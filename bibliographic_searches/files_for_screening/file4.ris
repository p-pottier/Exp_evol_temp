VL  - 18

SP  - 226-237
AB  - Larvae of S. exempta can be reared very successfully on a diet containing dried maize‐leaf powder renewed at about weekly intervals. The larvae pass through either five or six instars, as shown by measuring their head capsules. Sterilized soil should be provided for pupation. The moisture content of the soil does not appear to influence the survival, fecundity or fertility of the adults. At 25°C the eggs hatched in about 74 h, the larval period was 12–16 days, and the pupal period between 10 and 12 days. More than 90% of first‐instar larvae reached adulthood. The average number of eggs laid by a female in 5 days, taken over six generations, was 602 ± 62 but, on average, only about 50% hatched. All these values are equal to, or better than, those obtained with a stock whose larvae were always fed on growing maize plants. At 20° development was very much slower. The eggs hatched in about 174 h, the larval period was 25–30 days and the pupal period 18–19 days, i.e., on average, about 26 days longer from the time the egg was laid to the time the adult emerged. ÉLEVAGE DE SPODOPTERA EXEMPTA SUR ALIMENTS SEMI‐SYNTHÉTIQUE ET SUR PLANTES DE MAÏS EN CROISSANCE Les larves de S. exempta peuvent être élevées avec d'excellents résultats sur son aliment semi‐synthétique à base de poudre de feuille de maïs, aliment renouvelé à intervalles d'une semaine. Dans ces conditions les larves présentent 5 à 6 stades, comme le relève la mensuration des capsules céphaliques. De la terre stérilisée est mise à leur disposition pour assurer la nymphose. La teneur en humidité du sol ne semble pas influencer la survie, la fécondité ou la fertilité des adultes. À la température de 25° les œufs éclosent environ 74 h après la ponte, la vie larvaire est de 12 à 16 jours et la période nymphale de 10 à 12 jours. Plus de 90% des larves du ***1er Stade parviennent à l'état adulte. Le nombre moyen d'œufs pondus par une femelle en 5 jours, évalué sur six générations, est de 602 ± 62, mais en moyenne seulement 50% éclosent. Toutes ces données sont égales ou meilleures que celles obtenues avec un stock de larves nourries en permanence sur des plantes de mais en croissance. À la température de 20° le développement est beaucoup plus lent. Les œufs éclosent après 174 h environ; la durée de la vie larvaire atteint 25 à 30 jours et la période nymphale 18 à 19 jours, c'est‐à‐dire, en moyenne une durée totale pour le développement de l'œuf à l'adulte, plus long d'environ 26 jours. 1975 The Netherlands Entomological Society

VL  - 46

SP  - 671-676
AB  - The role of winter diapause in two aphid parasitoid species, Aphidius ervi Haliday and Aphidius rhopalosiphi DeStefani-Peres (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), in host synchronization and the induction of cold hardiness was investigated. Parasitoids were reared during three successive generations on Sitobion avenae Fabricius, at 15 degrees C under a photoperiod of 9 h light 15 h dark. Although these conditions are known to be strongly diapause inducing, neither parasitoids showed an incidence of diapause. above 65% over the three generations; the rest of the population underwent quiescence. In both parasitoid species, diapausing mummies exhibited greater cold hardiness than non-diapausing mummies, resulting in significantly lower supercooling points (SCP) and in a higher survival rate during long-term exposures at 0 and -10 degrees C. The induction of increased cold hardiness in parasitoids was thus associated with the diapause state. SCPs of third instar larvae of S. avenae were similar to those of non-diapausing mummies of both parasitoid species, but significantly higher than those of diapausing mummies. The effect of winter climate on the stability of the host-parasitoid interaction is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interactions between the female parasitoid Epidinocarsis lopezi De Santis (Hym., Encyrtidae) and its host, the cassava mealybug, Phenacoccus manihoti Matile‐Ferrero (Hom., Pseudococcidae)
VL  - 105
IS  - 1
SP  - 403-413
AB  - In laboratory experiments, the influence of different host instars and population densities of the cassava mealybug (CM), Phenacoccus manihoti Matile‐Ferrero, on the reproductive performance of the encyrtid parasitoid Epidinocarsis lopezi (De Santis), was investigated. In choice experiments, fourth instar hosts were examined most frequently, but third instar hosts were stung most often. Stinging was followed by oviposition in 87.7% of all third instar CM, and 57.1% of all second instars. At constant temperatures, no daily rhythmicity in egg laying could be detected. When different host densities were offered in a no‐choice experiment, parasitization at the lowest density was only one mummy per day, i.e. less important than host feeding. It then increased to 10 mummies per day when 30 or more CM were offered. Mortality from host feeding also increased with increasing host densities, but much less than the one by mummy formation. It was most important on second instars where it accounted for 48.2% of the total mortality inflicted by the parasitoid and decreased to 4.1% in the last instar. Starved females (for 36 h) consumed slightly more CM than well fed ones, but only when held at 30 °C. Some stung CM (12.0% in the third instar) showed retarded growth and impaired reproduction. In those which contained a parasitoid larva (one third for the third instar), E. lopezi failed to finish the development. The mortality caused by successful reproduction of E. lopezi, host feeding, mutilation, and arrestment of host development is summarized for the different CM instars. The high adaptability of E. lopezi is discussed. Zur Wechselwirkung zwischen Weihchen von Epidinocarsis lopezi De Santis (Hym., Encyrtidae) und ihren Wirtstieren, Phenacoccus manihoti Matile‐Ferrero (Hom., Pseudococcidae) Der Einfluß verschiedener Wirtsstadien und ‐dichten der Maniokschmierlaus Phenacoccus manihoti Matile‐Ferrero auf die Reproduktionsleistung ihres Parasiten Epidinocarsis lopezi (De Santis) wurde in Laborversuchen untersucht. Larven im vierten Stadium wurden in Präferenzversuchen am häufigsten untersucht, aber Drittlarven wurden am häufigsten gestochen. Bei 87,7% aller gestochenen Drittlarven wurde auch eine Eiablage beobachtet, bei Zweitlarven jedoch nur in 57,1%. Bei konstanter Temperatur konnte kein Tagesrhythmus in der Eiablage festgestellt werden. Wenn verschiedene Wirtsdichten ohne Auswahlmöglichkeit angeboten wurden, war die Parasitierungsrate bei der niedrigsten Wirtsdichte geringer (eine Mumie) als der Anteil der von den Parasitenweibchen gefressenen Wirte, stieg aber bei einem Angebot von 30 und mehr Wirten bis zu zehn Mumien pro Tag an. Die durch den Nahrungserwerb der Parasitenweibchen verursachte Mortalität stieg auch mit der Wirtsdichte an, jedoch in geringerem Maße als die Parasitierung. Sie war bei Wirten im zweiten Larvenstadium, in dem sie 48,2% der Gesamtmortalität ausmachte, am wichtigsten und nahm bis zum letzten Larvenstadium des Wirtes bis auf 4,1% ab. Für 36 Stunden nicht gefütterte Parasitenweibchen fraßen mehr Wirte als gefütterte, allerdings nur bei 30 °C. Bei einigen gestochenen Wirtstieren (12% bei Drittlarven) wurde ein langsameres Wachstum und eine geringere Reproduktionsleistung beobachtet. Ein großer Teil von ihnen enthielt Parasitenlarven, die in den meisten Fällen ihre Entwicklung nicht beenden konnten. Eine Zusammenfassung der von den Parasiten infolge von Reproduktion, Nahrungserwerb, Wirtsverstümmelung und Verzögerung der Wirtsentwicklung verursachten Mortalität in den verschiedenen Wirtsstadien wird präsentiert und die große Anpassungsfähigkeit von E. lopezi diskutiert. 1988 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - Techniques adopted to sustain the data services from IRS-P4 mission under power crunch scenario
VL  - 7
SP  - 4406-4418
AB  - IRS-P4, a 3-axis body stabilized earth-pointing satellite meant for oceanographic applications was launched on 26th May 1999. During its 7 years of on orbit life, the satellite had to encounter a series of power problems, which reduced the onboard power generation. The power crisis jeopardized not only the continuation of payload services but also the very survival of the mission. A strategy was then devised to over come this crippling power crisis and to extend the useful mission life for providing payload data to global user community. The strategy was to hold the inertial attitude of the satellite during all non-imaging orbits such that the solar panels were oriented towards sun thereby ensuring good power generation. Whenever payload operations were to be carried out, the spacecraft was brought back to earth pointing mode. Thus, the spacecraft had two attitude orientations, one to satisfy payload requirements and the other one to satisfy power requirements. However, this strategy had some associated issues, like thermal management and attitude stabilization (because of gyro drifts due to temperature variations caused by the different orientations). Novel methods and judicious planning of spacecraft operations on a daily basis addressed both these issues. This strategy was put into effect from 26 January 2006 onwards, after which sufficient power generation during nonpayload orbits was ensured. This allowed enough power generation to cater up to 6 payload operations a day. This approach has led to extending the useful life of India's only oceanographic spacecraft. This paper addresses the challenges that were involved and the methods by which they were overcome. Copyright IAF/IAA. All rights reserved.

AB  - The engagement-speed of clutch was determined with a weighted method based on the starting performance indices of AMT (automated mechanical transmission) and torque-transferring characteristics of clutch. In the method, the driver's intention and the requirements of starting performances are taken into consideration. A clutch engagement-speed control algorithm was proposed based on peak error sampling and adaptive temperature compensation. Experimental results show that the algorithm satisfies the requirements for three typical starting modes, namely, creeping, normal and abrupt start mode and improves the adaptability to temperature variation.

VL  - 42
IS  - 1
SP  - 41-47
AB  - The influence of temperature on the emergence and adult longevity of Platygaster demades Walker, an egg parasitoid of apple leaf curling midge (ALCM) was determined at five constant temperatures in the laboratory: 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27 degrees C. Apple leaves infested with second and fourth generation ALCM larvae were collected from three regions in New Zealand. Emergence of both ALCM and P. demades at the five temperatures were compared across two generations and three locations. Adult P. demades were fed with honey-agar diet and tested for longevity without exposure to ALCM eggs. Ten females reared at each temperature were allowed to live full life spans, and once dead were dissected to measure potential fecundity. The development period of P. demades in soil increased with increasing temperature but fewer emerged at 11 and 27 degrees C. The optimum temperature was 19 'C. Significant differences in development and emergence rates of P. demades between the second and fourth generations with temperature were detected (P = 0.003), although no differences in either were found between locations (P > 0.400). The highest longevity for females (47.9 +/- 5.5 days) and males (31.3 +/- 5.3 days) was recorded at 11 degrees C. Longevity decreased with increasing temperature. Life time fecundity did not change with age (P = 0.888) and an average female carried a mean pre-ovipositional load of 1380 +/- 263 eggs. Temperature has been considered one of the most important physical factors to influence asynchrony between second generation populations of P. demades and ALCM. Impacts of high longevity and fecundity on the ability of the parasitoid to overcome the synchrony are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Age-related changes in the microcirculation of skeletal muscle
VL  - 454
SP  - 343
AB  - The age-related reduction in exercise capacity is associated with a reduction in cardiac output and maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2(max)). The loss of muscle mass explains a large portion of the age-related decline in VO2(max). The capillary supply to a muscle fibre is primarily determined by its size, but also by its metabolic profile and the metabolic profile of surrounding fibres. Thus the age-related fibre atrophy and changes in the fibre type composition are expected to be accompanied by changes in the capillarisation. The exchange of oxygen, blood-borne energy sources, metabolites and heat between the blood and muscle tissue takes place in the microcirculation. Changes in the microcirculation may thus affect the functioning and viability of the muscle. The resting blood flow is minimally affected by age, but blood flow during or following exercise is generally reduced. This may in part be due to a reduced vasodilatory capacity and a decreased capillarisation. However, the coupling between capillary supply to a fibre and its metabolic profile or the profile of the surrounding fibres is maintained. There are some changes in ultrastructure of the endothelium. The age-related changes in the microcirculation are associated with a reduced VO2(max) and exercise capacity. The adaptability of the microcirculation is maintained at old age.

TI  - Particulate air pollution and health effects for cardiovascular and respiratory causes in Temuco City, Chile
VL  - 1
SP  - 184-188
AB  - The particulate matter pollution, induced mainly by the domiciliary wood heating, vehicular traffic, and industrial activity, has become the main source of concern of urban air quality in cities of colder climates. The city of Temuco, 800 km to the south of Santiago, Chile, suffers from severe wood smoke particulate pollution events. It is estimated that 87% of PM10 winter emissions originate from residential wood combustion. The relative risk estimations in Temuco were higher than those estimated in Santiago for respiratory mortality and for cardiovascular mortality. The main air pollution sources in Temuco are the residential wood stoves and wood cook stoves, while in Santiago are the diesel from mobile sources. The particles size distribution is different in Temuco and Santiago also. In winter season, the PM2.5 presents a higher proportion of the total PM10 in Temuco than in Santiago. These situations could explain the generation of higher toxicity over the exposed population in Temuco than that from Santiago, because finer particles penetrate more deeply in the respiratory system, even entering to the bloodstream and transported to other organs, where the PAH and other air toxics could cause toxic effects. Even though the study focused on PM10, further analysis should be on PM2.5 that has been demonstrated having worst effects on human heath. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 101st AWMA Annual Conference and Exhibition (Portland, OR 6/24-27/2008).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight the positive characteristics of the corelation between productivity and adaptability of some of the apricot donors and F1 and F2 hybrids descendants and finally to contribute to the selection progress. The research protocol is aimed at establishing the apricot ideotype, the links between the parental and hybrid descendants characteristics and the differences between every donor, descendant and the apricot ideotype and at determining by electrophoreses the izosymes bands. Biological material concerned 6 apricot donors, 55 Fl descendants. For this analysis the characteristics of the apricot ideotype were expressed by a score of 125 points/grades: 5 for tree height, 5 winter frost resistance, 5 resistance to the low spring temperature, 20 for resistance to Monilinia laxa Lev. (Aderh), Cytospora cincta Sacc., Stigmina carpophila (Lev.) M. B. Ellis and Plum pox virus, and 90 for the fruit traits quality. From among the donors, Dacia had the 119 points, closest to the ideotype, but none of Dacia descendants scored the same. Even positive transgressions detected in F1 descendants of some donors were not cumulated in the some phenotype. On the first stage the MDH- Malatedehydrogenase isozyme patterns revealed different zones of activity in the eight: apricot donors: Favorit, Manitoba, NJA 48, Stella, Dacia, Early Orange, Sony, Kinred.

VL  - 123

SP  - 356-363
AB  - The relative incorporation of thymine and its analogue, 5-bromouracil, into the DNA of a thymine-requiring bacterium was studied under a variety of conditions. Exponentially growing cultures of Escherichia coli strain TAU-bar were transferred to media containing defined amounts of thymine and 5-bromouracil. Following a period of growth the bacteria were harvested and the DNA was isolated. Density distribution analysis in CsCl density gradients was used to determine the relative incorporation of the natural base and its analogue into the newly-synthesized DNA. Under most growth conditions the bacteria exhibited a marked selectivity for thymine over 5-bromouracil. This selectivity was constant for all isolated DNA fragments and it indicated that few regions exist which require thymine to the exclusion of 5-bromouracil. The selectivity for thymine decreased as the incubation temperature was increased: at 51° no selectivity for thymine was observed. The selectivity for thymine did not change with time over the one generation period studied. The relation of these findings to the viability of bacteria which are incorporating 5-bromouracil into their DNA is discussed. © 1966.

TI  - SP-100 thermoelectric converter technology development
VL  - 6
SP  - 73-77
AB  - As part of the SP-100 Space Reactor Power System Program being undertaken for the U. S. Department of Energy, GE is developing a thermoelectric (T/E) power converter which utilizes reactor delivered heat and transforms it into usable electric power by purely static means. This converter is based to GE's product line of successful thermoelectric space power systems. The SP-100 power converter embodies the next generation improvement over the type of T/E converter successfully flown on the six U. S. space missions. That is, conduction coupling of T/E cell to both the heat source and the heat rejection elements. The current technology utilizes radiation coupling in these areas. The conduction coupling technique offers significant improvements in system specific power since it avoids the losses associated with parasitic ΔT's across the radiation gap between the heat source and the hot junction of the thermoelectric (T/E) cell. However, this advantage brings with it the associated challenges of (1) electrically isolating the voltage developed by a string of T/E cells and spacecraft ground (at which potential the hot side heat exchanger will be running) and (2) compensating for the thermally induced deformations of the T/E cell elements and the elements to which they are attached, caused by the nearly 500°C temperature difference across the T/E cell assembly. Both of these challenges have been successfully met and fabrication/test accomplishments have proven the viability of the necessary enabling technology. The paper discusses how these challenges have been met.

AB  - A comparative assessment of temperature sensitivity, based on stability of chromosomal mechanisms and fertility, of some polyploid wheat species and their diploid progenitors was made by subjecting plants to a temperature of 40±1°C (R.H. 70) for durations ranging from 12 to 72 hours. All the diploids were observed to be considerably more sensitive than the polyploids. The differential response of varieties within a ploidy group was very marked: winter types being strikingly more resistant than the spring forms. These observatiens have been discussed with regard to the contributions of polyploidy in relation to adaptability of the bread wheats. © 1967, The Genetics Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

VL  - 7

SP  - 335-345
AB  - An annual life-cycle of three over-lapping generations was found for Biomphalaria pfeifferi in a perennial stream on the eastern Transvaal escarpment. The 2nd of these generations appeared during the hottest months of the year-late January and February. This generation sequence was confirmed in a completely different environment, a permanent pond in a climatically different area, the coastal peneplain of north-eastern Zululand though the density of the 2nd generation here was much reduced. The species is moreover absent from certain types of shallow, permanent waterbody (pans) on this plain. In these habitats the thermal regime rose above those in other types during spring and early summer-the maturation period of the 1st generation. A negative partial-correlation, significant at a 1% level, was found between decreasing fecundity of the 1st generation and increasing periods of above-optimal temperatures (> 27°C) during its maturation period. This temperature effect accounts for the species' absence from pans in the area and the critical duration of these above-optimal temperatures appears to lie between mean weekly levels of 120 and 179 deg.h. > 27°C. The discontinuous distribution of B. pfeifferi in the Lake Sibaya area of the Zululand coastal plain corresponds to an ecological succession amongst waterbodies associated with the lake's fluctuating water level. The separation of sheltered bays from the lake was followed by further lowering of their levels and a spread of emergent vegetation. This is believed to have contributed to an increasingly high thermal regime, especially during spring when temperatures rise rapidly. The pans from which B. pfeifferi is absent constitute the present end point of this succession. © 1977.

TI  - Do traditional western european drinking practices have origins in antiquity?
VL  - 2

SP  - 227-239
AB  - Over the last few decades, alcohol consumption patterns have been changing in western European cultures (FAO 1991; Hupkens etal, 1992). Many nations have begun to embrace non-traditional beverages and drinking1 practices. There are arguments for both cultural change and for persistence of drinking norms over time or across generations. Indeed, some recent reports suggest both rapid change and persistence (Heath, 1992; McGowan et al, 1992) in some drinking patterns. The northern and the southern regions of Western Europe have traditionally been seen as having different drinking cultures.2 Moreover, these preferences and patterns appear to have persisted from a more distant past. Could it be possible that the traditional western European drinking norms, attitudes and practices may have persisted over the centuries and have origins in antiquity? To explore the question of the etiology of western European drinking cultures, some tentative hypotheses will be offered. It is hoped that these speculations will generate discussion and a more thorough examination of the inception of drinking attitudes, practices and norms in many cultures. Although a many faceted hypothesis is presented, there is space in this paper only for a focus on one aspect, namely the reasons why different patterns formed in the first place. Questions concerning the process of Romanization and the Germanic influences of the early Middle Ages upon drinking patterns will have to wait for another time. In short, this paper is a tour through some questions, and extremely tentative hints of some answers. Because this paper is a social-science comment synthesizing material from many fields of study, both primary and secondary published sources are used. © 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

VL  - 102
IS  - 2
SP  - 239-249
AB  - Evidence is presented to suggest that the gypsy moth, Portbetria dispar (L.), is numerically self-regulating through a shift in the quality of individuals induced by changes in nutrition. This qualitative change affects dispersal, behavior, developmental rate, and fecundity, and this provides P. dispar with the ability to respond to intrinsic and extrinsic factors faster and more efficiently than if dependent on selection. Adaptability is further facilitated because the change in quality can be induced either in the previous generation by the amount of nutrient reserves provided the eggs, or during the current generation by hunger, crowding, or cool temperature. This change is best characterized by an increase in the number of larvae with additional instars. In these larvae, a prolongation of instar I and a shift in behavior increases their potential for dispersal. The similarities and differences between P. dispar and Malacosovna pluviale (Dyar) are discussed. © 1970, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.

VL  - 104
IS  - 4
SP  - 339-352
AB  - A recently developed experimental set-up has been used to test the constancy of flight direction in the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae, originally collected in Northern Germany. The flight direction, tested with virgin females, depends on the developmental mode. Butterflies from diapause pupae fly north, those from subitan pupae fly south. The constancy of the flight direction has been examined in detail with the spring generation over a period of 14 d. The preferred direction does not change with advancing age and is essentially not influenced by temperature or by the sun's azimuth. The flight activity, however, increases with temperature, but this is concealed by an intrinsic response resulting in a diurnal peak of flight activity at 10.00-11.00 hours, long before the maximum temperature of the day is reached. Whether the observed direction can be considered as a parameter of migration behaviour is discussed. It is shown that migration in Pieris brassicae does not end with reproductive maturity but lasts throughout the entire imaginal stage.

VL  - 27

SP  - 441-456
AB  - Populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans from Melbourne, Vic., and Brisbane, Qld, were regularly sampled for resistance to desiccation. D. melanogaster was more resistant than D. simulans and females of each species were more resistant than males for both populations. The resistance observed for the D. melanogaster population from Melbourne and for the populations of both species from Brisbane remained fairly constant throughout a yearly cycle. However, the resistance of the D. simulans population from Melbourne was greatest during the warmest months and became progressively less as the temperature decreased. For this D. simulans population percentage mortality was correlated with mean temperature and temperature fluctuation of the Melbourne environment. No other correlation was found for any other population comparison. Laboratory populations, derived from founders of each area and kept at constant temperatures of 15, 20 and 25°C, provided results that agreed with the field data. The level of resistance of the D. simulans population from Melbourne appeared to be related to the environmental temperature of maintenance but the other populations maintained fairly uniform resistance levels over a number of generations. Diallel cross techniques indicate that the genetic architectures for resistance to desiccation of the Melbourne D. melanogaster population and of both species from Brisbane are similar, with additive, dominance and interaction effects being observed. Desiccation resistance for D. simulans from Melbourne is almost entirely additive, however. This result is discussed in relation to the field and laboratory data. © 1974 ASEG.

VL  - 20
IS  - 4
SP  - 290-295
AB  - The Stentor is a thermal memory Nitinol frame covered by an external permeable polyester fabric. The Mialhe Stentor bifurcation which is matted into the infra renal aorta is designed for the treatment of AAA extended to the bifurcation and the iliac arteries. The bifurcated device is comprised of two separately introduced segments: - the aortic part with a fixed iliac limb loaded into a 18 F delivery system is introduced into the common femoral artery by a cut down approach, - the contralateral iliac leg loaded into a 10 F introducer is inserted percutaneously. This preliminary serie involves 84 Stentor procedures: 14 straigth, 2 tapered, 21 single bifurcated and 50 bifurcated and extended devices. The per and post operative surgical complications are reported: 4 peripheral emboli, 1 partial left colon ischemia, 2 hematomas and 1 local infection at the access site. Post operative angio and CT scan are necessary to identify the remaining leakages and their origin. In this serie two AAA remain injected because of a proximal leakage by mismatch which has to be treated by implanting a cuff. These preliminary results demonstrate the accuracy of the proximal positioning, the adaptability of the device according to the anatomical situation and its ability to be extended. A long term follow-up study is necessary to prove the long term effectiveness of the endovascular exclusion of AAA and to improve the selection criteria.

When handling materials which are toxic, explosive at fairly high temperatures, or liable to dispersal, this kind of conveyor will greatly improve the working and sanitary conditions, minimizing the pollution of the environment. En-masse conveyors are now extensively used in chemical, light and metallurgical enterprises, the building material industry, hydropower stations, communications and harbours, for conveying materials such as fertilizers, carbon black, cereals, wood chips, cotton seeds, powdered ores, pulsverized coal, cement, slag etc. The specifications of en-masse conveyors for general and special services which are available in China's market are given in the article.

SP  - 93-103
AB  - Meganyctiphanes norvegica is abundant in the Norwegian fjords. The species has two years of life span and matures in one year. These starts maturing from October onwards, and most of the population become mature by March. Spawning continued up to June and most of the females are found spent after June. First generation (O group) appears in August and measures 12-20 mm T.L. (Total Length: 3.89 x C.L. + 1.49). GII and GIII were dominating for most part of the sampling period, while GIV were very few and dying away. Total growth in a year appeared to be about 30 mm. In the second year the species grew to 12-15 mm more and died at the end of second year at 42-45 mm T.L. Meganyctiphanes live at depth below 200 m but ascend upto surface during night. Larger individuals prefer to stay at deeper layers even at zero hours related to highest abundance in deeper waters during night hauls and highest abundance per 1000 M3 were estimated during April December, February and January. Total maturity (Z) was recorded between 1.6 to 2.20 in GII. In the study area there is a heating of water above 100 m depth from 6-16 °C during February to August period and increase of salinity from 31-32 in the surface layers to 35 ‰ at 200-300 m depth. There appears to be a correlation between warming of water (16 ° C) and highest concentration of D.O. (8-18 ml/l) in the upper layers to the appearance of first generation (GI).

VL  - 22

SP  - 91-102
AB  - The intensity and timing of infestation events of caligid copepods in wild or cultured fish populations may be predicted from previous local production of nauplius I of the parasite. However, this relationship is not well established, the spatial scales over which it operates are unclear, and the role of host reactions to the invading copepodid is unknown. Rate of development (and population structure), generation time and rate and actual reproductive output are temperature-dependent. In Ireland between five and seven generations of Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer) can develop annually and generation time varies from over 120 days in winter to 23 days in summer. Host reactions may affect the rate of development of the parasite but are less important than temperature. Host reactions may also cause parasite mortality, but this effect is specific for individual host parasite associations. The distribution of L. salmonis in cultured host populations is typically normal but is very over-dispersed in wild populations with heavy infestations. Parasite-induced morphological damage to the host is correlated with physiological impacts. Physiological effects are present even when morphological damage is slight and so intermittent chemotherapeutic control of infestations cannot prevent some parasite impact from occurring. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The yellow-spotted longicom beetle, Psacothea hilaris, which is a serious pest of mulberry and fig trees, was collected from different localities between 24°N and 36°N in Japan. The egg periods were checked under constant temperature conditions. Most populations showed similar developmental zeros (slightly lower than 11°C). However, there were great variations in the effective cumulative days (ECD). The highest ECD was found in the Hino strain which had been reared over 30 generations in the laboratory and mainly overwinters in the egg stage in the field. The obtained ECD does not explain how so many eggs of this strain overwinter without hatching, so factors delaying egg development were investigated. The hibernaculum of this species is mostly under mulberry bark. The results show that the host plant per se had large growth-retarding effects on P. hilaris eggs. However low temperature and wet conditions also had some effect. © 1995, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low temperature wheat genotypes are a group of wheat with a slightly low canopy (plant) temperature, and the research on their biological characters and utilization in wheat breeding has been done at home and abroad for more than 20 years, and has made great progress. The research contents and advances include the following respects: Wheat genotypes with slightly low canopy temperature have been verified to exist in nature; these wheat genotypes, which present cold temperature, are superior to conventional wheat materials in some important biological characters and particularly prominently in metabolic function and cellular structure; when they suffer stresses such as drought, high temperature and overcast and rainy weather, they still retain their superiority in some of their important biological characters and therefore have a wide range of ecological adaptability; slightly low canopy temperatures of these genotypes are closely correlated with low temperatures of their second heat sources and their vigorous plants; since their low canopy temperatures can be inherited, they can exert favorable influence on the temperatures of their offspring while crossing with other wheat materials, and in particular, the discovery of cold-source wheat as a contributor to low temperature, has further formed good conditions for breeding high and stable quality low temperature wheat varieties with a high and stable yield. Thus, low temperature wheat genotypes are of great research importance and have great prospects. © 2008 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

VL  - 59

SP  - 511-533
AB  - Carbon sequestration in soil organic matter is increasingly advocated as a possible win-win strategy in the rehabilitation of degrading dryland agro-ecosystems because it simultaneously contributes to the reduction of global atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations while enhancing local land productivity. A study was conducted in Senegal's Old Peanut Basin to assess current carbon stocks and to examine management options for their increase. Average soil and woody biomass carbon contents were 11.3 and 6.3 t carbon (C) ha(-1), respectively. CENTURY, a biogeochemical model, was used to simulate soil and biomass carbon over a period of 25 and 50 years under a series of land use and management options. These simulated practices resulted in C dynamics ranging from -0.13 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) from a worst-case millet-sorghum rotation to +0.43 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) on intensively managed agricultural fields. Agroforestry simulations involving Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. also resulted in promising carbon gain (+0.22 and +0.12 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively), suggesting that improving agricultural practices is key to enhancing food production and mitigating climate change. Results from a sensitivity analysis suggest that woody biomass carbon is more sensitive to long-term changes in precipitation and temperature than soil carbon. Other management strategies likely to result in lower rates of soil carbon sequestration, including short-term improved fallows, should also be considered viable opportunities because promoting too narrow a set of 'best management practices' risks weakening local adaptability and opportunistic management regimes, both of which are crucial elements in small-scale farming systems in drylands.

In outlining the challenge to ecology I discuss some of the key elements in the GM debate, and trace the growing importance of ecological questions within the regulatory and advisory system in the UK. The need to understand, and predict, some of the potential wider environmental impact of genetically modified (GM) crops has both driven changes in the regulations and led directly to farm-scale evaluation of herbicide-tolerant crops. 3. Several examples illustrate how ecological science is being used, and abused, in the public debate and in the provision of advice to regulators. In particular short-term or laboratory studies identifying possible hazards or impacts often receive wide-spread media attention but the thorough ecological field-based studies which either evaluate exposure to a hazard or assess fitness over several generations are rarely carried out, or, in the classic case of the impact of Bt maize on the Monarch butterfly, pass almost unnoticed. 4. It is increasingly important that trained ecologists become involved in the public debate. The challenge of dealing with the problems of variability, complexity and uncertainty, and of developing the necessary predictive tools for risk assessment, bring with it a huge responsibility, not only to be clear about the limitations of our science, but to recognise and acknowledge the boundary between science and informed opinion.

AB  - CERTAIN environmental conditions can induce genetic changes in particular varieties of plants1-5; these changes are stable and inherited over many generations. One of the best examples of this involves the flax variety Stormont Cirrus, which when supplied with certain fertilizers and grown for at least 5 weeks in a heated greenhouse can change from its original form (P1) into a large stable genotroph (L), or a small stable genotroph (S), depending on the fertilizers supplied1,6. L plants may be up to six times the weight of S plants, depending on the environment in which they are grown, with the P1 type having a weight in between those of L and S. © 1973 Nature Publishing Group.

VL  - 52
SP  - 183-232
AB  - The intense 1982-83 El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event significantly raised sea surface temperature devastating eastern Pacific coral reefs. In the aftermath of this disturbance, slow recovery has led to extensive reef erosion. The death of corals and the subsequent reef erosion have stimulated a reevaluation of the history and the causes for the small, low diversity reefs of the eastern Pacific. Today's eastern Pacific reefs differ markedly in size and species composition and richness from this region's past reefs and other present-day Pacific reefs. The closure of the Panamanian isthmus in the Plio-Pleistocene marked a deterioration in the reef building environment in the eastern Pacific. With this seaway closed, the modern Pacific surface circulation developed, and the components necessary for the ENSO events came together. The termination of the Pacific-Atlantic exchange coincided with the beginning of glacial-interglacial cycles. Since the closure of the Panamanian seaway and the onset of the glacial cycles, the eastern Pacific has faced two different climatic states that restricted reef growth and development: one during glacial periods with cool waters and lowered sea-levels and the other during interglacial periods with higher sea-levels, warmer waters, and ENSO events. During this latest high sea-level stand, between 18 to 65 ENSO events of the 1982-1983 magnitude may have disturbed the eastern Pacific. An uplifted reef at Urvina Bay, Galapagos Islands provides an opportunity to determine how eastern Pacific reefs develop during sea-level high stands. Here, recurrent intense ENSO events start the coral communities on a cycle of death, erosion, and recolonization stunting long-term reef growth. ENSO events, acting in concert with other physical and biological forces, have prevented the buildup of a substantial reef-framework. During the transition to inter-glacial times, melting ice raised sea-level and improved the environmental conditions for coral-reef growth enabling coral recruits to colonize the shelf. In the western and central Pacific, where reefs survived subaerial exposure, corals colonized and built new reefs on these antecedent structures enabling carbonate accumulation to continue. Whereas in the eastern Pacific, where small reefs eroded during low sea-level stands, recruits had to settle on basaltic or other consolidated outcrops rather than on previous carbonate build-ups. New recruits face not only harsh reef building conditions (e.g., upwelling and intense grazing) but recurrent intense and lethal ENSO events. After coral mortality, bioerosion removed much of the coral build-up. This repeated process prevents the coral community from increasing in diversity or developing to a resistant structure that can withstand erosion after death. Thus, one generation's growth is not transferred to the next, and large, persistent reef frameworks are not constructed. © 1990, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Interleukin-6 delays neutrophil apoptosis
VL  - 131
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-30
AB  - Background: Neutrophil (PMN) apoptosis promotes the phagocytosis of PMNs without inciting an inflammatory response or local cytotoxic effect. This is important in the normal resolution of inflammatory processes and the control of tissue injury. Conversely, a delay in PMN apoptosis may facilitate PMN- mediated organ dysfunction by extending PMN functional integrity at an inflammatory site. Elevated circulating and tissue levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with postinjury organ dysfunction, and IL-6 appears to augment PMN cytotoxic functions. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-6 delays PMN apoptosis, thereby enhancing PMN-mediated cytotoxicity. Methods: Neutrophils isolated from healthy human donors were incubated for 24 hours in enriched RPMI 1640 cell culture medium at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. Subgroups were incubated with IL-6, heat-denatured IL-6, or buffer alone. Apoptosis was assessed morphologically using acridine orange-ethidium bromide stain, and biochemically by DNA gel electrophoresis. Functional capacity of PMNs was assessed by superoxide generation after activation with phorbol myristate acetate or platelet-activating factor plus formyl- methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine. Results: Treatment with IL-6 resulted in a greater population of surviving (nonapoptotic) PMNs after 24 hours. In addition, the IL-6-treated population produced more superoxide after 24 hours than did the untreated or heat-denatured IL-6-treated groups, after either activating stimulus. Conclusions: Interleukin-6 delays PMN apoptosis, resulting in a larger population of surviving PMNs with a greater collective capacity for superoxide production. This could potentially facilitate PMN- mediated tissue injury and may be a mechanism whereby IL-6 contributes to organ dysfunction.

VL  - 76
IS  - 1
SP  - 153-162
AB  - Spatial and temporal variations in the distribution of the marine picoplanktic cyanobacteria population and mixing conditions were found in the Ebro River estuary outflow to the Mediterranean Sea in Spain. Six sampling surveys were undertaken between July 1999 and February 2000 for distances up to 15 km from the river mouth. Measurements were taken of flow velocity, salinity, temperature, depth and picocyanobacteria (PCB) abundances. Gradient Richardson (Rig) and Reynolds (Re) numbers were determined to evaluate hydrodynamics. In summer, large values of Rig arise from the small flow rates, and small values of velocity shear between the surface fresh water layer and the bottom saline layer; conversely, in winter the large flow rates and attendant large velocity shears between the layers give rise to small values of Rig. Flow conditions in the fall are an intermediate case between the summer and winter cases. Vertical abundance distributions were resolved through the river water, interfacial region, and the bottom salt wedge; longitudinal gradients of PCB abundances were also resolved. Seasonal differences in the PCB abundance values were observed. Analysis of cell numbers (C) showed that the variable dC/dS, the dependence of cell number upon salinity gradient (dS) was critical. A non-dimensional number; the cellular gradient number (Cg) is introduced. Cg has useful biological interpretations that can potentially be included in ecological modeling. For example, Cg = 1 pertains to perfect adaptability of the organism to adjust to changing environmental conditions, whereas Cg = 0 describes total mortality. For a system with strong advection there is insufficient time for cells to adapt to the changing environment, and so those cell counts are unchanged. This is the case for the Ebro estuary in winter as advection of salinity (and hence PCB abundance) dominates the other loss processes for large flow rates. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 121

SP  - 407-409
AB  - Cold active isolates #76, #102, and #D of Steinernema kraussei and the Czech isolate #B1 of S. feltiae preadapted for the parasitation of European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, were used for the laboratory control of the European corn borer larvas and pupae at low temperature. The experiments performed in Petri dishes were divided into two alternatives, both at a constant temperature of 7 degrees C, exposition time 250 h with 200 infective juveniles and 10 insects per dish. In the first experiment the only non-ligatured Ostrinia larvae and Canadian isolates were tested, while in the second experiment the Canadian isolate #D and Czech isolate #B1 were compared when using against ligatured larvae of the pest. The average mortality of the pest larvae in the first experiment reached maximally 26% and the average number of adult nematodes recovered by dissection was 7.2 per insect in the best #D isolate. Low efficacy of steinernematids to pest larvae was probably significantly influenced by forming a cocoon by insect. In the second experiment the pest larvae were ligatured before nematode application and forming of the cocoon was blocked. Surprisingly, the #B1 isolate killed on average 88.3% of Ostrinia larvae while the cold active #D isolate killed only 48.3% of the pest larvae. Number of recovered adults per insect by dissection was 30.3 in the #B1 isolate and 10 in the #D isolate. The results were analysed by means of one-way analysis of variance and of t-test. The percentage of parasitation (P < 0.01) and number of recovered adults (P < 0.05) were statistically significant between S. kraussei #D and S. feltiae #B1. It is speculated that the adaptability of the #B1 isolate had more significant role for the parasitation than the cold activity of the #D isolate.

VL  - 16

SP  - 373-379
AB  - The survival of adults of Clausenia josefi was investigated as a function of temperature and relative humidity. Natural severe climatic conditions were simulated and the adaptability of the parasites to such conditions was determined. EFFET DE L'HUMIDITÉ RELATIVE ET DE LA TEMPÉRATURE SUR LA SURVIE DE CLAUSENIA JOSEFI (HYMENOPTERA, ENCYRTIDAE) Clausenia josefi, parasite interne de Planococcus vitis, cochenille qui attaque la vigne, a éTÉ trouvé dans la zone aride du sud d'Israël (Negev). La moyenne de la température maximum en éTÉ (Juillet‐Août) est dans cette région de 34° et l'humidiTÉ relative moyenne à 14h00 est de 40%. Le début de l'éTÉ (Mai‐Juin) est la période la plus sévère, quant à l'instabiliTÉ des conditions climatiques. L'apparition saisonnière de C. josefi est caracTÉrisée par 2 pics, un premier en Juin et un second, plus petit, en Octobre‐Novembre. L'objet de cette étude était de déterminer les effets de la température et de l'humidiTÉ sur la longéviTÉ des adultes de Clausenia josefi et d'expliquer les raisons de la réduction de ses populations en éTÉ. A 28°, des humidiTÉs relatives comprises entre 20% et 80% n'ont aucun effet mesurable sur la survie des adultes de C. josefi (Fig. 1). L'effet d'une baisse d'humidiTÉ relative (20%) est plus prononcé pour des durées d'exposition de 2h et plus à de hautes températures (43°) (Fig. 3). A 43°, l'augmentation de l'humidiTÉ relative provoque un accroissement marqué de la survie (Fig. 4). Les conditions extrèmes dans les vignobles en Mai‐Juin, même pendant de courtes périodes de temps, pourraient affecter les populations de ce parasite entomophage. Le fait que les populations de l'hôte sont à un maximum entre Mai et Juin, masque probablement les effets défavorables des conditions extrêmes sur l'entomophage, de sorte que le pic de ses populations apparaît à ce moment. Puisque les conditions climatiques sont moins extrêmes en Juillet et Août, la réduction des populations du parasite pendant ces mois n'est pas duc aux effets climatiques mais plutôt à la réduction des populations de son hôte. 1973 The Netherlands Entomological Society

AB  - A hydrocarbon degrading Acinetobacter baumannii S30 strain, isolated from crude oil-contaminated soil, was inserted with the lux gene from the luciferase gene cassette luxCDABE. Soil microcosms were designed to study the degradation efficacy for total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) of crude oil by lux-tagged A. baumannii S30 pJES. Bioaugmentation of a TPH-contaminated microcosm with A baumannii S30 pJES showed that TPH levels were reduced from 89.3 to 53.9 g/kg soil in 90 days. Biodegradation of TPH by A baumannii S30 pJES was also monitored in shake flask conditions, which showed a reduction of initial TPH levels by over 50% at the end of 120 h. A lux-PCR-based approach along with the standard dilution plating with selective antibiotics was successfully utilized to monitor the survivability of the lux-tagged strain A. baumannii S30 pJES in soil microcosms and stability of the lux insert in the host strain A. baumannii S30. The selective plating technique indicated the population of A. baumannii S30 pJES to be 6.5±0.13×108 CFU/g at day zero (just after bioaugmentation) and 2.09±0.08×108 CFU/g of soil after 90 days of incubation. lux-PCR confirmed the stability of the insert in all the randomly selected colonies of A. baumannii strains from the antibiotic plates. The lux insert was stable after 50 generations in Luria Bertini broth and storage at -70°C as glycerol stocks for over a year. These results revealed that the lux insert was stable and lux-tagged A. baumannii S30 strain could survive in a TPH-contaminated soil microcosm and could degrade TPH in the soil microcosm conditions. It can be used as an effective marker to monitor the survival of augmented strains at a bioremediation site. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

TI  - Long-term ocean oxygen depletion in response to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
SP  - 105-109
AB  - Ongoing global warming could persist far into the future, because natural processes require decades to hundreds of thousands of years to remove carbon dioxide from fossil-fuel burning from the atmosphere. Future warming may have large global impacts including ocean oxygen depletion and associated adverse effects on marine life, such as more frequent mortality events, but long, comprehensive simulations of these impacts are currently not available. Here we project global change over the next 100,000 years using a low-resolution Earth system model, and find severe, long-term ocean oxygen depletion, as well as a great expansion of ocean oxygen-minimum zones for scenarios with high emissions or high climate sensitivity. We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen depletion. Decreased oxygen solubility from surface-layer warming accounts for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean. Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean. We conclude that substantial reductions in fossil-fuel use over the next few generations are needed if extensive ocean oxygen depletion for thousands of years is to be avoided. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

VL  - 277

SP  - 41060-41069
AB  - Hsp70 chaperones assist protein folding processes through nucleotide-controlled cycles of substrate binding and release. In our effort to understand the structure-function relationship within the Hsp70 family of proteins, we characterized the Escherichia coli member of a novel Hsp70 subfamily, HscC, and identified considerable differences to the well studied E. coli homologue, DnaK, which together suggest that HscC is a specialized chaperone. The basal ATPase cycle of HscC had kcat and Km values that were 8- and 10,000-fold higher than for DnaK. The HscC ATPase was not affected by the nucleotide exchange factor of DnaK GrpE and stimulated 8-fold by DjlC, a DnaJ protein with a putative transmembrane domain, but not by other DnaJ proteins tested. Substrate binding dynamics and substrate specificity differed significantly between HscC and DnaK. These differences are explicable by distinct structural variations. HscC does not have general chaperone activity because it did not assist refolding of a denatured model substrate. In vivo, HscC failed to complement temperature sensitivity of ΔdnaK cells. Deletion of hscC caused a slow growth phenotype that was suppressed after several generations. Triple knock-outs of all E. coli genes encoding Hsp70 proteins (ΔdnaK ΔhscA ΔhscC) were viable, indicating that Hsp70 proteins are not strictly essential for viability. An extensive search for ΔhscC phenotypes revealed a hypersensitivity to Cd2+ ions and UV irradiation, suggesting roles of HscC in the cellular response to these stress treatments. Together our data show that the Hsp70 structure exhibits an astonishing degree of adaptive variations to accommodate requirements of a specialized function.

Microbes CJF-002 were of Enterobacter spp, could grow at temperatures 15-37°C and pH 5.4-9.0 with the most favorable growth conditions of 30°C and pH 6.5-7.5. In a molasses culture medium, CJF-002 produced 50-70 μg polysaccharides per mL in 24 hrs and the polysaccharides production was higher under anaerobic conditions. CJF-002 possessed strong competitive ability with indigeneous reservoir bacteria. The injectivity of the bacterial culture was good as shown by the distribution of CJF-002 and the produced polysaccharides along injection stream in artificial cores. In an injecting experiment on paralell double cores and a simulation micromodel oil displacing experiment, the plugging of water passages, the viscosifying of injected water, and the enhancement of oil recovery by the polysaccharides produced by CJF-002 were demonstated or evidenced. Totally six MEOR projects using microbes CJF-002 were conducted in the east district of Fuyu. The satisfactory field results of MEOR project in the experimental area E12-3, covering 3 injection and 21 production wells, conducted in 2007 were presented in 3 tables: the changes in water injectivity profile for one well: productivity profile for one well: and reservoir physical characteristics and sweeping volume for 7 production wells obtained by interwell tracering analysis meanwhile the data of composition and properties of crude oil recovered from 5 wells expressing significant drop down of asphaltene/resin content, pour point depression, and density raise were presented and explained as a result of enlargement of sweeping zones.

TI  - A Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant with a heat-sensitive, conditional-lethal defect in vacuolar function
VL  - 99
IS  - 6
SP  - 1907-1916
AB  - We describe a mutant derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells that is heat-sensitive for viability and for resistance to certain protein toxins. This mutant, termed G.7.1, grows normally at 34° C but does not grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 39.5°C. However, when this medium is supplemented with FeSO4, the mutant cells will grow at the elevated temperature. At 39.5°C, G.7.1 cells acquire resistance to diphtheria toxin, modeccin, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, all of which are protein toxins that require endocytosis and exposure to a low pH within vesicles before they can invade the cytosol and kill cells. The properties of mutant G.7.1 could result from a heat-sensitive lesion that impairs vacuolar acidification. We assayed the ATP-stimulated generation of pH gradients across the membrane of vesicles in cell-free preparations from mutant and parental cells by the partitioning of acridine orange into acidic compartments and found that the acidification response of the mutant cells was heat-labile. Altogether the evidence suggests that G.7.1 cells contain a heat-sensitive lesion that impairs vacuolar acidification and that they fail to grow in normal medium at 39.5°C because they cannot extract Fe+3 from transferrin, a process that normally requires exposing transferrin to a low pH within endosomal vesicles.

VL  - 167

SP  - 197-200
AB  - E. affinis can adjust to temperature stress in a matter of hours. Adaptation is greater in a varying temperature than in a constant temperature, consistent with the estuarine habitat of this calanoid. The species has the capacity to adjust both in the short-term as individuals and also genetically over a number of generations. The adjustments have been examined at several levels of organization. In whole copepods the time an individual becomes comatose when exposed to a 32 °C temperature and increasing by 1/2 °C at 5 min. intervals, has been used as a repeatable assay and gives a good prediction of survival at 30 °C, the ecological limit of the species in Chesapeake bay, USA. At the molecular and cellular levels, two adaptive mechanisms which have been observed in temperature stressed copepods are the synthesis of novel proteins and phase changes in plasma membrane lipids. Both of these mechanisms have potential for further understanding the adaptation of Eurytemora to variable temperatures. They may also have application as indicators of sublethal stress. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

VL  - 114
IS  - 3
SP  - 327-338
AB  - Groups of Arctic charr (150 g) were abruptly transferred from freshwater to water of salinities ranging from 10 to 35 ppt in April. Feed intake, growth and the ability of the fish to osmoregulate were then investigated on day 3 and day 30 following salt water transfer. Water temperature was kept at 8°C. No mortality occurred during the entire experimental period. Three days after transfer there were significant differences in feed intake, plasma osmolality and Cl- concentrations among fish exposed to the different salinity treatments. Feed intake was found to decrease and plasma electrolyte levels to increase with increasing salinity. At the termination of the experiment (30 days after transfer) no significant differences were found in feed intake, but plasma electrolyte levels were highest in fish held in water of the highest salinity. All plasma values were, however, within the normal range, indicating that osmo- and ionoregulatory homeostasis was achieved in all groups of fish. Increased salinity appeared to have an acute, but short lived appetite depressive effect in the experimental groups. Despite reduced feed intake in these groups on day 3, growth rates were high in all groups and there were no significant differences among salinity treatments. Thus, all groups of charr appear to have adapted quickly to the new salinity conditions. The results indicate that Arctic charr can rapidly adapt to salinities up to 35 ppt in April, and that they may then have potentials for growth comparable to those of fish reared in freshwater. The results are discussed in relation to seasonal changes in seawater adaptability in salmonids. © 1993.

TI  - Prediction of dissolved oxygen in the Mediterranean Sea along Gaza, Palestine - An artificial neural network approach
VL  - 60
IS  - 12
SP  - 3051-3059
AB  - Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are flexible tools which are being used increasingly to predict and forecast water resources variables. The human activities in areas surrounding enclosed and semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea always produce in the long term a strong environmental impact in the form of coastal and marine degradation. The presence of dissolved oxygen is essential for the survival of most organisms in the water bodies. This paper is concerned with the use of ANNs - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function neural networks for predicting the next fortnight's dissolved oxygen concentrations in the Mediterranean Sea water along Gaza. MLP and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks are trained and developed with reference to five important oceanographic variables including water temperature, wind velocity, turbidity, pH and conductivity. These variables are considered as inputs of the network. The data sets used in this study consist of four years and collected from nine locations along Gaza coast. The network performance has been tested with different data sets and the results show satisfactory performance. Prediction results prove that neural network approach has good adaptability and extensive applicability for modelling the dissolved oxygen in the Mediterranean Sea along Gaza. We hope that the established model will help in assisting the local authorities in developing plans and policies to reduce the pollution along Gaza coastal waters to acceptable levels. © IWA Publishing 2009.

TI  - Genetic variance of sexually selected traits in waxmoths: Maintenance by genotype x environment interaction
VL  - 54
IS  - 3
SP  - 953-967
AB  - When traits experience directional selection, such as that imposed by sexual selection, their genetic variance is expected to diminish. Nonetheless, theory and findings from sexual selection predict and demonstrate that male traits favored by female choice retain substantial amounts of additive genetic variance. We explored this dilemma through an ecological genetic approach and focused on the potential contributions of genotype x environment interaction (GEI) to maintenance of additive genetic variance for male signal characters in the lesser waxmoth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). We artificially selected genetic variants for two male signal characters, signal rate (SR) and peak amplitude (PA), that influence female attraction and then examined the phenotypic plasticity of these variants (high- and low-SR and high- and low-PA lines) under a range of environmental conditions expected in natural populations. Our split-family breeding experiments indicated that two signal characters, SR and PA, and several developmental characters in both high- and low-SR and high- and low-PA lines displayed considerable phenotypic plasticity among the environments tested. Moreover, strong GEIs leading to crossover between high- and low-SR lines were found for SR and developmental period. Therefore, neither high- nor low-SR genetic variants would achieve maximum attractiveness and fitness in every environment, and those variants producing unattractive signals with low SRs under normal conditions may remain in populations provided that gene flow across environments or generation overlap are sufficiently high. We speculate that the phenotypic plasticity for SR and developmental period is adaptive in A. grisella populations experiencing a range of temperature and density conditions. Females mating with attractive (high-SR) males may be assured of obtaining good genes because these males sire offspring that develop more rapidly and a crossover for developmental period may parallel that for SR. Such parallel crossovers may be expected wherever good-genes sexual selection mechanisms operate.

TI  - Aedes albopictus in Rome: results and perspectives after 10 years of monitoring
VL  - 50
IS  - 1
SP  - 121-123
AB  - In 1997, Aedes albopictus (Skuse 1894) was detected in Rome in two opposite areas of the city. In the following 2 years, the species quickly spread. In 2000, scattered foci of the species were reported in the whole urban area and in the outskirts of the capital city. In Rome, Ae. albopictus seems to have found optimal environmental conditions to proliferate and to overwinter through and without diapausing eggs. In ten years Ae. albopictus has colonized the whole urban area through three phases: first massive spread, following maintenance of infestation, and colonization of alternative winter breeding sites with favorable climatic conditions. Data collected during the 2007 show that rainfall is no longer the most important factor for the development of the species, with respect to the past. In fact Ae. albopictus probably has found new alternative larval breeding sites through the colonization of small water collections refilled periodically by human activities. During 2007-2008 winter season, in order to evaluate the species adaptability, a study of eggs hatching and length of larval cycle at low temperatures, was carried out in laboratory and in simulated field conditions. Data and results are showed and discussed also by the light of existing literature.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 66-69
AB  - There was continual burst of grasshopper disasters and its area and hazard degree were infrequent in Inner Mongolia since 2000. Analyzing results indicate that the zoology adaptability of special genus groups is formed in typical grassland of Inner Mongolia. And these groups increase and decrease with climatic change. Low temperature in winter is unfavorable for grasshoppers' egg to over winter. But cold wave and strong cold weather take more effects on grasshoppers' eggs in fall. If rainfall is more than 20mm in one time in spring, moisture content of soil layer in depth of 0-20cm will be increased greatly; its eggs will be easy to mildew and die. If temperature decreased deeply more, the eggs body will be dying out. On the contrary, the rainfall will be the key if temperature is appropriate in spring. Less rainfall in spring is not advantage to egg's breaking ground and hulling and to nymph's feed getting. The egg grows rapidly and has high imago ratio under condition of appropriate temperature and 3-10mm rainfall per ten days. In imago period, the continuingly raised minimum temperature approaches to the temperature needed for nymph's growth, so the probability of temperature to incur dead of nymph is less and less.

VL  - 19

SP  - 3005-3011
AB  - Background. Glucose degradation products (GDP) are an important factor that contribute to bioincompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids. These substances are generated in the dialysis fluid during heat sterilization. Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the content or toxicity, or both, of GDP present in the dialysis fluid. We examined whether L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), a precursor for glutathione synthesis, reduces the cytotoxicity of GDP in human peritoneal mesothelial cells. Methods. Experiments were performed on primary mesothelial cell cultures. Free radical generation in these cells after exposure to acetaldehyde (ACT), glyoxal (GLYO) or methylglyoxal (M-GLYO) was detected with a fluorescent probe. Cell viability measurements were based on release of LDH from cell cytosol, and synthesis of IL-6 and proliferation after exposure to GDP. Effects of individual GDPs and of dialysis fluid free of GDP (GDP-free PDF) or containing GDP (GDP-high PDF) on cell viability were also studied in the presence of OTZ (1 mmol/l). Results. All of the GDPs as well as the autoclaved dialysis fluid caused increased free radical generation. ACT increased LDH release from the cells by 374% (P < 0.001), and this effect was abolished by OTZ. All of the GDPs inhibited cell growth (ACT, 47%, P < 0.01; GLYO, 52%, P < 0.01; M-GLYO, 26%, P < 0.05) and this effect was reversed in presence of OTZ. ACT inhibited I1-6 synthesis in mesothelial cells by 74% P < 0.01 and this effect was prevented by OTZ. GDP-high PDF but not GDP-free PDF reduced synthesis of IL-6 in mesothelial cells by 40% (P < 0.01) an effect that was reversed by OTZ. Mesothelial cell growth was more strongly inhibited by GDP-high PDF (76%, P < 0.01) than by GDP-free PDF (31%, P<0.05). OTZ improved growth of mesothelial cells in the presence of GDP-high PDF (+150%, P < 0.01) and in presence of GDP-low PDF (+38%, P < 0.05). OTZ prevented the cytotoxic effect of GDP-high PDF on mesothelial cells. Conclusions. The GDP-induced stimulation of free radicals in mesothelial cells in the present study may provide a possible mechanism of GDP cytotoxicity. Because OTZ reduced the toxic effects of GDP on mesothelial cells, this compound may improve biocompatibility of peritoneal dialysis fluids. © ERA-EDTA 2004; all rights reserved.

VL  - 267

SP  - 165-174
AB  - The purpose of this study was to check if it is possible to influence sea bass juvenile metabolism by a conditioning of larvae from day 6 post hatching to day 45 to a low or a high HUFA compound diet (LH, 0.8% EPA + DHA and HH, 2.2% EPA + DHA) when reared at 16 or 22 degrees C. Following a 3-month intermediate period (at 19 degrees C using a commercial diet), the adaptability of the 4 initial larval groups to a HUFA experimental deprived diet (0.5% EPA + DHA) were tested at 19 degrees C in a 60 day-experiment (d-151-211). The four experimental duplicated conditions were ex-LH 16 and ex-HH 16 for the 2 groups previously reared at 16 degrees C (initial weight, 7.3 +/- 0.5 g) and ex-LH22 and ex-HH22 for the 2 groups previously reared at 22 degrees C (initial weight, 11.1 +/- 0.5 g). Survival was maximal and there was a 1.6-2 fold increase in mass during the experiment. Growth was similar in the 4 experimental groups: NS difference in growth curve slopes (P=0.7). At the end of the experiment (d-211), whole body fat levels were in the same range in all groups (13-15% WW). The fatty acid (FA) composition in polar lipids (PL) and total lipids (TL) were significantly affected by initial weight related to larvae conditioning, which can be mainly attributed to a dilution effect (impact of initial FA content on final FA content versus relative mass increase during the course of the experiment). Conversely to this trend, DHA content in PL was higher in the ex-LH groups than in the ex-HH groups whatever thermal conditioning of larvae was. This indicated that ex-LH groups had a better capacity to adapt to a deficient HUFA diet than ex-HH fish. The relative expression of the delta-6 desaturase (Delta 6D) was significantly higher in ex-LH than in ex-HH groups (P<0.001) between d-151 and d-181, which suggested that Delta 6D transcription in ex-LH groups was positively modulated by the HUFA-deprived diet. This stimulation of the first step of the desaturation/elongation pathway could allow synthesizing FA needed to compensate low dietary HUFA supply. This study shows for the first time that it seems possible to influence juvenile fish metabolism by a nutritional conditioning during the larval stage. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the first generation (nymphal stage, about 20-degrees-C on average in Kochi) of a water strider, Aquarius paludum (Fabricius), the preoviposition period was longer than in the second generation (> 27-degrees-C) in both macropterous and brachypterous forms under natural conditions. The adults of both wing-forms showed lower fecundity in the early reproductive period than in the late one in the first generation. The oviposition process in the second generation, however, was the opposite of the first generation. Half of the females in the second generation entered diapause after the reproductive period. A high temperature of 28 +/- 2-degrees-C in the nymphal stage induced a shorter preoviposition period and higher fecundity than a low temperature of 20 +/- 2-degrees-C in both wing-forms. A stepwise reduction in photophase (14.5-12-10 h) in the early adult stage caused lower fecundity than a reduction of 14.5-10 h.

AB  - Reactions of the invasive alien species Achatina fulica to abiotic factors: perspectives for the management. Achatina fulica Bowdich, 1822 is an african snail that is invasive in different parts of the world, being characterized mainly by its high adaptability. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of abiotic factors, such as temperature and substrate, on the egg eclosion, adult and juvenile reaction to different abiotics factors, and the resistance of A. fulica to popular methods of control. Three studies were made, including 19 laboratory experiments and observations of free animals in the municipal district of Guaraquecaba, southern Brazil. Eggs were characterized as the most fragile phase, whereas the juveniles and adults were resistant to the immersion in fresh and salt water and little resistant to temperature variation and salt, using burying, aestivation, and muscular force as defense strategies. Those strategies should be considered in management actions and in orientating popular methods of control.

AB  - Numerous aspects of the ridge-till system for corn and soya bean production are discussed. Advantages reported for this system included early soil warm-up, reduced costs, erosion control, and improved timeliness. Disadvantages reported included the difficulty in building and maintaining ridges in row widths of less than 76 cm, inadequate erosion control on highly erodible land, and the need for extra equipment for preparing end rows. The equipment and the options needed to practice the ridge system effectively are identified, as are the proper procedures required for initiating and maintaining the ridge system. Suggestions for fertilization and pest control are included. Research has identified the major factors affecting the performance of specific tillage systems to be soil drainage, previous crop, and length of growing season. Data that show ridge-tillage to be well adapted to a wide variety of soil and climatic conditions in the eastern Corn Belt are presented. Finally, a procedure for assisting agricultural producers in determining whether the ridge-till system is well adapted to their specific soil, climatic and cropping conditions is identified and discussed. © 1990.

AB  - Protein electrostatic properties stem from the proportion and distribution of polar and charged residues. Polar and charged residues regulate the electrostatic properties by forming short-range interactions, like salt-bridges and hydrogen-bonds, and by defining the over-all electrostatic environment in the protein. Electrostatics play a major role in defining the mechanisms of protein-protein complex formation, molecular recognitions, thermal stabilities, conformational adaptabilities and protein movements. For example: Functional hinges, or flexible regions of the protein, lack short-range electrostatic interactions, Thermophilic proteins have higher electrostatic interactions than their mesophilic counter parts; Increase in binding specificity and affinity involve optimization of electrostatics; High affinity antibodies have higher, and stronger, electrostatic interactions with their antigens; Rigid parts of proteins have higher and stronger electrostatic interactions. In this review we address the significance of electrostatics in protein folding, binding and function. We discuss that the electrostatic properties are evolutionally selected by a protein to perform an specific function. We also provide bona fide examples to illustrate this. Additionally, using continuum electrostatic and molecular dynamics approaches we show that the "hot-spot" inter-molecular interactions in a very specific antibody-antigen binding are mainly established through charged residues. These "hot-spot" molecular interactions stay intact even during high temperature molecular dynamics simulations, while the other inter-molecular interactions, of lesser functional significance. disappear. This further corroborates the significance of charge-charge interactions in defining binding mechanisms. High affinity binding frequently involves "electrostatic steering". The forces emerge from over-all electrostatic complementarities and by the formation of charged and polar interactions. We demonstrate that although the high affinity binding of barnase-barstar and anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody-HEL complexes involve different molecular mechanisms, it is electrostatically regulated in both the cases. These observations, and several other studies, suggest that a fine tuning of local and global electrostatic properties are essential for protein binding and function.

AB  - The Castilian conquerors of Mexico and Central America were quite effective in their efforts to destroy documents that might reflect a complex culture with a deep understanding of history and place. When Pedro de Alvarado came to and burned the capitol of the second largest empire of Mesoamerica, along with its kings, we can only speculate what else was committed to those flames. But among those who survived were well-educated bards in service to the court, who some scholars suspect kept the contents of the burned books in their heads, only to later commit them to European paper in Latin letters, in secret, over a generation later (Tedlock, 1985.) The book thus produced is most commonly called the Popol Vuh, or Book of Council. While the original remains hidden or lost, a Spanish friar made a copy from that original K'iche' over a 150 years later, and a variety of translations began to emerge in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is now the national book of Guatemala, there are numerous translations, and a rich field of interpretation, to which in a small way this chapter contributes (also see Earle, 1983b.) A central theme of the book's mythic tales involves decent by heroic twins from the surface of this holy earth into the underworld, where they meet with challenges from the lords of death and sickness. The first generation is defeated, after a series of travails. The second pair, miraculous offspring of the skull of one of the first, make a better go of it, despite being sent to many of the same life and death trials, an excerpt of which is quoted above. Of all the intimidating places to survive in the deadly territory of Xibalbaj, I have always wondered what was the danger of the house of bats. The others were clear. Cold, knives, jaguars, fire all seemed inherently fatal, but this danger I assumed, as did Dennis Tedlock, was that these bats were monstrous beasts of another dimension, bats out of hell, so to speak. Yet my doubts remained. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Dissections of the reproductive system of over-wintering adults of Chrysopa carnea disclose the classical symptoms of gonotrophic dissociation and show these adults to be in a state of reproductive diapause. Experiments testing the efficacy of day length and warm temperatures in promoting the resumption of reproductive activity show that the diapause state is eliminated within 20 days with exposure to daily photophases of 16 hr at 25°C, whereas with daily photophases of 10 hr no indications of the termination of diapause are visible after as long as 55 days at this temperature. Parallel experiments at 3°C give comparable results and provide no evidence that exposure to low temperatures potentiates the elimination of diapause to any significant degree. Rearing experiments show that the induction of diapause is also under primary photoperiodic control which, at least in the male, acts upon some pre-imaginal instar. A reversible colour change undergone by the over-wintering generation is likewise shown to be largely under the control of the adult photoperiod, although certain components of this change are influenced by non-photoperiodic factors to a small extent. The adaptive rôle of certain of these changes in the seasonal cycle of C. carnea is discussed, and the significance of developmental systems which are dependent upon environmental photoperiods for both the induction and termination of diapause is noted. © 1967.

VL  - 77

SP  - 487-494
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of hot summer climatic conditions (compared to winter) on the libido, semen quality traits, level of serum testosterone hormone and some physiological and body measurements of Egyptian Suffolk rams. A parameter for the tolerance of the rams to adverse hot climatic conditions, designated as the tunica dartos index (TDI), was estimated as the multiplication of the percentage change in scrotal length and that of the percentage difference between rectal temperature and scrotal skin temperature. The relationships between the TDI and semen characteristics were also estimated. The results showed that in summer, the reaction time, pH, percentage dead and abnormal spermatozoa, acrosomal damage and temperatures of rectum, body skin and scrotal skin and scrotal length were significantly higher, while sperm motility, sperm concentration, scrotal circumference and testis length were significantly lower than in winter. The correlation coefficient (r) values estimated between the TDI and each of the semen pH, ejaculate volume, sperm motility and sperm cell concentration were positive, and those estimated between the TDI and each of the reaction time, dead and abnormal spermatozoa and acrosomal damage were negative. The best values of libido (low reaction time), semen pH, semen motility percentage, sperm cell concentration and testosterone level were recorded with a high TDI level (7.5 and more), while those of percentage of dead spermatozoa, sperm abnormalities and acrosomal damage were recorded with a low TDI level (less than 4.5). It can be concluded that the TDI correlates well with the reproductive ability of the ram and can be a reliable parameter to indicate the tolerance of rams to hot subtropical conditions in Egypt. © 2006 Japanese Society of Animal Science.

TI  - Tilapia Production Systems in the Americas: Technological Advances, Trends, and Challenges
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 465-498
AB  - Tilapia is the common. name applied to three genera of fish in the family Cichlidae: Oreochromis, Sarotherodon, and Tilapia. The species that are most important for aquaculture are in the genus Oreochromis, including the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, the Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus, the blue tilapia, O. aureus, and O. urolepis hornorum. Fish farmers are now growing many strains of these parent species along with many hybrid strains. Native to Africa and the Middle East, these species have become the second most common farm raised food fish in the world. In the 1960s and 1970s tilapia culture was aimed at the production of food for local consumption, utilizing primarily extensive or semiintensive culture methods with minimal inputs of fertilizer or feeds. However, tilapia culture has expanded rapidly during the last decade as a result of technological advances associated with the intensification of culture practices. These include the development of new strains and hybrids, monosex male culture, formulated diets, a variety of semiintensive and intensive cult-Lire systems (e.g., ponds, cages, tanks, and raceways) and the utilization of greenhouses, geothermal, or industrial waste heat and advanced water treatment methods. Marketing programs have also nurtured a growing demand for tilapia in domestic and international markets. Annual worldwide production of cultured tilapia was less than 200,000 metric tons (mt) in 1984 and increased to 1,100,000 nit in 1999. In the Americas, the increased production of farmed tilapia is due in large part to their adaptability to a diverse array of production systems. These include subsistence level, extensive pond culture in the Eastern Caribbean, integrated animal-fish culture in Guatemala and Panama, semiintensive pond culture in Honduras, intensive pond culture in Colombia, Costa-Rica and Jamaica, semiintensive cage culture in several countries, intensive flowthrough tank and raceway culture in the U.S., and a variety of highly intensive indoor recirculating tank cult-Lire in the U.S. In addition, there is increasing production of tilapia in shrimp ponds in Ecuador to ameliorate shrimp disease problems. In this article, representatives of various systems are compared with respect to technological approaches and constraints. Poor management of tilapia genetic resources is causing a loss of productivity, and research in genetics and selective breeding will be needed to improve production efficiency, fillet yields, and environmental tolerance. Continuing nutritional studies will also be needed to increase efficiency and profitability. With intensification, infectious diseases have become more serious, and fish health management through biosecurity procedures, environmental manipulation, reduction of stress, nutrition, genetics, and the use of prophylactic therapeutics will be essential. Increasing waste production will require novel methods for integrating tilapia culture with the production of other valuable crops to maximize nutrient recovery and minimize pollution. Market development and quality control will be critical to ensure market growth.

AB  - The preceding production of essential numbers of hosts--puparia of Musca domestica L.--requires more labour and space and higher costs than the virtual rearing of the hymenopterous parasitoid Muscidifurax raptor GIRAULT & SANDERS itself. Therefore, the possibility of preserving the host by freezing would be a substantial improvement in the mass rearing of the parasitoid. It was demonstrated that frozen puparia were not less attractive for females of M. raptor than fresh ones. Puparia less than 24 hours old are not suitable for cold storing. Host pupae stored under freezing temperatures or heat (treated for 5 min at 65 degrees C) showed a higher hatching rate of the parasitoid than fresh ones. Freezing temperatures of about -7 degrees C are not sufficient for longer storage. At a temperature of -21 degrees C the host suitability of the frozen puparia did not decrease for a storage period of 53 weeks. The average size of M. raptor remained unchanged after rearing 8-9 generations upon coldstored hosts.

AB  - Among the activities of the laboratory of Floriculture of the National Agriculture Research Foundation (NAGREF) are the collection, conservation and study of native Mediterranean and Balkan species. These are materialized through the newly established Balkan Botanic Garden of Kroussia (BBGK), situated in the area of central Macedonia, Greece. In the nursery of the BBGK situated in Thermi, Thessaloniki, the mother plant material is preserved in pots receiving various treatments under various conditions (shade, substrate, irrigation, fertilization), which dependent on the needs of every species. Greenhouses serve as the main area of preserving, during winter, susceptible to cold mother plants as well as for the sexual and asexual propagation of them. In addition, growth and development of the propagated material takes place, having the control of the climate, fertilization and irrigation conducted automatically. The plants are transferred to the BBGK for ex situ preservation and further studying in adverse climatic conditions. Experimentation and field studies concerning the suitability of certain species for landscape uses as roof-garden and xeriscaping plants, according to their characteristics and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions (water stress) are conducted. Other uses of native plant material as dried material are also studied.

AB  - The special possibilities of the illuminant proposed depend on the presence of two filaments, which can be operated either singly or both at once and are so small and close together that they form a concentrated source even when both are in use; and on the special adaptability of the headlight bulb for overloading. It is shown that within the range of from 6 to 8 volts per filament for which the bulb is made, the two filaments when run together yield a maximum of about 160 C. P.; while the 32 C. P. of single filament at its design voltage provides a reduction to 1/5 of the maximum without reducing the color-temperature below that required for the correct performance of "daylight" filters. The higher intensities, with proper concentration, permit the use of very dense green filter combinations. The bulb is small enough to permit a very effective reflector, making condensing lenses unnecessary. It develops relatively little heat. It is immediately replaceable almost anywhere. Ordinary small transformers provide the necessary voltage range. The lamp described conforms to the requirements of the Belling method, but includes some new means for putting these principles into practice. The headlight bulb is substituted for low-voltage projection bulbs; the thin metal diaphragms are replaced by a thick brass slide, in which the optical effect of extreme thinness is obtained by beveling the openings to a sharp edge; and a "hood-tube," projecting from 15 to 20 cm. from the plane of the diaphragmed ground-glass, combines the two functions of eye protection and filter support, confining all unfiltered light, and placing the filter in a protected position inside the end cap of the added tube. Constructional detail is given in the description, supplemented by a drawing and a photograph. © 1935 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

VL  - 33

AB  - 1. A major, and largely unexplored, uncertainty in projecting the impact of climate change on biodiversity is the consequence of altered interspecific interactions, for example between parasitoids and their hosts. The present study investigated parasitism in the Brown Argus butterfly, Aricia agestis; a species that has expanded northward in Britain during the last 30 years in association with climate warming. 2. Aricia agestis larvae suffered lower mortality from parasitoids in newly colonised areas compared with long-established populations. This result was consistent over four consecutive generations (2 years) when comparing one population of each type, and also when several populations within the historical and recently colonised range of the species were compared within a single year. Thus, A. agestis appears to be partially escaping from parasitism as it expands northwards. 3. Reduced parasitism occurred despite the fact that several of the parasitoid species associated with A. agestis were already present in the newly colonised areas, supported predominantly by an alternative host species, the Common Blue butterfly, Polyommatus icarus. 4. As the species expand their distributions into areas of increased climatic suitability, invasion fronts may escape from natural enemies, enhancing rates of range expansion. The results suggest that the decoupling of interspecific interactions may allow some species to exploit a wider range of environments and to do so more rapidly than previously thought possible. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 3

SP  - 55-66
AB  - The Yokohama population of Hyphantria cunea took 8, 38 and 13 days for development of the egg, larval and pupal stages, respectively, at 25°C. A sum of 800-900 degree-days above 10°C was thus required for completing the nondiapause generation. Some pupae raised in a long photoperiod were, however, in a state of arrested development for about a week at 25°C, which resulted in bimodal emergence of adults. The ture winter diapause lasted much longer periods, being induced by a short photoperiod during the larval stage. The critical (median) photoperiod for the induction of the winter diapause at 25°C was between 14 hr 30 min and 14 hr 45 min, although it might be shorter than this at a higher temperature. These data were superimposed on the photothermographs of different parts of Japan in order to predict the seasonal life cycle and the local adaptability of the species. In the Tokyo-Yokohama area, the predicted life cycle conformed well to field observations. It was suggested that this psecies would require some genetic changes for establishing in Hokkaido or in the southern part of Kyusyu. At present, local samples collected from the northern front of distribution (Omagari, Akita) did not show any sign of divergence in the photoperiodic response. © 1968, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

TI  - The association between fluctuating asymmetry, trait variability, trait heritability, and stress: A multiply replicated experiment on combined stresses in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - 493-505
AB  - A number of hypotheses have been proposed about the association between developmental stability, phenotypic variability, heritability, and environmental stress. Stress is often considered to increase both the asymmetry and phenotypic variability of bilateral traits, although this may depend on trait heritability. Empirical studies of such associations often yield inconsistent results. This may reflect the diversity of traits and conditions used or a low repeatability of any associations. To test for repeatable associations between these variables, multiply replicated experiments were undertaken on Drosophila melanogaster using a combination stress at the egg, larval, and adult stages of reduced protein, ethanol in the medium, and a cold shock. Both metric and meristic traits were measured and levels of heritable variation for each trait estimated by maximum likelihood and parent-offspring regression over three generations. Trait means were reduced by stress, whereas among-individual variation increased. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was increased by stress in some cases, but few comparisons were significant. Only one trait, orbital bristle, showed companynsistent increases in FA. Changes in trait means, trait phenotypic variability, and developmental stability as a result of stress were not correlated. Extreme phenotypes tended to have higher levels of FA, but only the results for orbital bristles were significant. All traits had low to intermediate heritabilities except orbital bristle, which showed no heritable variation. Only traits with low heritability and high levels of phenotypic variability may show consistent increases in FA under stress. Overall, the independence of phenotypic variability, plasticity, and the developmental stability of traits extend to changes in these measures under stressful conditions.

TI  - Identification of a gene overexpressed in aphids reared under short photoperiod
VL  - 33
IS  - 3
SP  - 289-298
AB  - Most aphids develop a cyclic parthenogenesis life-cycle. After several generations of viviparously produced parthenogenetic females, follows a single annual generation of sexual individuals, usually in autumn, that mate and lay the sexual eggs. Shortening of photoperiod at the end of the summer (together with temperature) is a key factor inducing the sexual response. Currently no genes involved in the cascade of events that lead to the appearance of sexual forms have been reported. After a Differential Display RT-PCR survey performed on Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids, we identified a gene that is overexpressed in aphids reared under short photoperiod conditions that induce sexuality in this species. This cDNA (called ApSDI-1) shows similarities with a protein involved in amino acid transport in GABAergic neurons. Since several studies implicate GABAergic transmission in the generation and modulation of circadian rhythmicity, we propose that ApSDI-1 could be involved in the transduction of the photoperiodic message and therefore be a candidate to participate at some point in processes that trigger the sexual response in aphids. This is the first gene identified in aphids whose expression is governed by the photoperiod. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolutionary individual-based model for the recruitment of anchovy (Engraulis capensis) in the southern Benguela
VL  - 59
IS  - 5
SP  - 910-922
AB  - Evolutionary simulations are developed to explore environmental constraints that select observed spatial and temporal spawning patterns for anchovy (Engraulis capensis) in the southern Benguela. They couple a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an individual-based model in which an evolutionary-based reproductive strategy for adult fish and a passive transport for early life stages are implemented. The evolutionary success of spawning is quantified when patterns at the population level emerge after many generations from constraints at the individual level through a selective process. As a result, several self-sustaining populations are identified considering different sets of selective constraints. Simulated spawning patterns better match the observed mean spawning pattern when two selective environmental constraints are associated: a threshold temperature of 14degreesC, above which the development of early life stages is ensured, and the avoidance of offshore currents that constitute a loss of spawning products. Simulated recruitment patterns are more realistic when considering the constraint of reaching the nursery area. This modeling experience can help to identify, temporally and spatially, environmental factors important for fish recruitment and to establish a hierarchy of these factors. The probable coexistence in nature of several self-sustaining populations of pelagic fishes is shown to be important for recruitment studies.

VL  - 417

SP  - 735-738
AB  - Coevolution of species is one of the major processes organizing the Earth's biodiversity. Recent coevolutionary theory has indicated that the geographic structure of species has the potential to impose powerful and continuing effects on coevolutionary dynamics, if that structure creates selection mosaics and coevolutionary hotspots across landscapes. Here we confirm that current coevolutionary selection in interspecific interactions can be highly divergent across both narrow and broad geographic scales, thereby fuelling continuing coevolution of taxa. Study of a widespread plant-insect interaction across a broad range of habitats for several years showed that an insect functioning both as a pollinator and a floral parasite can be strongly mutualistic in some habitats but commensal or antagonistic in neighbouring habitats. The results for one of the habitats span seven years, demonstrating that the local structure of coevolutionary selection can remain stable across multiple generations. Conservation of the evolutionary processes maintaining long-term biological diversity may require preservation of the conditions that allow a long-term shifting geographic mosaic of coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots.

VL  - 109

AB  - Population dynamics of the rotifers Brachionus rubens and B. calyciflorus were studied in the field and analysed by multivariate statistical techniques. There were some correlations, but they are difficult to interpret. Laboratory cultures under various controlled constant conditions showed sigmoid growth curves with subsequent oscillations around an equilibrium. Its level is determined by food quantity; frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillations increase with temperature. The growth curves are described by deterministic models (logistic growth function with one or two time lags) and by stochastic models (SIMULA). Both give simulations which are close to the experimental curves, even in the case of changing temperatures with variable time lags. A third descriptive model is proposed which permits predictions without causal analysis, on the basis of statistical properties. It is used for the development of a highly sensitive bioassay in ecotoxicology. Changes in population density reflect minute sublethal effects of toxic substances such as statistical reductions in lifespan and fertility of the individuals. Experiments suggest chronic sublethal effects which may develop over many generations: adaptation to pentachlorophenol and accumulation of detrimental effects of 4-chloroanilin. Phenol is more toxic at low than at high concentrations. Application of these findings to field conditions is discussed. © 1984 Dr W. Junk Publishers.

VL  - 57

SP  - 1664-1685
AB  - Depth-stratified zooplankton samples were collected from the Georges Bank with a plankton pump and a 1 m(2) MOCNESS during 1995 and 1996 as part of the US GLOBEC Georges Bank program. All development stages of Calanus finmarchicus were enumerated. During both years, recruitment of C. finmarchicus began in late December/early January in the southern Gulf of Maine, with the G1 generation being advected onto the northern edge of the Georges Bank. This winter generation spread across the bank, reaching the S Flank by March. It immediately began to mature, replacing adults of the GO generation. Because of the prolonged period that the GO population was present, there was a considerable overlap of G1 and subsequent generations. Nauplii were at a minimum during May throughout the region during both years. A large increase in numbers of nauplii was observed on the NE Peak and the S Flank of the Georges Bank during June 1995, but only on the S Flank during June 1996. The decline in abundance of nauplii in this region during May might have been due to food limitation of reproduction. On the Crest, numbers of C. finmarchicus declined following the March-April peak, reaching very low le, els during June of both years. This appears to be in response to high levels of predation and isolation of the waters of the Crest as the tidal-mixing front strengthens. The development of the G1 generation on the Georges Bank was earlier in 1995 than during 1996, but the peak abundance was greater during 1996. Mean temperatures on the Georges Bank were about 1 degreesC colder during winter 1996, and the delay in development and larger numbers of peaks that year are consistent with the effects of the colder temperatures on development.

AB  - Reproduction of isolated Gyrodactylus gasterostei from the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, has been investigated. Three lineages of isolated parasites, without opportunity for cross- or self-fertilisation, continued to reproduce for up to 19 generations (224 births) until experiments were discontinued. Most parasites gave birth to two daughters only, although four individuals in one lineage gave birth three times. After the final birth the empty uterus expanded, while a large oocyte remained in the seminal receptacle and appeared capable of development. Reproduction by isolated flukes was further analysed using quantitative genetic techniques, applied to the hamuli and marginal hooks. The variance of hamulus and marginal hook dimensions in lineages of isolated flukes (which, if sexual must be highly inbred) was similar to that observed in natural populations. Crude heritability appeared high, but a significant relationship between hook size and environmental temperature was noted, and when this was controlled for, the heritability of all characters became negligible. Genetic drift was not observed over 17 generations and variance within isolated lines accounted for almost all of the total variance. Genes controlling hamulus or marginal hook dimensions did not progress to fixation, although the number of generations (more than 10) was sufficient to ensure homozygosity if self-fertilisation were occurring. These observations indicate that reproduction by isolated G. gasterostei continues indefinitely, but does not involve sex. The limited variance of natural populations suggests that these are also clonal with observed variation being largely environmental. Sexual reproduction may therefore be rare in G. gasterostei.

AB  - This paper studies the properties of the sex ratio in two-period models of threshold (e.g., polygenic or temperature-dependent) sex determination under heavy-tailedness in the framework of possibly skewed stable distributions and their convolutions. We show that if the initial distribution of the sex determining trait in Such settings is moderately heavy-tailed and has a finite first moment, then an excess of males (females) in the first period leads to the same pattern in the second period. Thus, the excess of one sex over the other one accumulates over two generations and the sex ratio ill the total alive population ill the second period cannot stabilize at the balanced sex ratio value of 1/2. These properties are reversed for extremely heavy-tailed initial distributions of sex determining traits with infinite first moments. Ill Such settings, the sex ratio of the offspring oscillates around the balanced sex ratio value and an excess of males (females) in the first period leads to an excess of females (males) in the second period. In addition, the sex ratio in the total living population in the second period can stabilize at 1/2 for some extremely heavy-tailed initial distributions of the sex determining trait. The results in the paper are shown to also hold for bounded sex determining phenotypes. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We have studied the pattern of association between the season of conception and cytosolic low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (ACP1) genetic polymorphism in 329 consecutively newborn infants from the population of Penne and 361 consecutively newborn infants from the population of Rome. In addition, 329 mothers were studied in the population of Penne. A concordant, highly significant association was observed in the two populations between ACP1 parameters and the season of conception of newborn infants. The total activity of ACP1 shows a minimum in infants conceived in January-February and a maximum in those conceived at the end of the solar year. Analysis of the joint mother-newborn ACP1 distribution in relation to the season of fertilisation has shown that among mothers carrying ACP1(*)A (the allele showing the lowest activity), the proportion of newborns carrying this allele is higher in those conceived in the first months of the year than in those conceived subsequently. Since ACP1 probably functions as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase and as a flavin mononucleotide phosphatase, low activity could enhance the metabolic rate and would be advantageous in a cold environment. The cycle of variation of ACP1 in infants follows the cycle of solar illumination. It is possible that individuals who have a genetic background allowing them to adapt easily and readily to seasonal demand are more successful in reproducing themselves. The population of zygotes conceived in a given season would therefore reproduce the pattern of gene combination more fit for that season.

AB  - Mutants resistant to the wild-type phage PM2 (type C bacteria) were isolated from a culture of the marine bacterium Alteromonas espejiana BAL-31 (type B bacteria). The wide-host-range mutant phages PM2 r and PM2 r2 capable of reproduction in type C bacteria were obtained. Unlike the wild-type phage (phage w), phage r did not reproduce in type B bacteria at temperatures above 26°C, although both phages displayed similar kinetics of thermoinactivation at 45°C. Phage r2, like phage w, reproduced at temperatures of up to 30°C, i.e., it was not a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts-mutant). The frequency of the w → r mutation equaled 10-6-10-7. The frequency of the reverse mutation r → w, resulting in the loss of both ts and widehost-range properties, was the same. In type B bacteria, the frequency of mutations toward resistance to phages w or r was 10-6-10-8 per cell per generation. In type C bacteria, the frequency of mutations toward resistance to phage r was below 10-6 per cell per generation; however, over 10% of the bacteria formed colonies on Petri dishes with an excess of the phage, i.e., the mutation frequency in this system could not be determined by the standard procedure. In phage r lysates, an inhibitor considerably decreasing the rate of the death of type C bacteria induced by concentrated phage preparations (probably a reversible inhibitor of adsorption) was found. © 1996 MAHK Hayka/Interperiodica Publishing.

AB  - X-linked methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-sensitive mutations were induced with hybrid dysgenesis using four P strains: π2, Harwich, T-007 and OK-1. Mutations were identified after two generations of backcrosses to M strain females to replace the autosomes. Among 51471 X-chromosomes examined 10 carried stable MMS-sensitive mutations representing 8 independent events. Males of the mutant strains failed to induce gonadal dysgenesis in crosses to Oregon-R females at 28.5°C. Complementation tests showed that 3 of the induced mutations were mei-9 alleles, 2 were mei-41 alleles, 1 was a mus102 allele, and 2 were alleles at a newly identified MMS-sensitive locus, mus112 (map position: 1-32.8). As assayed by in situ hybridization on polytene chromosomes, each X-chromosome had no more than four P element insertions. 4 of the 8 mutations recovered in this study proved to have P element insertions at or very close to sites to which MMS sensitivity has been mapped. Hybrid dysgenesis-induced reversion of 2 mutants, mei-9RT1 and mei-41RT2, is associated with the loss of the P element from regions 4B and 14C respectively. © 1990.

TI  - Adaptations in reproduction and behaviour of captive pongids - Zoobiological and veterinary management
VL  - 107

SP  - 391-401
AB  - Monitoring of renal LH-excretion, changes in genital tumescence and menses assesses reproductive status in zookept female chimpanzees. Temporary detumescence of female sex skin in estrus is a reliable indicator for stress. Assessment of female chimpanzee reproductive status relates to local and individual variation of cycle length and temporal correlation of investigated parameters. Monitoring of neonate chimpanzee behavioural ontogeny is an essential tool of evaluating applied rearing methods since individuals were to be integrated into the adult group during adolescence. Slow and continuous transition periods between consecutive rearing phases avoid irreversible disturbed behaviour. Care by one person up to the age of 12 months, followed by a 3 year stay in a peer group guarantee normal development in zookept infant chimpanzees. 4-5 years old chimpanzees with infantile attributes and abilities to submit and appease can be integrated to adults with low risk. In female gorillas sexual cyclicity was monitored by renal excretion of LH, length of menses, sexual behaviour and - in tame females - by basal body temperature and variation of length of the urogenital cleft. Intraspecific variation of cyclicity allowed individual fertility assessment after comparison of several cycles. Analyses of behaviour gave hints to overcharged adaptability and reduced infertility under inadequate maintenance. Data on semen and testicular biopsy improve fertility-evaluation in gorilla males and point to degree and time of tissue alteration and etiology. Body hygiene analogous to the human, tool use and interspecific play with chimpanzees and humans behind window screens were observed in inadequately kept gorillas. Homosexual behaviour among females was reversible with environmental and social changes. Coalitions among nonrelated females were-an effective social strategy against an aggressive male. Cyclicity was disturbed drastically by social events such as physical lesions made by a male but normalized with improved social situation. Disturbed cyclicity featured prolongation of interestrus intervals and complete detumescence, oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea. Nulliparous females in their third decennium needed more than 1,5 years of social contact to a fertile male to become fullterm pregnant. During the first two months of pregnancy stillbirths and embryonic resorptions were detected. Hand-reared and inexperienced primiparous gorilla females accepted their infants and reared them normally after witnessing motherrearing in neighbored chimpanzee females for several years. Opportunities of free choice and decision making determine zookept pongid behaviour, that cannot be compared with prisoners' ethology. Adaptations of ontogenetic behaviour and reproduction, teleonomic patterns and zoomorphism are of zoobiological relevance. Adaptations develope during prolonged periods of time and thus results of corresponding management issues are to be assessed a posteriori.

TI  - On farm agronomic and first environmental evaluation of oil crops for sustainable bioenergy chains
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 171-180
AB  - Energy crops, and in particular oil crops, could be an important occasion for developing new non food production rows for a new multi-functional agriculture in Italy. In this view, the use of local biomass is a fundamental starting point for the development of a virtuous energy chain that should pursue not only agricultural profitability, but also chain sustainability and that is less dependent on the global market, characterized by instability in terms of biomass availability and price. From this perspective, particular attention must be paid to crop choice on the basis of its rusticity and of its adaptability to local growing conditions and to low input cropping systems. In this context, alike woody and herbaceous biomasses, oil crops such as sunflower and rapeseed should be able to support local agricultural bioenergy chain in Italy. In addition, in a local bioenergy chain, the role of the farmers should not be limited just to grain production; but also grain processing should be performed at farm or consortium level in oilseed extraction plants well proportioned to the cropped surface. In this way, by means of a simple power generator, farmer could thus produce its own thermal and electric energy from the oil, maximizing his profit. This objective could also be achieved through the exploitation of the total biomass, including crop residues and defatted seed meals, that may be considered as fundamental additional economic and/or environmental benefits of the chain. This paper reports some results of three-years on-farm experiments on oil crop chain carried out in the framework of "Bioenergie" project, that was focused to enhance farmers awareness of these criteria and to the feasibility at open field scale of low-input cultivation of rapeseed, sunflower and Brassica carinata in seven Italian regions. In several on-farm experiences, these crops produced more than 800 kg ha-1 of oil with good energy properties. Defatted seed meals could be interesting as organic fertilizers and, in the case of B. carinata, as a biofumigant amendment that could offer a total or partial alternative to some chemicals in agriculture. Furthermore, biomass soil incorporation could contribute to C sequestration, catching CO2 from atmosphere and sinking a part in soil as stable humus. Finally, four different open field experiences carried out again in the second year of the project, have been analysed in order to evaluate their energy and greenhouse gasses balance after cultivation phase.

TI  - Heat shock protein 70 as an indicator of early lung injury caused by exposure to arsenic
VL  - 277
IS  - 1
SP  - 153-164
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of highly conserved proteins that are induced by a number of stresses including toxic metals. Heat shock proteins expression has been reported to be an early and sensitive biomarker of cell stress. Arsenic is a naturally occurring metal that exists widely in the environment and is used in several industries. Exposure to arsenic is associated with the development of pulmonary cancers. We monitored changes in Hsp70 and markers of oxidative injury induced by arsenic in human pulmonary epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Hsp70 protein, mRNA and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were measured after exposing cells to arsenic as markers of injury. Hsp70 protein expression showed significant 7.9-fold and 31.5-fold increase using Western blotting and ELISA assay, respectively, at a 50 μM As(III) with a 12 h exposure and an 12 h recovery time. Hsp70A and Hsp70B mRNA expression showed a two-fold increase and Hsp70C mRNA expression showed a six-fold increase. As(III)-induced Hsp70 protein expression was inhibited significantly by catalase and NAC, indicating mediation of ROS in Hsp70 expression. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was significantly depleted by As(III) exposure. Lipid peroxidation by-product, 8-isoprostane, was increased six-fold at 24 h exposure to 20 μM As(III). Electron spin resonance and confocal microscope studies also showed As(III)-stimulated ROS generation. These results suggest that cellular injury by arsenic is mediated through ROS generation resulting in the expression of Hsp70. It is possible that Hsp70 may prove to be a sensitive biomarker for arsenic exposure with other markers of oxidative stress in human serum. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.

TI  - Stable, Germ-Line Transformation of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 38
IS  - 5
SP  - 701-710
AB  - A Hermes-based transposable element transformation system incorporating an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) marker was used to produce two transgenic lines of Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). The transformation frequency was ≈12% and transformation of Culex was shown to be dependent on the presence of Hermes transposase. Injected Culex embryos were treated with four different heat shock regimes, two of which produced transformed individuals. These individuals were mated with wild-type mosquitoes and produced offspring which expressed the dominant EGFP gene in Mendelian ratios predicted for the stable integration of a gene at a single locus. The two transformed lines displayed distinct patterns of phenotypic expression, the expression of which has remained stable after fifteen generations. In these transgenic lines both the Hermes element and flanking plasmid DNA integrated into the Culex genome, as has been previously seen in Hermes-mediated transgenic strains of Aedes aegypti (L.). The high frequency of Culex transformation together with the dependence on the presence of Hermes transposase suggests that, as for Ae. aegypti, this mode of transposition into the germ-line genome occurs by an alternate mechanism to the cut and paste type of transposition seen for this element in other insect species and in the somatic nuclei of mosquitoes. This is the first report of the genetic transformation of a species in the genus Culex and demonstrates that this medically important mosquito species can now, along with several other Culicine and Anopheline mosquito species, be genetically manipulated.

TI  - Seasonal variation of genotype-specific fertility and adaptation to endemic diseases: A study in past malarial areas of Italy
VL  - 76
IS  - 6
SP  - 837-848
AB  - Cyclic seasonal variation of genotype-specific fertility could interact with endemic diseases characterized by seasonal variation of severity resulting in changes of gene frequencies in the course of generations. Assuming that a given allele A has a frequency pw in infants conceived in the cold season and a frequency of ps in those conceived in the warm season and assuming that general fertility is the same in the two seasonal periods, the gene frequency in the population is pm = (pw + p s)/2; this frequency remains constant over the course of generations. The introduction of an endemic disease bearing negatively on general fertility and characterized by a seasonal pattern of severity could result in variations of the A allele frequency. If the maximum of endemicity coincides with the maximum value of the allele A frequency, the frequency of allele A will progressively decrease. A simple mathematical algorithm has been applied to two polymorphic enzymes (ACP1 and G6PD) correlated with past malarial morbidity in Sardinia and the Po River delta. The two systems show differences in gene frequency in relation to season of conception. The theoretical changes fit quite well with the data observed in Sardinian and Po delta populations, thus suggesting a mechanism that is an alternative to or concurrent with the classical mechanism that assumes a direct connection between the genetic systems and the biology of the malarial parasite.

SP  - 523-532
AB  - Synthetic pheromone trap captures of Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lep., Arctiidae) males were compared with those of virgin female-baited traps and with visual observations. Delta-traps with females and Uni-traps with synthetic pheromone (1Z,3Z,6Z-9,10-epoxyheneicosatriene, 3Z,6Z-9,10-epoxyheneicosadiene, and 9Z,12Z,15Z-octadecatrienal; total, 2-6 mg/dispenser) and visual observation at a fixed point were used. The diurnal rhythm of activity in the little studied first (spring) generation showed a broad peak (3 h) after sunset. The second (summer) generation showed a short (1.5 h) but intense peak of attraction before sunrise, both to natural and to synthetic pheromones. A second small peak, just after sunset, was detected only in traps with the synthetic bait. Males started to be attracted to females about I h later than to synthetics in both generations. The main flight of males (mid-50% of cumulative male catches) was longer (8-11 days) in the first than in the second generation (5-7 days). The catches of males were increased by high daily maximum temperatures in the spring generation, while rain suppressed activity (phenology was delayed) in both generations. The total period of activity detectable by visual observations was about 6 days shorter than by pheromone traps. Population trends were recorded over four generations 1992-94 in two sites by trapping of moths and counting of larval webs. The second (summer) generation was two to six times larger than the spring generation. There was a correlation between the log-transformed catch of males and larval webs (r = 0.92 for proportions of both infested trees and web density) of the same period. This allows prediction of the subsequent larval abundance (offspring) based on adult (parent) pheromone trapping in preceding weeks.

AB  - Biological traits of a prospective candidate for biological control of the glassy-winged sharpshooter (GWSS), Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), in the United States are herein reported. The mymarid wasp, Gonatocerus tuberculifemur (Ogloblin), is an egg-parasitoid native to Argentina and its first known host is Tapajosa rubromarginata (Signoret), a species related to GWSS. Laboratory studies were made in Tucuman and Buenos Aires Provinces, Argentina. Seven generations were maintained in the laboratory, and only one adult emerged per host egg. The average parasitism rate was 71.6% of total eggs. Although eggs of all ages (4 to 190 h old) were parasitized, wasps did not emerge from eggs over 96 h old. The percentage of wasp emergence was 66.5% from eggs between 4 and 72 h old. Over the seven generations that G. tuberculifemur was reared, the parasitism rate ranged between 55-84%. This percentage of emergence increased as the parasitoid generations progressed. The duration of development from oviposition to adult emergence of G. tuberculifemur was 12.6 +/- 1.8 days (range 11.4-13.0) at 22.5-27.5 degrees C and 70-80% RH. The duration of development was significantly affected by sex and temperature. Males developed faster than females (12.2 vs. 12.8, respectively). The sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1. Average adult longevity was 6.73 +/- 3.93 days fed on honey. Male and female longevity was not significantly different. Oviposition and mating behavior are described.

TI  - Curing Wolbachia infections in Nasonia (parasitoid wasp)
VL  - 4
IS  - 10
AB  - Nasonia is a complex of four closely related species of wasps with several features that make it an excellent system for a variety of genetic studies. These include a short generation time, ease of rearing, interfertile species, visible and molecular markers, and a sequenced genome. However, the Nasonia species normally are completely or partially reproductively isolated owing to Wolbachia, widespread intracellular bacteria found in arthropods and nematodes. Wolbachia cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in Nasonia. Although the current genome-sequenced strains of Nasonia (AsymCX, IV7[u], RV2X[u]) are all Wolbachia-free, crosses between infected and uninfected wasps, or between infected wasps of different species, will fail because of Wolbachia. The sperm modification that induces CI appears to be established before the adult stage, so it is generally not possible to cure an infection and break the CI barrier in the same generation. However, a Wolbachia infection can be removed from a strain over a number of generations by feeding antibiotics and selecting on females showing partial CI. This protocol describes the methods to cure a Nasonia strain of its Wolbachia symbionts. Copyright © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Diapause development of the Common Pine Sawfly (Diprion pini L.) (Hym., Diprinoidae) and their parasites The Common Pine Sawfly, Diprion pini, consists of a “lowland” and a “mountain” ecotype each of which characterized by a distinct and complex diapause behaviour. Because of varying duration of the eonymphal diapause development of the offspring of the 1st generation of the “lowland type” extends over three, that of the 2nd generation over four years. Emergence of the 1st and 2nd generation occurs in flight periods (“flight waves”). The pattern of emergence of the offspring of a single female consists of a maximum of four flight periods, which in the “lowland type” develop within two years, in the “mountain type” within four years. Day length is an important factor of induction, maintenance and termination of diapause; temperature is a modifying factor. Both of them appear to be components in a complexy genetic and environmental control system. The pattern of development and diapause in the egg, larval and cocoon parasites of both the “lowland type” and the “mountain type” of D. pini is dealt with. Diapause of parasites serves to synchronise with host development. Von der Gemeinen Kiefern‐Buschhornblattwespe gibt es zwei Ükotypen: die Tieflandform und die Gebirgsform. Beide zeichnen sich durch ein außerordentlich vielgestaltiges und komplexes Dormanzverhalten aus. Bedingt durch unterschiedlich lange Diapause im Eonymphenstadium erstreckt sich die Entwicklung der Nachkommen der 1. Generation der Tieflandform über 3, die der 2. Generation über 4 Jahre (Abb. 1). Das Schlüpfen der 1. und 2. Generation erfolgt in Wellen. In jeder Generation künnen bis zu 6 Schlüpfwellen gebildet werden. Der überwiegende Teil der Population schlüpft innerhalb des 1. Jahres nach der Fraßperiode; die Überliegerrate ist daher gering. Innerhalb eines Jahres gibt es bei der Tieflandform maximal 4 Schlüpfwellen; davon entfallen 3 auf die 1. Generation und 1 auf die 2. Die Schlüpfwellenfolge der D. pini anläßlich einer Massenvermehrung bei Fontainebleau im Pariser Becken in den Jahren 1963–1969 ist in Abb. 1 und Tab. 3 dargestellt (Dusaussoy und Géri 1971). Daß in Populationen 6 oder 7 Schlüpfwellen vorkommen, liegt daran, daß die Nachkommen mancher Weibchen 1 oder 2 “Schlüpftermine” überspringen. Der Gebirgsökotyp der D. pini schlüpft über 4–5 Jahre verteilt und hat im Unterschied zur Tieflandform meistens nur 1 Schlüpfwelle und 1 partielle Generation im Jahr. Die Überliegerrate ist hoch (Abb. 2). Die Nachkommen eines Weibchens schlüpfen in maximal 4 Wellen, die bei der Tieflandform in 1–2 Jahren (Abb. 3), bei der Gebirgsform in 4 Jahren entstehen. Die sommerliche Entwicklungshemmung der Afterraupen von D. pini betrifft hauptsächlich Individuen der Juniflugwelle (Abb. 4), und zwar überwiegend des 3. und 4. Stadiums. Der biologische Sinn des sehr differenzierten Dormanzverhaltens der D. pini stellt eine Risikostreuung dar, entwickelt, um alle Gegebenheiten des Standortes optimal auszunutzen. Es handelt sich wahrscheinlich um einen genetisch gesteuerten Polymorphismus. Die Schlüpfwellen ‐ maximal 4 ‐ und damit die Dauer der Diapause, werden offenbar durch einen Genlocus mit 4 Allelen vererbt. Für eine genetische Fixierung der Schlüpfwellenzahl spricht die Tatsache, daß sie unter konstanten Bedingungen im Laboratorium reproduziert werden kann (Tab. 2). Durch Kreuzungen mit Extremvarianten der Blattwespe konnte außerdem gezeigt werden, daß die saisonalen Schlüpfperioden und das Überliegen teilweise genetisch kontrolliert werden, wobei die Charaktere der diploiden Weibchen über die der haploiden Männchen dominieren (Eichhorn 1979). Ein wichtiger Faktor für die Induktion, Aufrechterhaltung und Beendigung der Diapause ist die Tageslänge (H:D‐Phase). Die Temperatur wirkt modifizierend. Völlig unabhängig wirkt keiner der Faktoren, weder die Tageslänge, noch die Temperatur; vielmehr scheint ein komplexes Verknüpfungsgefüge zwischen genetischen und umweltbedingten Faktoren zu bestehen. Entwicklung und Dormanzverhalten der Ei‐, Larven‐ und Kokonparasiten der Tieflandform (Abb. 1) und Gebirgsform (Abb. 2) der D. pini werden dargestellt. Die Dormanz der Parasiten dient der Synchronisation mit der Entwicklung des Wirtes. Spezifische, mono‐ bis oligophage Schmarotzer stimmen daher im Schlüpfmuster weitgehend mit dem Wirt überein, während weniger spezifische, polyphage Arten geringere Übereinstimmung der Schlüpfmuster aufweisen. Die hochspezifischen Larvenparasiten Olesicampe sp. und L. pini synchronisieren ihre Entwicklung mit der des Wirtes dadurch, daß sie sich dem endokrinen Steuerungssystem der Blattwespe einfügen, womit eine von äußeren Faktoren unabhängige Koordination der Entwicklungsabläufe der beiden Partner gewährleistet ist. Als Signal zur Beendigung der Dormanz dient den beiden Parasitenarten die Ausschüttung des Metarmorphosehormons der Blattwespe, das deren eonymphale Diapause beendet. Obwohl die kausalen Verknüpfungen der Dormanzverhältnisse der Gemeinen Kiefern‐Buschhornblattwespe noch nicht aufgeklärt sind, liefern doch die bisher erforschten Tatsachen wichtige Erkenntnisse für die angewandte Entomologie, insbesondere für die Prognose und damit für die Bekämpfung des Forstschädlings (Kap. 7). 1983 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

VL  - 70

AB  - Effects of external factors on the defence reactions of Neomyzus circumflexus. The blood cells of Neomyzus circumflexus are capable of encapsulating the newly hatched larvae of its endoparasite, Aphelinus asychis. However, the success of this defence reaction is variable: Sometimes it does not occur at all. Either the aphid or the parasite can develop completly or both remain in an intermediate developmental stage. At higher temperature (25° C) the host‐parasite relationship was more advantageous for the parasite than for the host. The rate of encapsulation of the parasite was low and the host remained smaller, with shorter longevity and less reproduction. The effect of low temperature (15° C) was just the reverse. The aphids encapsulation ability was compared on cuttings and whole plants of tulips, potatoes, broad beans and tomatoes; it was observed that the rate of encapsulation was more on tulips and least on tomatoes. The age of the host plant showed a significant influence on the encapsulation capacity only in the cut tulip leaves and whole bean plants. The restricted defense ability and vitality of aphids on tomatoes was probably due to thick hairy leaves which hindered their feeding. Artificial feeding deficient in cystein caused a fast reduction in vitality and defence ability, whereas the media lacking in tyrosin and phenylalanin caused a slower reduction over several generations. A reduction of vitality and encapsulation capacity was also attained by decreasing the total concentration of amino acids, however, the reduction of the sugar concentration had no effect. Since almost all the external factors studied here reduced the encapsulation ability of the aphids as well as their vitality, it seems probable that the defence ability of the aphids lies in their general vitality. Die Gefleckte Gewächshauslaus (Neomyzus circumflexus) führt gegen die frischgeschlüpften Larven von Aphelinus asychis hämocytäre Abwehrreaktionen aus, deren Erfolg aber unterschiedlich ist; teilweise unterbleibt die Reaktion auch ganz. Dementsprechend kann sich entweder die Blattlaus oder der Parasit vollständig entwickeln, oder es bleiben beide Partner auf einem mittleren Entwicklungszustand stehen. Bei einer Temperatur von 25° C war gegenüber 15° C das Wirt‐Parasit‐Verhältnis zugunsten des Parasiten verschoben: Die Abkapselungsrate war geringer. Gleichzeitig blieben die Läuse kleiner, hatten eine kürzere Lebensdauer und eine geringere Fruchtbarkeit. Das Abkapselungsvermögen der Läuse wurde auf abgeschnittenen und bewurzelten Tulpen, Kartoffeln, Ackerbohnen und Tomaten verglichen; es war auf Tulpen am größten, auf Tomaten am kleinsten. Das Alter der Wirtspflanzen hatte nur bei abgeschnittenen Tulpenblättern und bewurzelten Bohnenpflanzen einen signifikanten Einfluß auf die Abkapselungsfähigkeit. Dabei war auf älteren, ausgewachsenen Blättern bewurzelter Bohnenpflanzen die Reaktion seltener und schwächer als auf jungen, noch wachsenden. Die geringere Abwehrfähigkeit und Vitalität der Läuse auf Tomaten muß auf die starke Behaarung dieser Pflanzen zurückgeführt werden, welche die Tiere beim Saugen behindert. Dementsprechend war das Abwehrvermögen bei täglich 6stündigem Hunger ebenfalls reduziert. Auf künstlichem Nährmedium bewirkte ein Fehlen von Cystein eine rasche, ein Fehlen von Tyrosin und Phenylalanin eine langsame Reduktion von Vitalität und Abwehrvermögen über mehrere Generationen. Eine spezifische Wirkung des Tyrosinmangels auf die Abkapselung durch Unfähigkeit zur Melaninbildung ließ sich nicht nachweisen. Durch Herabsetzen des Gesamtgehalts an Aminosäuren wurde ebenfalls eine Minderung von Vitalität und Abwehrfähigkeit erreicht, durch eine Reduktion des Zuckergehaltes dagegen kaum eine Auswirkung erzielt. Durch Infiltration einer wässrigen Lösung von 22 Aminosäuren (3,6 °) in ältere Bohnenpflanzen erhöhte sich die Abkapselungsfähigkeit der darauf lebenden Blattläuse bis über das Niveau, das auf jungen Bohnen zu beobachten war. Nach gelungener Abkapselung einer Parasitenlarve war die Fruchtbarkeit der betreffenden Blattlaus fast auf die Hälfte reduziert. Da fast alle äußeren Einflüsse, welche die Abkapselungsfähigkeit der Gewächshauslaus reduzierten, gleichzeitig eine Minderung ihrer Vitalität (Gewicht, Entwicklungsgeschwindigkeit, Lebensdauer oder Fruchtbarkeit) bewirkten, scheint die Abwehrfähigkeit von der allgemeinen Vitalität der Laus abhängig zu sein. 1972 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

VL  - 155

SP  - 447-453
AB  - Escherichia coli murein was specifically labeled with [14C]diaminopimelic acid in the mutant strains W7 (dap lysA) and BUG6. Pulse-labeled heat-denatured E. coli cells were digested with 2 mg of egg-white lysozyme per ml to degrade the murein completely and free any lipoprotein-bound muropeptide trimers, dimers, and monomers. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the relative percentage of trimers and dimers found in the newly synthesized murein increased somewhat with time at the expense of monomers. The increase in cross-links indicated that the radioactive monomers served as acceptors in multisite transpeptidations occurring after the labeling period. The content of nonreducing monomers (C7 and C8) remained unaltered, indicating that the oligosaccharide chain length did not change with time. A gradual conversion of the reducing disaccharide tetrapeptide monomer to its tripeptide analog occurred during chasing. Braun lipoprotein was linked to about 2% of the murein subunits within 30 s of the incorporation of subunits into insoluble murein, an after one-half a generation of chase, lipoprotein-associated muropeptides had approached the maximum (16% of the total murein subunits). The distribution of muropeptides was similar in lipoprotein-linked and lipoprotein-free murein, showing that the enzyme that links Braun lipoprotein to murein does not discriminate between monomers, dimers, and trimers. No evidence for a chasable, soluble polymer of murein was found in our experiments. Hence, our data support the idea that new murein is incorporated directly into the sacculus without first existing as a soluble intermediate.

TI  - Neoproterozoic Mangerite-Granite Magmatism in Southeastern Brazil: The São Pedro de Caldas Massif
VL  - 69
IS  - 3
SP  - 366-394
AB  - The São Pedro de Caldas (SPC) massif is the southeasternmost occurrence of a nearly continuous belt of foliated mangerite-granite tabular bodies which runs NW-SE for about 100 km within the Guaxupé Domain, an allochtonous terrane in the southern border of the São Francisco craton, Brazil, made up of rocks affected by a strong Neoproterozoic (650-620 Ma) metamorphic overprint. Greenish, medium- to coarse-grained mangerites are predominant in the SPC massif; pink hornblende granites are more abundant in its central portion, while fine-grained charnockites occur as scattered metric bodies within the mangerites. The strong metamorphic overprint (peaking at T = 750-800°C and P ≥ 7 kbar, as estimated from the pyroxene compositions) destroyed the magmatic textures and provoked exsolution and chemical reequilibration of the pyroxenes, feldspars and Fe-Ti oxides. A "within-plate" chemical signature is indicated by low mg#, Ca and Sr and high Zr. Slight but systematic variations in the mg# are observed among the three sectors in which the massif is divided; they are lower in the Eastern (7-9 in mangerites) as compared to the Central sector (from 17 in the mangerites down to 12 in fractionated granites), suggesting that slightly different parent melts gave rise to the different sectors of the massif. These differences are also shown by the mafic minerals, which approach pure iron-rich end-members in the Eastern sector (opx: Fs85-87; amphibole: hastingsitic hornblende with mg# = 8-11; biotite near pure annite). Contrasts in the contents of Al, Na, K, Ba and Sr observed among mangerites from different sectors of the massif are mostly due to variations in the contents of cumulative Na-K feldspar, which are greater in the Western sector, where the positive Eu anomalies seen in the REE patterns are more pronounced. Chemical modeling shows that in situ crystal fractionation involving oligoclase + K-feldspar (or a single ternary feldspar), ortho- and clinopyroxene and a Fe-Ti oxide is compatible with the observed major element variations in the mangerite-hornblende granite range. The major element variation towards more fractionated rocks (hololeucocratic granites at 75 wt% SiO2) is satisfactorily reproduced by feldspar + hornblende + Fe-Ti oxide extraction, but some mistif is observed with trace element modeling, where some elements (e.g. LREE, Th) attain values higher than expected, implying F (fraction of melt remaining) values lower than predicted by major element modeling (more primitive parent magmas?) or open-system behavior. As inferred from mineralogy and geochemistry, the parent magmas of the SPC mangerite-granite suite were derived from lower-crustal depleted granulites at very low a(H2O) and high T (ca. 950°C). The volumetrically minor fine-grained charnockites (with lower Rb and Th contents and well-displayed positive Eu anomalies but no other indications of cumulative character) would require an even more depleted source. The granites present in the massif share many chemical features with classic rapakivi granites, differing only in their lower Rb, Th and Nb contents, a clear reflection of their lower-crustal source. The generation of the mangerite-granite magmatism (U-Pb ages at ca. 630 Ma) occurred soon after extensive generation of high-K calc-alkaline granitoids (ca. 650 Ma), and seems intimately related to a huge thermal anomaly which ascended rapidly in the crust, provoking high-grade metamorphism and wide-spread migmatization in more fertile protoliths found in the intermediate crustal levels where the mangeritic magmas intruded.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS CONTROLLING THE EVOCATION AND TERMINATION OF DIAPAUSE IN THE FRUIT TREE RED SPIDER MITE METATETRANYCHUS ULMI KOCH (ACARINA: TETRANYCHIDAE)
VL  - 40
IS  - 3
SP  - 449-486
AB  - Metatetranychus ulmi lays eggs of two types. The summer eggs, which are laid on the leaves of the host plant (e.g. apple), are of the non‐diapause type and develop without interruption. The winter eggs, which are deposited predominantly on the bark, enter diapause at the blastoderm stage of development. ‘Summer’ and ‘winter’ females lay eggs of only one type if exposed to constant environmental conditions. Diapause is facultative. Over seventy successive summer generations have been reared under diapause‐preventing conditions. Winter females appear in the first post‐diapause generation in response to stimuli which induce diapause. Three environmental agencies are capable of evoking diapause, namely photoperiod, temperature and nutrition. Mites feeding upon undamaged young or mature leaves obtain a plentiful food supply and the incidence of diapause is then determined solely by photoperiod and temperature. However, if the food supplies are restricted, winter females appear even when photoperiod and temperature are such as to prevent diapause. Such deficiencies, which are probably of a quantitative nature, are manifested when the diet consists of the cell contents either of senescing leaves or of ‘bronzed’ foliage previously damaged by the feeding punctures of large mite populations. With daily photoperiods lasting from 6 to 13 hr., and at medium temperatures (c. 15° C.), only winter females develop. The incidence of diapause falls to zero at 15–16 hr., and only summer females are produced in continuous illumination. About 40% of summer females appear in the absence of light. The mites respond to the absolute duration of the cycle of illumination and not to increasing or decreasing photoperiods. Provided the illumination exceeds a threshold of 1–2 f.c., the response is independent of light intensity. Radiation in the near ultra‐violet, blue and blue‐green regions of the spectrum is photoperiodically active. Maximum sensitivity occurs in the blue region. Wavelengths above 550 m μ, i.e. in the orange, red and infra‐red regions, are totally inactive even if the energy level is high. The mites are influenced directly by the photoperiod, not indirectly through the medium of the host plant. High temperatures (e.g. 25° C.) tend to prevent diapause even if the photoperiod is short. Low temperatures (e.g. 10° C.) induce some diapause even with a long photoperiod. Temperature activity seems to be mainly confined to the dark phase. Developing mites are indifferent to photoperiod, temperature and nutrition until the deutonymphal instar. This is also the period of greatest sensitivity, but egg‐laying females, if exposed to antagonistic conditions, can still be caused to ‘switch‐over’ to the alternative egg type. Eggs intermediate in character may be laid during the period of reversal. Winter eggs in diapause never hatch at 18 or 25° C. Diapause can be broken by chilling the eggs at 1, 5 or 9° C. for 150–200 days. In Tetranychus telarius photoperiod, temperature and nutrition play a similar role in controlling the onset of diapause; and females in diapause can be caused to feed and oviposit if chilled. The tropical species Metatetranychus bioculatus is without diapause and photoperiod has no influence on development. These experimental findings have been used in an interpretation of the life cycle and phenology of M. ulmi. In orchards where mite populations remain small throughout the season the first winter females appear at a time when food supplies are still plentiful. This is accounted for by the response to photoperiod. Copyright © 1953, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 14

SP  - 547-559
AB  - Background, aim, and scope: One of the most important sources of global carbon dioxide emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for power generation. Power plants contribute more than 40% of the worldwide anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Therefore, the increased requirements for climate protection are a great challenge for the power producers. In this context a significant increase in power plant efficiency will contribute to reduce specific CO2 emissions. Additionally, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is receiving considerable attention as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option. CCS allows continued use of fossil fuels with no or little CO2 emissions given to the atmosphere. This could approve a moderate transition to a low-carbon energy generation over the next decades. Currently, R&amp;D activities in the field of CCS are mainly concentrated on the development of capture techniques, the geological assessment of CO2 storage reservoirs, and on economic aspects. Although first studies on material and energy flows caused by CCS are available, a broader environmental analysis is necessary to show the overall environmental impacts of CCS. The objectives in this paper are coal-based power plants with and without CO2 capture via mono-ethanolamine (MEA) and the comparison of their environmental effects based on life cycle assessment methodology (LCA). Methods: This LCA study examines the environmental and human health effects of power generation of five coal-based steam power plants, which differ in the year of installation (2005, 2010, 2020), the conversion efficiency, and in the ability and efficiency to capture CO2. For the removal of CO2 from combustion and gasification processes in power plants, three main technology concepts exist: (1) pre-combustion technology, (2) oxyfuel combustion systems, and (3) post-combustion separation. As post-combustion technology shows the highest level of maturity, this study concentrates on this route, focusing on capture using mono-ethanolamine (MEA). The analysis regards the post-combustion retrofit of coal power plants with MEA to be a general option in 2020. Results: Material and energy flows are balanced on the level of single processes as well as for the whole process chains. The life cycle inventory clearly shows decreasing inputs and outputs according to the efficiency increase from 43% to 49% in case of the power plants without CO2 capture. In case of the MEA plants, all inputs and emissions raise, according to the additional energy consumption, except CO2 and sulphur dioxide. The strong decrease of SO2 partly results from the necessary improvement of desulphurisation if MEA wash is used. The influence of up and downstream activities on the results is determined. For the MEA plants, a considerable effect of up and downstream activities on the overall results is observed. Finally, the inventory results are assigned to selected impact categories. Global warming (GWP), human toxicity (HTP), acidification (AP), photo-oxidant formation (POCP), eutrophication (EP), and primary energy demand are adopted as impact categories. The impact assessment indicates decreasing impacts for all categories with increasing combustion efficiency for the coal plants without carbon capture. As expected, the GWP for the MEA plants is much lower than for the power plants without CO2 capture. In contrast to this, the HTP and the EP are much higher (up to three times) for the MEA plants. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results. Furthermore, it is concluded from the sensitivity analysis that for CCS systems the length of CO2 pipeline has a negligible effect in comparison with the effect of capture efficiency. The LCA is completed by a normalisation of the environmental impact categories. Discussion: The development of combustion efficiency in case of the power plants without CO2 capture has the main influence on the decreasing mass flows at the input side. The energy penalty of the MEA plants affects the use of the inputs into the opposite direction. Although the power producer's focus is on the power plant, the sense of a life cycle assessment is an integrated environmental assessment of the full life cycle of a product (here 1 kWh) including up and downstream processes. Therefore, the inventory results are presented without and with up and downstream processes. The inventory analysis clearly shows the significant influence of the up and downstream processes on the overall emissions. This influence is higher for the MEA plants than for the power plants without capture. In case of CO2 emissions, the significance of up and downstream processes is especially considerable (approx. 30%). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results. Conclusions: The results point out that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere is achieved at the expense of increasing other emissions and corresponding environmental impacts. In most cases the influence of up and downstream processes is significant. Therefore, life cycle approaches are necessary to get a holistic evaluation. It also shows that the implementation of new techniques can change the environmental assessment of the process chain and, thus, positive and negative effects have to be compared and weighed up against each other. Perspectives: As there exist several possible technical options for CO2 capture, further studies are necessary to compare the overall environmental effects of competing capture concepts such as pre-combustion and oxyfuel technology. Additionally, gas separating membranes should be part of further studies as they have the potential to contribute to all three main capture technology routes. Further studies with more detail and reliable inventories for CO2 compression and liquefaction as well as for gas conditioning as an interface between CO2 capture and transport are needed. Furthermore, the environmental effects including long-term CO2 emission from the storage sites are recommended. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Enhancing PUFA-rich polar lipids in Tisochrysis lutea using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) with oscillating thermal stress
VL  - 105
IS  - 1
SP  - 301-312
AB  - Abstract: Adaptive laboratory evolution is a powerful tool for microorganism improvement likely to produce enhanced microalgae better tailored to their industrial uses. In this work, 12 wild-type strains of Tisochrysis lutea were co-cultivated under increasing thermal stress for 6 months. Indeed, temperature was oscillating daily between a high and a low temperature, with increasing amplitude along the experiment. The goal was to enhance the polyunsaturated fatty acid content of the polar lipids. Samples were taken throughout the evolution experiment and cultivated in standardized conditions to analyze the evolution of the lipid profile. Genomic analysis of the final population shows that two strains survived. The lipid content doubled, impacting all lipid classes. The fatty acid analyses show a decrease in SFAs correlated with an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), while changes in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs) vary between both photobioreactors. Hence, the proportion of C18-MUFAs (18:1 n-9) and most C18-PUFAs (18:2 n-6, 18:3 n-3, and 18:4 n-3) increased, suggesting their potential role in adjusting membrane fluidity to temperature shifts. Of particular interest, DHA in polar lipids tripled in the final population while the growth rate was not affected. Key points: • Adaptive laboratory evolution on a mix of 12 T. lutea strains led to survival of 2 • Thermal stress impacted cell size, total lipid cell content, and all lipid classes • DHA cell content partitioned to polar lipids tripled throughout the experiment. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Major range loss predicted from lack of heat adaptability in an alpine Drosophila species
VL  - 695
AB  - Climate warming is threatening biodiversity worldwide. Climate specialists such as alpine species are especially likely to be vulnerable. Adaptation by rapid evolution is the only long-term option for survival of many species, but the adaptive evolutionary potential of heat resistance has not been assessed in an alpine invertebrate. Here, we show that the alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa cannot readily adapt to heat stress. Heat-exposed flies from a regime with increased ambient temperature and a regime with increased temperature plus artificial selection for heat tolerance were less heat tolerant than the control group. Increased ambient temperature affected negatively both fitness and competitiveness. Ecological niche models predicted the loss of three quarters of the climatically habitable areas of this fly by the end of this century. Our findings suggest that, alongside with other climate specialists, species from mountainous regions are highly vulnerable to climate warming and unlikely to adapt through evolutionary genetic changes.

TI  - Emerging Adaptive Strategies Under Temperature Fluctuations in a Laboratory Evolution Experiment of Escherichia Coli
VL  - 12
AB  - Generalists and specialists are types of strategies individuals can employ that can evolve in fluctuating environments depending on the extremity and periodicity of the fluctuation. To evaluate whether the evolution of specialists or generalists occurs under environmental fluctuation regimes with different levels of periodicity, 24 populations of Escherichia coli underwent laboratory evolution with temperatures alternating between 15 and 43°C in three fluctuation regimes: two periodic regimes dependent on culture's cell density and one random (non-periodic) regime with no such dependency, serving as a control. To investigate contingencies on the genetic background, we seeded our experiment with two different strains. After the experiment, growth rate measurements at the two temperatures showed that the evolution of specialists was favored in the random regime, while generalists were favored in the periodic regimes. Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that several gene mutations were selected in parallel in the evolving populations with some dependency on the starting genetic background. Given the genes mutated, we hypothesized that the driving force behind the observed adaptations is the restoration of the internal physiology of the starting strains' unstressed states at 37°C, which may be a means of improving fitness in the new environments. Phenotypic array measurements supported our hypothesis by demonstrating a tendency of the phenotypic response of the evolved strains to move closer to the starting strains' response at the optimum of 37°C, especially for strains classified as generalists.

TI  - Development of freeze-thaw tolerant lactobacillus rhamnosus gg by adaptive laboratory evolution
VL  - 9
AB  - The industrial application of microorganisms as starters or probiotics requires their preservation to assure viability and metabolic activity. Freezing is routinely used for this purpose, but the cold damage caused by ice crystal formation may result in severe decrease in microbial activity. In this study, adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technique was applied to a lactic acid bacterium to select tolerant strains against freezing and thawing stresses. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG was subjected to freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) for 150 cycles with four replicates. After 150 cycles, FTG-evolved mutants showed improved fitness (survival rates), faster growth rate, and shortened lag phase than those of the ancestor. Genome sequencing analysis of two evolved mutants showed genetic variants at distant loci in six genes and one intergenic space. Loss-of-function mutations were thought to alter the structure of the microbial cell membrane (one insertion in cls), peptidoglycan (two missense mutations in dacA and murQ), and capsular polysaccharides (one missense mutation in wze), resulting in an increase in cellular fluidity. Consequently, L. rhamnosus GG was successfully evolved into stress-tolerant mutants using FTG-ALE in a concerted mode at distal loci of DNA. This study reports for the first time the functioning of dacA and murQ in freeze-thaw sensitivity of cells and demonstrates that simple treatment of ALE designed appropriately can lead to an intelligent genetic changes at multiple target genes in the host microbial cell.

TI  - Adaptive Evolution of Lactococcus Lactis to Thermal and Oxidative Stress Increases Biomass and Nisin Production
VL  - 193
IS  - 11
SP  - 3425-3441
AB  - High values of agitation and temperature lead to stressful conditions in the fermentations of Lactococcus lactis due to its aero-tolerant and mesophilic nature. Here, the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) technique was applied to increase biomass and nisin production yields by enhancing L. lactis subsp. lactis robustness at higher growth temperature and aeration rates. In two separate ALE experiments, after 162 serial transfers, optimum agitation and growth temperature of L. lactis were shifted from 40 rpm and 30 °C to 200 rpm and 37 °C, respectively. Oxidative and acid resistance were enhanced in the evolved strain. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the emergence of five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome of the evolved strain in jag, DnaB, ArgR, cation transporter genes, and one putative protein. The evolved strain of L. lactis in this study has more industrial desirable features and improved nisin production capability and can act more efficiently in nisin production in stressful conditions.

TI  - Rapid evolution in response to warming does not affect the toxicity of a pollutant: Insights from experimental evolution in heated mesocosms
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
SP  - 977-988
AB  - While human-induced stressors such as warming and pollutants may co-occur and interact, evolutionary studies typically focus on single stressors. Rapid thermal evolution may help organisms better deal with warming, yet it remains an open question whether thermal evolution changes the toxicity of pollutants under warming. We investigated the effects of exposure to a novel pollutant (zinc oxide nanoparticles, nZnO) and 4 degrees C warming (20 degrees C vs. 24 degrees C) on key life history and physiological traits of the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone species in aquatic ecosystems. To address the role of thermal evolution, we compared these effects between clones from an experimental evolution trial where animals were kept for two years in outdoor mesocosms at ambient temperatures or ambient +4 degrees C. The nZnO was more toxic at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C: only at 20 degrees C, it caused reductions in early fecundity, intrinsic growth rate and metabolic activity. This was due to a higher accumulated zinc burden at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, which was associated with an upregulation of a metallothionein gene at 20 degrees C but not at 24 degrees C. Clones from the heated mesocosms better dealt with warming than clones from the ambient mesocosms, indicating rapid thermal evolution. Notably, rapid thermal evolution did not change the toxicity of nZnO, neither at 20 degrees C nor at 24 degrees C, suggesting no pleiotropy or metabolic trade-offs were at work under the current experimental design. Evaluating whether thermal evolution influences the toxicity of pollutants is important for ecological risk assessment. It provides key information to extrapolate laboratory-derived toxicity estimates of pollutants both in space to warmer regions and in time under future global warming scenarios. In general, studying how the evolution of tolerance to one anthropogenic stressor influence tolerance to other anthropogenic stressors should get more attention in a rapidly changing world where animals increasingly face combinations of stressors.

TI  - Enhanced Acid Tolerance in Lactobacillus acidophilus by Atmospheric and Room Temperature Plasma (ARTP) Coupled with Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE)
VL  - 191
IS  - 4
SP  - 1499-1514
AB  - The aim of this study was to improve the acid tolerance of Lactobacillus acidophilus by combining atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutation with adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE). To achieve a high mutation efficiency, 60 s was determined as the ideal exposure time for ARTP mutation of L. acidophilus with a survival rate of 5.91%. The ARTP-ALE mutant strain LAartp-ale2 displayed increased lactic acid stress tolerance with survival rates of 75.67% and 25.78% when cultured in pH 3.0 and 2.5, respectively, for 3 h. Physiological analysis revealed that the ARTP-ALE mutant exhibited a lower inner membrane permeability than that of the parental strain during acid stress. Furthermore, the mutant LAartp-ale2 produced more biofilm in response to lactic acid-induced acid stress and showed an increased hydrophobicity (87.2%) when compared to the parent strain (76.2%) at pH 2.5. LAartp-ale2 exhibited a higher unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) to saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratio that affected the physical state of the cell membrane for increased survival in pH 3.0 and 2.5. The mutation with ARTP coupled with ALE in the present study proved to be effective in enhancing the acid tolerance of L. acidophilus for potential industrial use. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Development of Thermotolerant Lactobacilli Cultures with Improved Probiotic Properties Using Adaptive Laboratory Evolution Method
AB  - Probiotics play a significant role in functional foods. Heat stress and dehydration are the two principal mechanisms leading to inactivation and loss of probiotics viability in its production. There is a need to develop an industrial organism to withstand higher temperatures during its processing and storage. This current study aims to develop thermotolerant strains of Lacticaseibacillus casei N (N) and Lactobacillus helveticus NRRL B-4526 (H) by acclimatizing the wild-type strains to the higher temperature of 45 °C by adaptive laboratory evolution. A two-fold increase in biomass was observed in both acclimatized strains up to the 200th generation, which subsequently remained stable after 500 generations. The morphological change of these acclimatized strains was observed under scanning electron microscopy. Also, there was an increase in probiotic attributes of these acclimatized strains compared to their wild-types. Among two acclimatized strains, L. casei N-45 had shown higher tolerance in the acidic pH 3.0 (89.31%), the bile of 0.3% (84.45%), simulated gastric juice (79.12%), and simulated intestinal juice (73.86%). There was also an increase in salt tolerance (NaCl), radical scavenging activity, autoaggregation, coaggregation, and hydrophobicity of these adapted strains. The total protein profiling using 2D gel electrophoresis reveals the differences in protein expressions between wild-type and acclimatized strains. Specific protein spots from acclimatized strains of H-45 and N-45 were further subjected to MALDI-TOF MS/MS. Some of the identified proteins were recognized to play a role in RNA chaperones and protein synthesis during stress conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 128

AB  - Populations at risk of extinction due to climate change may be rescued by adaptive evolution or plasticity. Selective agents, such as introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits, suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection. These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to selection by temperature. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Playing evolution in the laboratory: From the first major evolutionary transition to global warming
VL  - 122

AB  - Experimental evolution allows testing hypotheses derived from theory or from observed patterns in nature. We have designed a droplet-based microfluidic "evolution machine" to test how transient compartmentalization ("trait-groups") of independent molecular replicators (likely a critical step in the origin of life) could have prevented the spread of parasitic mutants; that is, inactive RNAs that have been reported to spoil a system of free replicators. In remarkable agreement with the theory, we show that this simple population structure was sufficient to prevent takeover by inactive RNAs. A more complex scenario arises when we use experimental evolution to test field-derived hypotheses; for instance, the idea that temperature is driving genetic spatiotemporal patterns of climate change. In the fly Drosophila subobscura, latitudinal clines in gene arrangement frequencies occur worldwide, and more equatorial gene arrangements are becoming more frequent at higher latitudes as a correlated response to climate change. However, the evolution at different constant temperatures in the laboratory was not consistent with patterns in nature, suggesting some limitations of experimental evolution. Finally, also in D. subobscura, we show that repeatability in experimental evolution is staggeringly consistent for life history traits, making evolution quite predictable and suggesting that laboratory selection can quickly erase differences between populations. Yet, the genetic paths used to attain the same adaptive phenotypes are complex and unpredictable. © CopyrightEPLA, 2018.

AB  - We present a simple nutrient–phytoplankton model that incorpo-rates adaptive evolution and allometric relations. This model allows us to examine the patterns and consequences of adaptive changes in the cell size of phytoplankton under the effect of changes in water temperature. A the-oretical study reveals that the ecological reproductive index can be used to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of the nutrient–phytoplankton mod-el. Numerical analysis suggests that phytoplankton should evolve toward the small sizes typical of picophytoplankton as the water temperature increases. This study provides a framework for studying the adaptive evolution of phy-toplankton cell size in water ecosystem. © 2020, Wilmington Scientific Publisher. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heterogeneous and ever-changing thermal environments drive the evolution of populations and species, especially when extreme conditions increase selection pressure for traits influencing fitness. However, projections of biological diversity under scenarios of climate change rarely consider evolutionary adaptive potential of natural species. In this study, we tested for mechanistic evidence of evolutionary thermal adaptation among ecologically divergent redband trout populations (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) in cardiorespiratory function, cellular response and genomic variation. In a common garden environment, fish from an extreme desert climate had significantly higher critical thermal maximum (p <.05) and broader optimum thermal window for aerobic scope (>3°C) than fish from cooler montane climate. In addition, the desert population had the highest maximum heart rate during warming (20% greater than montane populations), indicating improved capacity to deliver oxygen to internal tissues. In response to acute heat stress, distinct sets of cardiac genes were induced among ecotypes, which helps to explain the differences in cardiorespiratory function. Candidate genomic markers and genes underlying these physiological adaptations were also pinpointed, such as genes involved in stress response and metabolic activity (hsp40, ldh-b and camkk2). These markers were developed into a multivariate model that not only accurately predicted critical thermal maxima, but also evolutionary limit of thermal adaptation in these specific redband trout populations relative to the expected limit for the species. This study demonstrates mechanisms and limitations of an aquatic species to evolve under changing environments that can be incorporated into advanced models to predict ecological consequences of climate change for natural organisms. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Climate change is increasing global temperatures and intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme heat waves. How organisms will cope with these changes depends on their inherent thermal tolerance, acclimation capacity, and ability for evolutionary adaptation. Yet, the potential for adaptation of upper thermal tolerance in vertebrates is largely unknown. We artificially selected offspring from wild-caught zebrafish (Danio rerio) to increase (Up-selected) or decrease (Down-selected) upper thermal tolerance over six generations. Selection to increase upper thermal tolerance was also performed on warm-acclimated fish to test whether plasticity in the form of inducible warm tolerance also evolved. Upper thermal tolerance responded to selection in the predicted directions. However, compared to the control lines, the response was stronger in the Down-selected than in the Up-selected lines in which evolution toward higher upper thermal tolerance was slow (0.04 ± 0.008 °C per generation). Furthermore, the scope for plasticity resulting from warm acclimation decreased in the Up-selected lines. These results suggest the existence of a hard limit in upper thermal tolerance. Considering the rate at which global temperatures are increasing, the observed rates of adaptation and the possible hard limit in upper thermal tolerance suggest a low potential for evolutionary rescue in tropical fish living at the edge of their thermal limits. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 90

SP  - 1666-1677
AB  - Many species that are moving polewards encounter novel thermal regimes to which they have to adapt. Therefore, rapid evolution of thermal tolerance and of thermal plasticity in fitness-related traits in edge populations can be crucial for the success and speed of range expansions. We tested for adaptation in cold tolerance and in life history, behavioural and physiological traits and their thermal plasticity during a poleward range expansion. We reconstructed the thermal performance curves of life history (survival, growth and development rates), behaviour (food intake) and cold tolerance (chill coma recovery time) in the aquatic larval stage of the damselfly Ischnura elegans that is currently showing a poleward range expansion in northern Europe. We studied larvae from three edge and three core populations using a common-garden experiment. Consistent with the colder annual temperatures, larvae at the expansion front evolved an improved cold tolerance. The edge populations showed no overall (across temperatures) evolution of a faster life history that would improve their range-shifting ability. Moreover, consistent with damselfly edge populations from colder latitudes, edge populations evolved at the highest rearing temperature (28°C) a faster development rate, likely to better exploit the rare periods with higher temperatures. This was associated with a higher food intake and a lower metabolic rate. In conclusion, our results suggest that the edge populations rapidly evolved adaptive changes in trait means and thermal plasticity to the novel thermal conditions at the edge front. Our results highlight the importance of considering besides trait plasticity and the evolution of trait means, also the evolution of trait plasticity to improve forecasts of responses to climate change. © 2021 British Ecological Society

TI  - Replacing water and nutrients for ethanol production by ARTP derived biogas slurry tolerant Zymomonas mobilis strain
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Reducing fresh water consumption and nutrient addition will be an effective way to reduce the whole cost of bioethanol production. On the other hand, treatment of biogas slurry derived from anaerobic digestion (AD), in which a great amount of nutrients is still left, costs too much to remove these pollutants. It would be beneficial for both digestate valorization and ethanol production if biogas slurry is used for producing bioethanol. However, both hyperosmosis and potential biotoxic components of the biogas slurry can severely inhibit fermentation. Results: In this study, two rounds of atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis combined with adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) were applied to improve the adaptability and genetic stability of Zymomonas mobilis in biogas slurry. Mutants D95 and S912 were identified. Growth of the mutants was remarkably improved in biogas slurry. The highest ethanol productivity reached 0.63 g/L/h which was 61.7% higher than ZM4 (0.39 g/L/h). Genomic re-sequencing results also revealed that single nucleic variations (SNVs) and Indels occurred in the mutants, which are likely related to inhibitor in biogas slurry and low pH tolerance. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that these mutant strains have great potential to produce ethanol using biogas slurry to replace fresh water and nutrients. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Competitive history shapes rapid evolution in a seasonal climate
VL  - 118
IS  - 6
AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics will play a critical role in determining species' fates as climatic conditions change. Unfortunately, we have little understanding of how rapid evolutionary responses to climate play out when species are embedded in the competitive communities that they inhabit in nature. We tested the effects of rapid evolution in response to interspecific competition on subsequent ecological and evolutionary trajectories in a seasonally changing climate using a field-based evolution experiment with Drosophila melanogaster. Populations of D. melanogaster were either exposed, or not exposed, to interspecific competition with an invasive competitor, Zaprionus indianus, over the summer. We then quantified these populations' ecological trajectories (abundances) and evolutionary trajectories (heritable phenotypic change) when exposed to a cooling fall climate. We found that competition with Z. indianus in the summer affected the subsequent evolutionary trajectory of D. melanogaster populations in the fall, after all interspecific competition had ceased. Specifically, flies with a history of interspecific competition evolved under fall conditions to be larger and have lower cold fecundity and faster development than flies without a history of interspecific competition. Surprisingly, this divergent fall evolutionary trajectory occurred in the absence of any detectible effect of the summer competitive environment on phenotypic evolution over the summer or population dynamics in the fall. This study demonstrates that competitive interactions can leave a legacy that shapes evolutionary responses to climate even after competition has ceased, and more broadly, that evolution in response to one selective pressure can fundamentally alter evolution in response to subsequent agents of selection. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Experimental Evolution of Anticipatory Regulation in Escherichia coli
VL  - 12
AB  - Environmental cues in an ecological niche are often temporal in nature. For instance, in temperate climates, temperature is higher in daytime compared to during night. In response to these temporal cues, bacteria have been known to exhibit anticipatory regulation, whereby triggering response to a yet to appear cue. Such an anticipatory response in known to enhance Darwinian fitness, and hence, is likely an important feature of regulatory networks in microorganisms. However, the conditions under which an anticipatory response evolves as an adaptive response are not known. In this work, we develop a quantitative model to study response of a population to two temporal environmental cues, and predict variables which are likely important for evolution of anticipatory regulatory response. We follow this with experimental evolution of Escherichia coli in alternating environments of rhamnose and paraquat for ∼850 generations. We demonstrate that growth in this cyclical environment leads to evolution of anticipatory regulation. As a result, pre-exposure to rhamnose leads to a greater fitness in paraquat environment. Genome sequencing reveals that this anticipatory regulation is encoded via mutations in global regulators. Overall, our study contributes to understanding of how environment shapes the topology of regulatory networks in an organism. Copyright © 2022 Mahilkar, Venkataraman, Mall and Saini.

TI  - Post-introduction evolution of a rapid life-history strategy in a newly invasive plant
AB  - A central question in invasion biology is whether adaptive trait evolution following species introduction promotes invasiveness. A growing number of common-garden experiments document phenotypic differences between native- and introduced-range plants, suggesting that adaptive evolution in the new range may indeed contribute to the success of invasive plants. However, these studies are often subject to methodological pitfalls, resulting in weak evidence for post-introduction adaptive trait evolution and leaving its role in the invasion process uncertain. In a common-garden glasshouse study, we compared the growth, life-history, and reproductive traits of 35 native- and introduced-range Polygonum cespitosum populations. We used complementary approaches including climate-matching, standardizing parental conditions, selection analysis, and testing for trait–environment relationships to determine whether traits that increase invasiveness adaptively evolved in the species' new range. We found that the majority of introduced-range populations exhibited a novel trait syndrome consisting of a fast-paced life history and concomitant sparse, reduced growth form. Selection analysis confirmed that this trait syndrome led to markedly higher fitness (propagule production) over a limited growing season that was characteristic of regions within the introduced range. Additionally, several growth and reproductive traits showed temperature-based clines consistent with adaptive evolution in the new range. Combined, these results indicate that, subsequent to its introduction to North America over 100 generations ago, P. cespitosum has evolved key traits that maximize propagule production. These changes may in part explain the species' recent transition to invasiveness, illustrating how post-introduction evolution may contribute to the invasion process. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Temperature is an important environmental factor for life-history traits in poikilothermic animals. Many of experiments on evolution have been conducted using Drosophila species, and effects on life-history traits vary depending on the study. On the other hand, few studies have been conducted on the effects of temperature on life-history traits in the other insect species. In the present study, we reared adzuki bean beetles under two different temperatures, high and low, for 2 years (20 generations), and compared life-history traits including body size of females, fecundity, egg size, rate of egg hatching, emergence rate, development time, and wing length. No differences in responses were found in these traits between selection strains, except the rate of egg hatching. That is, the rates of egg hatching in high-temperature (32 °C) selection strains were significantly higher than those in low-temperature (24 °C) selection strains. We discuss the cause of change in egg hatchability during successive generations under different temperature treatments from the following viewpoints including evolutionary adaptation to high temperature and the experimental protocol. © 2019, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.

VL  - 29

SP  - 536-548
AB  - Evolve and Resquence (E&R) studies are a useful tool to study genomic processes during rapid adaptation, e.g., in the framework of adaptive responses to global climate change. We applied different thermal regimes to a natural Chironomus riparius (Diptera) population in an E&R framework to infer its evolutionary potential for rapid thermal adaptation. We exposed two replicates to three temperatures each (14°C, 20°C and 26°C) for more than two years, the experiment thus lasting 22, 44 or 65 generations, respectively. The two higher temperatures presented a priori moderate, respectively strong selection pressures. Life-cycle fitness tests revealed no appreciable adaptation to thermal regimes but a common adaptation of all six replicates probably due to the rearing conditions, presumably increased larval density and water quality. Genomic analyses showed a strong, genome-wide selective response in all replicates (mean s of selected SNPs = 0.305). This genomic response was significantly similar at all genomic levels among all replicates (SNPs, 10 kb windows, genes, exons, regions of elevated allele frequency change [REA]). The intersections among the replicates exposed to the same temperature were either insignificant or underrepresented. This confirmed a selective response to identical selection pressure(s), however, not to thermal regime. Genes closest to the SNP with the highest selection coefficient per REA were enriched for GO terms related to ion transport, regulation of transcription and signal transduction, which supported the presumed acting selection pressures. Our study showed the evolutionary potential for rapid adaptation by genome-wide and probably polygenic selection on standing genetic variation in C. riparius. However, because of the impossibility to accurately predict the acting selective regime in evolutionary experiments, we discuss the sobering perspectives for inferring the evolutionary potential of natural populations with this approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Thermodynamics of evolution and the origin of life
VL  - 119
IS  - 6
AB  - We outline a phenomenological theory of evolution and origin of life by combining the formalism of classical thermodynamics with a statistical description of learning. The maximum entropy principle constrained by the requirement for minimization of the loss function is employed to derive a canonical ensemble of organisms (population), the corresponding partition function (macroscopic counterpart of fitness), and free energy (macroscopic counterpart of additive fitness). We further define the biological counterparts of temperature (evolutionary temperature) as the measure of stochasticity of the evolutionary process and of chemical potential (evolutionary potential) as the amount of evolutionary work required to add a new trainable variable (such as an additional gene) to the evolving system. We then develop a phenomenological approach to the description of evolution, which involves modeling the grand potential as a function of the evolutionary temperature and evolutionary potential. We demonstrate how this phenomenological approach can be used to study the "ideal mutation" model of evolution and its generalizations. Finally, we show that, within this thermodynamics framework, major transitions in evolution, such as the transition from an ensemble of molecules to an ensemble of organisms, that is, the origin of life, can be modeled as a special case of bona fide physical phase transitions that are associated with the emergence of a new type of grand canonical ensemble and the corresponding new level of description. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - A century later: Adaptive plasticity and rapid evolution contribute to geographic variation in invasive mosquito fish
VL  - 726
AB  - One century after their introduction to Europe, eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) represent a natural experiment to determine the relative contributions of adaptive plasticity and rapid evolutionary change in creating large-scale geographic variation in phenotypes. We evaluated the population-genetic structure and invasion history based on allele length polymorphisms of 15 nuclear microsatellites, which we quantified for N=660 individuals from 23 populations sampled in 2013 across the invasive range of G. holbrooki in Europe. We analysed body-shape and life-history variation in N = 1331 individuals from 36 populations, sampled in 2013 and 2017, and tested heritability of phenotypic differences in a subset of four populations using a common-garden experiment. The genetic structure of wild-caught individuals suggested a single introduction for all European mosquitofish, which were genetically impoverished compared to their native counterparts. We found some convergent patterns of phenotypic divergence across native and invasive climatic gradients (e.g., increased body size in colder/more northern populations); however, several phenotypic responses were not consistent between sampling years, pointing towards plastic phenotypes. Our analysis of common-garden reared individuals uncovered moderate heritability estimates only for two measures of male body size (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.628 and 0.556) and offspring fat content (ICC=0.734), while suggesting high levels of plasticity inmost other phenotypic traits (ICC=0.407). Our results highlight the importance of phenotypic plasticity in invasive species during range expansions and demonstrate that strong selective pressures-in this case towards increased body size in colder environments-simultaneously promote rapid evolutionary divergence.

TI  - Constitutive up-regulation of Turandot genes rather than changes in acclimation ability is associated with the evolutionary adaptation to temperature fluctuations in Drosophila simulans
VL  - 104
SP  - 40-47
AB  - Most research on thermal adaptation of ectotherms is based on experiments performed at constant temperatures. However, for short-lived insects daily fluctuations of temperature could be an important environmental parameter involved in evolutionary adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to daily fluctuating temperatures. We studied replicated selection lines of Drosophila simulans evolved in a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime. Previous studies of these lines have shown clear acclimation benefits to heat tolerance induced by the fluctuating regime. First, we tested the existence of an evolved circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance in selected flies. This was done by investigating the daily variation in time to heat knockdown in flies from both selection regimes when exposed to either a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime for a single generation. While daily variation in heat resistance was found, the results suggest that there was neither an evolved adaptive circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance nor a continuous acclimation response induced by fluctuating temperatures in these lines. Second, in order to reveal functional candidates for adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to a high temperature exposure in flies from both regimes. We found that flies selected both in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes responded similarly to increasing temperature. However, we found that evolutionary adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime led to transcriptional enrichment of the GO terms eggshell chorion assembly and cellular response to heat. The latter category was constituted by a constitutive up-regulation of four Turandot genes and not heat shock protein genes, suggesting that Turandot genes could play a prominent role for adaptation to daily fluctuating thermal conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behaviour exhibit low heritability despite genetic divergence between lizard populations
VL  - 285
IS  - 1878
AB  - Ectothermic species are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and may adapt to changes in thermal environments through evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology or thermoregulatory behaviour. Nevertheless, the heritability of thermal traits, which sets a limit on evolutionary potential, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we captured brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) from two populations that occur in contrasting thermal environments. We raised offspring from these populations in a laboratory common garden and compared the shape of their thermal performance curves to test for genetic divergence in thermal physiology. Thermal performance curves differed between populations in a common garden in ways partially consistent with divergent patterns of natural selection experienced by the source populations, implying that they had evolved in response to selection. Next, we estimated the heritability of thermal performance curves and of several traits related to thermoregulatory behaviour. We did not detect significant heritability in most components of the thermal performance curve or in several aspects of thermoregulatory behaviour, suggesting that contemporary selection is unlikely to result in rapid evolution. Our results indicate that the response to selection may be slow in the brown anole and that evolutionary change is unlikely to keep pace with current rates of environmental change. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Genetic redundancy fuels polygenic adaptation in Drosophila
VL  - 17
IS  - 2
AB  - The genetic architecture of adaptive traits is of key importance to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are polygenic—i.e., result from selection on a large number of genetic loci—but most molecularly characterized traits have a simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs) across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent responses for several phenotypes—e.g., fitness, metabolic rate, and fat content—and a strong polygenic response (99 selected alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based on the heterogeneous genomic patterns among replicates. Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the experimental data better than simulations assuming independent selective sweeps. Our results show that natural D. simulans populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation facilitating rapid evolutionary responses using multiple alternative genetic pathways converging at a new phenotypic optimum. This key property of beneficial alleles requires the modification of testing strategies in natural populations beyond the search for convergence on the molecular level. © 2019 Barghi et al.

VL  - 29
IS  - 20
SP  - 3938-3953
AB  - Plasticity and evolution are two processes allowing populations to respond to environmental changes, but how both are related and impact each other remains controversial. We studied plastic and evolutionary responses in gene expression of Tribolium castaneum after exposure of the beetles to new environments that differed from ancestral conditions in temperature, humidity or both. Using experimental evolution with 10 replicated lines per condition, we were able to demonstrate adaptation after 20 generations. We measured whole-transcriptome gene expression with RNA-sequencing to infer evolutionary and plastic changes. We found more evidence for changes in mean expression (shift in the intercept of reaction norms) in adapted lines than for changes in plasticity (shifts in slopes). Plasticity was mainly preserved in selected lines and was responsible for a large part of the phenotypic divergence in expression between ancestral and new conditions. However, we found that genes with the largest evolutionary changes in expression also evolved reduced plasticity and often showed expression levels closer to the ancestral stage. Results obtained in the three different conditions were similar, suggesting that restoration of ancestral expression levels during adaptation is a general evolutionary pattern. With a larger sample in the most stressful condition, we were able to detect a positive correlation between the proportion of genes with reversion of the ancestral plastic response and mean fitness per selection line. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Improving tolerance and 1,3-propanediol production of Clostridium butyricum using physical mutagenesis, adaptive evolution and genome shuffling
VL  - 363
AB  - Bioconversion efficiency of glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) by Clostridium butyricum is bottlenecked by its low tolerance to various stressors, especially glycerol as the substrate, 1,3-PD as the end product, and butyric acid as a by-product, which eventually decreases 1,3-PD yield. This study aimed at improving the tolerance and 1,3-PD production capability of C. butyricum using random mutagenesis and evolutionary techniques. Mutagenesis of wild strain by atmospheric room temperature plasma (ARTP) provided the first population with maximum tolerance to 160 g/L glycerol, while microbial microdroplet culture system (MMC)-mediated adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) generated the second population with tolerance to 100 g/L 1,3-PD. Subsequently, genome shuffling of both populations yielded a final strain, GJH-418, which generated 60.12 g/L1,3-PD with a productivity of 1.72 g/L/h. The transcript analysis of the mutant and wild strains revealed the possible involvement of 8 genes in high tolerance and high 1,3-PD production through either up- or down-regulation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 72

SP  - 431-448
AB  - Dams and other anthropogenic barriers have caused global ecological and hydrological upheaval in the blink of the geological eye. In the present article, we synthesize 307 studies in a systematic review of contemporary evolution following reduced connectivity and habitat alteration on freshwater fishes. Genetic diversity loss was more commonly observed for small populations impounded in small habitat patches for many generations behind low-passability barriers. Studies show that impoundments can cause rapid adaptive evolution in migration timing, behavior, life history, temperature tolerance, and morphology, as well as reduce phenotypic variance, which can alter adaptive potential and ecological roles. Fish passage structures can restore migratory populations but also create artificial selection pressures on body size and migration. The accelerating pace of dam removals and the paucity of data for fishes other than salmonids, other vertebrates, invertebrates, and tropical and southern hemisphere organisms highlights the urgent need for more studies on the rapid evolutionary effects of dams. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Complete Genome Sequence of the Newly Developed Lactobacillus acidophilus Strain With Improved Thermal Adaptability
VL  - 12
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) is a representative probiotic and is widely used in many industrial products for its beneficial effects on human and animal health. This bacterium is exposed to harsh environments such as high temperatures for manufacturing industrial products, but cell yield under high temperatures is relatively low. To resolve this issue, we developed a new L. acidophilus strain with improved heat resistance while retaining the existing beneficial properties through the adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) method. The newly developed strain, L. acidophilus EG008, has improved the existing limit of thermal resistance from 65°C to 75°C. Furthermore, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative genome analysis of wild-type and EG008 strains to unravel the molecular mechanism of improved heat resistance. Interestingly, only two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were different compared to the L. acidophilus wild-type. We identified that one of these SNPs is a non-synonymous SNP capable of altering the structure of MurD protein through the 435th amino acid change from serine to threonine. We believe that these results will directly contribute to any industrial field where L. acidophilus is applied. In addition, these results make a step forward in understanding the molecular mechanisms of lactic acid bacteria evolution under extreme conditions. © Copyright © 2021 Jeon, Kim, Choi, Cho, Seo and Kim.

TI  - Changes in lipid classes of Drosophila melanogaster in response to selection for three stress traits
VL  - 117
AB  - Laboratory selection on environmental stress traits is an evolutionary approach that is informative in the context of understanding stress adaptation. Here we characterize changes in a lipidome of Drosophila melanogaster in lines selected for increased heat (elevated heat knockdown refractoriness), cold (decreased time to recover from chill-coma) and desiccation survival. Selection for desiccation resistance resulted in changes in multiple lipid classes used to characterize a lipidome. This included a decrease in triacylglycerols (TAGs) which is relevant to interpretation of storage lipid levels in previous D. melanogaster desiccation survival selection experiments. Chill-coma recovery rate selection was expected to show extensive changes in lipid classes, but only phosphatidic acids exhibited significant change. Selection for increased heat knockdown resistance resulted in a substantial change in the abundance of a class of lipids (diacylglycerols) which could play a role in mediating the heat shock response or result in an increase in neutral lipid mobilization. © 2019

TI  - Lactococcus lactis Mutants Obtained From Laboratory Evolution Showed Elevated Vitamin K2 Content and Enhanced Resistance to Oxidative Stress
VL  - 12
AB  - Vitamin K2 is an important vitamin for human health. Vitamin K2 enrichment in the human diet is possible by using vitamin K2-producing bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis in food fermentations. Based on previous observations that aerated cultivation conditions improved vitamin K2 content in L. lactis, we performed laboratory evolution on L. lactis MG1363 by cultivating this strain in a shake flask in a sequential propagation regime with transfers to a fresh medium every 72h. After 100 generations of propagation, we selected three evolved strains that showed improved stationary phase survival in oxygenated conditions. In comparison to the original strain MG1363, the evolved strains showed 50–110% increased vitamin K2 content and exhibited high resistance against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. Genome sequencing of the evolved strains revealed common mutations in the genes ldh and gapB. Proteomics analysis revealed overproduction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA), universal stress protein A2 (UspA2), and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (MutM) under aerated conditions in evolved strains, proteins with putative functions in redox reactions, universal stress response, and DNA damage repair, all of which could contribute to the enhanced oxidative stress resistance. The mechanisms underlying elevated vitamin K2 content in the evolved strains remain to be elucidated. Two out of the three evolved strains performed similar to the original strain MG1363 in terms of growth and acidification of culture media. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a natural selection approach without genetic manipulations to obtain vitamin K2 overproducers that are highly relevant for food applications and contributed to the understanding of oxidative stress resistance in L. lactis. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, de Groot, Boeren, Abee and Smid.

AB  - According to the metabolic theory of ecology, metabolic rate, an important indicator of the pace of life, varies with body mass and temperature as a result of internal physical constraints. However, various ecological factors may also affect metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Although reports of such effects on metabolic scaling usually focus on single factors, the possibility of significant interactive effects between multiple factors requires further study. In this study, we show that the effect of temperature on the ontogenetic scaling of resting metabolic rate of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus minus depends critically on habitat differences in predation regime. Increasing temperature tends to cause decreases in the metabolic scaling exponent (slope) in population samples from springs with fish predators, but increases in population samples from springs without fish. Accordingly, the temperature sensitivity of metabolic rate is not only size-specific, but also its relationship to body size shifts dramatically in response to fish predators. We hypothesize that the dampened effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of large adults in springs with fish, and of small juveniles in springs without fish are adaptive evolutionary responses to differences in the relative mortality risk of adults and juveniles in springs with versus without fish predators. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction among metabolic rate, body mass, temperature and predation regime. The intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature is not merely the result of physical constraints related to internal body design and biochemical kinetics, but rather is ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable. © 2020.

VL  - 25

SP  - 541-554
AB  - Although studies quantifying evolutionary change in response to the selective pressures that organisms face in the wild have demonstrated that organisms can evolve rapidly, we lack a systematic assessment of the frequency, magnitude and direction of rapid evolutionary change across taxa. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 studies that document the effects of warming, predation or competition on the evolution of body size, development rate or fecundity in natural or experimental animal populations. We tested whether there was a consistent effect of any selective agent on any trait, whether the direction of these effects align with theoretical predictions, and whether the three agents select in opposing directions on any trait. Overall, we found weak effects of all three selective agents on trait evolution: none of our nine traits by selective agent combinations had an overall effect that differed from zero, only 31% of studies had a significant within-study effect, and attributes of the included studies generally did not account for between-study variation in results. One notable exception was that predation targeting adults consistently resulted in the evolution of smaller prey body size. We discuss potential causes of these generally weak responses and consider how our results inform the ongoing development of eco-evolutionary research. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Are animals shrinking due to climate change? Temperature-mediated selection on body mass in mountain wagtails
VL  - 189
IS  - 3
SP  - 841-849
AB  - Climate change appears to affect body size of animals whose optimal size in part depends on temperature. However, attribution of observed body size changes to climate change requires an understanding of the selective pressures acting on body size under different temperatures. We examined the link between temperature and body mass in a population of mountain wagtails (Motacilla clara) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, between 1976 and 1999, where temperature increased by 0.18 ∘C. The wagtails became lighter by 0.035 g per year. Partitioning this trend, we found that only a small part of the effect (0.009 g/year) was due to individuals losing weight and a large part (0.027 g/year) was due to lighter individuals replacing heavier ones. Only the latter component was statistically significant. Apparently, the wagtails were reacting to selection for reduced weight. Examining survival, we found that selection was temperature-mediated, i.e., lighter individuals survived better under high temperatures, whereas heavier individuals survived better under low temperatures. Our results thus support the hypothesis that temperature drove the decline in body mass in this wagtail population and provides one of the first demonstrations of the selective forces underlying such trends. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Understanding how natural populations will respond to rapid anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest challenges for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Much research has focussed on whether physiological traits can evolve quickly enough under rapidly increasing temperatures. While the simple Breeder's equation helps to understand how extreme temperatures and genetic variation might drive within-population evolution under climate change, it does not consider two key areas: how different forms of phenotypic plasticity interact and variation among populations. Plasticity can modify the exposure to climatic extremes and the strength of selection from those extremes, while differences among populations provide adaptive diversity not apparent within them. Here, we focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, with a case study on a tropical lizard, demonstrate the complex interplay between spatial, genetic and plastic contributions to variation in climate-relevant physiological traits. We identify several problems that need to be better understood: which traits are under selection in a changing climate; the different forms of plasticity relevant to population persistence and rapid evolution; plastic versus genetic contributions to geographic variation in climate-associated traits and whether plasticity can be harnessed to promote persistence of species. Given ongoing uncertainties around whether natural populations can evolve rapidly enough to persist, we advocate the use of field trials aimed at increasing rates of adaptation, especially in systems known to be strongly impacted by human-driven changes in climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Catullo and colleagues discuss the complexities of how terrestrial animals might evolve and adapt under rapidly changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 14

SP  - 203-217
AB  - The globally dominant N2-fixing cyanobacteria Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera provide vital nitrogen supplies to subtropical and tropical oceans, but little is known about how they will be affected by long-term ocean warming. We tested their thermal responses using experimental evolution methods during 2 years of selection at optimal (28°C), supra-optimal (32°C) and suboptimal (22°C) temperatures. After several hundred generations under thermal selection, changes in growth parameters, as well as N and C fixation rates, suggested that Trichodesmium did not adapt to the three selection temperature regimes during the 2-year evolution experiment, but could instead rapidly and reversibly acclimate to temperature shifts from 20°C to 34°C. In contrast, over the same timeframe apparent thermal adaptation was observed in Crocosphaera, as evidenced by irreversible phenotypic changes as well as whole-genome sequencing and variant analysis. Especially under stressful warming conditions (34°C), 32°C-selected Crocosphaera cells had an advantage in survival and nitrogen fixation over cell lines selected at 22°C and 28°C. The distinct strategies of phenotypic plasticity versus irreversible adaptation in these two sympatric diazotrophs are both viable ways to maintain fitness despite long-term temperature changes, and so could help to stabilize key ocean nitrogen cycle functions under future warming scenarios. © 2022 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Rapid adaptive evolution of the diapause program during range expansion of an invasive mosquito
VL  - 74
IS  - 7
SP  - 1451-1465
AB  - In temperate climates, the recurring seasonal exigencies of winter represent a fundamental physiological challenge for a wide range of organisms. In response, many temperate insects enter diapause, an alternative developmental program, including developmental arrest, that allows organisms to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal environmental variation. Geographic variation in diapause phenology contributing to local climatic adaptation is well documented. However, few studies have examined how the rapid evolution of a suite of traits expressed across the diapause program may contribute to climatic adaptation on a contemporary timescale. Here, we investigate the evolution of the diapause program over the past 35 years by leveraging a “natural experiment” presented by the recent invasion of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, across the eastern United States. We sampled populations from two distinct climatic regions separated by 6° of latitude (∼700 km). Using common-garden experiments, we identified regional genetic divergence in diapause-associated cold tolerance, diapause duration, and postdiapause starvation tolerance. We also found regional divergence in nondiapause thermal performance. In contrast, we observed minimal regional divergence in nondiapause larval growth traits and at neutral molecular marker loci. Our results demonstrate rapid evolution of the diapause program and imply strong selection caused by differences in winter conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 10

SP  - 1998-2006
AB  - Reproduction and related traits such as mating success are strongly affected by thermal stress. We tested direct and correlated responses to artificial selection in replicated lines of Drosophila buzzatii that were selected for mating success at high temperature. Knockdown resistance at high temperature (KRHT) and chill-coma recovery (CCR) were tested as correlated selection responses. Virgin flies were allowed to mate for four hours at 33°C in three replicated lines (S lines) to obtain the selected flies and then returned at 25°C to lay eggs. Other three replicated lines were maintained at 25°C without any selection as control (C lines). After 15 selection generations, KRHT and CCR were measured. Both traits were assessed in flies that did not receive any hardening pretreatments as well as in flies that were either heat or cold hardened. Thermotolerance traits showed significant correlated responses with higher KRHT in S than in C lines, both with a heat-hardening pretreatment and without a heat-hardening pretreatment. CCR time was longer in S than in C lines both with a cold-hardening pretreatment and without a cold-hardening pretreatment. Hardening treatments improved both KRHT and CCR in all cases excepting KRHT in C lines. Overall, KRHT and CCR showed an antagonistic pattern of correlated responses to our selection regime, suggesting either pleiotropy or tightly linked trait-specific genes partially affecting KRHT and CCR. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Assessing whether trait variations among individuals are consistent over time and among environmental conditions is crucial to understand evolutionary responses to new selective pressures such as climate change. According to the universal thermal dependence hypothesis, thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate should not vary strongly and consistently among organisms, implying limited evolutionary response for metabolic traits under climate change. However, this hypothesis has been rarely tested at an individual level, leaving a gap in our understanding of climate change impacts on metabolic responses and their potential evolution. Using the amphipod Gammarus fossarum, we investigated the variability and repeatability of individual metabolic thermal reaction norms over time. We found large variations in both the thermal sensitivity (i.e. slope) and expression level (i.e. intercept) of individual metabolic reaction norms. Moreover, differences among individuals were consistent over time, and therefore repeatable. Inter-individual variations in body mass resulted in a high repeatability of metabolic expression level but had no significant effect on the repeatability of thermal sensitivity. Overall, our results highlight that inter-individual variability and repeatability of thermal reaction norms can be substantial. We conclude that these consistent differences among individuals should not be overlooked when apprehending the ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Coral reefs are rapidly declining because of widespread mass coral bleaching causing extensive coral mortality. Elevated seawater temperatures are the main drivers of coral bleaching, and climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of destructive marine heatwaves. Efforts to enhance coral thermal bleaching tolerance can be targeted at the coral host or at coral-associated microorganisms (e.g., dinoflagellate endosymbionts and bacteria). The literature on experimental evolution of bacteria suggests that it has value as a tool to increase coral climate resilience. We provide a workflow on how to experimentally evolve coral-associated bacteria to confer thermal tolerance to coral hosts and emphasize the value of implementing this approach in coral reef conservation and restoration efforts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand what factors affect the repeatability of adaptive outcomes. To better understand the role of temperature in determining the repeatability of adaptive trajectories, we evolved populations of different genotypes of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila at low and high temperatures and followed changes in growth rate over 6,500 generations. As expected, growth rate increased with a decelerating rate for all populations; however, there were differences in the patterns of evolution at the two temperatures. The growth rates of the different genotypes tended to converge as evolution proceeded at both temperatures, but this convergence was quicker and more pronounced at the higher temperature. Additionally, over the first 4,000 generations we found greater repeatability of evolution, in terms of change in growth rate, among replicates of the same genotype at the higher temperature. Finally, we found limited evidence of trade-offs in fitness between temperatures, and an asymmetry in the correlated responses, whereby evolution in a high temperature increases growth rate at the lower temperature significantly more than the reverse. These results demonstrate the importance of temperature in determining the repeatability of evolutionary trajectories for the eukaryotic microbe Tetrahymena thermophila and may provide clues to how temperature affects evolution more generally. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Meiotic recombination plays a critical evolutionary role in maintaining fitness in response to selective pressures due to changing environments. Variation in recombination rate has been observed amongst and between species and populations and within genomes across numerous taxa. Studies have demonstrated a link between changes in recombination rate and selection, but the extent to which fine-scale recombination rate varies between evolved populations during the evolutionary period in response to selection is under active research. Here, we utilize a set of 3 temperature-evolved Drosophila melanogaster populations that were shown to have diverged in several phenotypes, including recombination rate, based on the temperature regime in which they evolved. Using whole-genome sequencing data from these populations, we generated linkage disequilibrium-based fine-scale recombination maps for each population. With these maps, we compare recombination rates and patterns among the 3 populations and show that they have diverged at fine scales but are conserved at broader scales. We further demonstrate a correlation between recombination rates and genomic variation in the 3 populations. Lastly, we show variation in localized regions of enhanced recombination rates, termed warm spots, between the populations with these warm spots and associated genes overlapping areas previously shown to have diverged in the 3 populations due to selection. These data support the existence of recombination modifiers in these populations which are subject to selection during evolutionary change. © The Author(s) 2022.

VL  - 116
SP  - 77-89
AB  - Selection experiments offer an efficient way to study the evolvability of traits that play an important role in insects’ reproduction and/or survival and to trace correlations and trade-offs between them. We have exercised bi-directional selection on Drosophila montana flies’ pre-adult development time under constant light and temperature conditions for 10 generations and traced the indirect effects of this selection on females’ diapause induction under different day lengths, as well as on the body weight and cold tolerance of both sexes. Overall, selection was successful towards slow, but not towards fast development. However, all fast selection line replicates showed at the end of selection increased variance in females’ photoperiodic diapause response and about one hour increase in the critical day (CDL), where more than 50% of emerging females enter diapause. Indirect effects of selection on flies’ body weight and cold-tolerance were less clear, as the flies of the slow selection line were significantly heavier and less cold-tolerant than the control line flies after five generations of selection, but lighter and more cold-tolerant at the end of selection. Changes in females’ diapause induction resulting from selection for fast development could be due to common metabolic pathways underlying these traits, collaboration of circadian clock and photoperiodic timer and/or by the interaction between the endocrine and circadian systems. © 2019

TI  - Thermal evolution offsets the elevated toxicity of a contaminant under warming: A resurrection study in Daphnia magna
VL  - 11

AB  - Synergistic interactions between temperature and contaminants are a major challenge for ecological risk assessment, especially under global warming. While thermal evolution may increase the ability to deal with warming, it is unknown whether it may also affect the ability to deal with the many contaminants that are more toxic at higher temperatures. We investigated how evolution of genetic adaptation to warming affected the interactions between warming and a novel stressor: zinc oxide nanoparticles (nZnO) in a natural population of Daphnia magna using resurrection ecology. We hatched resting eggs from two D. magna subpopulations (old: 1955–1965, recent: 1995–2005) from the sediment of a lake that experienced an increase in average temperature and in recurrence of heat waves but was never exposed to industrial waste. In the old “ancestral” subpopulation, exposure to a sublethal concentration of nZnO decreased the intrinsic growth rate, metabolic activity, and energy reserves at 24°C but not at 20°C, indicating a synergism between warming and nZnO. In contrast, these synergistic effects disappeared in the recent “derived” subpopulation that evolved a lower sensitivity to nZnO at 24°C, which indicates that thermal evolution could offset the elevated toxicity of nZnO under warming. This evolution of reduced sensitivity to nZnO under warming could not be explained by changes in the total internal zinc accumulation but was partially associated with the evolution of the expression of a key metal detoxification gene under warming. Our results suggest that the increased sensitivity to the sublethal concentration of nZnO under the predicted 4°C warming by the end of this century may be counteracted by thermal evolution in this D. magna population. Our results illustrate the importance of evolution to warming in shaping the responses to another anthropogenic stressor, here a contaminant. More general, genetic adaptation to an environmental stressor may ensure that synergistic effects between contaminants and this environmental stressor will not be present anymore. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Climate plays a key role in shaping population trends and determining the geographic distribution of species because of limits in species’ thermal tolerance. An evaluation of species tolerance to temperature change can therefore help predict their potential spatial shifts and population trends triggered by ongoing global warming. We assessed inter- and intraspecific variations in heat resistance in relation to body mass, local mean temperatures, and evolutionary relationships in 39 bumblebee species, a major group of pollinators in temperate and cold ecosystems, across 3 continents, 6 biomes, and 20 regions (2386 male specimens). Based on experimental bioassays, we measured the time before heat stupor of bumblebee males at a heatwave temperature of 40 °C. Interspecific variability was significant, in contrast to interpopulational variability, which was consistent with heat resistance being a species-specific trait. Moreover, cold-adapted species are much more sensitive to heat stress than temperate and Mediterranean species. Relative to their sensitivity to extreme temperatures, our results help explain recent population declines and range shifts in bumblebees following climate change. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology

VL  - 13

SP  - 768-780
AB  - Temperature plays a multidimensional role in host–pathogen interactions. As an important element of climate change, elevated world temperature resulting from global warming presents new challenges to sustainable disease management. Knowledge of pathogen adaptation to global warming is needed to predict future disease epidemiology and formulate mitigating strategies. In this study, 21 Phytophthora infestans isolates originating from seven thermal environments were acclimated for 200 days under stepwise increase or decrease of experimental temperatures and evolutionary responses of the isolates to the thermal changes were evaluated. We found temperature acclimation significantly increased the fitness and genetic adaptation of P. infestans isolates at both low and high temperatures. Low-temperature acclimation enforced the countergradient adaptation of the pathogen to its past selection and enhanced the positive association between the pathogen's intrinsic growth rate and aggressiveness. At high temperatures, we found that pathogen growth collapsed near the maximum temperature for growth, suggesting a thermal niche boundary may exist in the evolutionary adaptation of P. infestans. These results indicate that pathogens can quickly adapt to temperature shifts in global warming. If this is associated with environmental conditions favoring pathogen spread, it will threaten future food security and human health and require the establishment of mitigating actions. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Evolutionary trade-offs between heat and cold tolerance limit responses to fluctuating climates
VL  - 8
IS  - 21
AB  - The evolutionary potential of species to cope with short-term temperature fluctuations during reproduction is critical to predicting responses to future climate change. Despite this, vertebrate research has focused on reproduction under high or low temperatures in relatively stable temperate climates. Here, we characterize the genetic basis of reproductive thermal tolerance to temperature fluctuations in the ostrich, which lives in variable environments in tropical and subtropical Africa. Both heat and cold tolerance were under selection and heritable, indicating the potential for evolutionary responses to mean temperature change. However, we found evidence for a negative, genetic correlation between heat and cold tolerance that should limit the potential for adaptation to fluctuating temperatures. Genetic constraints between heat and cold tolerance appear a crucial, yet underappreciated, factor influencing responses to climate change. Copyright © 2022 The Authors, some rights reserved.

TI  - Insect responses to heat: physiological mechanisms, evolution and ecological implications in a warming world
VL  - 95
IS  - 3
SP  - 802-821
AB  - Surviving changing climate conditions is particularly difficult for organisms such as insects that depend on environmental temperature to regulate their physiological functions. Insects are extremely threatened by global warming, since many do not have enough physiological tolerance even to survive continuous exposure to the current maximum temperatures experienced in their habitats. Here, we review literature on the physiological mechanisms that regulate responses to heat and provide heat tolerance in insects: (i) neuronal mechanisms to detect and respond to heat; (ii) metabolic responses to heat; (iii) thermoregulation; (iv) stress responses to tolerate heat; and (v) hormones that coordinate developmental and behavioural responses at warm temperatures. Our review shows that, apart from the stress response mediated by heat shock proteins, the physiological mechanisms of heat tolerance in insects remain poorly studied. Based on life-history theory, we discuss the costs of heat tolerance and the potential evolutionary mechanisms driving insect adaptations to high temperatures. Some insects may deal with ongoing global warming by the joint action of phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. Plastic responses are limited and may not be by themselves enough to withstand ongoing warming trends. Although the evidence is still scarce and deserves further research in different insect taxa, genetic adaptation to high temperatures may result from rapid evolution. Finally, we emphasize the importance of incorporating physiological information for modelling species distributions and ecological interactions under global warming scenarios. This review identifies several open questions to improve our understanding of how insects respond physiologically to heat and the evolutionary and ecological consequences of those responses. Further lines of research are suggested at the species, order and class levels, with experimental and analytical approaches such as artificial selection, quantitative genetics and comparative analyses. © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society

TI  - Invasive fish retain plasticity of naturally selected, but diverge in sexually selected traits
VL  - 811
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) have become a major threat to ecosystems worldwide. From an evolutionary ecological perspective, they allow teasing apart the relative contributions of plasticity and evolutionary divergence in driving rapid phenotypic diversification. When IAS spread across extensive geographic ranges, climatic variation may represent a source of strong natural selection through overwinter mortality and summer heat stress. This could favour local adaptation, i.e., evolutionary divergence of certain traits. IAS, however, are likely to show plasticity in survival-related traits, and environmental fluctuation in their new distribution range could favour the maintenance of this pre-existing phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, sexually selected traits are more likely to undergo evolutionary divergence when components of sexual selection differ geographically. Here, using data from a common-garden rearing experiment of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, 1853) from five populations across the species' invasive range in China, we show that invasive mosquitofish have retained plasticity in key physiological (thermal tolerances), morphological and life-history traits even 100 years after their introduction to China, but exhibit heritable population differences in several sexually selected traits, including the shape of the male copulatory organ. Adaptive plasticity of traits linked to immediate survival in different thermal environments—while likely responsible for the species' extraordinary invasion success—could slow down genetic evolution. Several sexually selected traits could diverge geographically and show rapid evolutionary change, e.g., because climate alters selective landscapes arising from mate competition as an indirect consequence of variation in overwinter mortality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contemporary global change is altering ecosystems at an unprecedented pace and scale. This critical period is a crisis for biodiversity, but the perturbations caused by global environmental change also offer new opportunities to study the evolution of species boundaries—their persistence, formation, or collapse—over rapid evolutionary timescales. Increasing temperature means and fluctuations have the potential to alter gene flow between species through changes in species distributions, interactions, life history, and temperature-dependent behavior. This is particularly true for insects, whose geographic ranges, behaviors, and life history traits are temperature dependent. Here, we review the potential for climate change to influence gene flow and species boundaries between closely related insect species. We focus on studies that have tracked changes in climate and insect distributions and/or have evaluated temperature dependent reproductive barriers between species. © 2019 Larson, Tinghitella and Taylor.

VL  - 33

SP  - 1677-1688
AB  - Sexual dimorphism in life history traits and their trade-offs is widespread among sexually reproducing animals and is strongly influenced by the differences in reproductive strategies between the sexes. We investigated how intrasexual competition influenced specific life history traits, important to fitness and their trade-offs in the outcrossing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. Here, we altered the strength of sex-specific selection through experimental evolution with increased potential for intrasexual competition by skewing the adult sex ratio towards either females or males (1:10 or 10:1) over 30 generations and subsequently measured the phenotypic response to selection in three traits related to fitness: body size, fecundity and tolerance to heat stress. We observed a greater evolutionary change in females than males for body size and peak fitness, suggesting that females may experience stronger net selection and potentially harbour higher amounts of standing genetic variance compared to males. Our study highlights the importance of investigating direct and indirect effects of intrasexual competition in both sexes in order to capture sex-specific responses and understand the evolution of sexual dimorphism in traits expressed by both sexes. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Gill surface area provides a clue for the respiratory basis of brain size in the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus)
VL  - 99
IS  - 3
SP  - 990-998
AB  - Brain size varies dramatically, both within and across species, and this variation is often believed to be the result of trade-offs between the cognitive benefits of having a large brain for a given body size and the energetic cost of sustaining neural tissue. One potential consequence of having a large brain is that organisms must also meet the associated high energetic demands. Thus, a key question is whether metabolic rate correlates with brain size. However, using metabolic rate to measure energetic demand yields a relatively instantaneous and dynamic measure of energy turnover, which is incompatible with the longer evolutionary timescale of changes in brain size within and across species. Morphological traits associated with oxygen consumption, specifically gill surface area, have been shown to be correlates of oxygen demand and energy use, and thus may serve as integrated correlates of these processes, allowing us to assess whether evolutionary changes in brain size correlate with changes in longer-term oxygen demand and energy use. We tested how brain size relates to gill surface area in the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus. First, we examined whether the allometric slope of brain mass (i.e., the rate that brain mass changes with body mass) is lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area across ontogeny. Second, we tested whether gill surface area explains variation in brain mass, after accounting for the effects of body mass on brain mass. We found that brain mass and gill surface area both had positive allometric slopes, with larger individuals having both larger brains and larger gill surface areas compared to smaller individuals. However, the allometric slope of brain mass was lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area, consistent with our prediction that the allometric slope of gill surface area could pose an upper limit to the allometric slope of brain mass. Finally, after accounting for body mass, individuals with larger brains tended to have larger gill surface areas. Together, our results provide clues as to how fishes may evolve and maintain large brains despite their high energetic cost, suggesting that C. limbatus individuals with a large gill surface area for their body mass may be able to support a higher energetic turnover, and, in turn, a larger brain for their body mass. © 2021 Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

TI  - Climatic factors and species range position predict sexually antagonistic selection across taxa
VL  - 373
IS  - 1757
AB  - Sex differences in selection are ubiquitous in sexually reproducing organisms. When the genetic basis of traits is shared between the sexes, such sexually antagonistic selection (SAS) creates a potential constraint on adaptive evolution. Theory and laboratory experiments suggest that environmental variation and the degree of local adaptation may all affect the frequency and intensity of SAS. Here, we capitalize on a large database of over 700 spatially or temporally replicated estimates of sex-specific phenotypic selection from wild populations, combined with data on microclimates and geographical range information. We performed a meta-analysis to test three predictions from SAS theory, that selection becomes more concordant between males and females: (1) in more stressful environments, (2) in more variable environments and (3) closer to the edge of the species' range. We find partial empirical support for all three predictions. Within-study analyses indicate SAS decreases in extreme environments, as indicated by a relationship with maximum temperature, minimum precipitation and evaporative potential (PET). Across studies, we found that the average level of SAS at high latitudes was lower, where environmental conditions are typically less stable. Finally, we found evidence for reduced SAS in populations that are far from the centre of their geographical range. However, and notably, we also found some evidence of reduced average strength of selection in these populations, which is in contrast to predictions from classical theoretical models on range limit evolution. Our results suggest that environmental lability and species range position predictably influence sex-specific selection and sexual antagonism in the wild.

TI  - Integrating high cell density cultures with adapted laboratory evolution for improved Gag-HA virus-like particles production in stable insect cell lines
VL  - 118

SP  - 2536-2547
AB  - Stable insect cell lines are emerging as an alternative to the insect cell-baculovirus expression vector system (IC-BEVS) for protein expression, benefiting from being a virus-free, nonlytic system. Still, the titers achieved are considerably lower. In this study, stable insect (Sf-9 and High Five) cells producing Gag virus-like particles (VLPs) were first adapted to grow under hypothermic culture conditions (22°C instead of standard 27°C), and then pseudotyped with a model membrane protein (influenza hemagglutinin [HA]) for expression of Gag-HA VLPs. Adaptation to lower temperature led to an increase in protein titers of up to 12-fold for p24 (as proxy for Gag-VLP) and sixfold for HA, with adapted Sf-9 cells outperforming High Five cells. Resulting Gag-HA VLPs producer Sf-9 cells were cultured to high cell densities, that is, 100 × 106 cell/ml, using perfusion (ATF® 2) in 1 L stirred-tank bioreactors. Specific p24 and HA production rates were similar to those of batch culture, enabling to increase volumetric titers by 7–8-fold without compromising the assembly of Gag-HA VLPs. Importantly, the antigen (HA) quantity in VLPs generated using stable adapted cells in perfusion was ≈5-fold higher than that from IC-BEVS, with the added benefit of being a baculovirus-free system. This study demonstrates the potential of combining stable expression in insect cells adapted to hypothermic culture conditions with perfusion for improving Gag-HA VLPs production. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

TI  - Pest defences under weak selection exert a limited influence on the evolution of height growth and drought avoidance in marginal pine populations
VL  - 289
IS  - 1982
AB  - While droughts, intensified by climate change, have been affecting forests worldwide, pest epidemics are a major source of uncertainty for assessing drought impacts on forest trees. Thus far, little information has documented the adaptability and evolvability of traits related to drought and pests simultaneously. We conducted common-garden experiments to investigate how several phenotypic traits (i.e. height growth, drought avoidance based on water-use efficiency inferred from δ13C and pest resistance based on defence traits) interact in five mature lodgepole pine populations established in four progeny trials in western Canada. The relevance of interpopulation variation in climate sensitivity highlighted that seed-source warm populations had greater adaptive capability than cold populations. In test sites, warming generated taller trees with higher δ13C and increased the evolutionary potential of height growth and δ13C across populations. We found, however, no pronounced gradient in defences and their evolutionary potential along populations or test sites. Response to selection was weak in defences across test sites, but high for height growth particularly at warm test sites. Response to the selection of δ13C varied depending on its selective strength relative to height growth. We conclude that warming could promote the adaptability and evolvability of growth response and drought avoidance with a limited evolutionary influence from pest (biotic) pressures. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Extreme climate shifts pest dominance hierarchy through thermal evolution and transgenerational plasticity
VL  - 35
IS  - 7
SP  - 1524-1537
AB  - Dominance hierarchy, the dominance ranking of members in a community, is determined by the relative population fitness of coexisting species. Climate change can shift dominance hierarchies depending on how species respond to changing climate, but ecological mechanisms underlying such shifts remain largely unknown. Specifically, dominance hierarchy shifts under climate change have rarely been linked to eco-evolutionary responses to thermal extremes, which we consider in this study. We conducted an 8-year field survey to link extreme high-temperature events to the shift in dominance hierarchy of two worldwide cereal aphid species (Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae), which may respond rapidly through evolutionary or plastic responses to thermal extremes due to their short generation duration, clonal structure and high thermal sensitivity. To further understand the mechanism involved in this change in species' dominance, we characterised aphid heat tolerance and demography of the two species sourced from relatively mild (Xinxiang) and hot (Wuhan) locations in a common garden design and compared the same measures in up- and down-selected lines of the two aphid species. We found that accumulation of extreme high-temperature events (EHTs) affected per capita growth rate of S. avenae but not R. padi, driving a shift in annual relative dominance of these two common species in wheat fields. Furthermore, evidence from common garden tests and artificial thermal selection revealed that evolutionary and plastic changes in thermal tolerance under EHTs were species-dependent; R. padi evolved higher heat tolerance without reducing fitness while S. avenae did not evolve heat tolerance but showed detrimental transgenerational plastic changes under thermal extremes. Rhopalosiphum padi may take over the dominant position of S. avenae in a warmer future, due to a higher evolutionary potential of heat tolerance and less detrimental plasticity following selection. Field surveys and laboratory experiments together point to a shift in species dominance related to interspecific differences in species' evolutionary rates and transgenerational plasticity of thermal traits during selection events associated with extreme climatic conditions. This study highlights that eco-evolutionary dynamics can contribute to community responses to natural thermal extremes.

TI  - An enhanced adaptive differential evolution algorithm for parameter extraction of photovoltaic models
VL  - 205
AB  - Parameter extraction of photovoltaic models based on measured current-voltage data plays an important role in the simulation, control, and optimization of photovoltaic systems. Although many parameter extraction techniques have been devoted to solving this problem, they may suffer from some deficiencies. In this paper, an enhanced adaptive differential evolution algorithm is proposed to extract photovoltaic parameters fast, accurately and reliably. In proposed method, the crossover rate sorting mechanism is introduced to assign each individual to an adapted crossover rate value according to their fitness values, which allows good elements to be more inherited in next generation. In addition, a dynamic population reduction strategy is used to improve the convergence speed and balance the exploration and exploitation. The performance of proposed method is confirmed by extracting parameters of different photovoltaic models, i.e., single diode, double diode, and photovoltaic modules. The simulated results show that the proposed method exhibits competitive performance on accuracy, reliability and convergence speed compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the test results on experimental data from the manufacturers data sheet also indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior solutions at different irradiance and temperature. Therefore, the proposed method can be an effective and efficient alternative for parameter extraction of photovoltaic models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Transcriptomics and fitness data reveal adaptive plasticity of thermal tolerance in oysters inhabiting different tidal zones
VL  - 9
AB  - Fine-scale adaptive evolution is always constrained by strong gene flow at vertical level in marine organisms. Rapid environmental fluctuations and phenotypic plasticity through optimization of fitness-related traits in organisms play important roles in shaping intraspecific divergence. The coastal systems experience strong variations in multiple abiotic environmental factors, especially the temperature. We used a typical intertidal species, Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), to investigate the interaction between plasticity and adaptive evolution. We collected intertidal and subtidal oysters from two ecological niches and carried out common garden experiments for one generation. We identified fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence between intertidal and subtidal F1 progeny at both sites, based on different hierarchical phenotypes, including morphological, physiological, and molecular traits. We further quantified the global plasticity to thermal stress through transcriptomic analysis. The intertidal oysters exhibited slow growth rate. However, they showed high survival and metabolic rates under heat stress, indicating vertically fine-scale phenotypic adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary trade-offs between growth and thermal tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the intertidal oysters have evolved high plasticity. The genes were classified into three types: evolutionarily divergent, concordantly plastic, and adaptive plastic genes. The evolved divergence between intertidal and subtidal oysters for these gene sets showed a significant positive correlation with plastic changes of subtidal populations in response to high temperature. Furthermore, the intertidal oysters exhibited delayed large-scale increase in expressional plasticity than that in subtidal counterparts. The same direction between plasticity and selection suggests that the oysters have evolved adaptive plasticity. This implies that adaptive plasticity facilitates the oyster to adapt to severe intertidal zones. The oysters exposed to strong environmental variability are thermal tolerant and have high adaptive potential to face the current global warming. Our findings will not only provide new insights into the significant role of plasticity in adaptive evolution that can be extended to other marine invertebrates, but also provide basic information for oyster resources conservation and reef reestablishment. © 2018 Li, Li, Wang, Song and Zhang.

TI  - Genetics and Plasticity Are Responsible for Ecogeographical Patterns in a Recent Invasion
VL  - 13
AB  - Patterns of covariation between phenotype and environment are presumed to be reflective of local adaptation, and therefore translate to a meaningful influence on an individual’s overall fitness within that specific environment. However, these environmentally driven patterns may be the result of numerous and interacting processes, such as genetic variation, epigenetic variation, or plastic non-heritable variation. Understanding the relative importance of different environmental variables on underlying genetic patterns and resulting phenotypes is fundamental to understanding adaptation. Invasive systems are excellent models for such investigations, given their propensity for rapid evolution. This study uses reduced representation sequencing data paired with phenotypic data to examine whether important phenotypic traits in invasive starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) within Australia appear to be highly heritable (presumably genetic) or appear to vary with environmental gradients despite underlying genetics (presumably non-heritable plasticity). We also sought to determine which environmental variables, if any, play the strongest role shaping genetic and phenotypic patterns. We determined that environmental variables—particularly elevation—play an important role in shaping allelic trends in Australian starlings and may also reinforce neutral genetic patterns resulting from historic introduction regime. We examined a range of phenotypic traits that appear to be heritable (body mass and spleen mass) or negligibly heritable (e.g. beak surface area and wing length) across the starlings’ Australian range. Using SNP variants associated with each of these phenotypes, we identify key environmental variables that correlate with genetic patterns, specifically that temperature and precipitation putatively play important roles shaping phenotype in this species. Finally, we determine that overall phenotypic variation is correlated with underlying genetic variation, and that these interact positively with the level of vegetation variation within a region, suggesting that ground cover plays an important role in shaping selection and plasticity of phenotypic traits within the starlings of Australia.

TI  - Climate change and green sea turtle sex ratio—preventing possible extinction
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
AB  - Climate change poses a threat to species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). A recent study on green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) at the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) showed a highly female-skewed sex ratio with almost all juvenile turtles being female. This shortage of males might eventually cause population extinction, unless rapid evolutionary rescue, migration, range shifts, or conservation efforts ensure a sufficient number of males. We built a stochastic individual-based model inspired by C. mydas but potentially transferrable to other species with TSD. Pivotal temperature, nest depth, and shading were evolvable traits. Additionally, we considered the effect of crossbreeding between northern and southern GBR, nest site philopatry, and conservation efforts. Among the evolvable traits, nest depth was the most likely to rescue the population, but even here the warmer climate change scenarios led to extinction. We expected turtles to choose colder beaches under rising temperatures, but surprisingly, nest site philopatry did not improve persistence. Conservation efforts promoted population survival and did not preclude trait evolution. Although extra information is needed to make reliable predictions for the fate of green sea turtles, our results illustrate how evolution can shape the fate of long lived, vulnerable species in the face of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.

VL  - 35

SP  - 1735-1744
AB  - While there is evidence of genetic and phenotypic responses to climate change, few studies have demonstrated change in functional traits with a known genetic basis. Here we present evidence for an evolutionary adaptive response to elevated temperatures in freshwater populations of the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. Using a unique set of historical data and museum specimens, in combination with contemporary samples, we fitted a Bayesian spatial model to identify a population-level decline in the number of lateral bony plates, comprising anti-predator armour, in multiple populations of sticklebacks over the last 91 years in Poland. Armor loss was predicted by elevated temperatures and is proposed to be a correlated response to selection for reduced body size. This study demonstrates a change in a functional trait of known genetic basis in response to elevated temperature, and illustrates the utility of the threespine stickleback as a model for measuring the evolutionary and ecological impacts of environmental change across the northern hemisphere.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Early developmental stages of cold-adapted ectotherms such as brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are at higher risk of mortality with increasing water temperatures. To determine the amount of variation present in early life, which may allow for potential adaptation to increasing temperature, we examined the routine metabolic rates (RMR) of wild-origin brook trout embryos and alevins reared at normal (5°C) and elevated (9°C) temperatures. The experiment was structured to examine variation in RMR within and among several levels of biological organization (family, population and ancestral type (native vs. mixed ancestry)). As expected, family and temperature variables were most important for predicting RMR and body mass, although population-level differences also existed when family was excluded for more detailed analysis. Additionally, body mass strongly influenced RMR at all life stages except for eyed embryos. When family identity was removed from the analysis, population became the most significant variable. Variation in RMR and mass within and among populations may indicate existing adaptive potential within and among brook trout populations to respond to predicted warming under climate change scenarios. © The Author(s) 2018.

VL  - 37

AB  - Neuronal activity is temperature sensitive and affects behavioral traits important for individual fitness, such as locomotion and courtship. Yet, we do not know enough about the evolutionary response of neuronal phenotypes in new temperature environments. Here, we use long-term experimental evolution of Drosophila simulans populations exposed to novel temperature regimes. Here, we demonstrate a direct relationship between thermal selective pressure and the evolution of neuronally expressed molecular and behavioral phenotypes. Several essential neuronal genes evolve lower expression at high temperatures and higher expression at low temperatures, with dopaminergic neurons standing out by displaying the most consistent expression change across independent replicates. We functionally validate the link between evolved gene expression and behavioral changes by pharmacological intervention in the experimentally evolved D. simulans populations as well as by genetically triggered expression changes of key genes in D. melanogaster. As natural temperature clines confirm our results for Drosophila and Anopheles populations, we conclude that neuronal dopamine evolution is a key factor for temperature adaptation. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Evolutionary Rescue as a Mechanism Allowing a Clonal Grass to Adapt to Novel Climates
VL  - 12
AB  - Filing gaps in our understanding of species' abilities to adapt to novel climates is a key challenge for predicting future range shifts and biodiversity loss. Key knowledge gaps are related to the potential for evolutionary rescue in response to climate, especially in long-lived clonally reproducing species. We illustrate a novel approach to assess the potential for evolutionary rescue using a combination of reciprocal transplant experiment in the field to assess performance under a changing climate and independent growth chamber assays to assess growth- and physiology-related plant trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones. We use a clonal grass, Festuca rubra, as a model species. We propagated individual clones and used them in a transplant experiment across broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients, simulating the projected direction of climate change in the region. Independent information on trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones was obtained by cultivating them in four growth chambers representing climate extremes. Plant survival was affected by interaction between plant traits and climate change, with both trait plasticities and maxima being important for adaptation to novel climates. Key traits include plasticity in extravaginal ramets, aboveground biomass, and osmotic potential. The direction of selection in response to a given climatic change detected in this study mostly contradicted the natural trait clines indicating that short-term selection pressure as identified here does not match long-term selection outcomes. Long-lived clonal species exposed to different climatic changes are subjected to consistent selection pressures on key traits, a necessary condition for adaptation to novel conditions. This points to evolutionary rescue as an important mechanism for dealing with climate change in these species. Our experimental approach may be applied also in other model systems broadening our understanding of evolutionary rescue. Such knowledge cannot be easily deduced from observing the existing field clines. © Copyright © 2021 Münzbergová, Vandvik and Hadincová.

AB  - Directional climate change (global warming) is causing rapid alterations in animals’ environments. Because the nervous system is at the forefront of animals’ interactions with the environment, the neurobiological implications of climate change are central to understanding how individuals, and ultimately populations, will respond to global warming. Evidence is accumulating for individual level, mechanistic effects of climate change on nervous system development and performance. Climate change can also alter sensory stimuli, changing the effectiveness of sensory and cognitive systems for achieving biological fitness. At the population level, natural selection forces stemming from directional climate change may drive rapid evolutionary change in nervous system structure and function. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Increased Daily Temperature Fluctuations Overrule the Ability of Gradual Thermal Evolution to Offset the Increased Pesticide Toxicity under Global Warming
VL  - 53
IS  - 8
SP  - 4600-4608
AB  - The widespread evidence that global warming can increase species sensitivities to chemical toxicants, and vice versa, and the recent insight that thermal evolution may mitigate these effects is crucial to predict the future impact of toxicants in a warming world. Nevertheless, a major component of global warming, the predicted increase in daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs), has been ignored at the interface of evolutionary ecotoxicology and global change biology. We studied whether 4 °C warming and a 5 °C DTF increase (to 10 °C DTF) magnified the negative impact of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) in larvae of low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. While 4 °C warming only increased CPF-induced mortality in high-latitude larvae, the high (10 °C) DTF increased CPF-induced larval mortality at both latitudes. CPF reduced the heat tolerance; however, this was buffered by latitude-specific thermal adaptation to both mean temperature and DTF. Integrating our results in a space-for-time substitution indicated that gradual thermal evolution in high-latitude larvae may offset the negative effects of CPF on heat tolerance under warming, unless the expected DTF increase is taken into account. Our results highlight the crucial importance of jointly integrating DTFs and thermal evolution to improve risk assessment of toxicants under global warming.

AB  - Adaptive evolution is key in mediating responses to global warming and may sometimes be the only solution for species to survive. Such evolution will expectedly lead to changes in the populations’ thermal reaction norm and improve their ability to cope with stressful conditions. Conversely, evolutionary constraints might limit the adaptive response. Here, we test these expectations by performing a real-time evolution experiment in historically differentiated Drosophila subobscura populations. We address the phenotypic change after nine generations of evolution in a daily fluctuating environment with average constant temperature, or in a warming environment with increasing average and amplitude temperature across generations. Our results showed that (1) evolution under a global warming scenario does not lead to a noticeable change in the thermal response; (2) historical background appears to be affecting responses under the warming environment, particularly at higher temperatures; and (3) thermal reaction norms are trait dependent: although lifelong exposure to low temperature decreases fecundity and productivity but not viability, high temperature causes negative transgenerational effects on productivity and viability, even with high fecundity. These findings in such an emblematic organism for thermal adaptation studies raise concerns about the short-term efficiency of adaptive responses to the current rising temperatures. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 12

AB  - Despite our extensive knowledge of the genetic regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), the evolutionary routes that allow bacteria to adaptively tune their HSP levels and corresponding proteostatic robustness have been explored less. In this report, directed evolution experiments using the Escherichia coli model system unexpectedly revealed that seemingly random single mutations in its tnaA gene can confer significant heat resistance. Closer examination, however, indicated that these mutations create folding-deficient and aggregation-prone TnaA variants that in turn can endogenously and preemptively trigger HSP expression to cause heat resistance. These findings, importantly, demonstrate that even erosive mutations with disruptive effects on protein structure and functionality can still yield true gain-of-function al-leles with a selective advantage in adaptive evolution. © 2021 Mortier et al.

TI  - Evolution of thermal tolerance and its fitness consequences: parallel and non-parallel responses to urban heat islands across three cities
VL  - 285
IS  - 1882
AB  - The question of parallel evolution—what causes it, and how common it is—has long captured the interest of evolutionary biologists. Widespread urban development over the last century has driven rapid evolutionary responses on contemporary time scales, presenting a unique opportunity to test the predictability and parallelism of evolutionary change. Here we examine urban evolution in an acorn-dwelling ant species, focusing on the urban heat island signal and the ant’s tolerance of these altered urban temperature regimes. Using a common-garden experimental design with acorn ant colonies collected from urban and rural populations in three cities and reared under five temperature treatments in the laboratory, we assessed plastic and evolutionary shifts in the heat and cold tolerance of F1 offspring worker ants. In two of three cities, we found evolved losses of cold tolerance, and compression of thermal tolerance breadth. Results for heat tolerance were more complex: in one city, we found evidence of simple evolved shifts in heat tolerance in urban populations, though in another, the difference in urban and rural population heat tolerance depended on laboratory rearing temperature, and only became weakly apparent at the warmest rearing temperatures. The shifts in tolerance appeared to be adaptive, as our analysis of the fitness consequences of warming revealed that while urban populations produced more sexual reproductives under warmer laboratory rearing temperatures, rural populations produced fewer. Patterns of natural selection on thermal tolerances supported our findings of fitness trade-offs and local adaptation across urban and rural acorn ant populations, as selection on thermal tolerance acted in opposite directions between the warmest and coldest rearing temperatures. Our study provides mixed support for parallel evolution of thermal tolerance under urban temperature rise, and, importantly, suggests the promising use of cities to examine parallel and non-parallel evolution on contemporary time scales. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Thermal flight performance reveals impact of warming on bumblebee foraging potential
VL  - 35
IS  - 11
SP  - 2508-2522
AB  - The effects of environmental temperature on components of insect flight determine life-history traits, fitness, adaptability and, ultimately, organism ecosystem functional roles. Despite the crucial role of flying insects across landscapes, our understanding of how temperature affects insect flight performance remains limited. Many insect pollinators are considered under threat from climatic warming. Quantifying the relationship between temperature and behavioural performance traits allows us to understand where species are operating in respect to their thermal limits, helping predict responses to projected temperature increases and/or erratic weather events. Using a tethered flight mill, we quantify how flight performance of a widespread bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, varies over a temperature range (12–30℃). Given that body mass constrains insect mobility and behaviour, bumblebees represent a useful system to study temperature-mediated size dependence of flight performance owing to the large intra-colony variation in worker body size they exhibit. Workers struggled to fly over a few hundred metres at the lowest tested temperature of 12℃; however, flight endurance increased as temperatures rose, peaking around 25℃ after which it declined. Our findings further revealed variation in flight capacity across the workforce, with larger workers flying further, longer, and faster than their smaller nestmates. Body mass was also positively related with the likelihood of flight, although importantly this relationship became stronger as temperatures cooled, such that at 12℃ only the largest workers were successful fliers. Our study thus highlights that colony foraging success under variable thermal environments can be dependent on the body mass distribution of constituent workers, and more broadly suggests smaller-bodied insects may benefit disproportionately more from warming than larger-bodied ones in terms of flight performance. By incorporating both flight endurance and likelihood of flight, we calculated a simple metric termed ‘temperature-mediated foraging potential’ to gain a clearer understanding of how temperature may constrain colony foraging. Of our tested temperatures, 27℃ supported the highest potential, indicating that for much of the range of this species, higher mean daily temperatures as forecasted under climate warming will push colonies closer to their thermal optimum for flight. Subsequently, warming may have positive implications for bumblebee foraging returns and pollination provision.

TI  - Drosophila Populations Reared Under Tropical Semi-natural Conditions Evolve Season-dependent Differences in Timing of Eclosion
VL  - 13
AB  - Circadian clocks are considered an evolutionary adaptation to environmental cycles, helping organisms to adapt to daily and seasonal changes. However, most studies on the evolution of circadian rhythms have been carried out in controlled laboratory conditions; hence evolution of circadian clocks and rhythms in organisms reared under the influence of naturally varying time cues is not well understood. To address this, we reared large outbred fly populations in an outdoor enclosure on our institutional grounds in Bengaluru, southern India for about 150 generations, at the same time maintaining their ancestral control populations under standard laboratory conditions. Studying their rhythms in eclosion, a vital behavior for Drosophila, in the laboratory and semi-natural environments revealed that flies reared under semi-natural conditions differed in the timing of eclosion under semi-natural conditions in a season-dependent manner from their laboratory-reared counterparts. These differences were manifested under harsh semi-natural environments but not under mild ones or in standard laboratory conditions. Further analysis revealed that this phenotype might be responsive to seasonal changes in temperature cycles which was confirmed in the laboratory with simulated light and temperature cycles that approximated semi-natural conditions. Our results highlight key intricacies on the relative impact of intensity and timing of environmental cues for predicting the timing of Drosophila eclosion under tropical naturalistic conditions. Overall, our research uncovers previously unexplored aspects of adaptive circadian timekeeping in complex natural conditions, offering valuable insight into the evolution of clocks.

TI  - Thermal and oxygen conditions during development cause common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) to alter the size of their gas-exchange organs
VL  - 90
AB  - Terrestrial isopods have evolved pleopodal lungs that provide access to the rich aerial supply of oxygen. However, isopods occupy conditions with wide and unpredictable thermal and oxygen gradients, suggesting that they might have evolved adaptive developmental plasticity in their respiratory organs to help meet metabolic demand over a wide range of oxygen conditions. To explore this plasticity, we conducted an experiment in which we reared common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) from eggs to maturation at different temperatures (15 and 22 °C) combined with different oxygen levels (10% and 22% O2). We sampled animals during development (only females) and then examined mature adults (both sexes). We compared woodlice between treatments with respect to the area of their pleopod exopodites (our proxy of lung size) and the shape of Bertalanffy's equations (our proxy of individual growth curves). Generally, males exhibited larger lungs than females relative to body size. Woodlice also grew relatively fast but achieved a decreased asymptotic body mass in response to warm conditions; the oxygen did not affect growth. Under hypoxia, growing females developed larger lungs compared to under normoxia, but only in the late stage of development. Among mature animals, this effect was present only in males. Woodlice reared under warm conditions had relatively small lungs, in both developing females (the effect was increased in relatively large females) and among mature males and females. Our results demonstrated that woodlice exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their lung size. We suggest that this plasticity helps woodlice equilibrate their gas exchange capacity to differences in the oxygen supply and metabolic demand along environmental temperature and oxygen gradients. The complex pattern of plasticity might indicate the effects of a balance between water conservation and oxygen uptake, which would be especially pronounced in mature females that need to generate an aqueous environment inside their brood pouch. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Coupling thermal evolution of planets and hydrodynamic atmospheric escape in MESA
VL  - 499
IS  - 1
SP  - 77-88
AB  - The long-term evolution of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres of sub-Neptune-like planets is mostly controlled to by two factors: a slow dissipation of the gravitational energy acquired at the formation (known as thermal evolution) and atmospheric mass-loss. Here, we use MESA to self-consistently couple the thermal evolution model of lower atmospheres with a realistic hydrodynamical atmospheric evaporation prescription. To outline the main features of such coupling, we simulate planets with a range of core masses (5-20 M☉) and initial atmospheric mass fractions (0.5-30 per cent), orbiting a solar-like star at 0.1 au. In addition to our computed evolutionary tracks, we also study the stability of planetary atmospheres, showing that the atmospheres of light planets can be completely removed within 1 Gyr and that compact atmospheres have a better survival rate. From a detailed comparison between our results and the output of the previous-generation models, we show that coupling between thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation considerably affects the thermal state of atmospheres for low-mass planets and, consequently, changes the relationship between atmospheric mass fraction and planetary parameters. We, therefore, conclude that self-consistent consideration of the thermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation is of crucial importance for evolutionary modelling and a better characterization of planetary atmospheres. From our simulations, we derive an analytical expression between planetary radius and atmospheric mass fraction at different ages. In particular, we find that, for a given observed planetary radius, the predicted atmospheric mass fraction changes as age0.11 © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Diversity in membrane composition is associated with variation in thermoregulatory capacity in hymenopterans
VL  - 224
SP  - 115-120
AB  - Thermoregulatory capacity varies widely among bees and wasps, but the cellular physiology required to support such thermogenic ability remains unclear. Studies conducted on ectothermic species living in varying temperature show that cellular membrane composition is adjusted to remain functional, a process named homeoviscous adaptation. We show that the fatty acid composition of flight muscle membranes varies with thermogenic capacity in species of bees and wasps. The relative abundance of palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2) decreased, while oleate (18:1) increased with increasing thoracic temperature. Species selected for the study varied over ten-fold in body mass, which in turn affected species thoracic temperature and their fatty acids profile. Nevertheless, all analyses conducted show that thoracic temperature is the main driver of flight muscle membrane composition in hymenopterans with diverse thermoregulatory capacity. These findings are in line with the predictions based on the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis and further show that thermogenic strategy used by insect species impacts cellular membrane composition. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Do Longevity and Fecundity Change by Selection on Mating Success at Elevated Temperature? Correlated Selection Responses in Drosophila buzzatii
VL  - 48
IS  - 3
SP  - 312-320
AB  - Adaptation to environmental temperature depends on both direct and correlated responses to selection for reproduction and survival at elevated temperature. Sexual selection is one of the most powerful of all evolutionary forces and we tested both fecundity and longevity for their correlated responses to sexual selection on the ability to mate (mating success) at high temperature. Replicated lines selected for 15 generations of mating at 33 °C (S lines) were compared to their respective controls (C lines) in D. buzzatii in three thermal regimes: 25 °C, 30 °C and a cyclic thermal regime for longevity from 17 to 32 °C. Previous work showed that S lines successfully responded for the trait selected and the present results show a trade-off in males between mating success at elevated temperature and longevity in all three thermal regimes tested. In addition, inter-sexual relationships of trade-offs were apparent between male longevity and female fecundity as correlated selection responses. In this sex-specific association of trade off, S females exhibited higher fecundity than C females at 30 °C only if females were exposed to a limited social environment of a single male. Overall, selection for mating at high temperature increases female fecundity at high temperature but decreases longevity in males. This sex-specific and negative impact on longevity in males could be the result of a genetic correlation between mating success at high temperature and reduced longevity in this sex. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 2019
IS  - 147
AB  - Continuous culture methods enable cells to be grown under quantitatively controlled environmental conditions, and are thus broadly useful for measuring fitness phenotypes and improving our understanding of how genotypes are shaped by selection. Extensive recent efforts to develop and apply niche continuous culture devices have revealed the benefits of conducting new forms of cell culture control. This includes defining custom selection pressures and increasing throughput for studies ranging from long-term experimental evolution to genome-wide library selections and synthetic gene circuit characterization. The eVOLVER platform was recently developed to meet this growing demand: a continuous culture platform with a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and automation. eVOLVER provides a single standardizing platform that can be (re)-configured and scaled with minimal effort to perform many different types of high-throughput or multi-dimensional growth selection experiments. Here, a protocol is presented to provide users of the eVOLVER framework a description for configuring the system to conduct a custom, large-scale continuous growth experiment. Specifically, the protocol guides users on how to program the system to multiplex two selection pressures — temperature and osmolarity — across many eVOLVER vials in order to quantify fitness landscapes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants at fine resolution. We show how the device can be configured both programmatically, through its open-source web-based software, and physically, by arranging fluidic and hardware layouts. The process of physically setting up the device, programming the culture routine, monitoring and interacting with the experiment in real-time over the internet, sampling vials for subsequent offline analysis, and post experiment data analysis are detailed. This should serve as a starting point for researchers across diverse disciplines to apply eVOLVER in the design of their own complex and high-throughput cell growth experiments to study and manipulate biological systems. © 2019 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.

TI  - Evolution of Portulacineae Marked by Gene Tree Conflict and Gene Family Expansion Associated with Adaptation to Harsh Environments
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 112-126
AB  - Several plant lineages have evolved adaptations that allow survival in extreme and harsh environments including many families within the plant clade Portulacineae (Caryophyllales) such as the Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, and Montiaceae. Here, using newly generated transcriptomic data, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Portulacineae and examined potential correlates between molecular evolution and adaptation to harsh environments. Our phylogenetic results were largely congruent with previous analyses, but we identified several early diverging nodes characterized by extensive gene tree conflict. For particularly contentious nodes, we present detailed information about the phylogenetic signal for alternative relationships. We also analyzed the frequency of gene duplications, confirmed previously identified whole genome duplications (WGD), and proposed a previously unidentified WGD event within the Didiereaceae. We found that the WGD events were typically associated with shifts in climatic niche but did not find a direct association with WGDs and diversification rate shifts. Diversification shifts occurred within the Portulacaceae, Cactaceae, and Anacampserotaceae, and whereas these did not experience WGDs, the Cactaceae experienced extensive gene duplications. We examined gene family expansion and molecular evolutionary patterns with a focus on genes associated with environmental stress responses and found evidence for significant gene family expansion in genes with stress adaptation and clades found in extreme environments. These results provide important directions for further and deeper examination of the potential links between molecular evolutionary patterns and adaptation to harsh environments. © The Author 2018.

TI  - The Single-Stranded RNA Bacteriophage Q beta Adapts Rapidly to High Temperatures: An Evolution Experiment
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses are thought to evolve rapidly due to an inherently high mutation rate. However, it remains unclear how ssRNA viruses adapt to novel environments and/or how many and what types of substitutions are needed to facilitate this evolution. In this study, we followed the adaptation of the ssRNA bacteriophage Q beta using thermally adaptedEscherichia colias a host, which can efficiently grow at temperatures between 37.2 and 45.3 degrees C. This made it possible to evaluate Q beta adaptation to the highest known temperature that supports growth, 45.3 degrees C. We found that Q beta was capable of replication at this temperature; within 114 days (similar to 1260 generations), we detected more than 34 novel point mutations in the genome of the thermally adapted Q beta population, representing 0.8% of the total Q beta genome. In addition, we returned the 45.3 degrees C-adapted Q beta populations to 37.2 degrees C and passaged them for 8 days (similar to 124 generations). We found that the reverse-adapted Q beta population showed little to no decrease in fitness. These results indicate that Q beta can evolve in response to increasing temperatures in a short period of time with the accumulation of point mutations.

TI  - An experimental test of temperature-dependent selection on mitochondrial haplotypes in Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetles
VL  - 10
IS  - 20
SP  - 11387-11398
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) consists of few but vital maternally inherited genes that interact closely with nuclear genes to produce cellular energy. How important mtDNA polymorphism is for adaptation is still unclear. The assumption in population genetic studies is often that segregating mtDNA variation is selectively neutral. This contrasts with empirical observations of mtDNA haplotypes affecting fitness-related traits and thermal sensitivity, and latitudinal clines in mtDNA haplotype frequencies. Here, we experimentally test whether ambient temperature affects selection on mtDNA variation, and whether such thermal effects are influenced by intergenomic epistasis due to interactions between mitochondrial and nuclear genes, using replicated experimental evolution in Callosobruchus maculatus seed beetle populations seeded with a mixture of different mtDNA haplotypes. We also test for sex-specific consequences of mtDNA evolution on reproductive success, given that mtDNA mutations can have sexually antagonistic fitness effects. Our results demonstrate natural selection on mtDNA haplotypes, with some support for thermal environment influencing mtDNA evolution through mitonuclear epistasis. The changes in male and female reproductive fitness were both aligned with changes in mtDNA haplotype frequencies, suggesting that natural selection on mtDNA is sexually concordant in stressful thermal environments. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of mtDNA. © 2020 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Warming, temperature fluctuations and thermal evolution change the effects of microplastics at an environmentally relevant concentration
VL  - 292
AB  - Microplastics are sometimes considered not harmful at environmentally relevant concentrations. Yet, such studies were conducted under standard thermal conditions and thereby ignored the impacts of higher mean temperatures (MT), and especially daily temperature fluctuations (DTF) under global warming. Moreover, an evolutionary perspective may further benefit the future risk assessment of microplastics under global warming. Here, we investigated the effects of two generations of exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of polystyrene microplastics (5 μg L−1) under six thermal conditions (2 MT × 3 DTF) on the life history, physiology, and behaviour of Daphnia magna. To assess the impact of thermal evolution we thereby compared Daphnia populations from high and low latitudes. At the standard ecotoxic thermal conditions (constant 20 °C) microplastics almost had no effect except for a slight reduction of the heartbeat rate. Yet, at the challenging thermal conditions (higher MT and/or DTF), microplastics affected each tested variable and caused an earlier maturation, a higher fecundity and intrinsic growth rate, a decreased heartbeat rate, and an increased swimming speed. These effects may be partly explained by hormesis and/or an adaptive response to stress in Daphnia. Moreover, exposure to microplastics at the higher mean temperature increased the fecundity and intrinsic growth rate of cold-adapted high-latitude Daphnia, but not of the warm-adapted low-latitude Daphnia, suggesting that thermal evolution in high-latitude Daphnia may buffer the effects of microplastics under future warming. Our results highlight the critical importance of DTF and thermal evolution for a more realistic risk assessment of microplastics under global warming. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Small-scale phenotypic differentiation along complex stream gradients in a non-native amphipod
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Selective landscapes in rivers are made up by an array of selective forces that vary from source to downstream regions or between seasons, and local/temporal variation in fitness maxima can result in gradual spatio-temporal variation of phenotypic traits. This study aimed at establishing freshwater amphipods as future model organisms to study adaptive phenotypic diversification (evolutionary divergence and/or adaptive plasticity) along stream gradients. Methods: We collected Gammarus roeselii from 16 sampling sites in the Rhine catchment during two consecutive seasons (summer and winter). Altogether, we dissected n = 1648 individuals and quantified key parameters related to morphological and life-history diversification, including naturally selected (e.g., gill surface areas) as well as primarily sexually selected traits (e.g., male antennae). Acknowledging the complexity of selective regimes in streams and the interrelated nature of selection factors, we assessed several abiotic (e.g., temperature, flow velocity) and biotic ecological parameters (e.g., conspecific densities, sex ratios) and condensed them into four principal components (PCs). Results: Generalized least squares models revealed pronounced phenotypic differentiation in most of the traits investigated herein, and components of the stream gradient (PCs) explained parts of the observed differences. Depending on the trait under investigation, phenotypic differentiation could be ascribed to variation in abiotic conditions, anthropogenic disturbance (influx of thermally polluted water), or population parameters. For example, female fecundity showed altitudinal variation and decreased with increasing conspecific densities, while sexual dimorphism in the length of male antennae - used for mate finding and assessment - increased with increasing population densities and towards female-biased sex ratios. Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive protocol for comparative analyses of intraspecific variation in life history traits in amphipods. Whether the observed phenotypic differentiation over small geographical distances reflects evolutionary divergence or plasticity (or both) remains to be investigated in future studies. Independent of the mechanisms involved, variation in several traits is likely to have consequences for ecosystem functions. For example, leaf-shredding in G. roeselii strongly depends on body size, which varied in dependence of several ecological parameters. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Dwarfism in close continental amphibian populations despite lack of genetic isolation
VL  - 129
IS  - 8
SP  - 1243-1256
AB  - Ample variation in body size is common in vertebrates over extensive geographical distances, or in isolated populations, where effective geographical barriers may cause dwarfism or gigantism. Here we study potential causes of extreme size reduction in continental populations of amphibians within a short geographical distance and in the absence of geographical barriers. Natterjack toads Epidalea calamita in Doñana National Park (Spain) experience up to 2.1-fold difference in body mass in as little as 37 km. Studying six populations divergent in body size, we tested for genetic isolation of the dwarf populations using multilocus genotypes (16 microsatellites), and explored whether populations differ in trophic status (through stable isotope analysis), standard metabolic rate and growth pattern, senescence and age structure (conducting telomere length assays and skeletochronology). We also recorded advertisement calls across populations and experimentally tested for behavioural reinforcement of the body size variation through female preferences. Local dwarfism in these populations occurs in the absence of genetic isolation while maintaining relatively high effective population sizes. Dwarf populations, however, are exposed to drier and warmer climatic conditions, have different trophic status, show lower mass-specific metabolic rate, and male advertisement calls with a higher dominant frequency. Juvenile growth differed among populations, reaching the adult stage at different body sizes. Altogether, our results suggest a significant influence of environmental conditions on the physiology and ecology of the Doñana E. calamita populations, mainly affecting toads between metamorphosis and sexual maturity. Further experimental and genomic studies focusing on these early life stages are necessary to dissect the relative roles of the environment and adaptive genetic differentiation on this phenomenon. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

TI  - Oxidative stress resistance as a factor in aging: evidence from an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
SP  - 497-513
AB  - Longevity of a species is a multifactorial quantitative trait influenced by genetic background, sex, age and environment of the organism. Extended longevity phenotypes (ELP) from experimental evolution in the laboratory can be used as model systems to investigate the mechanisms underlying aging and senescence. ELPs of Drosophila are correlated with various life history attributes such as resistance to environmental stressors (starvation, desiccation, cold and paraquat), developmental time, biochemical defenses, etc. The association between oxidative stress resistance and longevity is not clear and ELPs offer an opportunity to examine the role of oxidative stress resistance in longevity. Here, we have investigated the hypothesis that enhanced oxidative stress resistance and elevated antioxidant defense system play a positive role in longevity using an ELP of Drosophila melanogaster. An ELP of D. melanogaster isolated and characterized in our laboratory through artificial selection (inbred laboratory strain of Oregon K) is employed in this study. Our ELP, named as long lifespan (LLS) flies, shows marked extension in lifespan when compared to the progenitor population (normal lifespan, NLS) and makes a suitable model to study the role of mitochondrial genome in longevity because of its least heterogeneity. In this study, sensitivity to ethanol with age was employed as a measure of resistance to oxidative stress in NLS and LLS flies. Effect of age and oxidative stress on longevity was examined by employing NLS and LLS flies of different age groups against ethanol-induced oxidative stress. Results show that the lower mortality against ethanol was associated with enhanced oxidative stress resistance, higher antioxidant defenses, lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, enhanced alcohol dehydrogenase activity and better locomotor ability attributes of LLS flies. In addition, age-related changes like locomotor impairments, decreased antioxidant defenses, higher ROS levels and sensitivity to oxidative stress were delayed in LLS flies when compared to NLS. Our study supports the hypothesis that higher oxidative stress resistance and enhanced antioxidant defenses are significant factors in extending longevity. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Trap-building predators remain under strong selection from thermal microenvironments. To address how soil temperature and body size affect trap building, we conducted a laboratory experiment using larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon bore at six ecologically relevant temperatures. Larger larvae built larger traps, and warmer soil led to more and larger traps. Body mass did not alter the dependence of trap building on temperature. Our results suggest that the physiological capacity of antlion larvae, which is affected by larval size and body temperature, is the major determinant of trap building. This effect should be considered when assessing interactions between antlions and prey. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Genetic and environmental effects on the scaling of metabolic rate with body size
VL  - 222
IS  - 7
AB  - Metabolic rate (MR) often scales with body mass (BM) following a power function of the form MR=aBMb, where log(a) is the allometric intercept and b is the allometric exponent (i.e. slope on a log–log scale). The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (G×E) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a G×E interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared and measured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28°C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no G×E interaction in b. However, we found a significant G×E interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this G×E interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures. © 2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Effects of genetic and physiological divergence on the evolution of a sulfate-reducing bacterium under conditions of elevated temperature
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 1-14
AB  - Adaptation via natural selection is an important driver of evolution, and repeatable adaptations of replicate populations, under conditions of a constant envi-ronment, have been extensively reported. However, isolated groups of populations in nature tend to harbor both genetic and physiological divergence due to multiple selective pressures that they have encountered. How this divergence affects adaptation of these populations to a new common environment remains unclear. To deter-mine the impact of prior genetic and physiological divergence in shaping adaptive evolution to accommodate a new common environment, an experimental evolution study with the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) was conducted. Two groups of replicate populations with genetic and physiological divergence, derived from a previous evolution study, were propagated in an elevated-temperature environment for 1,000 generations. Ancestor populations without prior experimental evolution were also propagated in the same environment as a control. After 1,000 generations, all the populations had increased growth rates and all but one had greater fitness in the new environment than the ancestor popu-lation. Moreover, improvements in growth rate were moderately affected by the divergence in the starting populations, while changes in fitness were not significantly af-fected. The mutations acquired at the gene level in each group of populations were quite different, indicating that the observed phenotypic changes were achieved by evolutionary responses that differed between the groups. Overall, our work demonstrated that the initial differences in fitness between the starting populations were eliminated by adaptation and that phenotypic convergence was achieved by acquisition of mutations in different genes. IMPORTANCE Improving our understanding of how previous adaptation influences evolution has been a long-standing goal in evolutionary biology. Natural selection tends to drive populations to find similar adaptive solutions for the same selective conditions. However, variations in historical environments can lead to both physiological and genetic divergence that can make evolution unpredictable. Here, we as-sessed the influence of divergence on the evolution of a model sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, in response to elevated temperature and found a significant effect at the genetic but not the phenotypic level. Under-standing how these influences drive evolution will allow us to better predict how bacteria will adapt to various ecological constraints. © 2020 Kempher et al.

AB  - The current policy has the world on track to experience around 3°C of warming by 2100. The responses of organisms to our warming world will be mediated by changes in physiological processes, including metabolic rate. Metabolic rate represents the energetic cost of living, and is fundamental to understanding the energy required to sustain populations. Current evidence indicates that animals have a limited capacity to adapt to warmer environments by reducing their metabolic rate. Consequently, animals may be more reliant on metabolic plasticity to ameliorate the thermodynamic effect of rising temperatures on physiological rates. However, metabolic plasticity is influenced by other environmental factors, including the nutritional quality of food. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are expected to reduce the protein and increase the carbohydrate concentration in plants, but we do not know how this will affect the response of metabolic rate to climate warming. Here we test the interactive effects of developmental dietary protein and carbohydrate concentrations on the metabolic plasticity of adult Drosophila melanogaster in response to a 3°C increase in temperature while accounting for variation associated with body mass and activity (resting metabolic rate). We show that the thermal sensitivity of resting metabolic rate is modulated by developmental nutrition with animals reared on nutritionally poor, low-protein diets showing the greatest increase in resting metabolic rate in response to simulated climate warming. We also show that if the nutritional quality of resources is unaffected by climate change, then temperature-induced increases in resting metabolic rate will be offset by decreases in mass, but the absolute energy requirements of animals will be elevated relative to current conditions despite this. If, on the other hand, temperatures rise and resources become more calorie-dense and carbohydrate-rich, then the resting metabolic rate of animals will remain relatively unchanged, but decreases in mass and activity may drive down the absolute energy requirements of animals. In the absence of evolutionary adaptation, these findings suggest that the combined plastic response of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits to temperature and nutrition may be an important determinant of the ultimate outcome of climate change for populations.

TI  - Does long-term selection for development time result in canalization: A test using Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 7
AB  - Canalization denotes the robustness of a trait against genetic or environmental perturbation. Plasticity, in contrast, indicates the environmental sensitivity of a trait. Stabilizing selection is often thought to increase the canalization of a trait, whereas directional selection is often thought to lead to decanalization. However, the relationship between selection, canalization, and plasticity remains largely unclear. Using experimental evolution, here, we ask whether long-term directional selection for reduced pre-adult development time in Drosophila melanogaster results in the evolution of increased canalization for development time, the trait under primary selection. We additionally investigate whether pre-adult survivorship, a trait only secondarily under selection in this experimental regime, also evolves to become canalized. We examine canalization both in terms of stability of population means and of within population variability across two environmental axes, reflecting macro- and microenvironmental canalization, respectively. We used four large outbred populations of D. melanogaster selected for rapid pre-adult development and early reproduction for 295 generations, and four corresponding ancestral control populations that were not under conscious selection for development time or early reproduction. The selected populations had evolved ~25% reduction in both development time and pre-adult survivorship at the time of this study. We studied development time and pre-adult survivorship of the selected populations and controls across various combinations of rearing temperature and larval density. Development time in the selected populations had become more canalized than controls against both macro- and microenvironmental variation, but only with regard to density, and not temperature. Canalization of development time across density appears to have evolved due to evolutionary changes in the life-history and physiology of the selected populations. Pre-adult survivorship, only a secondary correlate of fitness in the selected populations, did not show any clear trend in terms of canalization with regard to either density or temperature, and overall variation in the trait was greater compared to development time within and across environments. Whether long-term directional selection canalizes or not, therefore, appears to be dependent in a complex way on specific interactions of trait, selection regime, and environmental factor in the context of the ecology and physiology of the populations under study. © 2019 Ghosh, Satish, Jayaram and Joshi.

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Laser powder bed fusion exhibits many advantages for manufacturing complex geometries from hard to machine alloys such as IN625. However, a major drawback is the formation of high tensile residual stresses, and the complex relationship between the process parameters and the residual stresses has not been fully investigated. The current study presents multi-scale models to examine the variation of process parameters on melt pool dimensions, cyclic temperature evolutions, cooling rate, and cyclic stress generation and how they affect the stress end state. In addition, the effect of the same energy density, which is often overlooked, on the generated residual stresses is investigated. Multi-level validation is performed based on melt pool dimensions, temperature measurements with a two-color pyrometer, and finally, in-depth residual stress measurement. The results show that scan speed has the strongest effect on residual stresses, followed by laser power and hatch spacing. The results are explained in light of the non-linear temperature evolution, temperature gradient, and cooling rate during laser exposure, cooling time, and the rate during recoating time. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 74

SP  - 775-790
AB  - To better predict how populations and communities respond to climatic temperature variation, it is necessary to understand how the shape of the response of fitness-related rates to temperature evolves (the thermal performance curve). Currently, there is disagreement about the extent to which the evolution of thermal performance curves is constrained. One school of thought has argued for the prevalence of thermodynamic constraints through enzyme kinetics, whereas another argues that adaptation can—at least partly—overcome such constraints. To shed further light on this debate, we perform a phylogenetic meta-analysis of the thermal performance curves of growth rate of phytoplankton—a globally important functional group—controlling for environmental effects (habitat type and thermal regime). We find that thermodynamic constraints have a minor influence on the shape of the curve. In particular, we detect a very weak increase of maximum performance with the temperature at which the curve peaks, suggesting a weak “hotter-is-better” constraint. Also, instead of a constant thermal sensitivity of growth across species, as might be expected from strong constraints, we find that all aspects of the thermal performance curve evolve along the phylogeny. Our results suggest that phytoplankton thermal performance curves adapt to thermal environments largely in the absence of hard thermodynamic constraints. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Male fertility thermal limits predict vulnerability to climate warming
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Forecasting which species/ecosystems are most vulnerable to climate warming is essential to guide conservation strategies to minimize extinction. Tropical/mid-latitude species are predicted to be most at risk as they live close to their upper critical thermal limits (CTLs). However, these assessments assume that upper CTL estimates, such as CTmax, are accurate predictors of vulnerability and ignore the potential for evolution to ameliorate temperature increases. Here, we use experimental evolution to assess extinction risk and adaptation in tropical and widespread Drosophila species. We find tropical species succumb to extinction before widespread species. Male fertility thermal limits, which are much lower than CTmax, are better predictors of species' current distributions and extinction in the laboratory. We find little evidence of adaptive responses to warming in any species. These results suggest that species are living closer to their upper thermal limits than currently presumed and evolution/plasticity are unlikely to rescue populations from extinction. Trait-based approaches assume upper critical thermal limits (CTLs) are good predictors of climate change vulnerability. Here, the authors show that male fertility thermal limits, which are lower than CTLs, are better at predicting Drosophila extinction in the lab, suggesting species may be living close to their thermal limits.

TI  - Lower bioenergetic costs but similar immune responsiveness under a heatwave in urban compared to rural damselflies
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-35
AB  - There is mounting evidence that the widespread phenotypic changes in response to urbanization may reflect adaptations caused by rapid evolutionary processes driven by urban-related stressors. Compared to increased habitat fragmentation and pollution, adaptations towards another typical urban-related stressor, that is higher and longer lasting very high temperatures (heatwaves), are much less studied. Notably, the sensitivities to heatwaves of life-history traits and important fitness-related physiological traits such as immune responsiveness and bioenergetic variables (energy availability, energy consumption and their balance) have never been contrasted between urban and rural populations. By conducting a laboratory common-garden experiment, we compared effects of a simulated heatwave on life history (survival and growth rate), immune responsiveness and bioenergetic variables between three urban and three rural populations of the damselfly Coenagrion puella. Because energy-mediated trade-off patterns may only be detected under energetically costly manipulations, all larvae were immune-challenged by simulating ectoparasitism by water mites. As expected, the simulated heatwave caused negative effects on nearly all response variables. The immune responsiveness, on the other hand, increased under the heatwave, consistent with a trade-off pattern between immune function and growth, and this similarly between urban and rural populations. A key finding was that urban larvae suffered less from the simulated heatwave compared to the rural larvae in terms of a lower heatwave-induced depletion in energy availability. This suggests an adaptation of urban populations to better cope with the stronger and more frequent heatwaves in cities. Notably, this urbanization-driven evolution in the bioenergetic variables was not apparent in the absence of a heatwave. Given that changes in energy budgets have strong fitness consequences, our findings suggest that the evolved higher ability to cope with heatwaves is fundamental for the survival of urban damselfly populations. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Substrate thermal properties influence ventral brightness evolution in ectotherms
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - The thermal environment can affect the evolution of morpho-behavioral adaptations of ectotherms. Heat is transferred from substrates to organisms by conduction and reflected radiation. Because brightness influences the degree of heat absorption, substrates could affect the evolution of integumentary optical properties. Here, we show that vipers (Squamata:Viperidae) inhabiting hot, highly radiative and superficially conductive substrates have evolved bright ventra for efficient heat transfer. We analyzed the brightness of 4161 publicly available images from 126 species, and we found that substrate type, alongside latitude and body mass, strongly influences ventral brightness. Substrate type also significantly affects dorsal brightness, but this is associated with different selective forces: activity-pattern and altitude. Ancestral estimation analysis suggests that the ancestral ventral condition was likely moderately bright and, following divergence events, some species convergently increased their brightness. Vipers diversified during the Miocene and the enhancement of ventral brightness may have facilitated the exploitation of arid grounds. We provide evidence that integument brightness can impact the behavioral ecology of ectotherms. Jonathan Goldenberg et al. use photographic data and ancestral state reconstruction of 126 viper species to show that substrate type influences the evolution of ventral brightness for efficient heat transfer. Their results suggest that these patterns may have been involved in the diversification of vipers during the Miocene, and highlight the importance of ventral body regions when considering behavioral ecology and evolution.

VL  - 159
AB  - The simultaneous cloaking and concentrating of heat flux is achieved through topology optimization based on a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy by formulating the optimization problem of improving two different objective functions. The topology-optimized thermal cloak-concentrator realizes excellent bi-functionality (i.e., cloaking and concentrating) despite having a simple composition, and structural characteristics needed for simultaneous cloaking and concentrating are revealed adopting a level set method with clear structural interfaces. Moreover, a thermal cloak-concentrator that is robust against fluctuations of thermal conductivity is designed by improving a fitness incorporating multiple objective functions under various thermal conductivities.

TI  - Recent warming reduces the reproductive advantage of large size and contributes to evolutionary downsizing in nature
VL  - 287
IS  - 1928
AB  - Body size is a key functional trait that is predicted to decline under warming. Warming is known to cause size declines via phenotypic plasticity, but evolutionary responses of body size to warming are poorly understood. To test for warming-induced evolutionary responses of body size and growth rates, we used populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) recently established (less than 100 years) from a common source across a strong thermal gradient (19-33°C) created by geothermal springs. Each spring is remarkably stable in temperature and is virtually closed to gene flow from other thermal environments. Field surveys show that with increasing site temperature, body size distributions become smaller and the reproductive advantage of larger body size decreases. After common rearing to reveal recently evolved trait differences, warmer-source populations expressed slowed juvenile growth rates and increased reproductive effort at small sizes. These results are consistent with an adaptive basis of the plastic temperature-size rule, and they suggest that temperature itself can drive the evolution of countergradient variation in growth rates. The rapid evolution of reduced juvenile growth rates and greater reproduction at a small size should contribute to substantial body downsizing in populations, with implications for population dynamics and for ecosystems in a warming world. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Indications for rapid evolution of trait means and thermal plasticity in range-expanding populations of a butterfly
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 124-133
AB  - Currently, poleward range expansions are observed in many taxa, often in response to anthropogenic climate change. At the expanding front, populations likely face cooler and more variable temperature conditions, imposing thermal selection. This may result in changes in trait means or plasticity, the relative contribution of which is not well understood. We, here, investigate evolutionary change in range-expanding populations of the butterfly Pieris mannii, by comparing populations from the core and the newly established northern range under laboratory conditions. We observed both changes in trait means and in thermal reaction norms. Range-expanding populations showed a more rapid development, potentially indicative of counter-gradient variation and an increased cold tolerance compared with core populations. Genotype-environment interactions prevailed in all associated traits, such that the above differences were restricted to cooler environmental conditions. In range-expanding populations, plasticity was decreased in developmental traits enabling relatively rapid growth even under cooler conditions but increased in cold tolerance arguably promoting higher activity under thermally challenging conditions. Notably, these changes must have occurred within a time period of ca. 10 years only. Our results suggest, in line with contemporary theory, that the evolution of plasticity may play a hitherto underestimated role for adaptation to climatic variation. However, rather than generally increased or decreased levels of plasticity, our results indicate fine-tuned, trait-specific evolutionary responses to increase fitness in novel environments. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Glacial stream ecology: Structural and functional assets
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - High altitude glacier-fed streams are harsh environments inhabiting specialized invertebrate communities. Most research on biotic aspects in glacier-fed streams have focused on the simple relationship between presence/absence of species and prevailing environmental conditions, whereas functional strategies and potentials of glacial stream specialists have been hardly investigated so far. Using new and recent datasets from our investigations in the European Alps, we now demonstrate distinct functional properties of invertebrates that typically dominate glacier-fed streams and show significant relationships with declining glacier cover in alpine stream catchments. In particular, we present and argue about cause-effect relationships between glacier cover in the catchment and temperature, community structure, diversity, feeding strategies, early life development, body mass, and growth of invertebrates. By concentrating on key taxa in glacial and non-glacial alpine streams, the relevance of distinct adaptations in these functional components becomes evident. This clearly demonstrates that further studies of functional characteristics are essential for the understanding of peculiar diversity patterns, successful traits and their plasticity, evolutionary triggered species adaptions, and flexibilities. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Cold nights, city lights: Artificial light at night reduces photoperiodically induced diapause in urban and rural populations of aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 57
IS  - 6
SP  - 1694-1699
AB  - As the planet becomes increasingly urbanized, it is imperative that we understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of urbanization on species. One common attribute of urbanization that differs from rural areas is the prevalence of artificial light at night (ALAN). For many species, light is one of the most important and reliable environmental cues, largely governing the timing of daily and seasonal activity patterns. Recently, it has been shown that ALAN can alter behavioral, phenological, and physiological traits in diverse taxa. For temperate insects, diapause is an essential trait for winter survival and commences in response to declining daylight hours in the fall. Diapause is under strong selection pressure in the mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse); local adaptation and rapid evolution has been observed along a latitudinal cline. It is unknown how ALAN affects this photosensitive trait or if local adaptation has occurred along an urbanization gradient. Using a common garden experiment, we experimentally demonstrated that simulated ALAN reduces diapause incidence in this species by as much as 40%. There was no difference, however, between urban and rural demes. We also calculated diapause incidence from wild demes in urban areas to determine whether wild populations exhibited lower than predicted incidence compared to estimates from total nocturnal darkness. In early fall, lower than predicted diapause incidence was recorded, but all demes reached nearly 100% diapause before terminating egg laying. It is possible that nocturnal resting behavior in vegetation limits the amount of ALAN exposure this species experiences potentially limiting local adaptation. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

VL  - 8
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity, the property by which living organisms express different phenotypes depending on environmental conditions, can impact their response to environmental perturbation, including that resulting from climate change. When exposed to altered environmental conditions, phenotypic plasticity might help or might hinder both immediate survival and future adaptation. Because climate change will cause more than a global rise in mean temperatures, it is valuable to consider the combined effects of temperature and other environmental variables on trait expression (thermal plasticity), as well as trait evolution (thermal adaptation). In this review, we focus primarily on thermal developmental plasticity in insects. We discuss the genomics of thermal plasticity and its relationship to thermal adaptation and thermal tolerance, and to climate change and multifactorial environments. © Copyright © 2020 Rodrigues and Beldade.

TI  - The role of nonshivering thermogenesis genes on leptin levels regulation in residents of the coldest region of Siberia
VL  - 22
IS  - 9
AB  - Leptin plays an important role in thermoregulation and is possibly associated with the mi-croevolutionary processes of human adaptation to a cold climate. In this study, based on the Yakut population (n = 281 individuals) living in the coldest region of Siberia (t◦ minimum −71.2◦ C), we analyze the serum leptin levels and data of 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 10 genes (UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, FNDC5, PPARGC1A, CIDEA, PTGS2, TRPV1, LEPR, BDNF) that are possibly involved in nonshivering thermogenesis processes. Our results demonstrate that from 14 studied SNPs of 10 genes, 2 SNPs (the TT rs3811787 genotype of the UCP1 gene and the GG rs6265 genotype of the BDNF gene) were associated with the elevated leptin levels in Yakut females (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, of these two SNPs, the rs3811787 of the UCP1 gene demonstrated more indications of natural selection for cold climate adaptation. The prevalence gradient of the T-allele (rs3811787) of UCP1 increased from the south to the north across Eurasia, along the shore of the Arctic Ocean. Thereby, our study suggests the potential involvement of the UCP1 gene in the leptin-mediated thermoregulation mechanism, while the distribution of its allelic variants is probably related to human adaptation to a cold climate. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - There is justified concern about the impact of global warming on the persistence of tropical ectotherms. There is also growing evidence for strong selection on climate-relevant physiological traits. Understanding the evolutionary potential of populations is especially important for low dispersal organisms in isolated populations, because these populations have little choice but to adapt. Despite this, direct estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for physiological traits in ectotherms—which will determine their evolutionary responses to selection—are sparse, especially for reptiles. Here we examine the heritabilities and genetic correlations for a set of four morphological and six climate-relevant physiological traits in an isolated population of an Australian rainforest lizard, Lampropholis coggeri. These traits show considerable variation across populations in this species, suggesting local adaptation. From laboratory crosses, we estimated very low to moderate heritability of temperature-related physiological traits (h2 &lt; 0.31), but significant and higher heritability of desiccation resistance (h2~0.42). These values contrasted with uniformly higher heritabilities (h2 &gt; 0.51) for morphological traits. At the phenotypic level, there were positive associations among the morphological traits and between thermal limits. Growth rate was positively correlated with thermal limits, but there was no indication that morphology and physiology were linked in any other way. We found some support for a specialist–generalist trade-off in the thermal performance curve, but otherwise there was no evidence for evolutionary constraints, suggesting broadly labile multivariate trait structure. Our results indicate little potential to respond to selection on thermal traits in this population and provide new insights into the capacity of tropical ectotherms to adapt in situ to rapid climate change. © 2018, The Genetics Society.

VL  - 10

SP  - 1648-1665
AB  - Effects of parental environment on offspring traits have been well known for decades. Interest in this transgenerational form of phenotypic plasticity has recently surged due to advances in our understanding of its mechanistic basis. Theoretical research has simultaneously advanced by predicting the environmental conditions that should favor the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Yet whether such conditions actually exist in nature remains largely unexplored. Here, using long-term climate data, we modeled optimal levels of transgenerational plasticity for an organism with a one-year life cycle at a spatial resolution of 4 km2 across the continental United States. Both annual temperature and precipitation levels were often autocorrelated, but the strength and direction of these autocorrelations varied considerably even among nearby sites. When present, such environmental autocorrelations render offspring environments statistically predictable based on the parental environment, a key condition for the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Results of our optimality models were consistent with this prediction: High levels of transgenerational plasticity were favored at sites with strong environmental autocorrelations, and little-to-no transgenerational plasticity was favored at sites with weak or nonexistent autocorrelations. These results are among the first to show that natural patterns of environmental variation favor the evolution of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Furthermore, these findings suggest that transgenerational plasticity is likely variable in nature, depending on site-specific patterns of environmental variation. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Geographic dispersion of invasive crop pests: the role of basal, plastic climate stress tolerance and other complementary traits in the tropics
VL  - 50
AB  - Global pest invasions have significantly increased in recent years. These invasions together with climate warming directly impact agriculture. Tropical climates feature extreme weather events, including high temperatures and seasonal droughts. Thus, successful invasive pests in tropics have to adapt to these extreme climate features. The intrinsic factors relevant to tropical invasion of insects have been explored in many studies, but the knowledge is rather dispersed in contemporary literature. Here, we reviewed the potential biophysical characters of successful invasive pests’ adaption to tropical environments including [1] inherent high basal stress tolerance and advanced life-history performances [2], phenotypic plasticity [3], rapid evolution to environmental stress, polyphagy, diverse reproductive strategies and high fecundity. We summarised how these traits and their interactive effects enhance pest invasions in the tropics. Comprehensive understanding of how these characters facilitate invasion improves models for predicting ecological consequences of climate change on invasive pest species for improved pest management. © 2022

VL  - 35

AB  - Thermal tolerance is a key determinant of species distribution. Despite much study, the genetic basis of adaptive evolution of thermal tolerance, including the relative contributions of transcriptional regulation versus protein evolution, remains unclear. Populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus are adapted to local thermal regimes across their broad geographic range. Upon thermal stress, adults from a heat tolerant southern population, San Diego (SD), upregulate several heat shock proteins (HSPs) to higher levels than those from a less tolerant northern population, Santa Cruz (SC). Suppression of a specific HSP, HSPB1, significantly reduces T. californicus survival following acute heat stress. Sequencing of HSPB1 revealed population specific nucleotide substitutions in both promoter and coding regions of the gene. HSPB1 promoters from heat tolerant populations contain two canonical heat shock elements (HSEs), the binding sites for heat shock transcription factor (HSF), whereas less tolerant populations have mutations in these conserved motifs. Allele specific expression of HSPB1 in F1 hybrids between tolerant and less tolerant populations showed significantly biased expression favoring alleles from tolerant populations and supporting the adaptive divergence in these cis-regulatory variants. The functional impact of population-specific nonsynonymous substitutions in HSPB1 coding sequences was tested by assessing the thermal stabilization properties of SD versus SC HSPB1 protein variants. Recombinant HSPB1 from the southern SD population showed greater capacity for protecting protein structure under elevated temperature. Our results indicate that both regulatory and protein coding sequence evolution within a single gene appear to contribute to thermal tolerance phenotypes and local adaptation among conspecific populations. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The potential for adaptive evolution to enable species persistence under a changing climate is one of the most important questions for understanding impacts of future climate change. Climate adaptation may be particularly likely for short-lived ectotherms, including many pest, pathogen, and vector species. For these taxa, estimating climate adaptive potential is critical for accurate predictive modeling and public health preparedness. Here, we demonstrate how a simple theoretical framework used in conservation biology—evolutionary rescue models—can be used to investigate the potential for climate adaptation in these taxa, using mosquito thermal adaptation as a focal case. Synthesizing current evidence, we find that short mosquito generation times, high population growth rates, and strong temperature-imposed selection favor thermal adaptation. However, knowledge gaps about the extent of phenotypic and genotypic variation in thermal tolerance within mosquito populations, the environmental sensitivity of selection, and the role of phenotypic plasticity constrain our ability to make more precise estimates. We describe how common garden and selection experiments can be used to fill these data gaps. Lastly, we investigate the consequences of mosquito climate adaptation on disease transmission using Aedes aegypti-transmitted dengue virus in Northern Brazil as a case study. The approach outlined here can be applied to any disease vector or pest species and type of environmental change. © Couper et al.

TI  - Differentiation and Temperature Adaptation of Pampus Echinogaster Based on Genome-Wide SNPs
VL  - 9
AB  - Climate change and overfishing have led to the degradation of the quality and stock of Pampus echinogaster. Exploring the genetic structure and local adaptive evolutionary mechanisms of P. echinogaster is crucial for the management of this species. This population genomic study of nine geographical populations of P. echinogaster in China was conducted by specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq). A total of 935,215 SLAF tags were obtained, and the average sequencing depth of the SLAF tags was 20.80×. After filtering, a total of 46,187 high-consistency genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected. Based on all SNPs, the population size of the nine P. echinogaster geographical populations was large. The Shantou population had the lowest genetic diversity, and the Tianjin population had the highest. Moreover, the population genetic structure based on all SNPs revealed significant gene exchange and no significant genetic differentiation among the nine P. echinogaster geographical populations, probably because of the population expansion after the last glacial period, the lack of balance between migration and genetic drift, and the long-distance diffusion of eggs and larvae. We suspect that variation of material metabolism, ion transfer, breeding, stress response, and inflammatory reactions-related genes were critical for adaptation to spatially heterogeneous temperature selection in natural P. echinogaster populations.

TI  - Genetic adaptation as a biological buffer against climate change: Potential and limitations
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 372-391
AB  - Climate change profoundly impacts ecosystems and their biota, resulting in range shifts, novel interactions, food web alterations, changed intensities of host—parasite interactions, and extinctions. An increasing number of studies have documented evolutionary changes in traits such as phenology and thermal tolerance. In this opinion paper, we argue that, while evolutionary responses have the potential to provide a buffer against extinctions or range shifts, a number of constraints and complexities blur this simple prediction. First, there are limits to evolutionary potential both in terms of genetic variation and demographic effects, and these limits differ strongly among taxa and populations. Second, there can be costs associated with genetic adaptation, such as a reduced evolutionary potential towards other (human-induced) environmental stressors or direct fitness costs due to tradeoffs. Third, the differential capacity of taxa to genetically respond to climate change results in novel interactions because different organism groups respond to a different degree with local compared to regional (dispersal and range shift) responses. These complexities result in additional changes in the selection pressures on populations. We conclude that evolution can provide an initial buffer against climate change for some taxa and populations but does not guarantee their survival. It does not necessarily result in reduced extinction risks across the range of taxa in a region or continent. Yet, considering evolution is crucial, as it is likely to strongly change how biota will respond to climate change and will impact which taxa will be the winners or losers at the local, metacommunity and regional scales. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Seasonal variation of energy expenditure in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata)
VL  - 76
SP  - 139-146
AB  - Animals living in seasonal environments must adapt to a wide variation of temperature changes which requires flexible adjustments of time budget and metabolic processes for efficient thermoregulation. The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) is one of only a handful of nonhuman primate species that experience seasonal climates over a wide temperature range. We used behavior observations, accelerometer sensors and the doubly-labelled water (DLW) method to measure activity and total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) of M. fuscata housed in captivity but exposed to natural seasonal variations at day lengths ranging from 10 to 12 h and temperature ranging from 0° to 32°C. Although overall activity was significantly lower in winter compared to summer and autumn, we found no effect of temperature on day-time activity. However nocturnal inactivity and mean length of sleeping bouts significantly increased along a gradient of decreasing temperatures from summer through winter, suggesting the importance of adaptive behavioral thermoregulation in this species. Energy expenditure that was unaccounted for by Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and physical activity i.e. expended through diet-induced thermogenesis or thermoregulation was between 14% and 32%. This residual energy expenditure differed between summer/autumn and winter and was relatively consistent across individuals (approximately 5–8% higher in winter). The percentage of body fat and residual energy expenditure were negatively correlated, supporting that fat storage was higher when less energy was required for thermoregulation. Our results suggest that physiological mechanisms like behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation enable M. fuscata to adapt to wide fluctuations in environmental conditions which provide insights into the evolutionary adaptations of nonhuman primates in seasonal climate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Sexual size dimorphism, allometry and fecundity in a lineage of South American viviparous lizards (Liolaemidae: Phymaturus)
VL  - 279
SP  - 152-163
AB  - In living organisms with sexual reproduction, the presence of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is common. The main explanations for this phenomenon are based on sexual selection or the fecundity advantage hypothesis (natural selection). Here, we tested Rensch's rule in species of the viviparous lizard genus Phymaturus; additionally, we tested if there is a pattern of sexual size dimorphism or if it depends upon other morphological traits. We found no evidence for Rensch's rule in these lizards. After testing for multiple or single regime evolutionary models, we found that body size most likely evolved under multiregime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolutionary model; the same was observed for abdomen width in females, a fecundity advantage hypothesis trait. For species with female biased SSD there is a positive relationship between snout-vent length and width of the belly, supporting the fecundity advantage hypothesis. Additionally, the relationship between brood size and brood mass with body size and body mass (respectively) were positive giving strength to the fecundity advantage hypothesis. Finally, our results show males did not show a clear pattern in relation to the sexual selection hypothesis, probably because sexual selection is a complex aspect that involves behavior and color. On the other hand, female body size and reproductive output are related to mean seasonal air temperature and its combination with mean annual air temperature in an evolutionary fashion framework, such as fecundity advantage hypothesis in these lizards.

TI  - Genome of a giant isopod, Bathynomus jamesi, provides insights into body size evolution and adaptation to deep-sea environment
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The deep-sea may be regarded as a hostile living environment, due to low temperature, high hydrostatic pressure, and limited food and light. Isopods, a species-rich group of crustaceans, are widely distributed across different environments including the deep sea and as such are a useful model for studying adaptation, migration, and speciation. Similar to other deep-sea organisms, giant isopods have larger body size than their shallow water relatives and have large stomachs and fat bodies presumably to store organic reserves. In order to shed light on the genetic basis of these large crustaceans adapting to the oligotrophic environment of deep-sea, the high-quality genome of a deep-sea giant isopod Bathynomus jamesi was sequenced and assembled. Results: B. jamesi has a large genome of 5.89 Gb, representing the largest sequenced crustacean genome to date. Its large genome size is mainly attributable to the remarkable proliferation of transposable elements (84%), which may enable high genome plasticity for adaptive evolution. Unlike its relatives with small body size, B. jamesi has expanded gene families related to pathways of thyroid and insulin hormone signaling that potentially contribute to its large body size. Transcriptomic analysis showed that some expanded gene families related to glycolysis and vesicular transport were specifically expressed in its digestive organs. In addition, comparative genomics and gene expression analyses in six tissues suggested that B. jamesi has inefficient lipid degradation, low basal metabolic rate, and bulk food storage, suggesting giant isopods adopt a more efficient mechanism of nutrient absorption, storage, and utilization to provide sustained energy supply for their large body size. Conclusions: Taken together, the giant isopod genome may provide a valuable resource for understanding body size evolution and adaptation mechanisms of macrobenthic organisms to deep-sea environments. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Convergence of life history and physiology during range expansion toward the phenotype of the native sister species
VL  - 816
AB  - In our globally changing planet many species show range expansions whereby they encounter new thermal regimes that deviate from those of their source region. Pressing questions are to what extent and through which mechanisms, plasticity and/or evolution, species respond to the new thermal regimes and whether these trait changes are adaptive. Using a common-garden experiment, we tested for plastic and evolutionary trait changes in life history and a set of understudied biochemical/physiological traits during the range expansion of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from France into a warmer region in Spain. To assess the adaptiveness of the trait changes we used the phenotype of its native sister species in Spain, I. graellsii, as proxy for the locally adapted phenotype. While our design cannot fully exclude maternal effects, our results suggest that edge populations adapted to the local conditions in the newly invaded region through the evolution of a faster pace-of-life (faster development and growth rates), a smaller body size, a higher energy budget and increased expression levels of the heat shock gene DnaJ. Notably, based on convergence toward the phenotype of the native sister species and its thermal responses, and the fit with predictions of life history theory these potential evolutionary changes were likely adaptive. Nevertheless, the convergence toward the native sister species is incomplete for thermal plasticity in traits associated with anaerobic metabolism and melanization. Our results highlight that evolution might at least partly contribute in an adaptive way to the persistence of populations during range expansion into new thermal environments and should be incorporated when predicting and understanding species' range expansions.

TI  - Graphene oxide as a new anthropogenic stress factor - multigenerational study at the molecular, cellular, individual and population level of Acheta domesticus
VL  - 396
AB  - Although interest in transgenerational phenomena is constantly growing, little is known about the long-term toxicity of nanoparticles. In this study we investigate the multigenerational effects of graphene oxide (GO) which was given to Acheta domesticus in low doses (0.2, 2 and 20 μg·g-1 of food) for three subsequent generations. We assessed the influence of GO nanoparticles in many contexts, basing on parameters which represented different levels of biological organization: activity of antioxidant enzymes, level of apoptosis, DNA damage, histological analysis, hatching abilities, body mass and body length of insects, as well as their survival rate. The results have shown that exposing insects to nanoparticles over an extended period of time causes surprising intergenerational effects, based on significant differences in the life cycle and reproductive processes, which are not always dose-dependent. The second generation of insects appeared as the most unstable among the parameters that were studied, and did not match trends and patterns in the first and third generation categories. An increase of DNA damage was observed, but only in the third generation. This reduction of genome stability can be perceived as an essential element of adaptation, leading to an increase of genotype variants, which then undergo selection. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fitness effects for Ace insecticide resistance mutations are determined by ambient temperature
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Insect pest control programs often use periods of insecticide treatment with intermittent breaks, to prevent fixing of mutations conferring insecticide resistance. Such mutations are typically costly in an insecticide-free environment, and their frequency is determined by the balance between insecticide treatment and cost of resistance. Ace, a key gene in neuronal signaling, is a prominent target of many insecticides and across several species, three amino acid replacements (I161V, G265A, and F330Y) provide resistance against several insecticides. Because temperature disturbs neuronal signaling homeostasis, we reasoned that the cost of insecticide resistance could be modulated by ambient temperature. Results: Experimental evolution of a natural Drosophila simulans population at hot and cold temperature regimes uncovered a surprisingly strong effect of ambient temperature. In the cold temperature regime, the resistance mutations were strongly counter selected (s = − 0.055), but in a hot environment, the fitness costs of resistance mutations were reduced by almost 50% (s = − 0.031). We attribute this unexpected observation to the advantage of the reduced enzymatic activity of resistance mutations in hot environments. Conclusion: We show that fitness costs of insecticide resistance genes are temperature-dependent and suggest that the duration of insecticide-free periods need to be adjusted for different climatic regions to reflect these costs. We suggest that such environment-dependent fitness effects may be more common than previously assumed and pose a major challenge for modeling climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).

VL  - 24
IS  - 8
SP  - 3837-3848
AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-moths—an insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal links—at both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50–3,200 m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measures—such as creating and improving urban green infrastructure—to mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 786
AB  - We used high-resolution (500 × 250 m) two-dimensional lithospheric-scale thermo-mechanical numerical modeling to unravel the unexpected topographic and thermal evolutions recorded during the necking phase of several rift systems worldwide. Through a systematic analysis we studied how the lithosphere rheology impacts the topographic and thermal evolutions across the entire width of magma-poor and sediment-starved rift systems until their crust is locally thinned to 10 km. We quantified the evolution of topography, uplift and subsidence rates, accommodation and emerged space creation, temperature and surface heat flow for a wide panel of crustal and mantle rheologies to provide an overview of possible rifting behaviors. Extension of a lithosphere for which the crust and mantle are mechanically decoupled by a weak lower crust generates complex morphotectonic evolutions, with the formation of temporarily restricted sub-basins framed by uplifted parts of the future distal margin. Mechanical decoupling between the crust and mantle controls also largely the thermal evolution of rift systems during the necking phase since, for equivalent extension rates and initial geotherms: (i) weak/decoupled lithospheres have a higher geothermal gradient at the end of the necking phase than strong/coupled lithospheres; and (ii) weak/decoupled lithospheres show intense heating of the lower crust at the rift center and intense cooling of the crust on either side of the rift center, unlike strong/coupled lithospheres. These behaviors contrast with the continuous subsidence and cooling predicted by the commonly used depth-uniform thinning model. Accommodation space in the evolving basins is first generated by vertical crustal velocities and subsequently by horizontal velocities causing the widening of the earlier formed basin. Processes such as strain softening and mantle fertilization have a limited impact on the primary morphology and thermal state of rift systems before the crust is thinned to 10 km but may locally amplify relief and thermal heterogeneities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Variability of functional traits and their syndromes in a freshwater fish species (Phoxinus phoxinus): The role of adaptive and nonadaptive processes
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SP  - 2833-2846
AB  - Functional traits can covary to form “functional syndromes.” Describing and understanding functional syndromes is an important prerequisite for predicting the effects of organisms on ecosystem functioning. At the intraspecific level, functional syndromes have recently been described, but very little is known about their variability among populations and—if they vary—what the ecological and evolutionary drivers of this variation are. Here, we quantified and compared the variability in four functional traits (body mass, metabolic rate, excretion rate, and boldness), their covariations and the subsequent syndromes among thirteen populations of a common freshwater fish (the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus). We then tested whether functional traits and their covariations, as well as the subsequent syndromes, were underpinned by the phylogenetic relatedness among populations (historical effects) or the local environment (i.e., temperature and predation pressure), and whether adaptive (selection or plasticity) or nonadaptive (genetic drift) processes sustained among-population variability. We found substantial among-population variability in functional traits and trait covariations, and in the emerging syndromes. We further found that adaptive mechanisms (plasticity and/or selection) related to water temperature and predation pressure modulated the covariation between body mass and metabolic rate. Other trait covariations were more likely driven by genetic drift, suggesting that nonadaptive processes can also lead to substantial differences in trait covariations among populations. Overall, we concluded that functional syndromes are population-specific, and that both adaptive and nonadaptive processes are shaping functional traits. Given the pivotal role of functional traits, differences in functional syndromes within species provide interesting perspectives regarding the role of intraspecific diversity for ecosystem functioning. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Cryptic genetic variation shapes the adaptive evolutionary potential of enzymes
VL  - 8
AB  - Genetic variation among orthologous proteins can cause cryptic phenotypic properties that only manifest in changing environments. Such variation may impact the evolvability of proteins, but the underlying molecular basis remains unclear. Here, we performed comparative directed evolution of four orthologous metallo-β-lactamases toward a new function and found that different starting genotypes evolved to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Despite a low initial fitness, one ortholog reached a significantly higher fitness plateau than its counterparts, via increasing catalytic activity. By contrast, the ortholog with the highest initial activity evolved to a less-optimal and phenotypically distinct outcome through changes in expression, oligomerization and activity. We show how cryptic molecular properties and conformational variation of active site residues in the initial genotypes cause epistasis, that could lead to distinct evolutionary outcomes. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the molecular details that connect genetic variation to protein function to improve the prediction of protein evolution. © Baier et al.

TI  - Exploring optimal topology of thermal cloaks by CMA-ES
VL  - 112
IS  - 6
AB  - This paper presents topology optimization for thermal cloaks expressed by level-set functions and explored using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Designed optimal configurations provide superior performances in thermal cloaks for the steady-state thermal conduction and succeed in realizing thermal invisibility, despite the structures being simply composed of iron and aluminum and without inhomogeneities caused by employing metamaterials. To design thermal cloaks, a prescribed objective function is used to evaluate the difference between the temperature field controlled by a thermal cloak and when no thermal insulator is present. The CMA-ES involves searches for optimal sets of level-set functions as design variables that minimize a regularized fitness involving a perimeter constraint. Through topology optimization subject to structural symmetries about four axes, we obtain a concept design of a thermal cloak that functions in an isotropic heat flux. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI  - Nanocalorimetry reveals the growth dynamics of Escherichia coli cells undergoing adaptive evolution during long-term stationary phase
VL  - 85
IS  - 15
AB  - Bacterial populations in long-term stationary-phase (LTSP) laboratory cultures can provide insights into physiological and genetic adaptations to lowenergy conditions and population dynamics in natural environments. While overall population density remains stable, these communities are very dynamic and are characterized by the rapid emergence and succession of distinct mutants expressing the growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype, which can reflect an increased capacity to withstand energy limitations and environmental stress. Here, we characterize the metabolic heat signatures and growth dynamics of GASP mutants within an evolving population using isothermal calorimetry. We aged Escherichia coli in anaerobic batch cultures over 20 days inside an isothermal nanocalorimeter and observed distinct heat events related to the emergence of three mutant populations expressing the GASP phenotype after 1.5, 3, and 7 days. Given the heat produced by each population, the maximum number of GASP mutant cells was calculated, revealing abundances of ~2.5×107, ~7.5×106, and ~9.9×106 cells in the populations, respectively. These data indicate that mutants capable of expressing the GASP phenotype can be acquired during the exponential growth phase and subsequently expressed in LTSP culture. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

TI  - Genetic variation underlies plastic responses to global change drivers in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
VL  - 289
IS  - 1981
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution enable population persistence in response to global change. However, there are few experiments that test how these processes interact within and across generations, especially in marine species with broad distributions experiencing spatially and temporally variable temperature and pCO2. We employed a quantitative genetics experiment with the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to decompose family-level variation in transgenerational and developmental plastic responses to ecologically relevant temperature and pCO2. Adults were conditioned to controlled non-upwelling (high temperature, low pCO2) or upwelling (low temperature, high pCO2) conditions. Embryos were reared in either the same conditions as their parents or the crossed environment, and morphological aspects of larval body size were quantified. We find evidence of family-level phenotypic plasticity in response to different developmental environments. Among developmental environments, there was substantial additive genetic variance for one body size metric when larvae developed under upwelling conditions, although this differed based on parental environment. Furthermore, cross-environment correlations indicate significant variance for genotype-by-environment interactive effects. Therefore, genetic variation for plasticity is evident in early stages of S. purpuratus, emphasizing the importance of adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity in organismal responses to global change. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Thermal physiological traits in tropical lowland amphibians: Vulnerability to climate warming and cooling
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
AB  - Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent ~65% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species’ thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species’ body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While CTmax and CTmin had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their CTmax, 25% might be moderately affected and 70% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3C temperature increase. © 2019 von May et al.

AB  - Development of embryos, larvae, and juveniles of Argopecten irradians concentricus were observed using an optical microscope, with a digital camera at water temperatures of 28°C to 29°C and salinity of 24 to 25. Zygotes began the first cleavage at 50 min post-fertilization, developed to D-shaped larvae between 22 and 24 h, and the larvae developed eye points and feet at day 11 and entered the attachment metamorphosis stage. There was no significant difference in the time of embryo development between the selective and control lines (P > 0.05). The shell length and shell height were not significantly different at the embryonic and early larval stages between the selective and control lines (P > 0.05), but there was a significant difference in shell length and shell height at the post-larval and attachment metamorphosis stages between the selective and control lines (P < 0.05). The metamorphosis and survival rates of the selective line were significantly different from those of the control line (P < 0.05), and the selective line has obvious advantages. The results show that the growth of the early planktonic larval stage of A. irradians concentricus was slow but at the post-larval and juvenile stages, it was rapid. The growth of shell length and shell height of A. irradians concentricus was not synchronized. The growth speed of shell length exceeded that of shell height at the earlier larval stage, and at the later larval stage, the growth speed of shell height exceeded that of shell length; at 28 to 30 days, shell height exceeded shell length. At the larval and juvenile stages, the growth of the selective line significantly exceeded that of the control line. The selective line has obvious growth advantages and growth potential. © 2018 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

TI  - A review of freshwater fish introductions to the Guangdong province, China
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SP  - 396-407
AB  - In the last few decades, non-native freshwater fishes have been introduced all over the world for economic purposes, including aquaculture and aquarium trade, as well as improvement for wild stocks resulting in adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. The Guangdong province of China is at a high risk of fish invasions owing to its warm and humid climate, abundance of water courses, flourishing aquaculture and ornamental fish trade, and extensive sea ports. A total of 160 non-native freshwater species were introduced in the Guangdong province and 71.9% of them were imported for aquarium purposes. Fourteen species have established self-sustaining populations and 21 species were found in the main river basin of the Guangdong province. Propagule pressure, rapid evolution and abundant resources in the environment were the factors likely to contribute to successful invasion by non-native fishes. The invasion of non-native fishes in the Guangdong province has already resulted in economic losses, decline of native species, as well as negative impacts on the functional diversity of native fish assemblages. To mitigate these effects and prevent future non-native fish invasions, scientists, policy makers and stakeholders should collaborate on the management of non-native fish introductions by developing risk assessments, statutory regulations, public education and scientific research. © 2019, Copyright © 2019 AEHMS.

TI  - Pace of life syndrome under warming and pollution: integrating life history, behavior, and physiology across latitudes
VL  - 89
IS  - 1
AB  - To fully comprehend and predict the impact of drivers of global change such as climate warming and pollution, integrated multi-trait approaches are needed. As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - The effect of sexual selection on adaptation and extinction under increasing temperatures
VL  - 285
IS  - 1877
AB  - Strong sexual selection has been reported to both enhance and hinder the adaptive capacity and persistence of populations when exposed to novel environments. Consequently, how sexual selection influences population adaption and persistence under stress remains widely debated. Here, we present two empirical investigations of the fitness consequences of sexual selection on populations of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, exposed to stable or gradually increasing temperatures. When faced with increasing temperatures, strong sexual selection was associated with both increased fecundity and offspring survival compared with populations experiencing weak sexual selection, suggesting sexual selection acts to drive adaptive evolution by favouring beneficial alleles. Strong sexual selection did not, however, delay extinction when the temperature became excessively high. By manipulating individuals’ mating opportunities during fitness assays, we were able to assess the effect of multiple mating independently from the effect of population-level sexual selection, and found that polyandry has a positive effect on both fecundity and offspring survival under increasing temperatures in those populations evolving with weak sexual selection. Within stable temperatures, there were some benefits from strong sexual selection but these were not consistent across the entire experiment, possibly reflecting changing costs and benefits of sexual selection under stabilizing and directional selection. These results indicate that sexual selection can provide a buffer against climate change and increase adaptation rates within a continuously changing environment. These positive effects of sexual selection may, however, be too small to protect populations and delay extinction when environmental changes are relatively rapid. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics Among Wolbachia Strains During Thermal Adaptation of Their Drosophila melanogaster Hosts
VL  - 11
AB  - Climate change is a major evolutionary force triggering thermal adaptation in a broad range of species. While the consequences of global warming are being studied for an increasing number of species, limited attention has been given to the evolutionary dynamics of endosymbionts in response to climate change. Here, we address this question by studying the dynamics of Wolbachia, a well-studied endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. D. melanogaster populations infected with 13 different Wolbachia strains were exposed to novel hot and cold laboratory environments for up to 180 generations. The short-term dynamics suggested a temperature-related fitness difference resulting in the increase of clade V strains in the cold environment only. Our long-term analysis now uncovers that clade V dominates in all replicates after generation 60 irrespective of temperature treatment. We propose that adaptation of the Drosophila host to either temperature or Drosophila C virus (DCV) infection are the cause of the replicated, temporally non-concordant Wolbachia dynamics. Our study provides an interesting case demonstrating that even simple, well-controlled experiments can result in complex, but repeatable evolutionary dynamics, thus providing a cautionary note on too simple interpretations on the impact of climate change. © Copyright © 2020 Mazzucco, Nolte, Vijayan and Schlötterer.

TI  - Climate warming can reduce biocontrol efficacy and promote plant invasion due to both genetic and transient metabolomic changes
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1387-1400
AB  - Climate change may affect plant–herbivore interactions and their associated ecosystem functions. In an experimental evolution approach, we subjected replicated populations of the invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia to a combination of simulated warming and herbivory by a potential biocontrol beetle. We tracked genomic and metabolomic changes across generations in field populations and assessed plant offspring phenotypes in a common environment. Using an integrated Bayesian model, we show that increased offspring biomass in response to warming arose through changes in the genetic composition of populations. In contrast, increased resistance to herbivory arose through a shift in plant metabolomic profiles without genetic changes, most likely by transgenerational induction of defences. Importantly, while increased resistance was costly at ambient temperatures, warming removed this constraint and favoured both vigorous and better defended plants under biocontrol. Climate warming may thus decrease biocontrol efficiency and promote Ambrosia invasion, with potentially serious economic and health consequences. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Size does matter — the eco-evolutionary effects of changing body size in fish
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 311-324
AB  - Body size acts as a proxy for many fitness-related traits. Body size is also subject to directional selection from various anthropogenic stressors such as increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, fisheries, as well as natural predators. Changes in individual body size correlate with changes in fecundity, behaviour, and survival and can propagate through populations and ecosystems by truncating age and size structures and changing predator–prey dynamics. In this review, we will explore the causes and consequences of changing body size in fish in the light of recent literature and relevant theories. We will investigate the central role of body size in ecology by first discussing the main selective agents that influence body size: Fishing, increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, and predation. We will then explore the impacts of these changes at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. Considering the relatively high heritability of body size, we will discuss how a change in body size can leave a genetic signature in the population and translate to a change in the evolutionary potential of the species. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - A meta-analysis of ungulate predation and prey selection by the brown bear Ursus arctos in Eurasia
VL  - 64
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-9
AB  - At the biogeographic scale, spatial variation in diets may reflect not only the ecological flexibility of carnivore feeding habits, but also evolutionary adaptations of different populations within a species. We described the large-scale pattern in brown bear Ursus arctos predation on ungulates, its selectivity for ungulate species, and its relative role in ungulate mortality. We collated data from 63 studies in Europe and Asia and analyzed them in relation to annual temperature. Ungulate meat makes up, on average, 8.7% of brown bear diets, with European bears feeding on ungulates more (mean 10.5%) than Asiatic bears (6.8%). In Europe (but not in Asia), the percentage share of ungulates in bear diet was negatively related to the mean annual temperature. Northern populations of Asian bears consumed less ungulate meat than the respective populations in Europe, because of the widespread occurrence of Siberian pine Pinus sibirica and dwarf Siberian pine Pinus pumila, which produce relatively large, protein-rich seeds. In both continents, ungulates peak in the diet of bears in spring. Brown bears’ preference for 10 species of ungulates increased with body mass of prey. The bear significantly preferred preying upon moose Alces alces throughout its range. Bears were the most important predator of moose and caused, on average, 23% of total natural mortality in moose populations. Brown bear preference for moose and its dominant role in moose mortality suggest an evolutionary predator–prey relationship between these two species. Brown bears illustrate that even an apparently omnivorous predator can prefer one prey species. © 2018, The Author(s).

SP  - 205-230
AB  - In this chapter, I explore evolutionary explanations for humor and creativity, via humor production-the ability to generate a verbal comment or behavior that other people find funny. Proposed evolutionary mechanisms for the origin of the human capacity for humor production include Darwinian natural selection and sexual selection. Natural selection explanations for humor are hampered by the difficulty of distinguishing genuine adaptations from evolutionary by-products, and by a problematic emphasis on group selection. A sexual selection view of humor as a trait-indicator of genetic fitness has been studied extensively and boasts impressive empirical support. Alternatives to the trait-indicator view, such as the use of humor to signal compatibility, interest, or warmth, have also been suggested. The wide range of interpersonal contexts in which humor production can play out suggests a pluralism of mechanisms underlying humor production ability-rich fodder for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Maternal nesting behaviour in city dragons: A species with temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Urban environments present some of the greatest challenges to species survival. This is particularly true for species that exhibit thermally sensitive traits, such as temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). This is because urban environments not only present species with entirely novel ecosystems, but species will also experience increased temperatures. These temperature increases may result not only in offspring mortality, but also skewed population sex ratios. To persist in cities, urban dwellers with TSD will therefore need to adjust the temperature of the nesting environment, either through phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution through natural selection. Here, we investigate the nesting ecology of a long-lived, urban dwelling reptile, the eastern water dragon (Intellagama lesueurii), to understand how a TSD species may respond to urban environments. Based on data collected from 72 nests over 2 nesting seasons, we show that city dragons not only dug significantly deeper nests than previously observed across their natural riparian habitat, but also nested in novel substrates. Furthermore, we observed a behaviour not previously described in this species, where mothers travel outside of their core home range to nest. This excursion behaviour potentially represents a greater maternal investment and is linked to the selection of specific microhabitats. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Temperature variation makes an ectotherm more sensitive to global warming unless thermal evolution occurs
VL  - 88
IS  - 4
SP  - 624-636
AB  - To assess long-term impacts of global warming on species, there is growing interest in latitudinal intraspecific patterns in thermal adaptation. Yet, while both mean temperatures and daily temperature fluctuations (DTFs) are expected to increase under global warming, latitudinal differences in the effects of DTFs have not been documented. We tested whether low-latitude populations of an ectotherm deal better with greater DTF than high-latitude populations, especially at a high mean temperature close to the optimal temperature for growth where DTF causes exposure to extreme high temperatures. We evaluated the impact of DTFs when assessing the effect of gradual thermal evolution at the high latitude with a space-for-time substitution. We compared effects of both mean temperatures (20 and 24°C) and DTFs (constant = 0°C, low = 5°C and high = 10°C) on growth rates between low-latitude and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans in a common-garden experiment. DTFs, if anything, reduced growth and were generally stressful as indicated by reductions in body condition, antioxidant defence and metabolic rate, and increases in oxidative damage. Most negative effects of DTFs were only present at a mean of 24°C when too high temperatures were reached during a daily cycle. Notably, while 4°C warming was beneficial in terms of growth rate at both latitudes at a constant temperature regime, this changed in a negative effect at high DTF. Moreover, this modulating effect of the mean temperature by DTF differed between latitudes indicating local thermal adaptation. While 4°C warming at low DTF still caused faster growth in low-latitude larvae, it already slowed growth in high-latitude larvae. This supports the emerging insight that warming would increase growth in high-latitude larvae in the absence of DTF, yet would decrease growth in the more realistic scenarios with DTF. In contrast, a space-for-time substitution approach suggested that under gradual thermal evolution, the evolved high-latitude larvae would no longer suffer a growth reduction in the presence of DTF. Our study provided important proof-of-principle that jointly integrating gradual thermal evolution and the expected increase in DTF generates opposing predictions of effects of global warming on this ectotherm. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Visible and near-infrared radiation may be transmitted or absorbed differently by beetle elytra according to habitat preference
VL  - 2019
IS  - 11
AB  - Background: The exoskeleton of an insect could be an important factor in the success of its evolutionary process. This reaches its maximum expression in beetles, which constitute the most diversified animal taxon. The involvement in the management of environmental radiation could be one of the most important functions of the exoskeleton due to the passive contributions to the thermoregulation of body temperature. We study whether the elytra of two sympatric and closely related beetle species respond differentially to the radiation of distinct wavelengths in agreement with their ecological preferences. Methods: Onthophagus coenobita (Herbst) and O. medius (Kugelaan) occupy different habitats and environmental conditions (shaded vs. unshaded from solar radiation). The potential adaptive variations to thermoregulation under these different ecological conditions were studied using the responses of their exoskeletons to radiation of different wavelengths (ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared). For these two species, the amounts of the three wavelengths that were reflected, transmitted or absorbed by the exoskeleton were measured using of a spectrophotometer. In addition, the darkness and thickness of the elytra were examined to determine whether these two features influence the management of radiation by the exoskeleton. Results: Both species differ in the management of visible and near-infrared radiation. In agreement with habitat preferences, the species inhabiting shaded conditions would allow infrared and visible radiation to penetrate the elytra more easily to heat internal body parts, while the elytra of the heliophilous species would have increased absorbance of these same types of radiation. An increase in body size (and therefore in elytron thickness) and the quantity of dark spots may serve as barriers against exogenous heat gain. However, the maintenance of between-species differences independent of the effects of these two morphological features led us to suspect that an unconsidered elytron characteristic may also be affecting these differences. Discussion: The results of the involvement of the exoskeleton thickness and spots in the thermoregulation of insects opens new research lines to obtain a better understanding of the function of the exoskeleton as a passive thermoregulation mechanism in Coleoptera. © 2019 Cuesta et al.

TI  - Evolutionary rescue at different rates of environmental change is affected by trade-offs between short-term performance and long-term survival
VL  - 34
IS  - 7
SP  - 1177-1184
AB  - As climate change accelerates and habitats free from anthropogenic impacts diminish, populations are forced to migrate or to adapt quickly. Evolutionary rescue (ER) is a phenomenon, in which a population is able to avoid extinction through adaptation. ER is considered to be more likely at slower rates of environmental change. However, the effects of correlated characters on evolutionary rescue are seldom explored yet correlated characters could play a major role in ER. We tested how evolutionary background in different fluctuating environments and the rate of environmental change affect the probability of ER by exposing populations of the bacteria Serratia marcescens to two different rates of steady temperature increase. As suggested by theory, slower environmental change allowed populations to grow more effectively even at extreme temperatures, but at the expense of long-term survival at extreme conditions due to correlated selection. Our results indicate important gap of knowledge on the effects of correlated selection during the environmental change and on evolutionary rescue at differently changing environments. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 74

SP  - 283-289
AB  - Little research has been done on egg diapause and the embryonic development of water mites. The aim of this study was to check the impact of temperature and periods of light on hatching of larvae of Eylais extendens. Three batches of eggs which were spawned on 30 July were placed at one of three temperatures (4, 10 and 20 A degrees C) and two periods of light (7 and 14 h per day). Egg hatching (both, percentage of hatched larvae and rate of hatching) was found to differ between 4 versus 10 A degrees C and between 4 versus 20 A degrees C, but not between 10 versus 20 A degrees C. The periods of light had no influence on hatching. This synchronization of hatching, enabling the eggs to emerge from diapause in the spring, could be considered an evolutionary adaptation aimed at postponing hatching of late-spawned eggs until a time allowing for completion of the full development cycle, including the parasitic larval stage.

VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - A few experimental studies on thermal tactile perception have shown the influence of the thermal contact resistance which relates to contact surface roughness and pressure. In this paper, the theoretical influence of the skin thickness and the thermal contact resistance is studied on the thermal model describing the temperature evolution in skin and materials when they come in contact. The thermal theoretical profile for reproducing a thermal cue for given contact thermal resistance is also presented. Compared to existing models of thermal simulation, the method proposed here has the advantage that the parameters of skin structure and thermal contact resistance in target temperature profiles can be adjusted in thermal perception simulation according to different skin features or surface roughness if necessary. The experimental results of surface roughness recognition were also presented. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Physiology of Highly Radioresistant Escherichia coli After Experimental Evolution for 100 Cycles of Selection
VL  - 11
AB  - Ionizing radiation (IR) is lethal to most organisms at high doses, damaging every cellular macromolecule via induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Utilizing experimental evolution and continuing previous work, we have generated the most IR-resistant Escherichia coli populations developed to date. After 100 cycles of selection, the dose required to kill 99% the four replicate populations (IR9-100, IR10-100, IR11-100, and IR12-100) has increased from 750 Gy to approximately 3,000 Gy. Fitness trade-offs, specialization, and clonal interference are evident. Long-lived competing sub-populations are present in three of the four lineages. In IR9, one lineage accumulates the heme precursor, porphyrin, leading to generation of yellow-brown colonies. Major genomic alterations are present. IR9 and IR10 exhibit major deletions and/or duplications proximal to the chromosome replication terminus. Contributions to IR resistance have expanded beyond the alterations in DNA repair systems documented previously. Variants of proteins involved in ATP synthesis (AtpA), iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (SufD) and cadaverine synthesis (CadA) each contribute to IR resistance in IR9-100. Major genomic and physiological changes are emerging. An isolate from IR10 exhibits protein protection from ROS similar to the extremely radiation resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, without evident changes in cellular metal homeostasis. Selection is continuing with no limit to IR resistance in evidence as our E. coli populations approach levels of IR resistance typical of D. radiodurans. © Copyright © 2020 Bruckbauer, Martin, Minkoff, Veling, Lancaster, Liu, Trimarco, Bushnell, Lipzen, Wood, Sussman, Pennacchio and Cox.

TI  - Continued susceptibility of the wMEL wolbachia infection in Aedes aegypti to heat stress following field deployment and selection
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia are being deployed to control the spread of arboviruses around the world through blockage of viral transmission. Blockage by Wolbachia in some scenarios may be affected by the susceptibility of wMel to cyclical heat stress during mosquito larval development. We therefore evaluated the potential to generate a heat-resistant strain of wMel in Ae. aegypti through artificial laboratory selection and through exposure to field temperatures across multiple generations. To generate an artificially selected strain, wMel-infected females reared under cyclical heat stress were crossed to wMel-infected males reared at 26◦C. The low proportion of larvae that hatched founded the next generation, and this process was repeated for eight generations. The wMel heat-selected strain (wMel-HS) was similar to wMel (unselected) in its ability to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and restore compatibility when larvae were reared under cyclical heat stress, but wMel-HS adults exhibited reduced Wolbachia densities at 26◦C. To investigate the effects of field exposure, we compared the response of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns, Australia where the infection has been established for seven years, to a wMel-infected population maintained in the laboratory for approximately 60 generations. Field and laboratory strains of wMel did not differ in their response to cyclical heat stress or in their phenotypic effects at 26◦C. The capacity for the wMel infection in Ae. aegypti to adapt to high temperatures therefore appears limited, and alternative strains may need to be considered for deployment in environments where high temperatures are regularly experienced in mosquito breeding sites. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Loss of transcriptional plasticity but sustained adaptive capacity after adaptation to global change conditions in a marine copepod
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Rapid adaptation will facilitate species resilience under global climate change, but its effects on plasticity are less commonly investigated. This study shows that 20 generations of experimental adaptation in a marine copepod drives a rapid loss of plasticity that carries costs and might have impacts on future resilience to environmental change. Adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity will fuel resilience in the geologically unprecedented warming and acidification of the earth's oceans, however, we have much to learn about the interactions and costs of these mechanisms of resilience. Here, using 20 generations of experimental evolution followed by three generations of reciprocal transplants, we investigated the relationship between adaptation and plasticity in the marine copepod, Acartia tonsa, in future global change conditions (high temperature and high CO2). We found parallel adaptation to global change conditions in genes related to stress response, gene expression regulation, actin regulation, developmental processes, and energy production. However, reciprocal transplantation showed that adaptation resulted in a loss of transcriptional plasticity, reduced fecundity, and reduced population growth when global change-adapted animals were returned to ambient conditions or reared in low food conditions. However, after three successive transplant generations, global change-adapted animals were able to match the ambient-adaptive transcriptional profile. Concurrent changes in allele frequencies and erosion of nucleotide diversity suggest that this recovery occurred via adaptation back to ancestral conditions. These results demonstrate that while plasticity facilitated initial survival in global change conditions, it eroded after 20 generations as populations adapted, limiting resilience to new stressors and previously benign environments.

TI  - Remarkable insensitivity of acorn ant morphology to temperature decouples the evolution of physiological tolerance from body size under urban heat islands
VL  - 85
AB  - Environmental temperature can alter body size and thermal tolerance, yet the effects of temperature rise on the size-tolerance relationship remain unclear. Terrestrial ectotherms with larger body sizes typically exhibit greater tolerance of high (and low) temperatures. However, while warming tends to increase tolerance of high temperatures through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change, warming tends to decrease body size through these mechanisms and thus might indirectly contribute to worse tolerance of high temperatures. These contrasting effects of warming on body size, thermal tolerance, and their relationship are increasingly important in light of global climate change. Here, we used replicated urban heat islands to explore the size-tolerance relationship in response to warming. We performed a common garden experiment with a small acorn-dwelling ant species collected from urban and rural populations across three different cities and reared under five laboratory rearing temperatures from 21 to 29 °C. We found that acorn ant body size was remarkably insensitive to laboratory rearing temperature (ant workers exhibited no phenotypic plasticity in body size across rearing temperature) and among populations experiencing cooler rural versus warmer urban environmental temperatures (no evolved differences in body size between urban and rural populations). Further, this insensitivity of body size to temperature was highly consistent across each of the three cities we examined. Because body size was robust to temperature variation, previously described plastic and evolved shifts in heat (and cold) tolerance in acorn ant responses to urbanization were shown to be independent of shifts in body size. Indeed, genetic (colony-level) correlations between heat and cold tolerance traits and body size revealed no significant association between size and tolerance. Our results show how typical trait correlations, such as between size and thermal tolerance, might be decoupled as populations respond to contemporary environmental change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 30
IS  - 23
SP  - 6370-6386
AB  - Climate warming, in particular in island environments, where opportunities for species to disperse are limited, may become a serious threat to cold adapted alpine species. In order to understand how alpine species may respond to a warming world, we need to understand the drivers that have shaped their habitat specialisation and the evolutionary adaptations that allow them to utilize alpine habitats. The endemic, endangered New Zealand kea (Nestor notabilis) is considered the only alpine parrot in the world. As a species commonly found in the alpine zone it may be highly susceptible to climate warming. But is it a true alpine specialist? Is its evolution driven by adaptation to the alpine zone, or is the kea an open habitat generalist that simply uses the alpine zone to, for example, avoid lower lying anthropogenic landscapes? We use whole genome data of the kea and its close, forest adapted sister species, the kākā (Nestor meridionalis) to reconstruct the evolutionary history of both species and identify the functional genomic differences that underlie their habitat specialisations. Our analyses do not identify major functional genomic differences between kea and kākā in pathways associated with high-altitude. Rather, we found evidence that selective pressures on adaptations commonly found in alpine species are present in both Nestor species, suggesting that selection for alpine adaptations has not driven their divergence. Strongly divergent demographic responses to past climate warming between the species nevertheless highlight potential future threats to kea survival in a warming world. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Exposure to moderate environmental stress is one important source of evolutionary change. This evidence would support the hypothesis that hormesis is an evolutionary expectation. In this short review, I discuss relevant examples of genetic and phenotypic responses to moderate stress exposure that are compatible with hormesis and with paradigms of evolutionary theory such as evolutionary rescue or phenotypic plasticity. Genetic recombination, nonlethal mutations, activity of transposable elements, or gene expression are some of the molecular mechanisms through which hormesis might enable organisms to maintain or even increase evolutionary fitness in stressful environments. These mechanisms span the tree of life from plants to vertebrates. © The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Effects of temperature on growth and development of amphibian larvae across an altitudinal gradient in the Tibetan Plateau
VL  - 70

SP  - 239-250
AB  - Organisms living in extreme environments, such as amphibians inhabiting the Tibetan plateau, are faced with a magnitude of potentially strong selection pressures. With an average elevation exceeding 4500 m, the Tibetan plateau is mainly characterized by low temperatures, but little is known about the influence of this factor on the growth, development, and behaviour of amphibian larvae living in this environment. Using a common garden experiment, we studied the influence of temperatures on the early growth and development of tadpoles of the Tibetan brown frog (Rana kukunoris) endemic to the eastern Tibetan plateau. We discovered that temperature had a significant influence on early growth and development of the tadpoles, with those undergoing high-temperature treatment growing and developing faster than their siblings from a low-temperature treatment. However, high-altitude individuals grew faster than low-altitude individuals at low temperatures, while the opposite was true at high temperatures. These results support the temperature adaptation hypothesis, as tadpoles' growth and developmental rates were maximized at the temperatures experienced in their native environments. These results suggest that variation in ambient temperature, combined with evolutionary adaptation to temperature of local environments, is probably one of the most critical environmental factors shaping altitudinal differences in the growth and development of amphibian larvae on the Tibetan plateau. © 2020 Copyright 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

AB  - Thermal ecology and mate competition are both pervasive features of ecological adaptation. A surge of recent work has uncovered the diversity of ways in which temperature affects mating interactions and sexual selection. However, the potential for thermal biology and reproductive ecology to evolve together as organisms adapt to their thermal environment has been underappreciated. Here, we develop a series of hypotheses regarding (1) not only how thermal ecology affects mating system dynamics, but also how mating dynamics can generate selection on thermal traits; and (2) how the thermal consequences of mate competition favour the reciprocal co-adaptation of thermal biology and sexual traits. We discuss our hypotheses in the context of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory processes. We also call for future work integrating experimental and phylogenetic comparative approaches to understand evolutionary feedbacks between thermal ecology and sexual selection. Overall, studying reciprocal feedbacks between thermal ecology and sexual selection may be necessary to understand how organisms have adapted to the environments of the past and could persist in the environments of the future. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Stress Resistance Traits under Different Thermal Conditions in Drosophila subobscura from Two Altitudes
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - Simple Summary The global warming and rapid climate change that we are witnessing is generally influencing all of the living world, so all species must necessarily cope with these changes in order to survive. The ability to withstand environmental stress, especially during the last two decades, has been of great importance for any species' long-term survival. For that purpose, we studied these abilities in the Drosophila subobscura species, which is known to be a good model organism for studying adaptations to environmental changes such as in temperature. We chose to investigate thermal stress responses in D. subobscura populations from two different altitudes, through four traits linked to stress tolerance: desiccation resistance, heat knock-down resistance, starvation resistance, and chill coma recovery time. Correlations between the populations' origin and these traits were found, as well as the significant influence of the laboratory thermal conditions and sex on these traits showing that males and cold-adapted populations are expected to fare much worse in a fast-changing warming environment. Global warming and climate change are affecting many insect species in numerous ways. These species can develop diverse mechanisms as a response to variable environmental conditions. The rise in mean and extreme temperatures due to global warming and the importance of the population's ability to adapt to temperature stress will further increase. In this study, we investigated thermal stress response, which is considered to be one of the crucial elements of population fitness and survival in fast-changing environments. The dynamics and variation of thermal stress resistance traits in D. subobscura flies originating from two natural populations sampled from different altitudes were analysed. Three different temperature regimes (25 degrees C, 19 degrees C, and 16 degrees C) were used for the F1 progeny from both localities to establish six experimental groups and investigate stress resistance traits: desiccation resistance, heat knock-down resistance, starvation resistance, and chill-coma recovery time. We detected that laboratory thermal conditions and population origin may have an effect on the analysed traits, and that sex also significantly influences stress resistance. Individuals from the lower altitude reared at higher temperatures show inferior resistance to thermal shock.

TI  - SPEAD 1.0-Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics in a two-trait continuous fitness landscape applied to the Sargasso Sea
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 1949-1985
AB  - Diversity plays a key role in the adaptive capacity of marine ecosystems to environmental changes. However, modelling the adaptive dynamics of phytoplankton traits remains challenging due to the competitive exclusion of suboptimal phenotypes and the complexity of evolutionary processes leading to optimal phenotypes. Trait diffusion (TD) is a recently developed approach to sustain diversity in plankton models by introducing mutations, therefore allowing the adaptive evolution of functional traits to occur at ecological timescales. In this study, we present a model called Simulating Plankton Evolution with Adaptive Dynamics (SPEAD) that resolves the eco-evolutionary processes of a multi-trait plankton community. The SPEAD model can be used to evaluate plankton adaptation to environmental changes at different timescales or address ecological issues affected by adaptive evolution. Phytoplankton phenotypes in SPEAD are characterized by two traits, the nitrogen half-saturation constant and optimal temperature, which can mutate at each generation using the TD mechanism. SPEAD does not resolve the different phenotypes as discrete entities, instead computing six aggregate properties: total phytoplankton biomass, the mean value of each trait, trait variances, and the intertrait covariance of a single population in a continuous trait space. Therefore, SPEAD resolves the dynamics of the population's continuous trait distribution by solving its statistical moments, wherein the variances of trait values represent the diversity of ecotypes. The ecological model is coupled to a vertically resolved (1D) physical environment, and therefore the adaptive dynamics of the simulated phytoplankton population are driven by seasonal variations in vertical mixing, nutrient concentration, water temperature, and solar irradiance. The simulated bulk properties are validated by observations from Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Studies (BATS) in the Sargasso Sea. We find that moderate mutation rates sustain trait diversity at decadal timescales and soften the almost total inter-trait correlation induced by the environment alone, without reducing the annual primary production or promoting permanently maladapted phenotypes, as occur with high mutation rates. As a way to evaluate the performance of the continuous trait approximation, we also compare the solutions of SPEAD to the solutions of a classical discrete entities approach, with both approaches including TD as a mechanism to sustain trait variance. We only find minor discrepancies between the continuous model SPEAD and the discrete model, with the computational cost of SPEAD being lower by 2 orders of magnitude. Therefore, SPEAD should be an ideal eco-evolutionary plankton model to be coupled to a general circulation model (GCM) of the global ocean. © Author(s) 2021.

TI  - An analysis of direct and indirect effects in Drosophila melanogaster undergoing a few cycles of experimental evolution for stress-related traits
VL  - 263
AB  - The physiological mechanisms underpinning adaptations to starvation and cold stresses have been extensively studied in Drosophila, yet the understanding of correlated changes in stress-related and life-history traits, as well as the energetics of stress tolerance, still remains elusive. To answer the questions empirically in this context, we allowed D. melanogaster to evolve for either increased starvation or cold tolerance (24-generations / regime) in an experimental evolution system, and examined whether selection of either trait affects un-selected stress trait, as well as the impacts potential changes in life-history and mating success-related traits. Our results revealed remarkable changes in starvation/cold tolerance (up to 1.5-fold) as a direct effect of selection, while cold tolerance had been dramatically reduced (1.26-fold) in the starvation tolerant (ST) lines compared to control counterparts, although no such changes were evident in cold-tolerant (CT) lines. ST lines exhibited a higher level of body lipids and a reduced level of trehalose content, while CT lines accumulated a greater levels of body lipid and trehalose contents. Noticeably, we found that selection for starvation or cold tolerance positively correlates with larval development time, longevity, and copulation duration, indicating that these traits are among the most common targets of selection trajectories shaping stress tolerance. Altogether, this study highlights the complexity of mechanisms evolved in ST lines that contribute to enhanced starvation tolerance, but also negatively impact cold tolerance. Nevertheless, mechanisms foraging enhanced cold tolerance in CT lines appear not to target starvation tolerance. Moreover, the parallel changes in life history/mating success traits across stress regimes could indicate some generic pathways evolved in stressful environments, targeting life-history and mating success characteristics to optimize fitness. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sexual selection and conflict can act on genes with important metabolic functions, potentially shaping standing genetic variance in such genes and thus evolutionary potential of populations. Here, using experimental evolution, we show how reproductive competition intensity and thermal environment affect selection on phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6Pgdh)—a metabolic gene involved in sexual selection and conflict in the bulb mite. The S allele of 6Pgdh increases male success in reproductive competition, but is detrimental to S-bearing males’ partners. We found that the rate of the S allele spread increased with the proportion of males in the experimental populations, illustrating that harm to females is more easily compensated for males under more intense sexual competition. Furthermore, we found that under equal sex ratio, the S allele spreads faster at higher temperature. While the direction of selection on 6Pgdh was not reversed in any of the conditions we tested, which would be required for environmental heterogeneity to maintain polymorphism at this locus, our study highlights that ecological and sexual selection can jointly affect selection on important metabolic enzymes. © 2020 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Insight into the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial genomes in intertidal chitons
VL  - 87
IS  - 2
AB  - The intertidal zone is one of the most stressful environments, with extreme shifts in temperature, salinity, pH and oxygen concentration. Marine molluscs, particularly chitons that belong to the category of ecologically significant organisms, survive in this extreme environment, and are ideal systems for studying stress adaptation. Mitochondria are known to be critical for energy homeostasis, and changes in environmental factors result in their dysfunction and consequent injury to the organism. Intertidal organisms are exception in this respect because they are capable of maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Here, we used mitochondrial genetic components from seven chitons of the intertidal zone to infer phylogenetic relationships. Selection analyses on individual protein-coding genes (PCGs) were performed to identify and map potentially adaptive residues in the modelled structures of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The results showed significant amino acid changes in sites under diversifying selection for all the PCGs, indicating that the mitochondrial genome in chitons is undergoing adaptive evolution. Such sites were observed in the proton pump as well as in the translocation channel of the transmembrane helices and the surrounding loop regions, thus implying functional modification of the mitochondrial proteins essential for survival in the dynamic environment of the intertidal zone. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Microstructural tailoring of As-Selective Laser Melted Ti6Al4V alloy for high mechanical properties
VL  - 816
AB  - As-Selective Laser Melted (as-SLMed) Ti6Al4V in horizontal direction possess poor ductility because of acicular alpha' martensite and columnar beta grains in microstructure. However, traditional ductility improvement methods including high-temperature preheating or heat treatment will decrease not only strength but also the efficiency of SLM fabrication to application. For a satisfactory mechanical property of as-SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy, some special temperature evolution conditions brought about from processing parameters such as layer thickness, hatch spacing, energy density and area ratios between support structure and part, were carried out in the paper. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure. The microstructure of as-SLMed specimens are found to be different extent decomposing of alpha' martensite. Also, the formation mechanisms of such microstructural variables are proposed based on temperature evolution vs time during SLM process. Moreover, the tensile test presents high elongation (>8%) is achieved for horizontally as-SLMed Ti6Al4V specimens without lowering their strength (the ultimate tensile strength similar to 1260 +/- 30 MPa and yield strength similar to 1160 +/- 50 - MPa), which markedly exceed ASTM standard for castings. The mechanical proper- ties and fracture mechanisms of specimens are obviously affected by the width of alpha'/alpha martensite and the content of beta phase. This work marks an important step forward in the understanding of microstructural tailoring in SLM process for a high-performance Ti6Al4V alloy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 73
IS  - 9
SP  - 1885-1897
AB  - For microorganisms cycling between free-living and host-associated stages, where reproduction occurs in both of these lifestyles, an interesting inquiry is whether adaptation to stress during the free-living stage can impact microbial fitness in the host. To address this topic, the mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and the marine bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri was utilized. Using microbial experimental evolution, V. fischeri was selected to low (8°C), high (34°C), and fluctuating temperature stress (8°C/34°C) for 2000 generations. The temperatures 8°C and 34°C were the lower and upper growth limits, respectively. V. fischeri was also selected to benign temperatures (21°C and 28°C) for 2000 generations, which served as controls. V. fischeri demonstrated significant adaptation to low, high, and fluctuating temperature stress. V. fischeri did not display significant adaptation to the benign temperatures. Adaptation to stressful temperatures facilitated V. fischeri’s ability to colonize the squid host relative to the ancestral lines. Bioluminescence levels also increased. Evolution to benign temperatures did not manifest these results. In summary, microbial adaptation to stress during the free-living stage can promote coevolution between hosts and microorganisms. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - How to routinely assess transition, adhesion and survival of probiotics into the gut: a case study on propionibacteria
VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - 484-490
AB  - Two commercial promising probiotic strains (Propionibacterium jensenii and Propionibacterium freudenreichii) were studied to evaluate two basic probiotic requisites (adhesion and survival during the transit into the gut); two commercial starter cultures (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) were used as references. As an additional goal, the technological robustness was evaluated as growth as a function of pH, temperature and salt. Adhesion was studied as biofilm formation and hydrophobicity, whereas a simplified protocol was used to simulate the transit into the gut, along with the assessment of survival at pH 2.5 and in the presence of 0.3% bile salts. Propionibacteria were hydrophobic and form biofilm on glass slides, thus confirming the correlation of these properties and with the ability to adhere. None of the strains survived after the simulation of the transit into the gut, but this property could be induced in propionibacteria using a simple protocol of adaptive evolution. This paper suggests the possibility of using hydrophobicity as a screening tool to assess adhesion in propionibacteria and highlights the necessity of using a complete protocol of simulation of the gut to study the resistance to the conditions of stomach and intestine to avoid false-positive results. © 2017 Institute of Food Science and Technology

TI  - Trait evolution in tropical rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) trees is related to dry season intensity
VL  - 32
IS  - 12
SP  - 2638-2651
AB  - Drought shapes the distribution and survival of trees even in tropical wet forests, and the wood and leaf trait spectra are used to understand drought adaptations. However, trait variation may result from ontogenetic adjustment or be related to tree size and not reflect evolutionary adaptations. Intraspecific variation in adaptations to drought can be an important factor in a species’ distribution and response to climate change, but excluding potentially confounding factors and proving adaptive evolution are challenging. Provenance trials can identify hereditary variability. We analysed wood and leaf traits in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) tree clones from 15 locations in the Amazon basin that were planted in northern Thailand, controlled for tree size, tested for genetic relatedness and the phylogenetic signal in traits and compared trait variations with the climate at the location of origin. Correlations between traits and tree size were low. Intraspecific trait variation was similar to relationships in published among-species comparisons, and correlations among wood traits and correlations among leaf traits were stronger than between wood and leaf traits. Genotype explained 30%–70% of the trait variation, and traits differed in how much of this variation was controlled by location or the relatedness among clones. There was no correlation with mean temperature or total annual rainfall. However, rainfall in the driest quarter (19–199 mm) was strongly related to leaf mass per area, carbon isotopic composition and area-based nitrogen content (r2 = 0.54–0.70) and weaker to wood traits (vessel density and vessel lumen fraction). Trees from locations with a stronger dry season also had higher growth rates in Thailand. All traits correlating with climate showed a significant phylogenetic signal. We found no evidence of increased drought tolerance, but the trait spectrum and higher growth in trees from drier locations suggest that deciduous rubber trees have adapted via drought avoidance rather than tolerance. Our study also underlines the importance of looking at a suite of traits rather than individual ones to understand adaptive strategies.

TI  - Selection on phenotypic plasticity favors thermal canalization
VL  - 117
IS  - 47
SP  - 29767-29774
AB  - Climate change affects organisms worldwide with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences, often increasing population extinction risk. Climatic factors can increase the strength, variability, or direction of natural selection on phenotypic traits, potentially driving adaptive evolution. Phenotypic plasticity in relation to temperature can allow organisms to maintain fitness in response to increasing temperatures, thereby "buying time" for subsequent genetic adaptation and promoting evolutionary rescue. Although many studies have shown that organisms respond plastically to increasing temperatures, it is unclear if such thermal plasticity is adaptive. Moreover, we know little about how natural and sexual selection operate on thermal reaction norms, reflecting such plasticity. Here, we investigate how natural and sexual selection shape phenotypic plasticity in two congeneric and phenotypically similar sympatric insect species. We show that the thermal optima for longevity and mating success differ, suggesting temperature-dependent trade-offs between survival and reproduction in both sexes. Males in these species have similar thermal reaction norm slopes but have diverged in baseline body temperature (intercepts), being higher for the more northern species. Natural selection favored reduced thermal reaction norm slopes at high ambient temperatures, suggesting that the current level of thermal plasticity is maladaptive in the context of anthropogenic climate change and that selection now promotes thermal canalization and robustness. Our results show that ectothermic animals also at high latitudes can suffer from overheating and challenge the common view of phenotypic plasticity as being beneficial in harsh and novel environments. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Ready on arrival: Standing variation at a chromosomal inversion contributes to rapid adaptation in an invasive marine crab
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-40
AB  - In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Tepolt et al. (2021) illustrate how the genetic architecture of adaptation and life history influence invasive success. A marvel of many invasive species is that they are incredibly successful despite evolutionary expectations that they will have low adaptive potential and suffer inbreeding depression due to initially small founding population sizes. Determining the combinations of ecoevolutionary factors that permit this apparent "genetic paradox of invasions" is an ongoing endeavour of invasive species research. Tepolt et al. (2021) study the European green crab in its invasive range on the North American west coast. Following a single introduction into California, this crab quickly spread across a wide latitude gradient, despite low diversity in the original founding population. Adaptation of this crab to clinal variation in temperature appeared largely driven by an inferred chromosomal inversion. This inversion exists as a balanced polymorphism in the European home range of green crabs and is associated with thermal tolerance. Tepolt et al. (2021) therefore demonstrate that adaptive evolution post introduction need not be impeded by bottlenecks if variation at key parts of the genome is available and can be maintained in introduced populations. Moreover, Tepolt et al. (2021) show how chromosomal inversions acting as large-effect loci might facilitate rapid responses to selection in introduced populations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

SP  - 301-312
AB  - Larvae of three latitudinally different populations of Drosophila jambulina belonging to the montium subgroup were tested for pupation site preference in relation to temperature. At 30 °C, larvae preferred to pupate on food whereas at 21 °C pupation occurred on the cotton. Genetic basis of larval pupation behavior was studied by conducting reciprocal crosses for 30 generations on food-selected and on cotton-selected pupae. Results from genetic analysis between food-selected and cotton-selected strains indicated a single gene responsible for the pupation site preference, with F1 progeny pupated on cotton and F2 (F1 × F1) larvae pupated on both food as well as on cotton. Although we found no change in morphological traits in food vs cotton selected populations, significantly different growth rate (body weight) between the two strains was observed. These results suggest that pupation site preferences can affect life-history traits in D. jambulina. © 2019, © 2019 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

TI  - The circadian clock uses different environmental time cues to synchronize emergence and locomotion of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Life on earth adapted to the daily reoccurring changes in environment by evolving an endogenous circadian clock. Although the circadian clock has a crucial impact on survival and behavior of solitary bees, many aspects of solitary bee clock mechanisms remain unknown. Our study is the first to show that the circadian clock governs emergence in Osmia bicornis, a bee species which overwinters as adult inside its cocoon. Therefore, its eclosion from the pupal case is separated by an interjacent diapause from its emergence in spring. We show that this bee species synchronizes its emergence to the morning. The daily rhythms of emergence are triggered by temperature cycles but not by light cycles. In contrast to this, the bee’s daily rhythms in locomotion are synchronized by light cycles. Thus, we show that the circadian clock of O. bicornis is set by either temperature or light, depending on what activity is timed. Light is a valuable cue for setting the circadian clock when bees have left the nest. However, for pre-emerged bees, temperature is the most important cue, which may represent an evolutionary adaptation of the circadian system to the cavity-nesting life style of O. bicornis. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Higher comfort temperature preferences for anthropometrically matched Chinese and Japanese versus white-western-middle-European individuals using a personal comfort / cooling system
VL  - 183
AB  - Purpose: To investigate potential differences in preferred Personal Comfort Systems (PCS) settings of Japanese and Han-Chinese versus white-western-middle-Europeans. Method: A series of five experiments (n=167) with similar methodology is reported that allowed participants to self-select their preferred PCS outlet air temperature in a warm controlled climatic chamber setup with and without solar radiation. Test groups were matched for age, height, weight, body-surface-area and body-mass-index to remove the influence of these confounding factors on the results. Participants were first exposed to solar radiation (exp-1-4; simulating glazed building without proper shading or a car) before starting to control the outlet temperature of the PCS, or (exp-5, simulating warm building) were exposed to a warm room temperature and immediately could control the PCS. Ethnicity effects were studied through the chosen preferred PCS outlet temperatures and the microclimate temperature close to the participants’ chest. Results: In all experiments, Asian groups selected a PCS outlet temperature significantly higher, on average by 5 °C, leading to a 1.9 °C higher microclimate temperature at chest level. While absolute selected temperatures of the PCS differed between experiments, related to different designs of the PCS and climate conditions, no interaction between ethnicity and experiment was present. Conclusions: Despite removing important confounding factors that could explain earlier observed differences between Asian and white western middle-European ethnicities tested, a substantial, consistently higher thermal preference temperature of the PCS was found in the two Asian groups. This has implications for the design parameters of PCS for use in offices or air-conditioning systems in cars. © 2020 The Authors

VL  - 30
IS  - 9
SP  - 1420-1429
AB  - Corynebacterium glutamicum, an important industrial strain, has a relatively slower reproduction rate. To acquire a growth-boosted C. glutamicum, a descendant strain was isolated from a continuous culture after 600 generations. The isolated descendant C. glutamicum, JH41 strain, was able to double 58% faster (td=1.15 h) than the parental type strain (PT, td=1.82 h). To understand the factors boosting reproduction, the transcriptomes of JH41 and PT strains were compared. The mRNAs involved in respiration and TCA cycle were upregulated. The intracellular ATP of the JH41 strain was 50% greater than the PT strain. The upregulation of NCgl1610 operon (a putative dyp-type heme peroxidase, a putative copper chaperone, and a putative copper importer) that presumed to role in the assembly and redox control of cytochrome c oxidase was found in the JH41 transcriptome. Plasmid-driven expression of the operon enabled the PT strain to double 19% faster (td=1.82 h) than its control (td=2.17 h) with 14% greater activity of cytochrome c oxidase and 27% greater intracellular ATP under the oxidative stress conditions. Upregulations of genes those might enhance translation fitness were also found in the JH41 transcriptome. Plasmid-driven expressions of NCgl0171 (encoding a cold-shock protein) and NCgl2435 (encoding a putative peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase) enabled the PT to double 22% and 32% faster than its control, respectively (empty vector: td=1.93 h, CspA: td=1.58 h, and Pth: td=1.44 h). Based on the results, the factors boosting growth rate in C. gluctamicum were further discussed in the viewpoints of cellular energy state, oxidative stress management, and translation.

TI  - Experimental evolution of west nile virus at higher temperatures facilitates broad adaptation and increased genetic diversity
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV, Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus introduced to North America in 1999. Since 1999, the Earth’s average temperature has increased by 0.6◦C. Mosquitoes are ectothermic organisms, reliant on environmental heat sources. Temperature impacts vector–virus interactions which directly influence arbovirus transmission. RNA viral replication is highly error-prone and increasing temperature could further increase replication rates, mutation frequencies, and evolutionary rates. The impact of temperature on arbovirus evolutionary trajectories and fitness landscapes has yet to be sufficiently studied. To investigate how temperature impacts the rate and extent of WNV evolution in mosquito cells, WNV was experimentally passaged 12 times in Culex tarsalis cells, at 25◦C and 30◦C. Full-genome deep sequencing was used to compare genetic signatures during passage, and replicative fitness was evaluated before and after passage at each temperature. Our results suggest adaptive potential at both temperatures, with unique temperature-dependent and lineage-specific genetic signatures. Further, higher temperature passage was associated with significantly increased replicative fitness at both temperatures and increases in nonsynonymous mutations. Together, these data indicate that if similar selective pressures exist in natural systems, increases in temperature could accelerate emergence of high-fitness strains with greater phenotypic plasticity. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Reductions in body size of benthic macroinvertebrates as a precursor of the early Toarcian (Early Jurassic) extinction event in the Lusitanian Basin, Portugal
VL  - 45
IS  - 2
SP  - 296-316
AB  - Reduction of body size is a common response of organisms to environmental stress. Studying the early Toarcian succession in the Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, we tested whether the shell size of benthic marine communities of bivalves and brachiopods changed at and before the global, warming-related Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE). Statistical analyses of shell size over time show that the mean shell size of communities decreased significantly before the T-OAE. This trend is distinct in brachiopods and is caused by larger-sized species becoming less abundant over time, whereas it is not significant in bivalves, suggesting a decoupled response to environmental stress. Reductions in shell size precede the decline in standardized sample-level species richness associated with the early Toarcian extinction event. Such decreases in the shell size of marine invertebrates, well before the onset of biodiversity change, suggest that reductions in body size more generally may be a precursor of a subsequent loss of species and turnover at the community level caused by climate change. Sedimentological evidence is against hypoxia as a driver of extinction and the preceding size decrease in the brachiopod fauna in the studied succession, although low oxygen levels are widely held responsible for elevated early Toarcian extinction rates globally. Reduction of mean shell size in brachiopods but stasis in bivalves is difficult to explain with ocean acidification, because experimental work shows that brachiopods can be resilient to lowered pH, albeit long-term metabolic costs and potential evolutionary adaptations are unknown. Rising early Toarcian temperatures in the Lusitanian Basin seem to be a plausible factor in both diversity decline associated with the T-OAE and the preceding reductions in mean shell size, because thermal tolerances in modern bivalves are among the highest within marine invertebrates.

TI  - How do phenology, plasticity, and evolution determine the fitness consequences of climate change for montane butterflies?
VL  - 11
IS  - 8
SP  - 1231-1244
AB  - Species have responded to climate change via seasonal (phenological) shifts, morphological plasticity, and evolutionary adaptation, but how these responses contribute to changes and variation in population fitness are poorly understood. We assess the interactions and relative importance of these responses for fitness in a montane butterfly, Colias eriphyle, along an elevational gradient. Because environmental temperatures affect developmental rates of each life stage, populations along the gradients differ in phenological timing and the number of generations each year. Our focal phenotype, wing solar absorptivity of adult butterflies, exhibits local adaptation across elevation and responds plastically to developmental temperatures. We integrate climatic data for the past half-century with microclimate, developmental, biophysical, demographic, and evolutionary models for this system to predict how phenology, plasticity, and evolution contribute to phenotypic and fitness variation along the gradient. We predict that phenological advancements incompletely compensate for climate warming, and also influence morphological plasticity. Climate change is predicted to increase mean population fitness in the first seasonal generation at high elevation, but decrease mean fitness in the summer generations at low elevation. Phenological shifts reduce the interannual variation in directional selection and morphology, but do not have consistent effects on variation in mean fitness. Morphological plasticity and its evolution can substantially increase population fitness and adaptation to climate change at low elevations, but environmental unpredictability limits adaptive plastic and evolutionary responses at high elevations. Phenological shifts also decrease the relative fitness advantages of morphological plasticity and evolution. Our results illustrate how the potential contributions of phenological and morphological plasticity and of evolution to climate change adaptation can vary along environmental gradients and how environmental variability will limit adaptive responses to climate change in montane regions. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - To deliver steady electric power with decent quality, intelligent and healthy control schemes are greatly necessary for automatic generation control (AGC) of power systems therefore, this work presents the design of two degree of freedom based tilt integral derivative controller with filter for AGC. Firstly, a two-area reheat thermal model is considered, and the gain of the controller are optimized by adaptive differential evolution method. The advantage of the suggested approach is validated by equating results with latest published approaches such as symbiotic organism search algorithm and articial bee colony tuned PID controller. Further, the suggested method is extended to a three unequal area thermal model and the performance of results are equated with teaching-learning based optimization-PIDD and firey algorithm-PID for the identical model. Lastly, the experiment of the proposed scheme has been employed in real-time simulation using OPAL-RT, for validation of its viability and cogency. © 2020 Jagan Mohana Rao Chintu et al., published by Sciendo 2020.

VL  - 126
IS  - 5
SP  - 859-868
AB  - Geographic and environmental isolations of islands and the mainland offer excellent opportunity to investigate colonization and survival dynamics of island populations. We inferred and compared evolutionary processes and the demographic history of Rhododendron tsusiophyllum, in the Izu Islands and the much larger island Honshu, treated here as the mainland, using thousands of nuclear SNPs obtained by ddRAD-seq from eight populations of R. tsusiophyllum and three populations of R. tschonoskii as an outgroup. Phylogenetic relationships and their habitats suggest that R. tsusiophyllum had evolved and migrated from cold north to warm south regions. We detected clear genetic divergence among populations in three regions of Honshu and the Izu Islands, suggesting restricted migration between them due to isolated habitats on mountains even in the mainland. The three regions have different changes in effective population size, especially, genetic diversity and population size of the Izu Islands are small compared to the others. Further, habitats of populations in the Izu Islands are warmer than those in Honshu, suggesting that they have undergone adaptive evolution. Our study provides evidences of montane rather than insular isolation on genetic divergence, survival of populations and significance of adaptive evolution for island populations with small population size and low genetic diversity, despite close proximity to mainland populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.

TI  - Polyploidization: Consequences of genome doubling on the evolutionary potential of populations
VL  - 109
IS  - 8
SP  - 1213-1220
AB  - Whole-genome duplication is common in plants and is considered to have a broad range of effects on individuals' phenotypes and genomes and to be an important driver of plant adaptation and speciation. Despite their increased capacity to cope with challenging environments, polyploid lineages are generally as prone to extinction, and sometimes more prone, than their diploid progenitors. Although several explanations have been proposed to explain the short- and long-term disadvantages of polyploidy on the survival probability of populations, the consequences of whole-genome doubling on the heritable variance remain poorly studied. Whole-genome doubling can have major effects not only on the genetics, but also on the ecology and life history of the populations. Modifications of other properties of populations can reverse the effects of polyploidization per se on heritable variance. In this synthesis, I summarize the empirical and theoretical knowledge about the multifarious consequences of genome doubling on the heritable variance of quantitative traits and on the evolutionary potential of polyploid populations compared to their diploid progenitors. I propose several ways to decipher the consequences of whole-genome doubling on survival probability and to study the further consequences of shifting the ecological niche and life-history traits of a population. I also highlight some practical considerations for comparing the heritable variance of a trait among different cytotypes. Such investigations appear to be timely and necessary to understand more about the paradoxical aspects of polyploidization and to understand the evolutionary potential of polyploid lineages in a global warming context. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.

TI  - Geographical isolation versus dispersal: Relictual alpine grasshoppers support a model of interglacial diversification with limited hybridization
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 296-312
AB  - Alpine biotas are paradigmatic of the countervailing roles of geographical isolation and dispersal during diversification. In temperate regions, repeated distributional shifts driven by Pleistocene climatic oscillations produced both recurrent pulses of population fragmentation and opportunities for gene flow during range expansions. Here, we test whether a model of divergence in isolation vs. with gene flow is more likely in the diversification of flightless alpine grasshoppers of the genus Podisma from the Iberian Peninsula. The answer to this question can also provide key insights about the pace of evolution. Specifically, if the data fit a divergence in isolation model, this suggests rapid evolution of reproductive isolation. Genomic data confirm a Pleistocene origin of the species complex, and multiple analytical approaches revealed limited asymmetric historical hybridization between two taxa. Genomic-based demographic reconstructions, spatial patterns of genetic structure and range shifts inferred from palaeodistribution modelling suggest severe range contraction accompanied by declines in effective population sizes during interglacials (i.e., contemporary populations confined to sky islands are relicts) and expansions during the coldest stages of the Pleistocene in each taxon. Although limited hybridization during secondary contact leads to phylogenetic uncertainty if gene flow is not accommodated when estimating evolutionary relationships, all species exhibit strong genetic cohesiveness. Our study lends support to the notion that the accumulation of incipient differences during periods of isolation were sufficient to lead to lineage persistence, but also that the demographic changes, dispersal constraints and spatial distribution of the sky islands themselves mediated species diversification in temperate alpine biotas. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Metabolism is linked with the pace-of-life, co-varying with survival, growth, and reproduction. Metabolic rates should therefore be under strong selection and, if heritable, become less variable over time. Yet intraspecific variation in metabolic rates is ubiquitous, even after accounting for body mass and temperature. Theory predicts variable selection maintains trait variation, but field estimates of how selection on metabolism varies are rare. We use a model marine invertebrate to estimate selection on metabolic rates in the wild under different competitive environments. Fitness landscapes varied among environments separated by a few centimeters: interspecific competition selected for higher metabolism, and a faster pace-of-life, relative to competition-free environments. Populations experience a mosaic of competitive regimes; we find metabolism mediates a competition-colonization trade-off across these regimes. Although high metabolic phenotypes possess greater competitive ability, in the absence of competitors, low metabolic phenotypes are better colonizers. Spatial heterogeneity and the variable selection on metabolic rates that it generates is likely to maintain variation in metabolic rate, despite strong selection in any single environment. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal imaging of exercise-associated skin temperature changes in swimmers subjected to 2-min intensive exercise on a vasa swim bench ergometer
VL  - 18
IS  - 12
AB  - An important element of swimming training is the improvement of muscle strength and the technique of swimming movements on dry land. The heat generated by the muscles involved in the effort contributes to a change in the temperature of the skin surface, which can be assessed by the IRT method. The aim of the study was to assess the symmetry and dynamics of changes in surface temperatures of selected areas of the body in swimmers after exercise on a swimming ergometer with the use of IRT. A total of 12 swimmers (aged 19 ± 1.3 years) completed a two-minute stress test (front crawl swimming movements) using a VASA Swim Ergometer, with a load of 5. Using an IRT camera (FLIR E60), postexercise changes in back and upper limbs surface temperature in relation to the resting values were observed. After exercise, the temperature value of all assessed areas decreased, apparently in the area of the back and the back of the arms, returning to the baseline values after 12 min of observation. There was no asymmetry in mean temperature values between the right and left upper limbs. IRT is a noninvasive and sensitive tool for the individual analysis of changes in body surface temperature in swimmers after training on dry land. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 190
SP  - 53-64
AB  - Phosphogypsum (PG) which is a waste byproduct of fertilizer production is the promising source of the gypsum industry. In order to explore the application of hemihydrate PG (HPG) as a substitute of hemihydrate gypsum, the setting and hardening characters of HPG plaster at different pH after neutralization were examined and contrasted with hemihydrate flue gas desulfurization gypsum (HFGD) plaster. Results showed that HPG plaster sets slow with a fall in strength and this effect was more pronounced after retarders were added when pH increased from 5.85 to 11.08. By contrast, HFGD plaster sets fast and without strength variation in the similar alkaline range. Microscopic studies including chemically combined water and temperature evolution curves of HPG plaster revealed that with the increase of the pH, the hydration reaction mechanism of hemihydrate and the gypsum crystal morphology were radically changed due to the fact of interaction between impurities and alkali. Consequently, HPG plaster is very different from HFGD plaster and its application in the alkaline condition was restricted. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Plasticity and evolution shape the scaling of metabolism and excretion along a geothermal temperature gradient
VL  - 36
IS  - 5
SP  - 1303-1314
AB  - Physiological rates are heavily dependent on temperature and body size. Most current predictions of organisms’ response to environmental warming are based on the assumption that key physiological rates such as metabolism and excretion scale independently with body size and temperature and will not evolve. However, temperature is a significant driver for phenotypic variability in the allometric scaling and thermal sensitivity of physiological rates within ectotherm species, suggesting that evolution may play a role in shaping these parameters. We common-reared six populations of western mosquitofish that have recently established (~100 years ago) in geothermal springs along a broad thermal gradient (19–33°C) to determine whether these scaling parameters are affected by evolutionary and/or plastic responses to warming over ecological timescales. Each population was reared at four different temperatures (23, 26, 30 and 32°C). We measured routine metabolic and nitrogen excretion rates on mosquitofish across a wide body size range. We found evidence for plasticity, but not evolution, increasing the allometric scaling of metabolic rate with temperature. Plasticity in metabolism allometry reflected a decrease in thermal sensitivity at smaller body sizes. We found evidence for evolution of phenotypic plasticity on the allometry of excretion rate, reflecting evolutionary differences in how thermal sensitivity varies with body size across different populations. Evolutionary differences in excretion rate scaling did not influence the relationship between excretion and metabolism across rearing temperatures, suggesting that warming does not affect the balance between mosquitofish energy demands and nutrient recycling rates.

AB  - Evolvable hardware is a field of study exploring the application of evolutionary algorithms to hardware systems during design, operation, or both. The work presented here focuses on the use of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), a type of dynamically reconfigurable hardware device typically used for electronic prototyping in conjunction with a newly created open-source platform for performing intrinsic analog evolvable hardware experiments. This work targets the reproduction of seminal field experiments that generated complex analog dynamics of unclocked FPGAs evolved through genetic manipulation of their binary circuit representation: the bitstream. Further, it demonstrates the intrinsic evolution of two nontrivial analog circuits with intriguing properties, amplitude maximization and pulse oscillation, as well as the robustness of evolved circuits to temperature variation and across-chip circuit translation. © 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

TI  - Escherichia coli has a unique transcriptional program in long-term stationary phase allowing identification of genes important for survival
VL  - 5
IS  - 4
AB  - Microbes live in complex and constantly changing environments, but it is difficult to replicate this in the laboratory. Escherichia coli has been used as a model organism in experimental evolution studies for years; specifically, we and others have used it to study evolution in complex environments by incubating the cells into long-term stationary phase (LTSP) in rich media. In LTSP, cells experience a variety of stresses and changing conditions. While we have hypothesized that this experimental system is more similar to natural environments than some other lab conditions, we do not yet know how cells respond to this environment biochemically or physiologically. In this study, we began to unravel the cells' responses to this environment by characterizing the transcriptome of cells during LTSP. We found that cells in LTSP have a unique transcriptional program and that several genes are uniquely upregulated or downregulated in this phase. Further, we identified two genes, cspB and cspI, which are most highly expressed in LTSP, even though these genes are primarily known to respond to cold shock. By competing cells lacking these genes with wild-type cells, we show that these genes are also important for survival during LTSP. These data can help identify gene products that may play a role in survival in this complex environment and lead to identification of novel functions of proteins. IMPORTANCE Experimental evolution studies have elucidated evolutionary processes, but usually in chemically well-defined and/or constant environments. Using complex environments is important to begin to understand how evolution may occur in natural environments, such as soils or within a host. However, characterizing the stresses that cells experience in these complex environments can be challenging. One way to approach this is by determining how cells biochemically acclimate to heterogenous environments. In this study, we began to characterize physiological changes by analyzing the transcriptome of cells in a dynamic complex environment. By characterizing the transcriptional profile of cells in long-term stationary phase, a heterogenous and stressful environment, we can begin to understand how cells physiologically and biochemically react to the laboratory environment, and how this compares to more-natural conditions. © 2020 Kram et al.

TI  - Implementation of differential evolution algorithm and its variants for optimal scheduling of distributed generations
VL  - 34
IS  - 6
AB  - Modern power systems are being shifted its attention towards distributed generations (DGs). DGs have allured more concern as an auspicious opportunity with considerable economic profits. To minimize the power generation costs of DGs, day-to-day operation scheduling is essential. The role of this study is to offer an optimal operation schedule for DG with several energy sources including renewable energy sources (RES), considering economic facets. In order to achieve the cost minimization along with optimal scheduling, an objection function has been formulated and solved using the optimization algorithms. This study aims to present the applications of differential evolution (DE) algorithm and its variants such as opposition-based differential evolution (ODE), self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE), improved differential evolution (IDE), and cultivated differential evolution (CuDE) for scheduling DG optimally. A scheme for optimal scheduling of thermal, wind power, and solar PV generators has been evaluated. The simulations have been carried out on IEEE 14 bus system, IEEE 30 bus system, IEEE 57 bus system, and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO), as a real part of 62 bus Indian utility system (IUS). The novelty of this study lies in simulating a real-time system for solving optimal scheduling problem, in that way helping decision makers to choose the optimal operation points. The results indicate that the SaDE outperformed other DE variants by giving the best fitness value and convergence rate. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To test the hypothesis that adaptive convergent evolution of climate niches occurred in multiple independent lemur lineages. Location: Madagascar. Taxon: Lemurs. Methods: I collected climate and altitude data from WorldClim and summarized the niches of almost all living lemurs (83 species) into phylogenetically controlled principal components. To test for convergent evolution, I searched for multiple, similar climate optima using multi-peak Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models (surface, l1-ou, bayou). I compared the observed level of climate convergence to that simulated under neutral and single-optimum models. To test if behavioural or morphological traits were related to climate niches, I used phylogenetic regressions with activity pattern, diet, and body size. Results: From an ancestral niche with high rainfall and low seasonality, four lemur lineages independently converged on climate niche optima characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall, supporting adaptive evolution in southwest deciduous and arid habitats. The observed level of convergence was more frequent than expected under Brownian motion and single-optimum simulations, which illustrates that the results are likely not a result of stochastic evolution over long time periods. Nocturnal and cathemeral activity patterns were common among lineages in the arid climate niche. Conclusion: Lemur climate niche evolution demonstrated that convergence explains the distribution of four independent clades in hot, arid environments of southwest Madagascar. The timing of these convergent shifts coincided with the origination of modern arid-adapted plant genera, some of which are important lemur food sources. These communities have high endemicity and are especially threatened by habitat loss. Arid environments are arenas in which convergent evolution is predicted to occur frequently. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Adaptation to environmental stress at different timescales
VL  - 1476
IS  - 1
SP  - 5-22
AB  - Environments are changing rapidly, and to cope with these changes, organisms have to adapt. Adaptation can take many shapes and occur at different speeds, depending on the type of response, the trait, the population, and the environmental conditions. The biodiversity crisis that we are currently facing illustrates that numerous species and populations are not capable of adapting with sufficient speed to ongoing environmental changes. Here, we discuss current knowledge on the ability of animals and plants to adapt to environmental stress on different timescales, mainly focusing on thermal stress and ectotherms. We discuss within-generation responses that can be fast and induced within minutes or hours, evolutionary adaptations that are often slow and take several generations, and mechanisms that lay somewhere in between and that include epigenetic transgenerational effects. To understand and predict the impacts of environmental change and stress on biodiversity, we suggest that future studies should (1) have an increased focus on understanding the type and speed of responses to fast environmental changes; (2) focus on the importance of environmental fluctuations and the predictability of environmental conditions on adaptive capabilities, preferably in field studies encompassing several fitness components; and (3) look at ecosystem responses to environmental stress and their resilience when disturbed. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Optimization of solder joints in embedded mechatronic systems via Kriging-assisted CMA-ES algorithm
VL  - 10
AB  - In power electronics applications, embedded mechatronic systems (MSs) must meet the severe operating conditions and high levels of thermomechanical stress. The thermal fatigue of the solder joints remains the main mechanism leading to the rupture and a malfunction of the complete MS. It is the main failure to which the lifetime of embedded MS is often linked. Consequently, robust and inexpensive design optimization is needed to increase the number of life cycles of solder joints. This paper proposes an application of metamodel-assisted evolution strategy (MA-ES) which significantly reduces the computational cost of ES induced by the expensive finite element simulation, which is the objective function in optimization problems. The proposed method aims to couple the Kriging metamodel with the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Kriging metamodel is used to replace the finite element simulation in order to overcome the computational cost of fitness function evaluations (finite element model). Kriging is used together with CMA-ES and sequentially updated and its fidelity (quality) is measured according to its ability in ranking of the population through approximate ranking procedure (ARP). The application of this method in the optimization of MS proves its efficiency and ability to avoid the problem of computational cost. © H. Hamdani et al., published by EDP Sciences, 2019.

TI  - Every breath you take: assessing metabolic costs of toxin resistance in garter snakes (Thamnophis)
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 567-580
AB  - Trait specialization often comes at the expense of original trait function, potentially causing evolutionary tradeoffs that may render specialist populations vulnerable to extinction. However, many specialized adaptations evolve repeatedly, suggesting selection favors specialization in specific environments. Some garter snake (Thamnophis) populations possess specialized mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels that allow them to consume Pacific newts (Taricha) defended by a highly potent neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin). These mutations, however, also decrease protein and muscle function, suggesting garter snakes may suffer evolutionary tradeoffs. We measured a key physiological process, standard metabolic rate (SMR), to investigate whether specialized adaptations in toxin-resistant garter snakes affect baseline energy expenditure. In snakes, skeletal muscles influence metabolism and power ventilation, so inefficiencies of sodium channels in these muscles might impact whole-animal energy expenditure. Further, because sodium channels are membrane-bound proteins, inefficiencies of channel kinetics and performance might be exacerbated at suboptimal temperatures. We measured SMR in 2 species, Thamnophis atratus and Thamnophis sirtalis, that independently evolved tetrodotoxin resistance through unique mutations, providing replicate experiments with distinct underlying genetics and potential physiological costs. Despite our expectations, neither resistance phenotype nor sodium channel genotype affected metabolism and resistant snakes did not perform worse under suboptimal body temperature. Instead, T. atratus and T. sirtalis show nearly identical rates of mass-adjusted energy expenditure at both temperatures, despite differing eco-morphologies, life histories, and distant phylogenetic positions. These findings suggest SMR may be a conserved feature of Thamnophis, and that any organismal tradeoffs may be compensated to retain whole-animal function. © 2021 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

TI  - Evolutionary adaptation of an RNA bacteriophage to the simultaneous increase in the within-host and extracellular temperatures
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Bacteriophages are the most numerous biological entities on Earth. They are on the basis of most ecosystems, regulating the diversity and abundance of bacterial populations and contributing to the nutrient and energy cycles. Bacteriophages have two well differentiated phases in their life cycle, one extracellular, in which they behave as inert particles, and other one inside their hosts, where they replicate to give rise to a progeny. In both phases they are exposed to environmental conditions that often act as selective pressures that limit both their survival in the environment and their ability to replicate, two fitness traits that frequently cannot be optimised simultaneously. In this study we have analysed the evolutionary ability of an RNA bacteriophage, the bacteriophage Qβ, when it is confronted with a temperature increase that affects both the extracellular and the intracellular media. Our results show that Qβ can optimise its survivability when exposed to short-Term high temperature extracellular heat shocks, as well as its replicative ability at higher-Than-optimal temperature. Mutations responsible for simultaneous adaptation were the same as those selected when adaptation to each condition proceeded separately, showing the absence of important trade-offs between survival and reproduction in this virus. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Global climate is changing at a rapid pace and the pivotal question is if the rate and extent of species' responses to stressful events enable them to persist in a changing world. Although the consequences of rapid environmental changes on animal life-history traits are receiving considerable attention, our understanding of how temperature fluctuations affect sexual chemical communication in animals is scarce. Male-female interactions often depend on pheromone detectability and sudden shifts in environmental temperature are expected to disrupt communication between potential mates. Whether organisms can adapt to temperature-induced changes at both signaller and receiver levels is virtually unexplored. In this perspective paper, we first provide a broad overview of the sex pheromone pathway, from biosynthesis to detection, and outline the importance of chemical-based mate choice. Finally, through several study cases, we highlight how thermal stress may interfere with chemical communication between the sexes, and discuss the potential evolutionary consequence of temperature stress. © 2019 Copyright 2019 by Groot and Zizzari.

TI  - Key factors controlling the occurrence of shale oil and gas in the Eagle Ford Shale, the Gulf Coast Basin: Models for sweet spot identification
VL  - 94
AB  - The key geological parameters controlling the enrichment and productivity of shale oil and gas (O&amp;G) are studied systematically using 991 shale core analyses, and assay data from 72 systematic coring wells and 1317 rigs from the lower section of the Eagle Ford Formation in the Gulf Coast Basin of the United States. The key parameters include both source and derived parameters. Source parameters are controlled mainly by the paleo-sedimentary environment, whereas derived parameters combine source parameters, thermal evolution, and tectonic evolution. Here we examine the evolution of, and relationships among, the source and derived parameters with respect to thermal and tectonic evolution. Derived parameters for shale, including total porosity (φt) and matrix permeability (Ke), are related to the source parameters of kerogen type, total organic carbon (TOC), clay volume content (Vclay), and effective shale thickness (Heshale), and can be represented by the source parameters and vitrinite reflectance (Ro), which directly reflects the thermal evolution of shale O&amp;G. Shale O&amp;G-derived parameters, including oil (So), gas (Sg), and water (Sw) saturation, are related to Ro, Vclay, and TOC, and can be represented by the source parameters and Ro. Shale O&amp;G-derived parameters that control the “sweet spots” and enrichment of shale O&amp;G include oil density (ρo), gas relative density (ρg), gas–oil ratio (GOR), water–gas ratio (WGS), oil volume coefficient (Boi), and gas compression factor (Z), and can be represented by Ro. Under the same conditions as the roof and floor in the effective shale layers, the formation pressure gradient (Pindex) can be represented by Ro, and shale compressibility can be represented by Vclay. Five parameters [TOC, Vclay, Heshale (effective shale thickness), Ro, and Pindex], combined with microfractures and sealing conditions, are the key parameters for assessing the enrichment, productivity, and “sweet spots” of shale O&amp;G. © 2021

TI  - Simulated climate warming and mitochondrial haplogroup modulate testicular small non-coding RNA expression in the neotropical pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
AB  - Recent theory suggests that tropical terrestrial arthropods are at significant risk from climate warming. Metabolic rate in such ectothermic species increases exponentially with environmental temperature, and a small temperature increase in a hot environment can therefore have a greater physiological impact than a large temperature increase in a cool environment. In two recent studies of the neotropical pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, simulated climate warming significantly decreased survival, body size and level of sexual dimorphism. However, these effects were minor compared with catastrophic consequences for male fertility and female fecundity, identifying reproduction as the life stage most vulnerable to climate warming. Here, we examine the effects of chronic high-temperature exposure on epigenetic regulation in C. scorpioides in the context of naturally occurring variation in mitochondrial DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) expression, are particularly sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, which can induce changes in epigenetic states and phenotypes that may be heritable across generations. Our results indicate that exposure of male pseudoscorpions to elevated temperature significantly altered the expression of >60 sncRNAs in testicular tissue, specifically microRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs. Mitochondrial haplogroup was also a significant factor influencing both sncRNAs and mitochondrial gene expression. These findings demonstrate that chronic heat stress causes changes in epigenetic profiles that may account for reproductive dysfunction in C. scorpioides males. Moreover, through its effects on epigenetic regulation, mitochondrial DNA polymorphism may provide the potential for an adaptive evolutionary response to climate warming. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Contrasting diversity patterns of breeding Anatidae in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
VL  - 9
IS  - 17
SP  - 9990-10003
AB  - For sustaining ecosystem functions and services, environmental conservation strategies increasingly target to maintain the multiple facets of biodiversity, such as functional diversity (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD), not just taxonomic diversity (TD). However, spatial mismatches among these components of biodiversity can impose challenges for conservation decisions. Hence, understanding the drivers of biodiversity is critical. Here, we investigated the global distribution patterns of TD, FD, and PD of breeding Anatidae. Using null models, we clarified the relative importance of mechanisms that influence Anatidae community. We also developed random forest models to evaluate the effects of environmental variables on the Anatidae TD, FD, and PD. Our results showed that geographical variation in Anatidae diversity is hemispheric rather than latitudinal. In the species-rich Northern Hemisphere (NH), the three diversity indices decreased with latitude within the tropical zone of the NH, but increased in the temperate zone reaching a peak at 44.5–70.0°N, where functional and phylogenetic clustering was a predominant feature. In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), Anatidae diversity increased poleward and a tendency to overdispersion was common. In NH, productivity seasonality and temperature in the coldest quarter were the most important variables. Productivity seasonality was also the most influential predictor of SH Anatidae diversity, along with peak productivity. These findings suggested that seasonality and productivity, both consistent with the energy-diversity hypothesis, interact with the varying histories to shape the contrasting hemispheric patterns of Anatidae diversity. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) and FD underdispersion, widespread across the species-rich, seasonally productive mid-to-high latitudes of the NH, reflects a rapid evolutionary radiation and resorting associated with Pleistocene cycles of glaciation. The SH continents (and southern Asia) are characterized by a widespread tendency toward PD and FD overdispersion, with their generally species-poor communities comprising proportionately more older lineages in thermally more stable but less predictably productive environments. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Multiple Stress Reduces the Advantage of Pesticide Adaptation
VL  - 55
IS  - 22
SP  - 15100-15109
AB  - Under global change scenarios, multistress conditions may occur regularly and require adaptation. However, the adaptation to one stressor might be associated with the increased sensitivity to another stressor. Here, we investigated the ecological consequences of such trade-off under multiple stress. We compared the pesticide tolerance of the crustacean Gammarus pulex from agricultural streams with populations from reference streams. Under optimum temperature, G. pulex from agricultural streams were considerably more tolerant to pesticides as compared to the reference populations. Here, we assume that the increased tolerance in agricultural populations is the combination of acclimation, epigenetic effect, and genetic evolution. After experimental pre-exposure to very low concentration (LC50/1000), reference populations showed increased pesticide tolerance. In contrast, pre-exposure did not further increase the tolerance of agricultural populations. Moreover, these populations were more sensitive to elevated temperature alone due to the hypothesized fitness cost of genetic adaptation to pesticides. However, both reference and agricultural populations showed a similar tolerance to the combined stress of pesticides and warming due to stronger synergistic effects in adapted populations. As a result, pesticide adaptation loses its advantage. The combined effect was predicted well using the stress addition model, developed for predicting the synergistic interaction of independent stressors. We conclude that under multistress conditions, adaptation to pesticides reduces the general stress capacity of individuals and trade-off processes increase the sensitivity to additional stressors. This causes strong synergistic effects of additional stressors on pesticide-adapted individuals. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Environmental variation mediates the evolution of anticipatory parental effects
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 371-381
AB  - Theory maintains that when future environment is predictable, parents should adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the anticipated environment. The plausibility of positive anticipatory parental effects is hotly debated and the experimental evidence for the evolution of such effects is currently lacking. We experimentally investigated the evolution of anticipatory maternal effects in a range of environments that differ drastically in how predictable they are. Populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, adapted to 20°C, were exposed to a novel temperature (25°C) for 30 generations with either positive or zero correlation between parent and offspring environment. We found that populations evolving in novel environments that were predictable across generations evolved a positive anticipatory maternal effect, because they required maternal exposure to 25°C to achieve maximum reproduction in that temperature. In contrast, populations evolving under zero environmental correlation had lost this anticipatory maternal effect. Similar but weaker patterns were found if instead rate-sensitive population growth was used as a fitness measure. These findings demonstrate that anticipatory parental effects evolve in response to environmental change so that ill-fitting parental effects can be rapidly lost. Evolution of positive anticipatory parental effects can aid population viability in rapidly changing but predictable environments. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal niche evolution of functional traits in a tropical marine phototroph
VL  - 54
IS  - 6
SP  - 799-810
AB  - Land-based plants and ocean-dwelling microbial phototrophs known as phytoplankton, are together responsible for almost all global primary production. Habitat warming associated with anthropogenic climate change has detrimentally impacted marine primary production, with the effects observed on regional and global scales. In contrast to slower-growing higher plants, there is considerable potential for phytoplankton to evolve rapidly with changing environmental conditions. The energetic constraints associated with adaptation in phytoplankton are not yet understood, but are central to forecasting how global biogeochemical cycles respond to contemporary ocean change. Here, we demonstrate a number of potential trade-offs associated with high-temperature adaptation in a tropical microbial eukaryote, Amphidinium massartii (dinoflagellate). Most notably, the population became high-temperature specialized (higher fitness within a narrower thermal envelope and higher thermal optimum), and had a greater nutrient requirement for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. Evidently, the energetic constraints associated with living at elevated temperature alter competiveness along other environmental gradients. While high-temperature adaptation led to an irreversible change in biochemical composition (i.e., an increase in fatty acid saturation), the mechanisms underpinning thermal evolution in phytoplankton remain unclear, and will be crucial to understanding whether the trade-offs observed here are species-specific or are representative of the evolutionary constraints in all phytoplankton. © 2018 Phycological Society of America

TI  - Improvement of S-adenosyl-L-methionine production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by atmospheric and room temperature plasma-ultraviolet compound mutagenesis and droplet microfluidic adaptive evolution
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - To improve S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (a compound with important physiological functions, SAM) production, atmospheric and room temperature plasma and ultraviolet-LiCl mutagenesis were carried out with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain ZY 1–5. The mutants were screened with ethionine, L-methionine, nystatin and cordycepin as screening agents. Adaptive evolution of a positive mutant UV6-69 was further performed by droplet microfluidics cultivation with ethionine as screening pressure. After adaptation, mutant T11-1 was obtained. Its SAM titer in shake flask fermentation reached 1.31 g/L, which was 191% higher than that of strain ZY 1–5. Under optimal conditions, the SAM titer and biomass of mutant T11-1 in 5 L bioreactor reached 10.72 g/L and 105.9 g dcw/L (142.86% and 34.22% higher than those of strain ZY 1–5), respectively. Comparative transcriptome analysis between strain ZY 1–5 and mutant T11-1 revealed the enhancements in TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis/glycolysis pathways as well as the inhibitions in serine and ergosterol synthesis of mutant T11-1. The elevated SAM synthesis of mutant T11-1 may attribute to the above changes. Taken together, this study is helpful for industrial production of SAM. © 2022, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.

TI  - The adaptive evolution of the tree sparrow (passer montanus) phenotype to environment factors
VL  - 38
IS  - 4
SP  - 1392-1400
AB  - Observed across a large altitudinal gradient and a widely-distributed geographical range, the tree sparrow (Passer montanus) is a species commonly associated with human beings. This study analyzed the relationship between 10 morphological characteristics of 837 tree sparrows sampled, and 4 environmental factors (air temperature factor, sunshine factor, altitude factor, and air-speed factor). The results indicated that morphological traits, such as body weight, rictus, wing length, tail length, tarsus length, skull width, and interorbital distance were significantly correlated with the sunshine factor (P < 0.05). Moreover, body weight, body size, wing length, tail length, and tarsus length were significantly correlated with the altitude factor (P<0.05). Additionally, body weight, culmen length, wing length, and skull length were significantly correlated with the air temperature factor (P < 0. 05). The aforementioned findings suggest that these morphological characteristics have adaptive potential in response to environmental factors. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between morphological size and latitude by controlling for longitude and altitude. The results of this analysis indicated that body weight, wing length, and skull size had a significant positive correlation with the latitude factor (P< 0.05). Conversely, culmen length and rictus had a significant negative correlation with latitude (P<0.05) after controlling for longitude and altitude. These findings suggest that body size increases with rising latitude, while bill size decreases with increased latitude. Therefore, we conclude that the morphological variation of this species is in concordance with Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule. A significant positive relationship was found between flight ability and the altitude factor (n =92, r = 0.217, P = 0.038), and thus our results postulate that the flight ability of P. montanus is greater at higher altitudes than at lower altitudes. This adaptive component of flight ability may offer an explanation as to why P. montanus is so widely-distributed throughout the planet. © 2018 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - When water interacts with temperature: Ecological and evolutionary implications of thermo-hydroregulation in terrestrial ectotherms
VL  - 9
IS  - 17
SP  - 10029-10043
AB  - The regulation of body temperature (thermoregulation) and of water balance (defined here as hydroregulation) are key processes underlying ecological and evolutionary responses to climate fluctuations in wild animal populations. In terrestrial (or semiterrestrial) ectotherms, thermoregulation and hydroregulation closely interact and combined temperature and water constraints should directly influence individual performances. Although comparative physiologists traditionally investigate jointly water and temperature regulation, the ecological and evolutionary implications of these coupled processes have so far mostly been studied independently. Here, we revisit the concept of thermo-hydroregulation to address the functional integration of body temperature and water balance regulation in terrestrial ectotherms. We demonstrate how thermo-hydroregulation provides a framework to investigate functional adaptations to joint environmental variation in temperature and water availability, and potential physiological and/or behavioral conflicts between thermoregulation and hydroregulation. We extend the classical cost–benefit model of thermoregulation in ectotherms to highlight the adaptive evolution of optimal thermo-hydroregulation strategies. Critical gaps in the parameterization of this conceptual optimality model and guidelines for future empirical research are discussed. We show that studies of thermo-hydroregulation refine our mechanistic understanding of physiological and behavioral plasticity, and of the fundamental niche of the species. This is illustrated with relevant and recent examples of space use and dispersal, resource-based trade-offs, and life-history tactics in insects, amphibians, and nonavian reptiles. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Antagonistic Coevolution Limits the Range of Host Defense in C. elegans Populations
VL  - 12
AB  - Host populations often evolve defenses against parasites due to the significant fitness costs imposed by infection. However, adaptation to a specific parasite may alter the effectiveness of the host’s defenses in general. Consequently, the specificity of host defense may be influenced by a host population’s evolutionary history with parasites. Further, the degree of reciprocal change within an interaction may profoundly alter the range of host defense, given that antagonistic coevolutionary interactions are predicted to favor defense against specific parasite genotypes. Here, we examined the effect of host evolutionary history on host defense range by assessing the mortality rates of Caenorhabditis elegans host populations exposed to an array of Serratia marcescens bacterial parasite strains. Importantly, each of the host populations were derived from the same genetic background but have different experimental evolution histories with parasites. Each of these histories (exposure to either heat-killed, fixed genotype, or coevolving parasites) carries a different level of evolutionary reciprocity. Overall, we observed an effect of host evolutionary history in that previously coevolved host populations were generally the most susceptible to novel parasite strains. This data demonstrates that host evolutionary history can have a significant impact on host defense, and that host-parasite coevolution can increase host susceptibility to novel parasites.

AB  - The most successful study systems are built on a foundation of decades of research on the basic biology, ecology and life history of the organisms in question. Com-bined with new technologies, this can provide a formidable means to address important issues in evolutionary biology and molecular ecology. Littorinid marine snails are a good example of this, with a rich literature on their taxonomy, speciation, thermal tolerance and behavioural adaptations. In August 2017, an international meeting on Littorinid evolution was held at the Tjarno Marine Research Laboratory in Western Sweden. In this meeting review, I provide a summary of some of the exciting work on parallel evolution, sexual selection and adaptation to environmental stress presented there. I argue that newly available genomic resources present an opportunity for integrating the traditionally divergent fields of speciation and environmental adaptation in Littorinid research. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - The recent advances in machine perfusion (MP) technology involve settings ranging between hypothermic, subnormothermic, and normothermic temperatures. Tissue level adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a long-established marker of viability and functionality and is universal for all organs. In the midst of a growing number of complex clinical parameters for the quality assessment of graft prior to transplantation, a revisit of ATP may shed light on the underlying reconditioning mechanisms of different perfusion temperatures in the form of restoration of metabolic and energy status. This article aims to review and critically analyse animal and preclinical human studies (discarded grafts) during MP of three abdominal organs (liver, kidney, and pancreas) in which ATP was a primary endpoint. A selective review of recent novel reconditioning approaches relevant to mitigation of graft ischaemia-reperfusion injury via MP and for different perfusion temperatures was also conducted. With a current reiterated interest for oxygenation during MP, a re-introduction of tissue ATP levels may be valuable for graft viability assessment prior to transplantation. Further studies may help delineate the benefits of selective perfusion temperatures on organs viability. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 192
IS  - 3
SP  - 435-445
AB  - Tolerance to thermal extremes is critical for the geographic distributions of ectotherm species, many of which are probably going to be modified by future climatic changes. To predict species distributions it is important to understand the potential of species to adapt to changing thermal conditions. Here, we tested whether the thermal tolerance traits of a common freeze-tolerant potworm were correlated with climatic conditions and if adaptation to extreme cold constrains the evolutionary potential for high temperature tolerance. Further, we tested if evolution of thermal tolerance traits is associated with costs in other fitness traits (body size and reproduction). Lastly, we tested if slopes of temperature-survival curves (i.e., the sensitivity distribution) are related to tolerance itself. Using 24 populations of the potworm, Enchytraeus albidus Henle (Enchytraeidae), collected from a wide range of climatic conditions, we established a common garden experiment in which we determined high and low temperature tolerance (using survival as endpoint), average reproductive output and adult body size. Heat tolerance was not related to environmental temperatures whereas lower lethal temperature was about 10 °C lower in Arctic populations than in populations from temperate regions. Reproduction was not related to environmental temperature, but was negatively correlated with cold tolerance. One explanation for the trade-off between cold tolerance and reproduction could be that the more cold-hardy populations need to channel energy to large glycogen reserves at the expense of less energy expenditure for reproduction. Adult body size was negatively related to environmental temperature. Finally, the slopes of temperature-survival curves were significantly correlated with critical temperature limits for heat and cold tolerance; i.e., slopes increased with thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that relatively heat-sensitive populations possess genetic variation, leaving room for improved heat tolerance through evolutionary processes, which may alleviate the effects of a warmer future climate in the Arctic. On the other hand, we observed relatively narrow sensitivity distributions (i.e., less variation) in the most heat tolerant populations. Taken together, our results suggest that both cold and heat tolerance can only be selected for (and improved) until a certain limit has been reached. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 100
IS  - 1
SP  - 179-195
AB  - Dapediidae are a characteristic group of deep-bodied Mesozoic actinopterygian fishes with a moderate diversity at genus- and species-level. Here, we add a new occurrence to their patchy fossil record and describe in detail a nearly complete dapediid specimen from the pelagic deposit of the Toarcian Úrkút Manganese Ore Formation in the Transdanubian Range of Hungary. The preserved characters represent nearly all anatomically important body parts and allow assignment to Dapedium and comparison with other dapediid genera. This is the first reported occurrence of the order in Hungary and the Carpathian Basin that extends the known geographical range of the genus to the Mediterranean (western Tethyan) Jurassic. A review of the temporal distribution of published occurrences of dapediids permits speculation that the disappearance of exclusively Late Triassic genera, coincident with the end-Triassic extinction event, was likely related to their specialised feeding strategies and light or incomplete squamation. Multiple environmental crises (warming, acidification and anoxia) severely affected reefal habitats and favoured the survival of the generalist-durophagous Dapedium. The Úrkút specimen adds important data to the Early Jurassic, particularly Toarcian Lagerstätte-dominated fossil record of dapediids. In contrast to the end-Triassic, the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event did not lead to genus extinction among dapediids, possibly prevented by adaptations evolved during the preceding and similarly multi-stressor event. Continuing studies of Mesozoic fish specimens in Hungarian collections may provide new records and insights into other groups as well. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Survival of Staphylococcus aureus on sampling swabs stored at different temperatures
VL  - 131
IS  - 3
SP  - 1030-1038
AB  - Aims: To understand the impact of storage temperature on recovery of Staphylococcus aureus on sampling swabs. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, but also causes a variety of life-threatening diseases. With a large pool of asymptomatic carriers and transmission that can occur even through indirect contact, mitigation efforts have had limited success. Swab sampling, followed by culturing, is a cornerstone of epidemiological studies, however, S. aureus viability on swabs stored at different temperatures has not been characterized. Methods and Results: We determined survival rates on swabs stored at five different temperatures. Samples stored at −70°C had no decay over time while samples stored at higher temperatures showed an exponential decay in viability. Mortality rates were greatest for swabs stored at 37°C. Survival at intermediate temperatures (−20 to 20·5°C) did not differ significantly, however, we observed more variation at higher temperatures. Conclusions: To maximize recovery of S. aureus cells, samples should be stored at −70°C or processed for culturing without delay. Significance and Impact of the Study: Epidemiological studies of bacterial diseases are typically limited to determination of pathogen presence/absence, yet quantitative assessments of pathogen load and genetic diversity can provide insights into disease progression and severity, likelihood of transmission and adaptive evolutionary potential. For studies of S. aureus where time or access to a microbiology laboratory may delay culturing, deep freezing or timely culturing will maximize the degree to which sampling results reflect source status. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Dealing with predictable and unpredictable temperatures in a climate change context: The case of parasitoids and their hosts
VL  - 224
AB  - The Earth s climate is changing at a rapid pace. To survive in increasingly fluctuating and unpredictable environments, species can either migrate or evolve through rapid local adaptation, plasticity and/ or bet-hedging. For small ectotherm insects, like parasitoids and their hosts, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging could be critical strategies for population and species persistence in response to immediate, intense and unpredictable temperature changes. Here, we focus on studies evaluating phenotypic responses to variable predictable thermal conditions (for which phenotypic plasticity is favoured) and unpredictable thermal environments (for which bethedging is favoured), both within and between host and parasitoid generations. We then address the effects of fluctuating temperatures on host parasitoid interactions, potential cascading effects on the food web, as well as biological control services. We conclude our review by proposing a road map for designing experiments to assess if plasticity and bet-hedging can be adaptive strategies, and to disentangle how fluctuating temperatures can affect the evolution of these two strategies in parasitoids and their hosts. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Can biomass supply meet the demands of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)?
VL  - 26
IS  - 10
SP  - 5358-5364
AB  - To reach the reduced carbon emission targets proposed by the Paris agreement, one of the widely proposed decarbonizing strategies, referred to as negative emissions technologies (NETs), is the production and combustion of bioenergy crops in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO2 emissions, with consequent high risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues: the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that 1 tonne of CO2 captured in the growth of biomass equates to 1 tonne of CO2 sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO2 is emitted by variable amounts during the lifecycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The steady and ongoing change in climatic patterns across the globe is triggering a cascade of climate-adaptive phenomena, both genetic and behavioral in parasites, and influencing the host-pathogen-transmission triangle. Parasite and vector traits are now heavily influenced due to increasing temperature that almost dissolved geospatial boundaries and impacted the basic reproductive number of parasites. As consequence, continents unknown to some parasites are experiencing altered distribution and abundance of new and emerging parasites that are developing into a newer epidemiological model. These are posing a burden to healthcare and higher disease prevalence. This calls for multidisciplinary actions focusing on One Health to improve and innovate in areas of detection, reporting, and medical countermeasures to combat the growing threat of parasite emergence owing to climate adaptations for better public health outcomes. © 2022 Tropical Parasitology.

TI  - Rapid evolution of post-zygotic reproductive isolation is widespread in Arctic plant lineages
VL  - 129
IS  - 2
SP  - 171-184
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Arctic tundra, with its extreme temperatures and short growing season, is evolutionarily young and harbours one of the most species-poor floras on Earth. Arctic species often show little phenotypic and genetic divergence across circumpolar ranges. However, strong intraspecific post-zygotic reproductive isolation (RI) in terms of hybrid sterility has frequently evolved within selfing Arctic species of the genus Draba. Here we assess whether incipient biological species are common in the Arctic flora. METHODS: We conducted an extensive crossing experiment including six species representing four phylogenetically distant families collected across the circumpolar Arctic. We crossed conspecific parental populations representing different spatial scales, raised 740 F1 hybrids to maturity and measured fertility under laboratory conditions. We examined genetic divergence between populations for two of these species (Cardamine bellidifolia and Ranunculus pygmaeus). KEY RESULTS: In five of the six species, we find extensive reduction in pollen fertility and seed set in F1 hybrids; 219 (46 %) of the 477 F1 hybrids generated between parents separated by ≥427 km had <20 % pollen fertility. Isolation with migration (IM) and *BEAST analyses of sequences of eight nuclear genes in C. bellidifolia suggests that reproductively isolated populations of this species diverged during, or even after, the last glaciation. Likewise, Arctic populations of R. pygmaeus were genetically very similar despite exhibiting strongly reduced fertility in crosses, suggesting that RI evolved recently also in this species. CONCLUSION: We show that post-zygotic RI has developed multiple times within taxonomically recognized Arctic species belonging to several distantly related lineages, and that RI may have developed over just a few millennia. Rapid and widespread evolution of incipient biological species in the Arctic flora might be associated with frequent bottlenecks due to glacial cycles, and/or selfing mating systems, which are common in the harsh Arctic environment where pollinators are scarce. © The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Nine years of experimental warming did not influence the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate in the medaka fish Oryzias latipes
VL  - 67
IS  - 3
SP  - 577-585
AB  - A pressing challenge is to determine whether and how global-change drivers influence species physiology and survival. Recently, researchers have proposed the metabolic theory of ecology, defending the hypothesis of a universal thermal dependence of metabolic rate or, alternatively, the metabolic cold adaptation theory, stating that local adaptation can influence the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate. However, the long-term (i.e. multigenerational) consequences of warming for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate remain largely unexplored although it determines energy use and is crucial for species response to climate change. In this study, we used an evolutionary experiment with medaka fishes Oryzias latipes maintained for more than 12 generations at warm and cold temperatures (30 and 20°C, respectively) to address this issue. Our objective was to investigate whether thermal adaptation influences the relationship between temperature and mass-corrected metabolic rate and how this may occur. In agreement with the universal thermal dependence hypothesis, we found that warming did not significantly influence the thermal sensitivity of mass-corrected metabolic rate: neither the intercept nor the slope of the temperature–metabolic rate relationship differed among fish lineages. Our small-scale laboratory experiment thus indicated that there is limited potential for evolutionary change in medaka fish metabolic rate in response to warmer temperatures. Overall, we provide evidence that 9 years of experimental warming did not influence the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate. Our results highlight the invariability of the thermal dependence of metabolic rate, which has important implications for adaptation to climate warming. This finding suggests a limited potential for metabolic adaptations in response to long-term temperature changes, which may have negative consequences for the persistence of fish populations under climate change. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Genetic mutations that drive evolutionary rescue to lethal temperature in Escherichia coli
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
SP  - 2029-2044
AB  - Evolutionary rescue occurs when adaptation restores population growth against a lethal stressor. Here, we studied evolutionary rescue by conducting experiments with Escherichia coli at the lethal temperature of 43.0 °C, to determine the adaptive mutations that drive rescue and to investigate their effects on fitness and gene expression. From hundreds of populations, we observed that ~9% were rescued by genetic adaptations. We sequenced 26 populations and identified 29 distinct mutations. Of these populations, 21 had a mutation in the hslVU or rpoBC operon, suggesting that mutations in either operon could drive rescue. We isolated seven strains of E. coli carrying a putative rescue mutation in either the hslVU or rpoBC operon to investigate the mutations' effects. The single rescue mutations increased E. coli's relative fitness by an average of 24% at 42.2 °C, but they decreased fitness by 3% at 37.0 °C, illustrating that antagonistic pleiotropy likely affected the establishment of rescue in our system. Gene expression analysis revealed only 40 genes were upregulated across all seven mutations, and these were enriched for functions in translational and flagellar production. As with previous experiments with high temperature adaptation, the rescue mutations tended to restore gene expression toward the unstressed state, but they also caused a higher proportion of novel gene expression patterns. Overall, we find that rescue is infrequent, that it is facilitated by a limited number of mutational targets, and that rescue mutations may have qualitatively different effects than mutations that arise from evolution to nonlethal stressors. © The Author(s) 2020.

VL  - 21

SP  - 1097-1107
AB  - Body size is a multi-functional trait related to various fitness components, but the relative importance of different selection pressures is seldom resolved. In Carabus japonicus beetles, of which the larvae exclusively prey on earthworms, adult body size is related to the presence/absence of a larger congener and habitat temperature. In sympatry, C. japonicus consistently exhibits smaller body size which is effective for avoiding interspecific mating, but in allopatry, it shows size variation unrelated to temperature. Here, we show that this predator–size variation is attributed to prey–size variation, associated with high phylogenetic diversity in earthworm communities. In allopatry, the predator size was larger where larger prey occurred. Larger adult size may have been selected because larger females produce larger larvae, which can subdue larger prey. Thus, in the absence of a larger congener, variation in prey body size had a pronounced effect on geographic body size divergence in C. japonicus. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

TI  - Sex-specific ornament evolution is a consistent feature of climatic adaptation across space and time in dragonflies
VL  - 118
IS  - 28
AB  - Adaptation to different climates fuels the origins and maintenance of biodiversity. Detailing how organisms optimize fitness for their local climates is therefore an essential goal in biology. Although we increasingly understand how survival-related traits evolve as organisms adapt to climatic conditions, it is unclear whether organisms also optimize traits that coordinate mating between the sexes. Here, we show that dragonflies consistently adapt to warmer climates across space and time by evolving less male melanin ornamentation-a mating-related trait that also absorbs solar radiation and heats individuals above ambient temperatures. Continent-wide macroevolutionary analyses reveal that species inhabiting warmer climates evolve less male ornamentation. Communityscience observations across 10 species indicate that populations adapt to warmer parts of species' ranges through microevolution of smaller male ornaments. Observations from 2005 to 2019 detail that contemporary selective pressures oppose male ornaments in warmer years; and our climate-warming projections predict further decreases by 2070. Conversely, our analyses show that female ornamentation responds idiosyncratically to temperature across space and time, indicating the sexes evolve in different ways to meet the demands of the local climate. Overall, these macro- and microevolutionary findings demonstrate that organisms predictably optimize their mating-related traits for the climate just as they do their survival-related traits. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 28

SP  - 412-421
AB  - We investigated the age-related and sexual characteristics in Phrynocephalus helioscopus and P. grumgrzimailoi using the body condition index and its relationship to annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, altitude, and mean diurnal range. We collected body measurement data for 176 individuals of P. helioscopus and 84 individuals of P. grumgrzimailoi. The body condition index is comprised of the ratio of log body mass to log snout-vent length. There were significant differences of the body condition index between P. helioscopus and P. grumgrzimailoi. In P. grumgrzimailoi, body condition indices between the sexes were significantly different but were not in P. helioscopus. Differences between sub-adults and adults were significant in both species. Body condition index of P. grumgrzimailoi differed significantly through time but remained unchanged in P. helioscopus. Annual mean temperature is a significant predictor for body condition index of P. grumgrzimailoi and interacts with annual precipitation in our models. Meanwhile, altitude had significant effects on body condition index in P. helioscopus. These results suggest that these two species respond differently to various environmental factors, and their adaptability to different environmental conditions are not the same. © 2020, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Genomic Responses to Climate Change: Making the Most of the Drosophila Model
VL  - 12
AB  - It is pressing to understand how animal populations evolve in response to climate change. We argue that new sequencing technologies and the use of historical samples are opening unprecedented opportunities to investigate genome-wide responses to changing environments. However, there are important challenges in interpreting the emerging findings. First, it is essential to differentiate genetic adaptation from phenotypic plasticity. Second, it is extremely difficult to map genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Third, neutral demographic processes and natural selection affect genetic variation in similar ways. We argue that Drosophila melanogaster, a classical model organism with decades of climate adaptation research, is uniquely suited to overcome most of these challenges. In the near future, long-term time series genome-wide datasets of D. melanogaster natural populations will provide exciting opportunities to study adaptation to recent climate change and will lay the groundwork for related research in non-model systems. © Copyright © 2021 Rodrigues and Cogni.

TI  - Mitochondrial variation in small brown planthoppers linked to multiple traits and probably reflecting a complex evolutionary trajectory
VL  - 28
IS  - 14
SP  - 3306-3323
AB  - While it has been proposed in several taxa that the mitochondrial genome is associated with adaptive evolution to different climatic conditions, making links between mitochondrial haplotypes and organismal phenotypes remains a challenge. Mitonuclear discordance occurs in the small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus, with one mitochondrial haplogroup (HGI) more common in the cold climate region of China relative to another form (HGII) despite strong nuclear gene flow, providing a promising model to investigate climatic adaptation of mitochondrial genomes. We hypothesized that cold adaptation through HGI may be involved, and considered mitogenome evolution, population genetic analyses, and bioassays to test this hypothesis. In contrast to our hypothesis, chill-coma recovery tests and population genetic tests of selection both pointed to HGII being involved in cold adaptation. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HGII is nested within HGI, and has three nonsynonymous changes in ND2, ND5 and CYTB in comparison to HGI. These molecular changes likely increased mtDNA copy number, cold tolerance and fecundity of SBPH, particularly through a function-altering amino acid change involving M114T in ND2. Nuclear background also influenced fecundity and chill recovery (i.e., mitonuclear epistasis) and protein modelling indicates possible nuclear interactions for the two nonsynonymous changes in ND2 and CYTB. The high occurrence frequency of HGI in the cold climate region of China remains unexplained, but several possible reasons are discussed. Overall, our study points to a link between mtDNA variation and organismal-level evolution and suggests a possible role of mitonuclear interactions in maintaining mtDNA diversity. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Amino acid substitutions in ribosomal protein RpsU enable switching between high fitness and multiple-stress resistance in Listeria monocytogenes
VL  - 351
AB  - Microbial population heterogeneity contributes to differences in stress response between individual cells in a population, and can lead to the selection of genetically stable variants with increased stress resistance. We previously provided evidence that the multiple-stress resistant Listeria monocytogenes LO28 variant 15, carries a point mutation in the rpsU gene, resulting in an arginine-proline substitution in ribosomal protein RpsU (RpsU17Arg-Pro). Here, we investigated the trade-off between general stress sigma factor SigB-mediated stress resistance and fitness in variant 15 using experimental evolution. By selecting for higher fitness in two parallel evolving cultures, we identified two evolved variants: 15EV1 and 15EV2. Whole genome sequencing and SNP analysis showed that both parallel lines mutated in the same codon in rpsU as the original mutation resulting in RpsU17Pro-His (15EV1) and RpsU17Pro-Thr (15EV2). Using a combined phenotyping and proteomics approach, we assessed the resistance of the evolved variants to both heat and acid stress, and found that in both lines reversion to WT-like fitness also resulted in WT-like stress sensitivity. Proteome analysis of L. monocytogenes LO28 WT, variant 15, 15EV1, and 15EV2 revealed high level expression of SigB regulon members only in variant 15, whereas protein profiles of both evolved variants were highly similar to that of the LO28 WT. Experiments with constructed RpsU17Arg-Pro mutants in L. monocytogenes LO28 and EGDe, and RpsU17Arg-His and RpsU17Arg-Thr in LO28, confirmed that single amino acid substitutions in RpsU enable switching between multiple-stress resistant and high fitness states in L. monocytogenes. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Turtle Nest-Site Choice, Anthropogenic Challenges, and Evolutionary Potential for Adaptation
VL  - 9
AB  - Oviparous animals, such as turtles, lay eggs whose success or demise depends on environmental conditions that influence offspring phenotype (morphology, physiology, and in many reptiles, also sex determination), growth, and survival, while in the nest and post-hatching. Consequently, because turtles display little parental care, maternal provisioning of the eggs and female nesting behavior are under strong selection. But the consequences of when and where nests are laid are affected by anthropogenic habitat disturbances that alter suitable nesting areas, expose eggs to contaminants in the wild, and modify the thermal and hydric environment experienced by developing embryos, thus impacting hatchling survival and the sexual fate of taxa with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and genotypic sex determination (GSD). Indeed, global and local environmental change influences air, water, and soil temperature and moisture, which impact basking behavior, egg development, and conditions within the nest, potentially rendering current nesting strategies maladaptive as offspring mortality increases and TSD sex ratios become drastically skewed. Endocrine disruptors can sex reverse TSD and GSD embryos alike. Adapting to these challenges depends on genetic variation, and little to no heritability has been detected for nest-site behavior. However, modest heritability in threshold temperature (above and below which females or males develop in TSD taxa, respectively) exists in the wild, as well as interpopulation differences in the reaction norm of sex ratio to temperature, and potentially also in the expression of gene regulators of sexual development. If this variation reflects additive genetic components, some adaptation might be expected, provided that the pace of environmental change does not exceed the rate of evolution. Research remains urgently needed to fill current gaps in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of nest-site choice and its adaptive potential, integrating across multiple levels of organization.

TI  - A framework for understanding gene expression plasticity and its influence on stress tolerance
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
SP  - 1381-1397
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can serve as a stepping stone towards adaptation. Recently, studies have shown that gene expression contributes to emergent stress responses such as thermal tolerance, with tolerant and susceptible populations showing distinct transcriptional profiles. However, given the dynamic nature of gene expression, interpreting transcriptomic results in a way that elucidates the functional connection between gene expression and the observed stress response is challenging. Here, we present a conceptual framework to guide interpretation of gene expression reaction norms in the context of stress tolerance. We consider the evolutionary and adaptive potential of gene expression reaction norms and discuss the influence of sampling timing, transcriptomic resilience, as well as complexities related to life history when interpreting gene expression dynamics and how these patterns relate to host tolerance. We highlight corals as a case study to demonstrate the value of this framework for non-model systems. As species face rapidly changing environmental conditions, modulating gene expression can serve as a mechanistic link from genetic and cellular processes to the physiological responses that allow organisms to thrive under novel conditions. Interpreting how or whether a species can employ gene expression plasticity to ensure short-term survival will be critical for understanding the global impacts of climate change across diverse taxa. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Mutations in degP and spoT Genes Mediate Response to Fermentation Stress in Thermally Adapted Strains of Acetic Acid Bacterium Komagataeibacter medellinensis NBRC 3288
VL  - 13
AB  - An acetic acid bacterium, Komagataeibacter medellinensis NBRC 3288, was adapted to higher growth temperatures through an experimental evolution approach in acetic acid fermentation conditions, in which the cells grew under high concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid. The thermally adapted strains were shown to exhibit significantly increased growth and fermentation ability, compared to the wild strain, at higher temperatures. Although the wild cells were largely elongated and exhibited a rough cell surface, the adapted strains repressed the elongation and exhibited a smaller cell size and a smoother cell surface than the wild strain. Among the adapted strains, the ITO-1 strain isolated during the initial rounds of adaptation was shown to have three indel mutations in the genes gyrB, degP, and spoT. Among these, two dispensable genes, degP and spoT, were further examined in this study. Rough cell surface morphology related to degP mutation suggested that membrane vesicle-like structures were increased on the cell surface of the wild-type strain but repressed in the ITO-1 strain under high-temperature acetic acid fermentation conditions. The ΔdegP strain could not grow at higher temperatures and accumulated a large amount of membrane vesicles in the culture supernatant when grown even at 30°C, suggesting that the degP mutation is involved in cell surface stability. As the spoT gene of ITO-1 lost a 3′-end of 424 bp, which includes one (Act-4) of the possible two regulatory domains (TGS and Act-4), two spoT mutant strains were created: one (ΔTGSAct) with a drug cassette in between the 5′-half catalytic domain and 3′-half regulatory domains of the gene, and the other (ΔAct-4) in between TGS and Act-4 domains of the regulatory domain. These spoT mutants exhibited different growth responses; ΔTGSAct grew better in both the fermentation and non-fermentation conditions, whereas ΔAct-4 did only under fermentation conditions, such as ITO-1 at higher temperatures. We suggest that cell elongation and/or cell size are largely related to these spoT mutations, which may be involved in fermentation stress and thermotolerance.

TI  - Phenotypic Responses to and Genetic Architecture of Sterility Following Exposure to Sub-Lethal Temperature During Development
VL  - 11
AB  - Thermal tolerance range, based on temperatures that result in incapacitating effects, influences species’ distributions and has been used to predict species’ response to increasing temperature. Reproductive performance may also be negatively affected at less extreme temperatures, but such sublethal heat-induced sterility has been relatively ignored in studies addressing the potential effects of, and ability of species’ to respond to, predicted climate warming. The few studies examining the link between increased temperature and reproductive performance typically focus on adults, although effects can vary between life history stages. Here we assessed how sublethal heat stress during development impacted subsequent adult fertility and its plasticity, both of which can provide the raw material for evolutionary responses to increased temperature. We quantified phenotypic and genetic variation in fertility of Drosophila melanogaster reared at standardized densities in three temperatures (25, 27, and 29°C) from a set of lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found little phenotypic variation at the two lower temperatures with more variation at the highest temperature and for plasticity. Males were more affected than females. Despite reasonably large broad-sense heritabilities, a genome-wide association study found little evidence for additive genetic variance and no genetic variants were robustly linked with reproductive performance at specific temperatures or for phenotypic plasticity. We compared results on heat-induced male sterility with other DGRP results on relevant fitness traits measured after abiotic stress and found an association between male susceptibility to sterility and male lifespan reduction following oxidative stress. Our results suggest that sublethal stress during development has profound negative consequences on male adult reproduction, but despite phenotypic variation in a population for this response, there is limited evolutionary potential, either through adaptation to a specific developmental temperature or plasticity in response to developmental heat-induced sterility. © Copyright © 2020 Zwoinska, Rodrigues, Slate and Snook.

TI  - Elevational Changes in Mormon Cricket Life Histories: Minimum Temperature for Nymphal Growth Declines with Elevation
VL  - 50
IS  - 1
SP  - 167-172
AB  - As the mean temperature and the duration of the growing season decline with elevation, growth of immature insects should initiate at a lower temperature, but it should also be faster to complete development prior to season's end. Although flightless, Mormon crickets migrate in large aggregations across broad spatial and elevational distances that might limit adaptations to local environments. In addition, selection to be active at cooler temperatures might limit selection to maximize growth rate. I measured growth rate in controlled environments for nymphs from three populations that vary in altitude (87-2,688 m) but are similar in latitude (43.2-45.7°N). Growth rate increased significantly with mean rearing temperature between 22 and 30°C. The intercept of the regression of growth rate on temperature increased with elevation, whereas the slope did not change significantly. For any given rearing temperature, growth rate increased with elevation, which suggests that selection to initiate growth at cooler temperatures did not compromise growth rate. Body mass did not differ between the two lower elevations, whereas the highest elevation population had smaller hatchlings and adults. Critical thermal minimum (base temperature) declined with elevation (0.7°C per 1,000 m), and the degree days were 509 across all elevations. For pest management, a base temperature from midelevation of 15.3°C (60°F) and growing degree days of 509 (equivalent to 916 Fahrenheit-based degree days) are reasonable estimates for applications from sea level to 2,700 m. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2020.

TI  - Minnows may be more reproductively resilient to climatic variability than anticipated: Synthesis from a reproductive vulnerability assessment of Gangetic pool barbs (Puntius sophore)
VL  - 105
SP  - 727-736
AB  - Information on various aspects of reproductive traits of female pool barbs from various stretches of Ganga River basin, India was generated in relation to climatic variability. The presumptions surrounding – minnows being the first and easily hit by climatic variability, was validated. GAM models revealed low threshold rainfall requirement (&gt;50 mm) within a wide temperature range (20–30 °C) necessary for attainment of breeding GSI (&gt;10.5 units). Pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn50) and size at 50% maturity (LM50) benchmarked through Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were in the range 1.61–1.67 units (Fulton condition factor) and 8.6–9.0 cm respectively. Mapping of climate preferendum through LOESS smoothing hinted both low-mild rainfall (50–150 mm) and high rainfall conditions (400–700 mm) conducive for attaining pre-spawning fitness while no dependence on temperature was observed. First maturity of females was encountered at 4.7 cm within the size range 4.4–12.6 cm. The present study hinted a probable reduction (1.4–1.8 cm) in size at maturity of female pool barbs. We observed pool barbs can breed within a wide thermal regime following slightest of rainfall events. Collating this with the present rates of climatic variability, we infer negligible threat of changing climate on reproduction of Puntius sophore in near future – contrary to the existing presumptions. Owing to the easiness in attainment of pre-spawning fitness under an apparently flexible climate preferendum, ‘skipped spawning’ decisions while facing climatic variability also seem minimum. The recorded breeding thresholds may serve as future references while assessing climate driven changes on reproduction and evolutionary adaptations in Gangetic minnows. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Psychrophiles are organisms living in extremely cold conditions within the temperature range of −20°C to + 10°C. These organisms survive in harsh environment by modulating their genetic make-up to thrive in extremely cold conditions. These cold-adaptations are closely associated with changes in the life forms, gene expression, and proteins, enzymes, lipids, etc. This review gives a brief description of the life and genetic adaptations of psychrophiles for their survival in extreme conditions as well as the bioactive compounds that are potential antimicrobials. © 2021, Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - A Two-Stage Cooperative Multi-objective Evolutionary Differential Algorithm for Combined Heat and Power Economic Emission Dispatch
AB  - Combined heat and power economic emission dispatch (CHPEED) can obtain good economic and environmental benefits, but the dispatch problem presents non-convex, nonlinear, multi-constrained and multi-objective characteristics. Thus, a two-stage cooperative multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm (TCADEA) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm uses a two-stage framework: the first stage uses a two-population strategy to divide the population into an elite population and an ordinary population, where the elite population is used to obtain better target values and the ordinary population is used to search the target space to ensure the diversity of the population and update the two populations by different adaptive differential operators. In addition, the ε constraint processing technique is used to handle the constraints. The second stage combines two populations into one and generates offspring through the constrained dominance principle (CDP) and adaptive differential evolution to maintain well-distributed population. The actual case results show that the TCADEA algorithm reduces $0.034 × 106, $0.008 × 106, $0.07 × 106 and 113 × 105 lb, 102 × 105 lb, 155 × 105 lb in fuel cost and emissions compared to MODE, NSGA-II, and TOP, respectively. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

TI  - ROLE OF TREMATOMUS BERNACCHII DUSP1 GENE IN CELL COLD RESISTANCE
VL  - 46
IS  - 8
SP  - 1105-1112
AB  - Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (dusp1) is an enzyme to inactivate MAPKs by selectively dephosphorylating critical serine/threonine residues. Dusp1 plays an important role in many environmental stress including hypoxia, oxidative stress, UV and heat shock. However, the role of dusp1 in response to cold stress has been rarely reported in fish species, especially in polar fish. To address this, we cloned a dusp1 homolog gene encoding 376 amino acids from Trematomus bernacchii. The open reading frame encoding dusp1 was amplified by PCR with homologous recombination approach cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector, referred to as pcDNA3.1-dusp1. The constructed eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. 1-dusp1 were transferred into the human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, and pcDNA3.1 (empty vector)-transfected cells were used as a negative control. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assayed using fluorescence probe DCFH-DA and the survival rate under low temperature stress was detected by flow cytometry, respectively. A Western-blot analysis was applied to determine the phosphorylation of P38/MAPK levels and the apoptosis effector gene caspase-3 mRNA expression levels were measured using RT-qPCR. The results showed the T. bernacchii DUSP1 protein in the HEK293T cells with the subcellular localization at nucleus. Dusp1 over-expression significantly decreased ROS content and apoptosis rate in cells under cold stress, and it also suppressed hyperphosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic gene p38 and decreased caspase-3 transcriptional activity. These results indicated that dusp1 from T. bernacchii can protect cells from the damage under cold stress, and this protection was achieved by inhibiting of the p38MAPK and caspase-3 activation. This study provide new insights of the cold temperature adaptive evolution of polar fish and lay a foundation for further functional studies of dusp1 in teleosts under cold stress. © 2022, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Associations between attention and implicit associative learning in healthy adults: The role of cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase responses to an acute stressor
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
SP  - 1-20
AB  - In this study, we investigated the associations between implicit associative learning with the cortisol and salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) stress response to an acute stressor as well as their associations with attention. Eighty one healthy adults (25 male) participated and either performed the socially evaluated cold-pressor test (SECPT) or a warm-water control task (WWT). Either prior to or immediately after the SECPT/WWT, participants implicitly learned digit-symbol pairs. A not-previously announced recall test was conducted about 20 min after the SECPT/WWT. Attention was assessed by means of a Stroop task at nine time points over the course of the experiment. Memory recall performance was not significantly associated with the acquisition time point (pre or post stressor) and did not significantly differ between the responder groups (i.e., non-responders, sAA-and-cortisol responders, only sAA responders, and only cortisol responders). Attentional performance increased throughout the experiment (i.e., reaction times in the Stroop task decreased). No differences in the attentional time course were found between the responder groups. However, some associations were found (puncorrected &lt; 0.05) that did not pass the multiple comparison adjusted alpha level of αadjusted = 0.002, indicating different associations between attention and implicit learning between the responder groups. We conclude that the associations of sAA and cortisol responses with implicit learning are complex and are related to each other. Further studies in which both (sAA and cortisol responses) are selectively (de-) activated are needed. Furthermore, different learning tasks and less—potentially stressful—attentional assessments should be used in future research. Moreover, field studies are needed in which the associations between acute stress and implicit associative learning are investigated in everyday life. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Extreme insolation: Climatic variation shapes the evolution of thermal tolerance at multiple scales
VL  - 192
IS  - 3
SP  - 347-359
AB  - The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) is a cornerstone of thermal ecology, predicting the evolution of wider organismal thermal tolerance ranges in more thermally variable environments. Thermal tolerance ranges depend on both upper and lower tolerance limits (critical thermal maxima [CTmax ] and critical thermal minima [CTmin ]), which may show different responses to environmental gradients. To delineate the relative effects of mean and extreme temperatures on thermal tolerances, we conducted a within-latitude comparative test of CVH predictions for army ants (Dorylinae) at multiple scales: across elevations, in seasonal versus aseasonal forests, and in subterranean versus surface microhabitats. Consistent with the CVH, thermally buffered subterranean species had narrower thermal tolerance ranges. Both CTmin and CTmax decreased with elevation for subterranean species. In contrast, aboveground species (those exposed to insolation) showed a decrease in CTmin but no change in CTmax across elevations. Furthermore, greater seasonal temperature variation in dry forests correlated with increased CTmax but not CTmin. These patterns suggest that CTmax and CTmin respond to different abiotic selective forces: habitat-specific exposure to extreme insolation corresponds to CTmax differences but not to CTmin variation. We predict that increasingly frequent heat spikes associated with climate change will have habitat-specific physiological consequences for ectothermic animals. Models predicting climate change impacts should account for species microhabitat uses and within-latitude differences in temperature seasonality. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - The role of selection and evolution in changing parturition date in a red deer population
VL  - 17
IS  - 11
AB  - Changing environmental conditions cause changes in the distributions of phenotypic traits in natural populations. However, determining the mechanisms responsible for these changes - and, in particular, the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity versus evolutionary responses - is difficult. To our knowledge, no study has yet reported evidence that evolutionary change underlies the most widely reported phenotypic response to climate change: the advancement of breeding times. In a wild population of red deer, average parturition date has advanced by nearly 2 weeks in 4 decades. Here, we quantify the contribution of plastic, demographic, and genetic components to this change. In particular, we quantify the role of direct phenotypic plasticity in response to increasing temperatures and the role of changes in the population structure. Importantly, we show that adaptive evolution likely played a role in the shift towards earlier parturition dates. The observed rate of evolution was consistent with a response to selection and was less likely to be due to genetic drift. Our study provides a rare example of observed rates of genetic change being consistent with theoretical predictions, although the consistency would not have been detected with a solely phenotypic analysis. It also provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of both evolution and phenotypic plasticity contributing to advances in phenology in a changing climate. © 2019 Bonnet et al.

TI  - Increasing temperature elevates the variation and spatial differentiation of pesticide tolerance in a plant pathogen
VL  - 14
IS  - 5
SP  - 1274-1285
AB  - Climate change and pesticide resistance are two of the most imminent challenges human society is facing today. Knowledge of how the evolution of pesticide resistance may be affected by climate change such as increasing air temperature on the planet is important for agricultural production and ecological sustainability in the future but is lack in scientific literatures reported from empirical research. Here, we used the azoxystrobin-Phytophthora infestans interaction in agricultural systems to investigate the contributions of environmental temperature to the evolution of pesticide resistance and infer the impacts of global warming on pesticide efficacy and future agricultural production and ecological sustainability. We achieved this by comparing azoxystrobin sensitivity of 180 P. infestans isolates sampled from nine geographic locations in China under five temperature schemes ranging from 13 to 25°C. We found that local air temperature contributed greatly to the difference of azoxystrobin tolerance among geographic populations of the pathogen. Both among-population and within-population variations in azoxystrobin tolerance increased as experimental temperatures increased. We also found that isolates with higher azoxystrobin tolerance adapted to a broader thermal niche. These results suggest that global warming may enhance the risk of developing pesticide resistance in plant pathogens and highlight the increased challenges of administering pesticides for effective management of plant diseases to support agricultural production and ecological sustainability under future thermal conditions. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Liquid Fuel Survey for Rotating Detonation Rocket Engines
AB  - The majority of current research into rotating detonation rocket engines (RDREs) has focused on the detonation of gaseous propellants. Liquid-liquid RDREs – where both propellants are introduced to the chamber in their liquid phase – are of interest because of their predicted higher performance potential due to the much higher detonation pressures and temperatures evolved from the detonation of the high-density, liquid mixtures. Few studies in the open literature have explored fully liquid propellant combinations and fewer have been propellants directly applicable to booster-applications. It is unknown if fuels that are trademarks of the constant pressure engine (CPE) field, like hydrogen, kerosene (RP), and methane, are the optimal option for an RDRE. In an RDRE, the peak detonation pressure and temperature and deflagration time scale of a propellant combination contribute to both the viability and performance of the engine; these properties do not necessarily correlate with desirable features for CPE propellants. In the following study, the detonation of liquid oxygen with fourteen different liquid fuels is considered with respect to properties relevant to RDREs. Three fuels – methane, RP, and propylene – were chosen for further evaluation with a 0-D liquid-liquid RDRE performance prediction code. This survey provides a baseline for comparison of liquid fuels; however, experimental studies will be required to baseline the performance prediction method and ascertain the importance of the propellant properties critical to RDRE operation and performance. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Species extinction rates are many times greater than the direst predictions made two decades ago by environmentalists, largely because of human impact. Major concerns are associated with the predicted higher recurrence and severity of extreme events, such as heat waves. Although tolerance to these extreme events is instrumental to species survival, little is known whether and how it evolves in natural populations, and to what extent it is affected by other environmental stressors. Here, we study physiological and molecular mechanisms of thermal tolerance over evolutionary times in multifarious environments. Using the practice of “resurrection ecology” on the keystone grazer Daphnia magna, we quantified genetic and plastic differences in physiological and molecular traits linked to thermal tolerance in historical and modern genotypes of the same population. This population experienced an increase in average temperature and occurrence of heat waves, in addition to dramatic changes in water chemistry, over five decades. On genotypes resurrected across the five decades, we measured plastic and genetic differences in CTmax, body size, Hb content and differential expression of four heat shock proteins after exposure to temperature as single stress and in combination with food levels and insecticide loads. We observed evolution of the critical thermal maximum and plastic response in body size, HSP expression and Hb content over time in a warming only scenario. Molecular and physiological responses to extreme temperature in multifarious environments were not predictable from the response to warming alone. Underestimating the effect of multiple stressors on thermal tolerance can lead to wrong estimates of species evolvability and persistence. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Linking thermal adaptation and life-history theory explains latitudinal patterns of voltinism
VL  - 374
IS  - 1778
AB  - Insect life cycles are adapted to a seasonal climate by expressing alternative voltinism phenotypes-the number of generations in a year. Variation in voltinism phenotypes along latitudinal gradients may be generated by developmental traits at critical life stages, such as eggs. Both voltinism and egg development are thermally determined traits, yet independently derived models of voltinism and thermal adaptation refer to the evolution of dormancy and thermal sensitivity of development rate, respectively, as independent influences on life history. To reconcile these models and test their respective predictions, we characterized patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate along a latitudinal temperature gradient using the matchstick grasshopper genus Warramaba. We found remarkably strong variation in voltinism patterns, as well as corresponding egg dormancy patterns and thermal responses of egg development. Our results show that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was explained by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation. We suggest that latitudinal patterns in thermal responses and corresponding life histories need to consider the evolution of thermal response curves within the context of seasonal temperature cycles rather than based solely on optimality and trade-offs in performance.

VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 752-772
AB  - Intraspecific genetic diversity and divergence have a large influence on the adaption and evolutionary potential of species. The widely distributed starfish, Coscinasterias tenuispina, combines sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction via fission. Here we analyse the phylogeography of this starfish to reveal historical and contemporary processes driving its intraspecific genetic divergence. We further consider whether asexual reproduction is the most important method of propagation throughout the distribution range of this species. Our study included 326 individuals from 16 populations, covering most of the species’ distribution range. A total of 12 nuclear microsatellite loci and sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene were analysed. COI and microsatellites were clustered in two isolated lineages: one found along the southwestern Atlantic and the other along the northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. This suggests the existence of two different evolutionary units. Marine barriers along the European coast would be responsible for population clustering: the Almeria–Oran Front that limits the entrance of migrants from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, and the Siculo-Tunisian strait that divides the two Mediterranean basins. The presence of identical genotypes was detected in all populations, although two monoclonal populations were found in two sites where annual mean temperatures and minimum values were the lowest. Our results based on microsatellite loci showed that intrapopulation genetic diversity was significantly affected by clonality whereas it had lower effect for the global phylogeography of the species, although still some impact on populations’ genetic divergence could be observed between some populations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - The cooler the better? Indirect effect of spring–summer temperature on fecundity in a capital breeder
VL  - 9
IS  - 6
AB  - Female reproductive performance is a central component of ungulate population dynamics, and it can be influenced by individual, social, and environmental factors. Researchers have often assumed direct effects of different predictors on reproduction, yet more complex relationships should be considered when investigating temporal variations in life-history traits within a broader eco-evolutionary context. In this study, we explored direct effects of individual, social, and environmental predictors on female reproductive performance and investigated potential causal chains among variables. We analyzed the variation in fecundity, measured as the probability of being pregnant, in 215 adult female deer Cervus elaphus culled on the Italian Alps, with respect to age, body mass, kidney fat, jaw length, lactation status, population size, temperature and precipitation in spring–summer, temperature and snow depth in winter, and the delayed effect of spring–summer temperature. We used random forest and logistic regression models to select variables whose direct effects best explained variation in fecundity. Path analysis was used to test for alternative hypotheses of direct/indirect effects between pre-selected weather (spring–summer temperature) and individual (age, kidney fat index [KFI]) predictors. The most important direct predictors of fecundity were age, kidney fat, and the interaction between kidney fat and spring–summer temperature. Path analysis supported the hypothesis that higher spring–summer temperature had negative, indirect effects on the probability of being pregnant, mediated by decreasing values of KFI. Our study revealed some complex, cause–effect relationships between weather stochasticity, body condition, and reproduction, possibly suggesting a conditional trade-off between opportunity for reproduction and survival, and emphasizing how environmental variations and individual characteristics may interact to shape life-history traits in ungulate populations. © 2018 The Authors.

VL  - 571
AB  - Raman spectroscopic analyses of thermally altered organic materials can be used to assess the paleothermometry of the sedimentary deposits. Although this technique has been widely applied to diverse microfossils, macroscopic vertebrate fossils have been neglected. In this paper, we show that fossil eggshells can be used for this purpose by demonstrating the paleothermometric potential of diverse amniotic eggshells from the Wido Volcanics (Upper Cretaceous, South Korea) that contain thermally altered organic material. We estimate the maximum paleotemperature recorded in the eggshells using Raman spectroscopic data and the spectrum deconvolution technique, which was invented and developed by organic geochemists. The results show that the same type of eggshells record different paleotemperature gradients depending on their spatial distribution in the fossil locality, whereas different types of eggshells from similar locations show similar paleotemperature gradients (except for one specimen with a peculiar microstructure). These findings are further supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic results, which focus on thermally altered organic materials, and electron backscatter diffraction data, which focus on calcite twinning. This study suggests that fossil eggshells are useful and reliable materials for paleothermometry because thermally altered organic materials and calcites of eggshells provide independent opportunities to assess paleothermometry. We propose that fossil eggshells may be useful for evaluating the thermal evolution of sedimentary basins. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Putative Independent Evolutionary Reversals from Genotypic to Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination are Associated with Accelerated Evolution of Sex-Determining Genes in Turtles
VL  - 86
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-26
AB  - The evolutionary lability of sex-determining mechanisms across the tree of life is well recognized, yet the extent of molecular changes that accompany these repeated transitions remain obscure. Most turtles retain the ancestral temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) from which multiple transitions to genotypic sex determination (GSD) occurred independently, and two contrasting hypotheses posit the existence or absence of reversals back to TSD. Here we examined the molecular evolution of the coding regions of a set of gene regulators involved in gonadal development in turtles and several other vertebrates. We found slower molecular evolution in turtles and crocodilians compared to other vertebrates, but an acceleration in Trionychia turtles and at some phylogenetic branches demarcating major taxonomic diversification events. Of all gene classes examined, hormone signaling genes, and Srd5a1 in particular, evolve faster in many lineages and especially in turtles. Our data show that sex-linked genes do not follow a ubiquitous nor uniform pattern of molecular evolution. We then evaluated turtle nucleotide and protein evolution under two evolutionary hypotheses with or without GSD-to-TSD reversals, and found that when GSD-to-TSD reversals are considered, all transitional branches irrespective of direction, exhibit accelerated molecular evolution of nucleotide sequences, while GSD-to-TSD transitional branches also show acceleration in protein evolution. Significant changes in predicted secondary structure that may affect protein function were identified in three genes that exhibited hastened evolution in turtles compared to other vertebrates or in transitional versus non-transitional branches within turtles, rendering them candidates for a key role during SDM evolution in turtles. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The adsorption heat of methane on coal: Comparison of theoretical and calorimetric heat and model of heat flow by microcalorimeter
VL  - 237
SP  - 81-90
AB  - Various methods have been proposed to determine the heat of adsorption indirectly from adsorption isotherms or directly through calorimeter, whereas authors rarely compared different models for calculating isosteric heat of methane adsorption on coal and seldom studied adsorption thermodynamics related to calorimetric heat flux. In this work, for better probing thermodynamics of adsorption of methane on coal, seeking a reliable model to describe adsorption heat, and predicting the adsorption heat at given temperatures and pressures from heat flow, isothermal adsorption experiments of methane on anthracite at temperatures of 298 K, 308 K and 318 K were conducted, with both calorimetric and volumetric method. The calorimetric results indicate that isosteric heat decreases with the increase of adsorption capacity and temperature. Then the calorimetric heat was compared with the isosteric heat using four adsorption models, in the fitness sequence of D-A > Toth > C–C > Virial. To be noted that the heat flux measured calorimetrically increases to the crest rapidly, then gradually decreases to the initial state. This tendency is proposed to be described by the exponential function with the fitting parameters estimated by empirical formulas proposed. The predicted heat flows were thus acquired, agreeing well with the experimental data except for the low coverage or pressure stage. Furthermore, it is revealed that the temperature evolution of adsorption can also be expressed by an exponential-like polynomial solution, induced from the proposed thermal flux prediction model based on the Tian's equation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The effects of impacts on the cooling rates of iron meteorites
VL  - 54
IS  - 7
SP  - 1604-1618
AB  - Iron meteorites provide a record of the thermal evolution of their parent bodies, with cooling rates inferred from the structures observed in the Widmanstätten pattern. Traditional planetesimal thermal models suggest that meteorite samples derived from the same iron core would have identical cooling rates, possibly providing constraints on the sizes and structures of their parent bodies. However, some meteorite groups exhibit a range of cooling rates or point to uncomfortably small parent bodies whose survival is difficult to reconcile with dynamical models. Together, these suggest that some meteorites are indicating a more complicated origin. To date, thermal models have largely ignored the effects that impacts would have on the thermal evolution of the iron meteorite parent bodies. Here we report numerical simulations investigating the effects that impacts at different times have on cooling rates of cores of differentiated planetesimals. We find that impacts that occur when the core is near or above its solidus, but the mantle has largely crystallized can expose iron near the surface of the body, leading to rapid and nonuniform cooling. The time period when a planetesimal can be affected in this way can range between 20 and 70 Myr after formation for a typical 100 km radius planetesimal. Collisions during this time would have been common, and thus played an important role in shaping the properties of iron meteorites. © The Meteoritical Society, 2019.

TI  - Pluto’s ocean is capped and insulated by gas hydrates
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
SP  - 407-410
AB  - Many icy Solar System bodies possess subsurface oceans. On Pluto, Sputnik Planitia’s location near the equator suggests the presence of a subsurface ocean and a locally thinned ice shell. To maintain an ocean, Pluto needs to retain heat inside. On the other hand, to maintain large variations in its thickness, Pluto’s ice shell needs to be cold. Here we show, by thermal evolution and viscous relaxation calculations, that the presence of a thin layer of clathrate hydrates (gas hydrates) at the base of the ice shell can explain both the long-term survival of the ocean and the maintenance of shell thickness contrasts. Clathrate hydrates act as a thermal insulator, preventing the ocean from completely freezing while keeping the ice shell cold and immobile. The most likely clathrate guest gas is methane, derived from precursor bodies and/or cracking of organic materials in the hot rocky core. Nitrogen molecules initially contained and/or produced later in the core would probably not be trapped as clathrate hydrates, instead supplying the nitrogen-rich surface and atmosphere. The formation of a thin clathrate hydrate layer cap to a subsurface ocean may be an important generic mechanism to maintain long-lived subsurface oceans in relatively large but minimally heated icy satellites and Kuiper belt objects. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

VL  - 17

SP  - 111-121
AB  - Ectothermic animals depend on environmental temperature to regulate their body temperature. The Chaco Tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis) is widespread in South America; however, populations are threatened mainly because of the pet trade. We described the activity pattern of C. chilensis relative to environmental temperature under semi-natural conditions in a zoo enclosure. We also estimated thermal parameters under controlled laboratory conditions: selected temperature (Tsel) and critical maximum temperature (CTmax) between sex and size indicators. In the enclosure, 81% of the observations were from inactive tortoises and 19% from active tortoises. Tortoises were active over a wide thermal range (12.0°–38.0° C) and Tsel was 34.4° ± 0.3° C (mean ± standard error), with no significant differences among sizes or between sexes. Heavier tortoises spent significantly more time at the lowest temperature than lighter ones. The range of CTmax was 36.3°–42.0° C and this parameter was inversely related to tortoise length but did not differ between sexes. The results suggest a wide thermal range in C. chilensis, dependence of thermal behavior on body size but not on sex, and a wider range of body temperatures in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Knowing the parameters that influence thermoregulation contributes to the improvement of management strategies under semi-natural conditions, which, in turn, can be extrapolated to wild populations. © 2022.

VL  - 58

AB  - Residual feed intake (RFI) is the difference between an animal's actual feed intake and that which would be expected based on production. This experiment was to test the hypothesis that part of the variation in RFI may be due to differences in energetic efficiency through changes in heat production, these being in part due to differences in protein metabolism. Following three generations of divergent selection for RFI, eight High and eight Low-RFI heifers were fed at both 105% and 180% of predicted maintenance feed requirements. Between-RFI line and feeding-level differences were assessed for energy intake, protein metabolism, heat production, body composition, energy and nitrogen balance and digestibility. The RFI lines did not differ in protein metabolism or heat production. The High-RFI heifers deposited 51% and 56% more subcutaneous fat at the P8 rump and 12/13th rib sites, respectively, with no difference in eye muscle area gain or average daily weight gain. The greater fat deposition of High-RFI heifers was due to a larger ad libitum feed consumption compared with the Low-RFI heifers. Energy and nitrogen balance did not differ between the RFI lines. The energy transactions indicated no difference in the efficiency of energy use on 105% maintenance, although when fed 180% of maintenance the differences in feed intake suggest variation in appetite as the mechanism contributing to RFI. All of the extra energy consumed by High-RFI heifers above maintenance and deposition of protein was associated with additional energy retained as fat. This study suggests that selection for RFI may not lead to improved efficiency of energy use. © 2018 CSIRO.

TI  - Thermal evolution of life history and heat tolerance during range expansions toward warmer and cooler regions
VL  - 101
IS  - 10
AB  - Species’ range edges are expanding to both warmer and cooler regions. Yet, no studies directly compared the changes in range-limiting traits within the same species during both types of range expansions. To increase our mechanistic understanding of range expansions, it is crucial to disentangle the contributions of plastic and genetic changes in these traits. The aim of this study was to test for plastic and evolutionary changes in heat tolerance, life history, and behavior, and compare these during range expansions toward warmer and cooler regions. Using laboratory experiments we reconstructed the thermal performance curves (TPCurves) of larval life history (survival, growth, and development rates) and larval heat tolerance (CTmax) across two recent range expansions from the core populations in southern France toward a warmer (southeastern Spain) and a cooler (northwestern Spain) region in Europe by the damselfly Ischnura elegans. First-generation larvae from field-collected mothers were reared across a range of temperatures (16°–28°C) in incubators. The range expansion to the warmer region was associated with the evolution of a greater ability to cope with high temperatures (increased mean and thermal plasticity of CTmax), faster development, and, in part, a faster growth, indicating a higher time constraints caused by a shorter time frame available for larval development associated with a transition to a greater voltinism. Our results thereby support the emerging pattern that plasticity in heat tolerance alone is inadequate to adapt to new thermal regimes. The range expansion to the cooler region was associated with faster growth indicating countergradient variation without a change in CTmax. The evolution of a faster growth rate during both range expansions could be explained by a greater digestive efficiency rather than an increased food intake. Our results highlight that range expansions to warmer and cooler regions can result in similar evolutionary changes in the TPCurves for life history, and no opposite changes in heat tolerance. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Caves, crevices and cooling capacity: Roost microclimate predicts heat tolerance in bats
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 38-50
AB  - The microsites that animals occupy during the rest phase of their circadian activity cycle influence their physiology and behaviour, but relatively few studies have examined correlations between interspecific variation in thermal physiology and roost microclimate. Among bats, there is some evidence that species exposed to high roost temperatures (Troost) possess greater heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity, but the small number of species for which both thermal physiology and roost microclimate data exist mean that the generality of this pattern remains unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that bat heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity have co-evolved with roost preferences. We predicted that species occupying roosts poorly buffered from high outside environmental temperature exhibit higher heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity compared to species inhabiting buffered roosts in which Troost remains well below outside conditions. We used flow-through respirometry to investigate thermoregulation at air temperatures (Ta) approaching and exceeding normothermic body temperature (Tb) among six species with broadly similar body mass but differing in roost microclimate (hot vs. cool roosts). We combined these data with empirical measurements of Troost for each study population. Hot-roosting species tolerated Ta ~4°C higher than cool-roosting bats before the onset of loss of coordinated locomotion and non-regulated hyperthermia. The evaporative scope (i.e. ratio of maximum evaporative water loss [EWL] to minimum thermoneutral EWL) of hot-roosting species (16.1 ± 2.4) was substantially higher than that of cool-roosting species (5.9 ± 2.4). Maximum evaporative cooling capacities (i.e. evaporative heat loss/metabolic heat production) of hot-roosting species were &gt;2, while the corresponding values for cool-roosting species were ≤1. The greater heat tolerance and higher evaporative cooling capacity of hot-roosting species compared with those occupying cooler roosts reveal variation in bat evaporative cooling capacity correlated with roost microclimate, supporting the hypothesis that thermal physiology has co-evolved with roost preference.

TI  - Annelids in extreme aquatic environments: Diversity, adaptations and evolution
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
SP  - 1-23
AB  - We review the variety of morphological, physiological and behavioral modifications that annelids have acquired to cope with environments either unsuitable for, or on the limits of, survival for most animals. We focus on polychaetes (excluding sipunculans and echiurans) and clitellates (oligochaetes and leeches) and source information mostly from the primary literature. We identified many modifications common to both polychaetes and clitellates, and others that are specific to one or the other group. For example, certain land-adapted polychaetes show reduction in nuchal organs, epidermal ciliation and receptor cells, and other coastal polychaetes use adhesive glands and glue-reinforced tubes to maintain position in surf zones, while oligochaetes, with their simple body plans, appear to be ‘pre-adapted’ to life underground. Modifications common to both groups include the ability to construct protective cocoons, make cryoprotective substances such as antifreeze and heat shock proteins, develop gills, transform their bodies into a home for symbiotic chemoautotrophic bacteria, metabolize contaminants, and display avoidance behaviors. Convergent evolution in both directions has enabled annelids to transition from salt water to freshwater, sea to land via beaches, freshwater to soil, and surface water to subterranean water. A superficially simple worm-like body and a mostly benthic/burrowing lifestyle has facilitated radiation into every conceivable environment, making annelids among the most common and diverse animal groups on the planet. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 52
IS  - 1
SP  - 113-119
AB  - Tests of hypotheses for the evolution of thermal physiology often rely on mean temperatures, but mounting evidence suggests geographic variation in temperature extremes is also an important predictor of species’ thermal tolerances. Although the tropics are less thermally variable than higher latitude regions, rain shadows on the leeward sides of mountains can experience greater diel and seasonal variation in temperature than windward sites. Rain shadows provide opportunities to test predictions about the relationships of extreme temperatures with thermal physiology while controlling for latitude. We tested the hypothesis that populations of leaf-cutting ants (Atta cephalotes) in leeward, montane, and windward sites in Costa Rica would differ in upper thermal tolerances (CTmax) of workers. As predicted from rain shadow effects via extreme high temperatures, the leeward rain shadow site yielded the highest mean CTmax (rain shadow site 42.1 ± 0.3°C, Montane site 38.2 ± 0.5°C, and windward site 38.2 ± 0.3°C). This suggests that high-temperature extremes in tropical rain shadow forests can select for higher thermal tolerances. CTmax increased with worker body size within sites, but CTmax increased with body size more gradually at the two lowland sites, as predicted if local high temperatures selected more strongly on the most thermally vulnerable society members (small workers). This suggests that warmer lowland climates selected for colonies with less variation in heat tolerance than cooler high elevation climates.

SP  - 893-903
AB  - Whole-genome sequence of Pseudomonas sp. Kongs-67 retrieved from Kongsfjorden, an Arctic fjord, has been investigated to understand the molecular machinery required for microbial association and survival in a polar fjord. The genome size of Kongs-67 was 4.5 Mb and was found to be closely related to the Antarctic P. pelagia strain CL-AP6. This genome encodes for chemotaxis response regulator proteins (CheABB1RR2VWYZ), chemoreceptors (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins), and flagellar system proteins (FliCDEFGOPMN, FlhABF, FlgBCDEFGHIJKL, and MotAB proteins) vital in cellular interactions in the dynamic fjord environment. A high proportion of genes were assigned to biofilm formation (pgaABCD operon) and signal transduction protein categories (EnvZ/OmpR, CpxA/CpxR, PhoR/PhoB, PhoQ) indicating that the biofilm formation in Kongs-67 could be tightly regulated in response to the availability of signalling-metabolites. The genome of Kongs-67 encoded for HemBCD, CbiA, CobABNSTOQCDP, and BtuBFR proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and transport along with proteins for siderophore-mediated iron channelling (PchR, Fur protein, FpvA); crucial in a microbial association. The genomes of Arctic strain Kongs-67 and Antarctic strain CL-AP6 were similar which is indicative of retainment of the core genes in the polar Pseudomonas strains that could be vital in conferring evolutionary adaptation for its survival in a polar fjord. Thus, our study contributes to the knowledge on the genetics of a polar Pseudomonas member exhibiting biosynthetic potentials and suggest Pseudomonas sp. Kongs-67 as a suitable candidate for the investigation of functional aspects of molecular adaptations in the polar marine environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 88
IS  - 12
SP  - 1961-1972
AB  - Trait-based studies are needed to understand the plastic and genetic responses of organisms to warming. A neglected organismal trait is elemental composition, despite its potential to cascade into effects on the ecosystem level. Warming is predicted to shape elemental composition through shifts in storage molecules associated with responses in growth, body size and metabolic rate. Our goals were to quantify thermal response patterns in body composition and to obtain insights into their underlying drivers and their evolution across latitudes. We reconstructed the thermal response curves (TRCs) for body elemental composition [C (carbon), N (nitrogen) and the C:N ratio] of damselfly larvae from high- and low-latitude populations. Additionally, we quantified the TRCs for survival, growth and development rates and body size to assess local thermal adaptation, as well as the TRCs for metabolic rate and key macromolecules (proteins, fat, sugars and cuticular melanin and chitin) as these may underlie the elemental TRCs. All larvae died at 36°C. Up to 32°C, low-latitude larvae increased growth and development rates and did not suffer increased mortality. Instead, growth and development rates of high-latitude larvae were lower and levelled off at 24°C, and mortality increased at 32°C. This latitude-associated thermal adaptation pattern matched the ‘hotter-is-better’ hypothesis. With increasing temperatures, low-latitude larvae decreased C:N, while high-latitude larvae increased C:N. These patterns were driven by associated changes in N contents, while C contents did not respond to temperature. Consistent with the temperature-size rule and the thermal melanism hypothesis, body size and melanin levels decreased with warming. While all traits and associated macromolecules (except for metabolic rate that showed thermal compensation) assumed to underlie thermal responses in elemental composition showed thermal plasticity, these were largely independent and none could explain the stoichiometric TRCs. Our results highlight that thermal responses in elemental composition cannot be explained by traditionally assumed drivers, asking for a broader perspective including the thermal dependence of elemental fluxes. Another key implication is that thermal evolution can reverse the plastic stoichiometric thermal responses and hence reverse how warming may shape food web dynamics through changes in body composition at different latitudes. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Do female reproductive stage and phenotype influence thermal requirements in an oviparous lizard?
VL  - 71
SP  - 202-208
AB  - Reproduction is an energetically costly activity that can alter thermal requirements in Squamata. This phenomenon has been largely studied in many viviparous species; however, little is known about the role of oviparous females in controlling temperature during vitellogenesis and embryo development before oviposition. Diversity of female phenotypes could be associated with diversity of thermoregulatory performance, since thermal requirements are frequently influenced by body shape. Furthermore, studying the thermoregulatory behaviour is fundamental to understand how females regulate their body temperature. Here, we aimed to determine whether reproduction alters thermal requirements in an oviparous model, Tropidurus spinulosus, and if the preferred body temperature and thermoregulatory behaviour vary among reproductive stages and in relation to the female phenotype. We characterized the female phenotypes according to multiple morphological traits (snout-vent length, inter-axillar length, abdominal perimeter, body condition and head width). Reproductive structures were diagnosed by portable ultrasound scanning. To determine body temperatures, the lizards were placed in an open-top terrarium, where a thermal gradient ranging from 18 to 50 °C was set up; we also recorded the permanence of individuals in cold, temperate and warm zones during each experiment. Reproductive females preferred higher temperatures and presented lower amplitude in thermal variability than non-reproductive females. Moreover, within reproductive females, females with wide abdominal perimeter and high body condition showed thermal stability. Females with oviductal eggs tended to select higher temperature and also show more thermal stability than females with vitellogenic follicles. The latter females used the temperate zone most frequently and to a lesser degree the warm one, whereas females with oviductal eggs used the temperate and warm zones with similarly high frequency. We conclude that reproductive stage and phenotypic traits influence the selection of preferred body temperatures and thermoregulatory behaviour in T. spinulosus females. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Vertebral number covaries with body form and elevation along the western slopes of the Ecuadorian Andes in the Neotropical fish genus Rhoadsia (Teleostei: Characidae)
VL  - 126

SP  - 706-720
AB  - Vertebral number is adaptively important in fishes and is associated with body shape at broad taxonomic ranks. Less is known about this association within species. Rhoadsia is a deep-bodied characid genus endemic to western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. It includes two species differing in body depth (BD), described from different drainages and elevations. Recently, BD has been found to vary with elevation in parallel between ∼30 and 1260 m across drainages in western Ecuador. Here, we report that vertebral number also covaries with elevation and with body shape. The latter association was present both across and within sites, suggesting that these traits are phenotypically integrated. The ratio of precaudal to caudal vertebrae also differed significantly among drainages, and variation in vertebral number appeared to be associated primarily with the caudal vertebrae, raising questions about its potential adaptive significance given the functional importance of caudal vertebrae in fishes. Vertebral number was associated with body size at some sites, consistent with geographically localized pleomerism. Disentangling the causative mechanisms at play will probably be complex and represents an important future research direction. This is one of the first known cases of an association between vertebral number and elevation in fishes. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

VL  - 25

SP  - 1471-1482
AB  - Lack of tree fecundity data across climatic gradients precludes the analysis of how seed supply contributes to global variation in forest regeneration and biotic interactions responsible for biodiversity. A global synthesis of raw seedproduction data shows a 250-fold increase in seed abundance from cold-dry to warm-wet climates, driven primarily by a 100-fold increase in seed production for a given tree size. The modest (threefold) increase in forest productivity across the same climate gradient cannot explain the magnitudes of these trends. The increase in seeds per tree can arise from adaptive evolution driven by intense species interactions or from the direct effects of a warm, moist climate on tree fecundity. Either way, the massive differences in seed supply ramify through food webs potentially explaining a disproportionate role for species interactions in the wet tropics. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Repeatability of Voluntary Thermal Maximum and Covariance with Water Loss Reveal Potential for Adaptation to Changing Climates
VL  - 95
IS  - 2
SP  - 113-121
AB  - Although climate warming poses a grave threat to amphibians, little is known about the capacity of this group to evolve in response to warming. The capacity of key traits to evolve depends on the presence of genetic variation on which selection can act. Here, we use repeatability estimates to estimate the potential upper bounds of heritable genetic variation in voluntary and critical thermal maxima of gray-cheeked salamanders (Plethodon metcalfi). Increases in thermal tolerance may also require concordant increases in resistance to water loss because hotter temperatures incur greater evap-orative risk. Therefore, we also tested for a correlation between voluntary thermal maxima and resistance to water loss and conducted an acclimation study to test for covariation between these traits in response to warming. Voluntary thermal maxima exhibited low to moderate levels of repeatability (R p 0:32, P p 0:045), while critical thermal maxima exhibited no statistically significant repeatability (R p 0:10, P p 0:57). Voluntary thermal maxima also correlated positively with resistance to water loss (R p 0:31, P p 0:025) but only when controlling for body mass. Voluntary thermal maxima and resistance to water loss also exhibited different acclimatory responses across control (127C–187C) andwarm(187C– 247C) temperature regimes, indicating a potential decoupling of traits in different thermal environments. By addressing the repeatability of thermal tolerance and the potential for covariation with resistance to water loss, we begin to address some of the key requirements of amphibians to evolve in warming climates. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

TI  - Separating thermal and viscous effects of temperature on copepod respiration and energy budget
VL  - 239
IS  - 1
SP  - 62-71
AB  - Changes in temperature alter the viscosity of fluids, which impacts the force needed to move and the diffusion rates of gases. This is particularly salient for organisms that operate at mid to low Reynolds numbers. In this study, we investigated the independent effects of changes in temperature and viscosity on oxygen consumption rates of two coastal copepods (Acartia tonsa and Parvocalanus crassirostris) and used bioenergetic models to predict how these patterns could influence copepods in the natural environment. We found that only temperature influenced copepod oxygen consumption rates, indicating that copepods were not impacted by reduced oxygen diffusivity or increased energetics of movement resulting from higher seawater viscosity. We developed energy budgets based on novel respiration experiments in conjunction with data from the literature and found that cold temperatures do not result in higher scope for growth, because decreased metabolic costs are offset by reduced feeding capability. Our energy budgets imply that observed copepod temperature ranges in natural waters match theoretical ranges of optimal net carbon assimilation. At cold temperatures, feeding on motile prey yielded higher net carbon assimilation compared to feeding on non-motile prey, implying that motile prey are more favorable and may be actively selected for at cold temperatures. Finally, our models predicted that A. tonsa had a higher maximum net carbon assimilation as a percentage of body mass, indicating that copepods that use a similar sink-and-wait feeding strategy may be better able to exploit ephemeral food sources compared to continuous-swimming copepods such as P. crassirostris. © 2020 The University of Chicago.

TI  - Dietary l-arginine accelerates pupation and promotes high protein levels but induces oxidative stress and reduces fecundity and life span in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 188
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-55
AB  - l-Arginine, a precursor of many amino acids and of nitric oxide, plays multiple important roles in nutrient metabolism and regulation of physiological functions. In this study, the effects of l-arginine-enriched diets on selected physiological responses and metabolic processes were assessed in Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary l-arginine at concentrations 5–20 mM accelerated larval development and increased body mass, and total protein concentrations in third instar larvae, but did not affect these parameters when diets contained 100 mM arginine. Young (2 days old) adult flies of both sexes reared on food supplemented with 20 and 100 mM l-arginine possessed higher total protein concentrations and lower glucose and triacylglycerol concentrations than controls. Additionally, flies fed 20 mM l-arginine had higher proline and uric acid concentrations. l-Arginine concentration in the diet also affected oxidative stress intensity in adult flies. Food with 20 mM l-arginine promoted lower protein thiol concentrations and higher catalase activity in flies of both sexes and higher concentrations of low molecular mass thiols in males. When flies were fed on a diet with 100 mM l-arginine, lower catalase activities and concentrations of protein thiols were found in both sexes as well as lower low molecular mass thiols in females. l-Arginine-fed males demonstrated higher climbing activity, whereas females showed higher cold tolerance and lower fecundity, compared with controls. Food containing 20 mM l-arginine shortened life span in both males and females. The results suggest that dietary l-arginine shows certain beneficial effects at the larval stage and in young adults. However, the long-term consumption of l-arginine-enriched food had unfavorable effects on D. melanogaster due to decreasing fecundity and life span. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

TI  - Survival and in-vessel redistribution of beryllium droplets after ITER disruptions
VL  - 58
IS  - 7
AB  - The motion and temperature evolution of beryllium droplets produced by first wall surface melting after ITER major disruptions and vertical displacement events mitigated during the current quench are simulated by the MIGRAINe dust dynamics code. These simulations employ an updated physical model which addresses droplet-plasma interaction in ITER-relevant regimes characterized by magnetized electron collection and thin-sheath ion collection, as well as electron emission processes induced by electron and high-Z ion impacts. The disruption scenarios have been implemented from DINA simulations of the time-evolving plasma parameters, while the droplet injection points are set to the first-wall locations expected to receive the highest thermal quench heat flux according to field line tracing studies. The droplet size, speed and ejection angle are varied within the range of currently available experimental and theoretical constraints, and the final quantities of interest are obtained by weighting single-trajectory output with different size and speed distributions. Detailed estimates of droplet solidification into dust grains and their subsequent deposition in the vessel are obtained. For representative distributions of the droplet injection parameters, the results indicate that at most a few percents of the beryllium mass initially injected is converted into solid dust, while the remaining mass either vaporizes or forms liquid splashes on the wall. Simulated in-vessel spatial distributions are also provided for the surviving dust, with the aim of providing guidance for planned dust diagnostic, retrieval and clean-up systems on ITER. © 2018 EURATOM.

VL  - 15

SP  - 1455-1459
AB  - Context: Time of day has been shown to impact athletic performance, with improved performance observed in the late afternoon–early evening. Diurnal variations in physiological factors may contribute to variations in pacing selection; however, research investigating time-of-day influence on pacing is limited. Purpose: To investigate the influence of time-of-day on pacing selection in a 4-km cycling time trial (TT). Methods: Nineteen trained male cyclists (mean [SD] age 39.0 [10.7] y, height 1.8 [0.1] m, body mass 78.0 [9.4] kg, VO2max 62.1 [8.7] mL·kg−1·min−1) completed a 4-km TT on 5 separate occasions at 08:30, 11:30, 14:30, 17:30, and 20:30. All TTs were completed in a randomized order, separated by a minimum of 2 d and maximum of 7 d. Results: No time-of-day effects were observed in pacing as demonstrated by similar power outputs over 0.5-km intervals (P = .78) or overall mean power output (333.0 [38.9], 339.8 [37.2], 335.5 [31.2], 336.7 [35.2], and 334.9 [35.7] W; P = .45) when TTs were performed at 08:30, 11:30, 14:30, 17:30, and 20:30. Preexercise tympanic temperature demonstrated a time-of-day effect (P &lt; .001), with tympanic temperature higher at 14:30 and 17:30 than at 08:30 and 11:30. Conclusion: While a biological rhythm was present in tympanic temperature, pacing selection and performance when completing a 4-km cycling TT were not influenced by time of day. The findings suggest that well-trained cyclists can maintain a robust pacing strategy for a 4-km TT regardless of time of the day. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.

TI  - Novel signals of adaptive genetic variation in northwestern Atlantic cod revealed by whole-genome sequencing
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
SP  - 1971-1987
AB  - Selection can create complex patterns of adaptive differentiation among populations in the wild that may be relevant to management. Atlantic cod in the Northwest Atlantic are at a fraction of their historical abundance and a lack of recovery within the Gulf of Maine has created concern regarding the misalignment of fisheries management structures with biological population structure. To address this and investigate genome-wide patterns of variation, we used low-coverage sequencing to perform a region-wide, whole-genome analysis of fine-scale population structure. We sequenced 306 individuals from 20 sampling locations in U.S. and Canadian waters, including the major spawning aggregations in the Gulf of Maine in addition to spawning aggregations from Georges Bank, southern New England, the eastern Scotian Shelf, and St. Pierre Bank. With genotype likelihoods estimated at almost 11 million loci, we found large differences in haplotype frequencies of previously described chromosomal inversions between Canadian and U.S. sampling locations and also among U.S. sampling locations. Our whole-genome resolution also revealed novel outlier peaks, some of which showed significant genetic differentiation among sampling locations. Comparisons between allochronic winter- and spring-spawning populations revealed highly elevated relative (FST) and absolute (dxy) genetic differentiation near genes involved in reproduction, particularly genes associated with the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, which likely control timing of spawning, contributing to prezygotic isolation. We also found genetic differentiation associated with heat shock proteins and other genes of functional relevance, with complex patterns that may point to multifaceted selection pressures and local adaptation among spawning populations. We provide a high-resolution picture of U.S. Atlantic cod population structure, revealing greater complexity than is currently recognized in management. Our genome-scan approach likely underestimates the full suite of adaptive differentiation among sampling locations. Nevertheless, it should inform the revision of stock boundaries to preserve adaptive genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of cod populations. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Morphological description of gametes in cave and surface populations of Astyanax mexicanus (De Filippi, 1853)
VL  - 30
IS  - 5
SP  - 719-729
AB  - The Mexican tetra Astyanax mexicanus presents two contrasting morphs, a widely distributed surface morph and a cave-adapted morph. These cave-adapted morphs have evolved independently from two different lineages (i.e. 'old' and 'new' lineages); therefore, this model system gives a unique opportunity to explore parallel adaptive evolution in biological traits. The present study corresponds to the first morphological description of the Astyanax mexicanus maturation process of the spermatozoa and oocytes, using thermal and hormonal stimuli to promote spermatogenesis and oogenesis, considering surface and cave morphs from both lineages. We corroborate the relevance of thermal and hormonal stimuli to promote gamete maturation. The hormone Ovaprim (GnRHa + Domperidone) is an effective promoter of ovarian development, maturation end in oocytes and spawning in Astyanax mexicanus. The sperm morphology of Astyanax mexicanus includes the sperm head, the midpiece, and tail or flagellum. We found differences in the spermatozoan total length between environments (F = 9.929, P = 0.05) and linages (F = 49.86, P = 0.005). The oocytes showed a spherical conformation with a mean diameter of 822.4 +/- 194.1 mu m for the surface populations, and 604.6 +/- 38.3 mu m for the cave populations. The oocyte chorion presents ridges and grooves that are arranged radially towards the micropyle. A plug in the micropyle zone was observed after fertilization, confirmed by the outer membrane of the chorion, which provides some weak adhesiveness to the substrate. We observed differences in chorion thickness between the contrasting environmental conditions. This is the first morphological characterization of the Sotanos Vazquez, Escondido and Tigre, which previous to this study were only known from speleological expeditions, with no previous biological information available.

TI  - Induced heat shock protein 70 confers biological tolerance in UV-B stress–adapted Myzus persicae (Hemiptera)
VL  - 220
SP  - 1146-1154
AB  - As an environmental stress factor, ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation directly affects insect growth, development, and reproduction. Heat shock protein 70s kDa (Hsp70s) plays an important role in the environmental adaptation of insects. To determine the role of MpHsp70s in the UV-B tolerance of Myzus persicae (Sulzer), we identified the complete complementary DNA sequences of seven MpHsp70s. They were found to be ubiquitously expressed during different developmental stages and were highly expressed in second-instar nymphs and wingless adults. The expression levels of the MpHsp70s were significantly upregulated when exposed to different durations of UV-B stress. Nanocarrier-mediated dsMpHsp70 suppressed the expression of the MpHsp70s and reduced the body length, weight, survival rate, and fecundity of M. persicae under UV-B exposure. When the combinational RNAi approach was adopted, the effects on the survival rate and fecundity were greater under UV-B stress, except for MpHsc70-4. These results suggest that MpHsp70s are essential for the resistance of M. persicae to UV-B stress. © 2022

TI  - Methods to study organogenesis in decapod crustacean larvae. I. larval rearing, preparation, and fixation
VL  - 75
IS  - 1
AB  - Crustacean larvae have served as distinguished models in the field of Ecological Developmental Biology (“EcoDevo”) for many decades, a discipline that examines how developmental mechanisms and their resulting phenotype depend on the environmental context. A contemporary line of research in EcoDevo aims at gaining insights into the immediate tolerance of organisms and their evolutionary potential to adapt to the changing abiotic and biotic environmental conditions created by anthropogenic climate change. Thus, an EcoDevo perspective may be critical to understand and predict the future of organisms in a changing world. Many decapod crustaceans display a complex life cycle that includes pelagic larvae and, in many subgroups, benthic juvenile–adult stages so that a niche shift occurs during the transition from the larval to the juvenile phase. Already at hatching, the larvae possess a wealth of organ systems, many of which also characterise the adult animals, necessary for autonomously surviving and developing in the plankton and suited to respond adaptively to fluctuations of environmental drivers. They also display a rich behavioural repertoire that allows for responses to environmental key factors such as light, hydrostatic pressure, tidal currents, and temperature. Cells, tissues, and organs are at the basis of larval survival, and as the larvae develop, their organs continue to grow in size and complexity. To study organ development, researchers need a suite of state-of-the-art methods adapted to the usually very small size of the larvae. This review and the companion paper set out to provide an overview of methods to study organogenesis in decapod larvae. This first section focuses on larval rearing, preparation, and fixation, whereas the second describes methods to study cells, tissues, and organs. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Different predation capacities and mechanisms of Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on two morphotypes of pear psylla Cacopsylla chinensis (Hemiptera: Psyllidae)
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
AB  - Pear psylla, Cacopsylla chinensis (Yang & Li) are present as two seasonal morphotypes in pear orchards where they, suck phloem sap, defoliate pear trees, and cause fruit russet. Despite the importance of natural enemies in psyllid control, the interactions between predators and the two seasonal morphotypes of psyllids remain poorly documented. Here we determined the predation efficiencies of the Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) on the two psyllid morphotypes. Predation of H. axyridis on both morphotypes conformed to a Type II functional response: the proportion of consumed psyllids decreased with increasing prey densities. Predation efficiency of H. axyridis against the winterforms increased with temperature when measured from 8 to 25C. Predation rate on the summerforms was significantly higher than that of the winterforms. This was linked to smaller body size, higher soluble protein level, thinner cuticle, and lower chitin content of summerform psyllids compared to winterform psyllids. Predation capacities of H. axyridis on both morphotypes indicated its potential as a biocontrol agent in psyllids management. Predation efficiency was higher on summerforms, likely due to the difference in body size, exoskeleton fragility, and nutritional value between the two morphotypes. Due to the Type II functional response of H. axyridis to both morphotypes of pear psylla, application of H. axyridis in pear orchards under suitable temperatures could be taken into consideration for suppression of C. chinensis, although further experiments conducted in field conditions are needed to validate our findings. © 2019 Ge et al.

TI  - Phylogenomics of an extra-Antarctic notothenioid radiation reveals a previously unrecognized lineage and diffuse species boundaries
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The impressive adaptive radiation of notothenioid fishes in Antarctic waters is generally thought to have been facilitated by an evolutionary key innovation, antifreeze glycoproteins, permitting the rapid evolution of more than 120 species subsequent to the Antarctic glaciation. By way of contrast, the second-most species-rich notothenioid genus, Patagonotothen, which is nested within the Antarctic clade of Notothenioidei, is almost exclusively found in the non-Antarctic waters of Patagonia. While the drivers of the diversification of Patagonotothen are currently unknown, they are unlikely to be related to antifreeze glycoproteins, given that water temperatures in Patagonia are well above freezing point. Here we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) in a total of twelve Patagonotothen species. Results: We present a well-supported, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis including closely and distantly related outgroups, confirming the monophyly of the genus Patagonotothen with an origin approximately 3 million years ago and the paraphyly of both the sister genus Lepidonotothen and the family Notothenidae. Our phylogenomic and population genetic analyses highlight a previously unrecognized linage and provide evidence for shared genetic variation between some closely related species. We also provide a mitochondrial phylogeny showing mitonuclear discordance. Conclusions: Based on a combination of phylogenomic and population genomic approaches, we provide evidence for the existence of a new, potentially cryptic, Patagonotothen species, and demonstrate that genetic boundaries between some closely related species are diffuse, likely due to recent introgression and/or incomplete linage sorting. The detected mitonuclear discordance highlights the limitations of relying on a single locus for species barcoding. In addition, our time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis shows that the early burst of diversification roughly coincides with the onset of the intensification of Quaternary glacial cycles and that the rate of species accumulation may have been stepwise rather than constant. Our phylogenetic framework not only advances our understanding of the origin of a high-latitude marine radiation, but also provides the basis for the study of the ecology and life history of the genus Patagonotothen, as well as for their conservation and commercial management. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Temporal evolution of threshold temperatures for extremely cold days in Spain
VL  - 844
AB  - In contrast to research on heat waves, there are no studies in recent years that analyze the temporal evolution of threshold temperatures (Tthreshold) for extremely cold days (ECD). It is unknown whether threshold temperatures have increased more quickly than the minimum daily temperature (Tmin) in recent years. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of the minimum daily temperature (Tmin) in a group of Spanish provinces and compare it with the evolution of threshold temperatures. An ecological, retrospective time series study was carried out using daily observations between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 2018 (36 years) in 10 provinces that are representative of the different climate territories in Spain. For each representative observatory in each province, the values of Tmin were obtained for the winter months (November–March). The value of Tthreshold was determined for each province and each year, using dispersion diagrams for the pre-whitened series, with daily mortality due to natural causes displayed on the Y axis (CIEX: A00-R99) and Tmin grouped by 10 degree intervals on the X axis. To determine the temporal evolution of Tmin and Tthreshold for each province, linear models were fitted, with time as the independent variable. During the winter months, Tmin increased at an average rate of 0.2 °C/decade (IC95: 0.1–0.3), while Tthreshold remained practically constant during the period, at 0.1 °C/decade (IC95% -0.1 0.3). These values are much lower than those obtained in the case of heat, both in terms of the evolution of maximum daily temperature and that of Tthreshold. In conclusion, the fact that this trend has been maintained across time in a scenario of climate change, with a slow increase in minimum daily temperatures and constant values of Threshold, suggests a decrease in the number of ECD. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Implications of Anomalous Crustal Provinces for Venus' Resurfacing History
VL  - 125
IS  - 10
AB  - Current Venus tectonics suggests a stagnant lid mode of mantle convection. However, the planet is debated to enter an episodic regime after long quiescent periods, driven by resurfacing due to rapid subduction and global crustal recycling. Tessera regions that cover approximately 10% of Venus' surface appear to be strongly deformed, which suggests that they have survived at least the latest resurfacing event, although the composition and age of the tesserae are unknown. Based on mantle convection modeling, we studied the effects of anomalous crustal provinces (ACPs) on mantle dynamics and postoverturn lithospheric survival. As a hypothesis, we assume ACPs to be thick, compositionally anomalous, and rheologically strong units, similar to terrestrial cratons. We model Venus with a varying number of preimposed ACP units and differing lithospheric yield stress in 2-D and 3-D spherical geometry. The impact of ACPs on mantle dynamics and the survival of lithosphere is investigated by examining the thermal evolution, crustal thickness, and surface age distribution. We find that the number and timing of overturns are highly dependent on the yield stress and, to some degree, on the number and size of the preimposed ACPs. ACPs in particular affect the wavelength of convection and may foster the survival of lithosphere even of those portions not being part of an ACP. However, ACPs do not seem to be a good analog for tessera regions due to their exaggerated age and (likely) thickness, but—with appropriate density contrast—may be more useful representatives of Venus' highland plateaus. © 2020.

TI  - Gene flow relates to evolutionary divergence among populations at the range margin
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: Morphological differentiation between populations resulting from local adaptations to environmental conditions is likely to be more pronounced in populations with increasing genetic isolation. In a previous study a positive clinal variation in body size was observed in isolated Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeselii, populations, but were absent from populations within a continuous distribution at the same latitudinal range. This observational study inferred that there was a phenotypic effect of gene flow on climate-induced selection in this species. Methods: To disentangle genetic versus environmental drivers of population differences in morphology, we measured the size of four different body traits in wild-caught individuals from the two most distinct latitudinally-matched pairs of populations occurring at about 60_N latitude in northern Europe, characterised by either restricted or continuous gene flow, and corresponding individuals raised under laboratory conditions. Results: Individuals that originated from the genetically isolated populations were always bigger (femur, pronotum and genital appendages) when compared to individuals from latitudinally-matched areas characterised by continuous gene flow between populations. The magnitude of this effect was similar for wild-caught and laboratory-reared individuals. We found that previously observed size cline variation in both male and female crickets was likely to be the result of local genetic adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity. Conclusions: This strongly suggests that restricted gene flow is of major importance for frequencies of alleles that participate in climate-induced selection acting to favour larger phenotypes in isolated populations towards colder latitudes.

TI  - The inhibition of cell-free supernatants of several lactic acid bacteria on the selected psychrophilic spoilage bacteria in liquid whole egg
VL  - 123
AB  - The short shelf-life of pasteurized liquid whole egg (LWE) has been a technical problem of the industry for a long time, and there was an urgent need to develop relevant methodologies for the control of spoilage bacteria. In this study, the spoilage potential of the selected strains at low temperature and the inhibition of cell-free supernatant (CFS) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the representative strains with strong spoilage ability was both investigated. The results showed that some high abundance strains such as Pseudomonas and Microbacterium had the strong spoilage ability which might dominate the spoilage of liquid egg products. Meanwhile, the CFS of the selected LAB had a good inhibitory effect on them, and the result was: CFS of Lactobacillus plantarum 90 > CFS of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 05 > CFS of Pediococcus pentosaceus L28-8. Also, the CFS of L. plantarum 90 had a good bacteriostatic effect on the selected representative spoilage bacteria in LWE in a dose-dependent manner. Combined with the experimental results, it is speculated that this was the result of synergistic action of many bacteriostatic substances such as organic acids and bacteriocins. Overall, this study provides a possibility for the application of CFS of LAB in pasteurized liquid egg products to extend the shelf-life. © 2020

TI  - Composition and thermal evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Ribeira Belt, SE Brazil: evidence from spinel peridotite xenoliths
VL  - 111
IS  - 3
SP  - 1057-1077
AB  - This study reports the first geochemical and Pb isotopic data for mantle xenoliths from beneath the Neoproterozoic Ribeira Belt, southeastern Brazil. The cm-sized spinel peridotite xenoliths are hosted by a Cretaceous lamprophyre dike that intruded high-grade metamorphic rocks. Major- and trace-element compositions of the main minerals indicate that the xenoliths derive from a shallow fertile mantle that has undergone a low degree of melt extraction (2–9% partial melting). On the basis of modeled isochemical phase diagrams for lherzolites, pressure and temperature conditions are inferred to vary from 1300–1350 °C and 17–19 kbar (fertile composition) to 1330–1430 °C and 17–23 kbar (relatively depleted composition), which correspond to high geothermal gradients of 65–80 mW/m2. Temperatures of last equilibration calculated based on the average REE content of pyroxenes for the same lherzolite samples vary from 1233 ± 56 °C to 1085 ± 42 °C, while conventional thermometry (TBKN) yields average values of 807 and 755 °C, indicating re-equilibration at lower temperatures. Pb isotope ratios of clinopyroxene define a mixing line that intercepts the Stacey-Kramers two-stage terrestrial Pb evolution curve at ca. 200 Ma. Linear regressions yield two errorchrons of 56 ± 75 Ma and 571 ± 99 Ma (95% confidence level). These results combined with the ages and tectonic settings of host rocks are suggestive of an overprint of a younger tectono-thermal event, most likely related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, over a mantle previously equilibrated during the Precambrian development of the Ribeira Belt. © 2022, Geologische Vereinigung e.V.

VL  - 31

SP  - 1420-1426
AB  - Environmental variability is on the rise in different parts of the earth, and the survival of many species depends on how well they cope with these fluctuations. Our current understanding of how organisms adapt to unpredictably fluctuating environments is almost entirely based on studies that investigate fluctuations among different values of a single environmental stressor such as temperature or pH. How would unpredictability affect adaptation when the environment fluctuates between qualitatively very different kinds of stresses? To answer this question, we subjected laboratory populations of Escherichia coli to selection over ~ 260 generations. The populations faced predictable and unpredictable environmental fluctuations across qualitatively different selection environments, namely, salt and acidic pH. We show that predictability of environmental fluctuations does not play a role in determining the extent of adaptation, although the extent of ancestral adaptation to the chosen selection environments is of key importance. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 235
SP  - 39-46
AB  - Pyrethroid-resistant Hyalella azteca with voltage-gated sodium channel mutations have been identified at multiple locations throughout California. In December 2013, H. azteca were collected from Mosher Slough in Stockton, CA, USA, a site with reported pyrethroid (primarily bifenthrin and cyfluthrin) sediment concentrations approximately twice the 10-d LC50 for laboratory-cultured H. azteca. These H. azteca were shipped to Southern Illinois University Carbondale and have been maintained in pyrethroid-free culture since collection. Even after 22 months in culture, resistant animals had approximately 53 times higher tolerance to permethrin than non-resistant laboratory-cultured H. azteca. Resistant animals held in culture also lacked the wild-type allele at the L925 locus, and had non-synonymous substitutions that resulted in either a leucine-isoleucine or leucine-valine substitution. Additionally, animals collected from the same site nearly three years later were again resistant to the pyrethroid permethrin. When resistant animals were compared to non-resistant animals, they showed lower reproductive capacity, lower upper thermal tolerance, and the data suggested greater sensitivity to, 4, 4′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), copper (II) sulfate, and sodium chloride. Further testing of the greater heat and sodium chloride sensitivity of the resistant animals showed these effects to be unrelated to clade association. Fitness costs associated with resistance to pyrethroids are well documented in pest species (including mosquitoes, peach-potato aphids, and codling moths) and we believe that H. azteca collected from Mosher Slough also have fitness costs associated with the developed resistance. Field-collected Hyalella azteca maintain pyrethroid resistance in long-term culture and tend to be more sensitive to stressors than non-resistant animals regardless of clade association. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 97

AB  - The recently emerging two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been a fertile ground for exploring abundant exotic physical properties. Critical points, the extrema or saddle points of electronic bands, are the cornerstone of condensed-matter physics and fundamentally determine the optical and transport phenomena of the TMDCs. However, for bilayer MoS2, a typical TMDC and the unprecedented electrically tunable venue for valleytronics, there has been a considerable controversy on its intrinsic electronic structure, especially for the conduction band-edge locations. Moreover, interlayer hopping and layer polarization in bilayer MoS2 which play vital roles in valley-spintronic applications have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of intrinsic critical points locations, interlayer hopping, layer-spin polarization, and their evolution with temperature in bilayer MoS2 by performing temperature-dependent photoluminescence. Our measurements confirm that the conduction-band minimum locates at the Kc instead of Qc, and the energy splitting between Qc and Kc redshifts with a descent of temperature. Furthermore, the interlayer hopping energy for holes and temperature-dependent layer polarization are quantitatively determined. Our observations are in good harmony with density-functional theory calculations. © 2018 American Physical Society.

TI  - The potential for the evolution of thermally sensitive courtship behaviours in the treehopper, Enchenopa binotata
AB  - The ability of animals to adapt to warming will depend on the evolutionary potential of thermally sensitive traits. The number of studies measuring the quantitative genetics of a wide variety of thermally sensitive traits has steadily increased; however, no study has yet investigated the quantitative genetics of thermal sensitivity for courtship traits. Since courtship often precedes mating, the ability of these traits to respond to warming may impact reproduction and therefore population persistence. Here, we use classic quantitative genetics breeding design to estimate heritability of various aspects of the thermal sensitivity of courtship behaviours in the treehopper Enchenopa binotata. We generated individual-level thermal courtship activity curves for males and females and measured levels of genetic variation in the thermal sensitivity of courtship activity. We found low heritability with 95% credible intervals that did not approach zero for most traits. Levels of genetic variation were highest in traits describing thermal tolerance. We also found some evidence for genetic correlations between traits within but not across sexes. Together, our results suggest that the range of temperatures over which these treehoppers actively court can evolve, although it remains unclear whether adaptation can happen quickly enough to match the speed of warming. © 2022 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Non-linear regional weather-growth relationships indicate limited adaptability of the eastern Baltic Scots pine
VL  - 479
AB  - Under changing climate, temporal and spatial stability (stationarity) of growth responses of trees to weather and climate, which has often been presumed without explicit testing, is crucial for prediction of productivity and sustainability of forests. However, considering evolutionary adaptation of tree populations to wide spatiotemporal ecological gradients, extrapolation of linear responses, which could be observed in limited parts of the gradients (certain locality), can result in biased results. Accordingly, the plasticity of responses of tree-ring width of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to meteorological conditions across the regional climatic gradient was assessed using a mixed generalized additive model. The linear responses were assessed using a bootstrapped correlation analysis for comparison. The radial growth responses of the eastern Baltic population of Scots pine showed explicit regional gradients according to the local climates, indicating gradual shifts in the effects of winter temperature and summer moisture regime. Accordingly, temperature in late-winter and summer, as well as summer water deficit were identified as the main regional drivers of tree-ring width. Their effects were generally non-linear, indicating explicit spatiotemporal gradients in growth responses in the mid-part of species distribution. This also implied limited efficiency of simple linear models for the assessment of radial growth under moderate conditions. The responses to summer temperature indicated local optima, while the responses to drought index showed threshold values. The responses to winter temperature indicated positive effect of warming on growth. In some stands, specific non-stationary responses though were evident, suggesting that trees have adapted (specialized) to certain local climatic conditions, which are changing and thus explaining temporal shifts in growth responses. Nevertheless, the estimated responses suggested phenotypical adaptability limits of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine in a longer term, supporting the necessity of climate-smart management for sustainability of forest in the region in the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Trait syndromes among North American trees are evolutionarily conserved and show adaptive value over broad geographic scales
VL  - 41
IS  - 3
SP  - 540-550
AB  - Adaptive syndromes and their evolutionary constraints represent a powerful construct for understanding plant distributions. However, it is unclear how the species requirements to face multiple stressors promotes syndrome formation and to which abiotic stressors these syndromes show adaptive value over broad geographic scales. We combined local occurrence data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) of 219 angiosperm and 85 gymnosperm species living across the conterminous US with phylogenies and trait data to identify tree syndromes, their evolutionary conservatism, and their adaptive value over broad scales. Factor analyses and evolutionary model selection revealed that trees possess functional trait syndromes that are strongly conserved. Major syndromes at the species level differed between angiosperms and gymnosperms. While the two main syndromes in angiosperms were related to cold and drought-waterlogging tolerance, in gymnosperms a trade-off between shade and drought tolerance was the main syndrome followed by a growth-fire resistance syndrome. Additional RLQ and fourth-corner approaches revealed that trait syndromes at the community level were broadly similar to those observed at the species level for angiosperms, although this was less clear for gymnosperms. This suggests that syndrome evolution has played an important role on angiosperm distributions, whereas additional ecological factors explain gymnosperm distributions. Importantly, syndromes show adaptive value, as they were geographically associated with several environmental variables showing structure from continental to local scales, being temperature the main abiotic stressor. Our results indicate that across the conterminous US tree species possess clear syndromes that are subjected to strong evolutionary constraints driving tree species and forest community distribution. © 2017 The Authors

VL  - 377
IS  - 1848
AB  - Species' range limits are ubiquitous. This suggests that the evolution of the ecological niche is constrained in general and at the edges of distributions in particular. While there may be many ecological and genetic reasons for this phenomenon, here we focus on the potential role of trade-offs. We performed a literature search on evidence for trade-offs associated with geographical or elevational range limits. The majority of trade-offs were reported as relevant at either the cold end of species' distribution (n = 19), the warm or dry end (n = 19) or both together (n = 14). One common type of trade-off involved accelerating growth or development (27%), often at the cost of small size. Another common type involved resistance to or tolerance of climatic extremes that occur at certain periods of the year (64%), often at the cost of small size or reduced growth. Trade-offs overlapped with some of the classic trade-offs reported in life-history evolution or thermal adaptation. The results highlight several general insights about species' niches and ranges, and we outline how future research should better integrate the ecological context and test for the presence of microevolutionary trade-offs. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.

TI  - The degree of spatial variation relative to temporal variation influences evolution of dispersal
VL  - 129
IS  - 11
SP  - 1611-1622
AB  - In the face of ongoing global climate and land use change, organisms have multiple possibilities to cope with the modification of their environment. The two main possibilities are to either adapt locally or disperse to a more suitable habitat. The evolution of both local adaptation and dispersal interacts and can be influenced by the spatial and temporal variation (of e.g. temperature or precipitation). In an individual based model (IBM), we explore evolution of phenotypes in landscapes with varying degree of spatial relative to global temporal variation in order to examine its influence on the evolution of dispersal, niche optimum and niche width. The relationship between temporal and spatial variation did neither influence the evolution of local adaptation in the niche optimum nor of niche widths. Dispersal probability is highly influenced by the spatio-temporal relationship: with increasing spatial variation, dispersal probability decreases. Additionally, the shape of the distribution of the trait values over patch attributes switches from hump- to U-shaped. At low spatial variance more individuals emigrate from average habitats, at high spatial variance more from extreme habitats. The comparatively high dispersal probability in extreme patches of landscapes with a high spatial variation can be explained by evolutionary succession of two kinds of adaptive response. Early in the simulations, extreme patches in landscapes with a high spatial variability act as sink habitats, where population persistence depends on highly dispersive individuals with a wide niche. With ongoing evolution, local adaptation of the remaining individuals takes over, but simultaneously a possible bet-hedging strategy promotes higher dispersal probabilities in those habitats. Here, in generations that experience extreme shifts from the temporal mean of the patch attribute, the expected fitness becomes higher for dispersing individuals than for philopatric individuals. This means that under certain circumstances, both local adaptation and high dispersal probability can be selected for for coping with the projected environmental changes in the future. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

TI  - Roles of orf60a and orf61 in development of bacteriophages λ and Φ24b
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - The exo-xis region of lambdoid bacteriophage genomes contains several established and potential genes that are evolutionarily conserved, but not essential for phage propagation under laboratory conditions. Nevertheless, deletion or overexpression of either the whole exo-xis region and important regulatory elements can significantly influence the regulation of phage development. This report defines specific roles for orf60a and orf61 in bacteriophage λ and Φ24B, a specific Shiga toxin-converting phage with clinical relevance. We observed that mutant phages bearing deletions of orf60a and orf61 impaired two central aspects of phage development: the lysis-versus-lysogenization decision and prophage induction. These effects were more pronounced for phage Φ24B than for λ. Surprisingly, adsorption of phage Φ24B on Escherichia coli host cells was less efficient in the absence of either orf60a or orf61. We conclude that these open reading frames (ORFs) play important, but not essential, roles in the regulation of lambdoid phage development. Although phages can propagate without these ORFs in nutrient media, we suggest that they may be involved in the regulatory network, ensuring optimization of phage development under various environmental conditions. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Cetacean skin continues to be the investigative focus of researchers from several different scientific disciplines. Yet, most research on the basic functions of lipo-keratinocytes, which constitute most of the cetacean epidermis, providing the first layer of protection against various environmental aggressors (including an ever-increasing level of pollutants), is restricted to specialized literature on the permeability barrier only. In this review, we have attempted to bring together much of the recent research on the functional biology of cetacean skin, including special adaptations at the cellular, genetic and molecular level. We have correlated these data with the cetacean permeability barrier’s unique structural and metabolic adaptations to fully aquatic life, including the development of secondary barriers to ward off challenges such as biofouling as well as exposure to extreme cold for the epidermis, which is outside of the insulation provided by blubber. An apparent contradiction exists between some of the reported gene loss for lipogenic enzymes in cetacean skin and the high degree of cetacean epidermal lipogenesis, as well as loss of desmocollin 1 and desmoplakin genes [while immunolocalization of these proteins is reported (Journal of Anatomy, 234, 201)] warrants a re-evaluation of the gene loss data. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - We investigate the effect of electrically induced thermal load on interconnect reliability and aging. We propose new models for uniform and non-uniform temperature evolution and its steady state distribution in interconnects considering Joule heating and heat convection. The models are verified by comparing the results against those of finite element experiments. We apply our models to study material migration induced aging and failures. We discuss how different non-uniform temperature profiles affect interconnect lifetime. We propose new formulas for accurate temperature aware assessment of the mortality of interconnects. We demonstrate that neglecting thermal effects in modern technologies may lead to incorrect conclusions about interconnect mortality. We also provide a method for modeling the true mean time to failure based on underlying physics. © 2019 ACM.

VL  - 126
IS  - 8
SP  - 781-790
AB  - Mating songs and preferences for these songs have to match for communication to function. Since this match restricts variation, understanding how phenotypic variation is introduced in communication systems is essential for understanding their evolution. The environment, through phenotypic plasticity or parental effects, is an important catalyst for phenotypic variation. In Kentucky, the cricket Gryllus rubens has one reproductive generation in the spring and one in the fall and the mating songs differ substantially between generations. I tested whether these differences in songs are the result of intergenerational (i.e., parental effects) or intragenerational phenotypic plasticity. To test for the role of parental effects on songs, I reared offspring of field-collected spring and fall females in a common garden environment and recorded their songs. None of the analyzed song characters differed between the sons of fall and spring parents, suggesting that parental effects do not play a role in song development. To test for the effect of phenotypic plasticity on songs, I reared juvenile and adult males in two separate sets of experiments at two different levels of temperature and daylength. Rearing temperature affected every analyzed song character: The higher adult rearing temperature (32°C) induced significantly faster pulse rates, shorter pulse durations, and higher dominant frequency compared with the lower rearing temperature (24°C). The higher juvenile temperature induced significantly shorter pulse durations, longer interval durations, and lower pulse duty cycles than the lower rearing temperature. Rearing photoperiod did not affect male song development. The changes induced by the temperature treatments paralleled those observed in the wild, suggesting that the seasonally different songs in Kentucky are primarily the result of seasonal temperatures. Possible evolutionary consequences of the temperature-related phenotypic plasticity are discussed. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

VL  - 40

AB  - The lizard Psammophilus (Reptilia: Diapsida: Agamidae) is commonly called as rock lizard. It has only been reported that female P. blanfordanus is a seasonal breeder otherwise research on its reproduction is limited. Therefore, to investigate the relationship between environmental and reproductive behaviour, studies on gonadosomatic index (GSI), histology and histometry of ovary and oviduct were undertaken. The GSI, relative weight of ovaries (ROW) and oviducts (ROiW) are highest during the breeding season. The ROW and ROiW are positively correlated with temperature, rainfall and relative humidity (RH). The histology and histometry of ovary and oviducts show that the breeding season in this animal is from April to June/July and sometimes extends to early August. During this period the diameter of oocyte, oviduct and oviduct glandular layer is increased. The thickness of oviduct glandular is also increased but thickness of oviduct muscle layer is decreased. The reproductive cycle of this animal is associate type. The study will be helpful in understanding its evolutionary adaptability to different seasons. © 2019 Taru Publications. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolutionary responses to global change in species-rich communities
VL  - 1476
IS  - 1
SP  - 43-58
AB  - Evolution in nature occurs in the provemmrbial tangled bank. The species interactions characterizing this tangled bank can be strongly affected by global change and can also influence the fitness and selective effects of a global change on a focal population. As a result, species interactions can influence which traits will promote adaptation and the magnitude or direction of evolutionary responses to the global change. First, we provide a framework describing how species interactions may influence evolutionary responses to global change. Then, we highlight case studies that have explicitly manipulated both a global change and the presence or abundance of interacting species and used either experimental evolution or quantitative genetics approaches to test for the effects of species interactions on evolutionary responses to global change. Although still not frequently considered, we argue that species interactions commonly modulate the effects of global change on the evolution of plant and animal populations. As a result, predicting the evolutionary effects of the multitude of global changes facing natural populations requires both community ecology and evolutionary perspectives. © 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius L.) exhibit limited ability to develop heat resistance
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
AB  - The global population growth of the bed bug, Cimex lectularius (L.), is attributed to their cryptic behavior, diverse insecticide resistance mechanisms, and lack of public awareness. Bed bug control can be challenging and typically requires chemical and non-chemical treatments. One common non-chemical method for bed bug management is thermal remediation. However, in certain instances, bed bugs are known to survive heat treatments. Bed bugs may be present after a heat treatment due to (i) abiotic factors associated with the inability to achieve lethal temperatures in harborage areas for a sufficient time period, (ii) re-infestation from insects that escaped to cooler areas during a heat treatment or (iii) development of physiological resistance that allows them to survive heat exposure. Previous research has investigated the optimal temperature and exposure time required for either achieving complete mortality or sublethally affecting their growth and development. However, no research has examined bed bug populations for their ability to develop resistance to heat exposure and variation in thermo-tolerance between different bed bug strains. The goals of this study were: i) to determine if bed bugs could be selected for heat resistance under a laboratory selection regime, and ii) to determine if bed bug populations with various heat exposure histories, insecticide resistance profiles, and geographic origins have differential temperature tolerances using two heat exposure techniques (step-function and ramp-function). Selection experiments found an initial increase in bed bug survivorship; however, survivorship did not increase past the fourth generation. Sublethal exposure to heat significantly reduced bed bug feeding and, in some cases, inhibited development. The step-function exposure technique revealed non-significant variation in heat tolerance between populations and the ramp-function exposure technique provided similar results. Based on these study outcomes, the ability of bed bugs to develop heat resistance appears to be limited. © 2019 Ashbrook et al.

TI  - Multi-model seascape genomics identifies distinct environmental drivers of selection among sympatric marine species
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: As global change and anthropogenic pressures continue to increase, conservation and management increasingly needs to consider species' potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Therefore, it is imperative to characterise the main selective forces acting on ecosystems, and how these may influence the evolutionary potential of populations and species. Using a multi-model seascape genomics approach, we compare putative environmental drivers of selection in three sympatric southern African marine invertebrates with contrasting ecology and life histories: Cape urchin (Parechinus angulosus), Common shore crab (Cyclograpsus punctatus), and Granular limpet (Scutellastra granularis). Results: Using pooled (Pool-seq), restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq), and seven outlier detection methods, we characterise genomic variation between populations along a strong biogeographical gradient. Of the three species, only S. granularis showed significant isolation-by-distance, and isolation-by-environment driven by sea surface temperatures (SST). In contrast, sea surface salinity (SSS) and range in air temperature correlated more strongly with genomic variation in C. punctatus and P. angulosus. Differences were also found in genomic structuring between the three species, with outlier loci contributing to two clusters in the East and West Coasts for S. granularis and P. angulosus, but not for C. punctatus. Conclusion: The findings illustrate distinct evolutionary potential across species, suggesting that species-specific habitat requirements and responses to environmental stresses may be better predictors of evolutionary patterns than the strong environmental gradients within the region. We also found large discrepancies between outlier detection methodologies, and thus offer a novel multi-model approach to identifying the principal environmental selection forces acting on species. Overall, this work highlights how adding a comparative approach to seascape genomics (both with multiple models and species) can elucidate the intricate evolutionary responses of ecosystems to global change. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Radial drift and concurrent ablation of boulder-sized objects
VL  - 629
AB  - Context. The composition of a protoplanetary disk at a given location does not only depend on temperature and pressure but also on the time dependent transport of matter, such as radial drift of solid bodies, which could release water and other volatile species before disintegration or accretion onto a larger body with potentially considerable implications for the composition of planets. Aims. We performed a parameter study focused on the water depletion of different sized bodies able to cross the water snowline by gas-induced radial drift. Methods. Either the analytical Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir sublimation formula assuming equilibrium temperature within the body or a more involved, numerical model for the internal thermal evolution was coupled with an α-disk model. Different properties of the disk and the embedded body were explored. Results. Bodies with radii up to 100 m drift faster toward the central star than the water snowline, and can therefore cross it. The region that can be reached before complete disintegration - and is therefore polluted with H2O ice - extends to 10% closer to the star than the snowline location. The extent of this polluted region could be multiple times larger in the presence of a dust mantle, which is, however, unlikely to form due to frequent collisions with objects smaller than a centimeter. Conclusions. Given a significant abundance of meter-sized boulders in protoplanetary disks, the transport of water by radial drift of these bodies toward regions closer to the star than the snowline is not negligible and this flux of volatiles can be estimated for a given distribution of solid body sizes and compositions. A simple expression for surface sublimation is applicable for a homogeneous body consisting of only dust and water ice without a dust mantle. © ESO 2019.

AB  - Water temperature is increasingly seen as a key environmental variable in aquatic environments, including rivers. River temperature extremes have important repercussions on water quality and on the distribution, growth, and survival of aquatic organisms. Extremes are most often defined in terms of threshold exceedances or maximum temperatures over a predefined duration, such as 1 week. This chapter provides a summary of the evolution of temperature extremes by revisiting the literature related to the river heat fluxes that may be affected by climate change, the trends observed in historical data, and the thermal models used in conjunction with climate change scenarios to investigate possible future thermal regimes in rivers. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Adaptive genetic variation underlies biocomplexity of Atlantic Cod in the Gulf of Maine and on Georges Bank
VL  - 14
IS  - 5
AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) are at a fraction of their historical abundance, creating economic hardships for fishermen and putting at risk the genetic diversity of the remaining populations. An understanding of the biocomplexity among GoM populations will allow for adaptive genetic diversity to be conserved to maximize the evolutionary potential and resilience of the fishery in a rapidly changing environment. We used restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to characterize the population structure and adaptive genetic diversity of five spawning aggregations from the western GoM and Georges Bank. We also analyzed cod caught in the eastern GoM, an under-sampled area where spawning aggregations have been extirpated. Using 3,128 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we confirmed the existence of three genetically separable spawning groups: (1) winter spawning cod from the western GoM, (2) spring spawning cod, also from the western GoM, and (3) Georges Bank cod. Non-spawning cod from the eastern GoM could not be decisively linked to either of the three spawning groups and may represent a unique component of the resource, a mixed sample, or cod from other unsampled source populations. The genetic differentiation among the three major spawning groups was primarily driven by loci putatively under selection, particularly loci in regions known to contain genomic inversions on linkage groups (LG) 7 and 12. These LGs have been found to be linked to thermal regime in cod across the Atlantic, and so it is possible that variation in timing of spawning in western GoM cod has resulted in temperature-driven adaptive divergence. This complex population structure and adaptive genetic differentiation could be crucial to ensuring the long-term productivity and resilience of the cod fishery, and so it should be considered in future management plans. © 2019 Clucas et al.

AB  - Predicting the response of marine animals to climate change is hampered by a lack of multigenerational studies on evolutionary adaptation, particularly to combined ocean warming and acidification (OWA). We provide evidence for rapid adaptation to OWA in the foundational copepod species, Acartia tonsa, by assessing changes in population fitness on the basis of a comprehensive suite of life-history traits, using an orthogonal experimental design of nominal temperature (18 °C, 22 °C) and pCO2 (400, 2,000 µatm) for 25 generations (~1 year). Egg production and hatching success initially decreased under OWA, resulting in a 56% reduction in fitness. However, both traits recovered by the third generation, and average fitness was reduced thereafter by only 9%. Antagonistic interactions between warming and acidification in later generations decreased survival, thereby limiting full fitness recovery. Our results suggest that such interactions constrain evolutionary rescue and add complexity to predictions of the responses of animal populations to climate change. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

TI  - An insect antifreeze protein from Anatolica polita enhances the cryoprotection of Xenopus laevis eggs and embryos
VL  - 225
IS  - 4
AB  - Cryoprotection is of interest in many fields of research, necessitating a greater understanding of different cryoprotective agents. Antifreeze proteins have been identified that have the ability to confer cryoprotection in certain organisms. Antifreeze proteins are an evolutionary adaptation that contributes to the freeze resistance of certain fish, insects, bacteria, and plants. These proteins adsorb to an ice crystal's surface and restrict its growth within a certain temperature range. We investigated the ability of an antifreeze protein from the desert beetle Anatolica polita, ApAFP752, to confer cryoprotection in the frog Xenopus laevis. X. laevis eggs and embryos microinjected with ApAFP752 exhibited reduced damage and increased survival after a freeze/thaw cycle in a concentration-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that ApAFP752 localizes to the plasma membrane in eggs and embryonic blastomeres and is not toxic for early development. These studies show the potential of an insect antifreeze protein to confer cryoprotection in amphibian eggs and embryos. © 2022. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Low dose HSP90 inhibition with AUY922 blunts rapid evolution of metastatic and drug resistant phenotypes induced by TGF-β and paclitaxel in A549 cells
VL  - 129
AB  - Objectives: Despite advances in cancer treatment, drug resistance and metastasis continue to contribute to treatment failure. Since drug resistance and metastasis in cancer are features that often occur toward the late stages in the disease after withstanding numerous selective pressures, they may rely on a shared adaptive mechanism in order to persist. The heat shock response is one of the most well conserved adaptive responses to cellular stress found in nature. A major player in the heat shock response is HSP90, with some studies suggesting that it can facilitate the molecular evolution of drug resistance and metastasis in cancer. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are strongly associated with drug resistance and metastasis either at the time of diagnosis or early in the treatment process. Materials and Methods: We explored the role of HSP90 in the evolution of metastatic and drug resistant features in NSCLC by treating A549 cells with AUY922, a clinically relevant HSP90 inhibitor, and inducing metastatic and drug resistant phenotypes via treatment with TGF-β and paclitaxel, respectively. We measured phenotypic plasticity in E-Cadherin, a marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition and two ABC transporters associated with drug resistant lung cancers. Results: We found that metastatic and efflux dependent drug resistant features negatively correlated with AUY922 treatment. We followed our results with functional assays relevant to metastasis and ABC transporters to confirm our results. Specifically we found the expression of E-cadherin was significantly increased in A549 cultures pretreated with AUY922 prior to exposure to paclitaxel, while expression of the drug transporters ABCB1 and ABCC1 was significantly reduced under similar conditions. Conclusion: Together our data indicates that HSP90 inhibition with AUY922 can limit the acquisition of metastatic and drug resistant phenotypes in A549 cells at low, clinically appropriate doses. © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Crack mitigation in Laser Powder Bed Fusion processed Hastelloy X using a combined numerical-experimental approach
VL  - 864
AB  - Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique associated with large thermal gradients and thermal strains resulting from the inherent nature of the process. Due to the non-equilibrium solidification conditions, certain alloys suffer from thermally induced micro-cracking, which hinders their exploitation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach towards the processing of a defect-free nickel-based superalloy, Hastelloy X, by means of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). A combined experimental and numerical approach was used in order to evaluate the influence of the laser beam intensity distribution and melt track overlap on the temperature evolution, solidification behavior and crack formation. The use of a laser beam with narrow diameter and Gaussian beam intensity distribution leads to keyhole mode melting and a steep cooling rate, whereas a large diameter beam with top-hat intensity distribution leads to the formation of wide and shallow conduction mode melt pools, with a lower cooling rate and consequently a coarser sub-grain microstructure. The decrease of hatch spacing did not show a significant change in the local thermal history within a melt pool when a Gaussian beam was used. On the other hand, with the laser with the top-hat beam profile was used, an overall increase in the temperature of the layer and significantly lower cooling rates were observed. As a result, by decreasing the hatch spacing to 125 mu m, micro-crack free Hastelloy X material was produced by LPBF for the first time, using a commercially available powder, simply by optimizing the scanning strategy and without modification of the chemical composition of the alloy. The material in the as-build condition exhibited a higher yield tensile strength (500 +/- 17 MPa) than conventionally produced Hastelloy X (340 MPa), with elongation of 31.5 +/- 3.0%.

TI  - Temperature preference of juvenile lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) originating from the southern and northern parts of Norway
VL  - 89
AB  - Fish are ectothermic animals and have body temperatures close to that of the water they inhabit. They can still control their body temperatures by selecting habitats with temperatures that maximize their growth, feed conversion and wellbeing. Lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus, is widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean and therefore exposed to variable water temperatures. Lumpfish is extensively used as cleanerfish in salmon farming in Norway and exposed to a wide temperature range along the north-south axis of the Norwegian coastline. But, if these temperature ranges correspond to the preference temperatures of lumpfish is not known. If lumpfish has adapted to regional temperatures along the Norwegian coast, differences in preference temperature for fish from different regions should be evident. In a selective breeding perspective, different selection lines for preference temperature would then be useful for further development of lumpfish as a cleanerfish. We subjected lumpfish juveniles weighing 154–426g originated from northern (Group North – GN) and southern (Group South – GS) Norway to a temperature preference test, using an electronic shuttle box system. The system allowed the fish to control the water temperature by moving between two chambers, and thereby choosing its preferred temperature in the range from 5 to 16 °C. We started the temperature at 7.8 ± 1.37 °C for GN and 7.58 ± 1.34 °C for GS, but all the fish except four (two each from GN and GS) chose lower temperatures (5.03–7.6 °C) in the first 18 h and stayed closer to that temperature during the next 30 h. Based on the results, GN and GS lumpfish preferred 6.92 ± 1.8 and 6.2 ± 1.2, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the groups. Neither was there any significant difference in growth rates (SGR) between the two groups. Based on our results, we suggest that lumpfish from any geographical origin along the Norwegian coast can be used anywhere in Norway. It follows that lumpfish from a single selection line could be used at any salmon farm in Norway independent of its location. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of body size and lung type on desiccation resistance, hypoxia tolerance and thermal preference in two terrestrial isopods species
VL  - 132
AB  - Terrestrial isopods have evolved adaptations to reduce water loss, which is necessary for life in low humidity environments. However, the evolution of a waterproofed cuticle to prevent loss of water to the environment could also impede oxygen uptake from the environment. We therefore postulate an evolutionary trade-off between water retention and gas exchange in this group of soil animals. The outcome of this trade-off is expected to be affected by both differences across species (different types of lung) and differences within species (body size and resulting surface area to volume ratios). To test these ideas, we compared two sympatric isopods: Porcellio scaber and Oniscus asellus. While P. scaber possesses covered lungs typical for drier habitats, O. asellus has simple open respiratory fields which are in direct contact with external air. For each species, we assessed how individuals across a broad range in body size differed in their hypoxia and desiccation tolerance. In addition, we assessed how hypoxia and low humidity affected their thermal preference. We found clear effects of species identity and body size on tolerance to hypoxia and low humidity. Desiccation resistance was tightly linked to water loss rates (R2 = 0.96) and strongly resembled the interspecific pattern across 20 isopod species. However, our results did not support the postulated trade-off. Tolerance to hypoxia and low humidity covaried, both increasing with body size and being higher in P. scaber. Thermal preference was affected by both hypoxia and low humidity, but not by body size. Our study increases understanding of the ecophysiology of both species, which can be useful in explaining the geographical distribution and use of microhabitats of isopod species in a climate change context. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 9
SP  - 7-15
AB  - Biological interactions and environmental constraints alter life-history traits, modifying organismal performances. Trematode parasites often impact their hosts by inducing parasitic castration, frequently correlated with increased body size in the host (i.e., gigantism hypothesis), which is postulated to reflect the re-allocation of energy released by the reduction in the reproductive process. In this study, we compared the effect of a trematode species on shell size and morphology in adult individuals of the intertidal mussels Perumytilus purpuratus (>20 mm) collected from two local populations of contrasting environmental regimes experienced in central-southern Chile. Our field data indicates that in both study locations, parasitized mussels evidenced higher body sizes (shell length, total weight and volume) as compared with non-parasitized. In addition, parasitized mussels from the southern location evidenced thinner shells than non-parasitized ones and those collected from central Chile, suggesting geographical variation in shell carbonate precipitation across intertidal habitats of the Chilean coast. In laboratory conditions, mussels collected from a local population in central Chile were exposed to two temperature treatments (12 and 18 °C). Parasitized mussels showed higher growth rates than non-parasitized, regardless of the seawater temperature treatments. However, the metabolic rate was not influenced by the parasite condition or the temperature treatments. Our field and laboratory results support the parasite-induced gigantism hypothesis, and suggest that both the thermal environment and geographic location explain only a portion of the increased body size, while the parasitic condition is the most plausible factor modulating the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. © 2019

AB  - Water availability is a major environmental challenge to a variety of terrestrial organisms. In insects, desiccation tolerance varies predictably over spatial and temporal scales and is an important physiological determinant of fitness in natural populations. Here, we examine the dynamics of desiccation tolerance in North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster using: (a) natural populations sampled across latitudes and seasons; (b) experimental evolution in field mesocosms over seasonal time; (c) genome-wide associations to identify SNPs/genes associated with variation for desiccation tolerance; and (d) subsequent analysis of patterns of clinal/seasonal enrichment in existing pooled sequencing data of populations sampled in both North America and Australia. A cline in desiccation tolerance was observed, for which tolerance exhibited a positive association with latitude; tolerance also varied predictably with culture temperature, demonstrating a significant degree of thermal plasticity. Desiccation tolerance evolved rapidly in field mesocosms, although only males showed differences in desiccation tolerance between spring and autumn collections from natural populations. Water loss rates did not vary significantly among latitudinal or seasonal populations; however, changes in metabolic rates during prolonged exposure to dry conditions are consistent with increased tolerance in higher latitude populations. Genome-wide associations in a panel of inbred lines identified twenty-five SNPs in twenty-one loci associated with sex-averaged desiccation tolerance, but there is no robust signal of spatially varying selection on genes associated with desiccation tolerance. Together, our results suggest that desiccation tolerance is a complex and important fitness component that evolves rapidly and predictably in natural populations. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 155
SP  - 79-81
AB  - The fossorial life-history emerged as a response to hostile environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures and dryness. It evolved independently in different lineages of amphibians, which are particularly vulnerable to dehydration and require a continuous level of humidity because of their permeable skin. For the first time, we test the hypothesis that amphibians are able to adapt their fossorial behaviour to substrate humidity, using the Pacific horned frogs (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) from the Ecuadorian dry forest as a model. When exposed to dry substrate, the animals burrowed much deeper than the ones in wet soil. The capacity to excavate was particularly high in this species: frogs from the dry treatment could be found at more than 1-m depth after just a few hours. Our results reveal a conditional strategy that contributes to explain the persistence of amphibians in dry environments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Phenotypic but no genetic adaptation in zooplankton 24 years after an abrupt +10°C climate change
VL  - 6

SP  - 284-294
AB  - The climate is currently warming fast, threatening biodiversity all over the globe. Populations often adapt rapidly to environmental change, but for climate warming very little evidence is available. Here, we investigate the pattern of adaptation to an extreme +10°C climate change in the wild, following the introduction of brine shrimp Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay, USA, to Vinh Chau saltern in Vietnam. We use a resurrection ecology approach, hatching diapause eggs from the ancestral population and the introduced population after 13 and 24 years (∼54 and ∼100 generations, respectively). In a series of coordinated experiments, we determined whether the introduced Artemia show increased tolerance to higher temperatures, and the extent to which genetic adaptation, developmental plasticity, transgenerational effects, and local microbiome differences contributed to this tolerance. We find that introduced brine shrimp do show increased phenotypic tolerance to warming. Yet strikingly, these changes do not have a detectable additive genetic component, are not caused by mitochondrial genetic variation, and do not seem to be caused by epigenetic marks set by adult parents exposed to warming. Further, we do not find any developmental plasticity that would help cope with warming, nor any protective effect of heat-tolerant local microbiota. The evolved thermal tolerance might therefore be entirely due to transgenerational (great)grandparental effects, possibly epigenetic marks set by parents who were exposed to high temperatures as juveniles. This study is a striking example of “missing heritability,” where a large adaptive phenotypic change is not accompanied by additive genetic effects. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Correlation between occupational high temperature exposure and dyslipidemia in steel workers
VL  - 38

SP  - 593-599
AB  - [Background] The occupational high temperature environment makes steel workers more susceptible to chronic diseases, and the influence of high temperature on diseases is attracting more and more attention. [Objective] This study evaluates the relationship between cumulative high temperature exposure and dyslipidemia, providing a scientific basis for the prevention and control of dyslipidemia in steel workers. [Methods] A cross-sectional study was adopted to select 6 107 front-line employees of a steel group in Tangshan with occupational health examination reports from April to June 2017. Among them, 5 977 workers participated in the physical examination and questionnaire survey, and the response rate was 97.87%. After excluding those aged >60 years and with incomplete questionnaire data and biochemical data, 5 807 steel workers were finally included in the study, and the effective recovery rate was 95.09%. Data were collected through questionnaire survey, physical examination, laboratory examination, and surveillance plan of occupational exposure in workplace. High temperature exposure data were derived from the workplace high temperature test reports following the Measurement of physical agents in workplace Part 7: High temperature (GBZ/T 189.7—2007). The cumulative exposure measurement (CEM) of high temperature was calculated based on wet-bulb global temperature and the working time schedule related to high temperature exposure. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) and mutiple logistic regression model were used to explore the relationship between cumulative high temperature exposure and dyslipidemia. [Results] Among the 5 807 steel workers, the prevalence of dyslipidemia was 38.11%. After adjusting for selected confounders, the results of the RCS model showed a linear dose-response relationship between cumulative high temperature exposure and dyslipidemia (χ2=11.88, P=0.002 6 for overall association test; χ2=1.70, P=0.192 9 for nonlinear test). After adjusting for age, sex, income per capita, education, family history of hypertension, smoking, alcohol drinking, dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score, sleeping time, physical activity level, hypertension, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), hyperuricemia, shift work, and exposures to noise, dust, and CO, the results of multiple logistic regression model showed that compared with the steel workers with CEM exposure < 477.97℃ ·year, the risks of dyslipidemia of the steel workers with CEM exposure >653.04 and >782.82℃ ·year were 1.362 (OR=1.362, 95%CI: 1.086-1.709) and 1.333 (OR=1.333, 95%CI: 1.048-1.694) times higher. [Conclusion] There is a linear dose-response relationship between cumulative high temperature exposure and dyslipidemia of steel workers. As the cumulative exposure to high temperature increases, the risk of dyslipidemia in steel workers increases. © 2021, Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

AB  - Climate change is already adversely affecting human health and health systems, 1,2 and projected climate change is expected to alter the geographic range and burden of a variety of climate-sensitive health outcomes and to affect the functioning of public health and health care systems. If no additional actions are taken, then over the coming decades, substantial increases in morbidity and mortality are expected in association with a range of health outcomes, including heat-related illnesses, illnesses caused by poor air quality, undernutrition from reduced food quality and security, and selected vectorborne diseases in some locations; at the same time, worker productivity is expected to decrease, particularly at low latitudes. 3,4 Vulnerable populations and regions will be differentially affected, with expected increases in poverty and inequities as a consequence of climate change. Investments in and policies to promote proactive and effective adaptation and reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions (mitigation) would decrease the magnitude and pattern of health risks, particularly in the medium-to-long term.

VL  - 20

AB  - The unique environment of space is characterized by several stress factors, including intense radiation, microgravity, high vacuum and extreme temperatures, among others. These stress conditions individually or in-combination influence genetics and gene regulation and bring potential evolutionary changes in organisms that would not occur under the Earth's gravity regime (1 × g). Thus, space can be explored to support the emergence of new varieties of microbes and plants, that when selected for, can exhibit increased growth and yield, improved resistance to pathogens, enhanced tolerance to drought, low nutrient and disease, produce new metabolites and others. These properties may be more difficult to achieve using other approaches under 1 × g. This review provides an overview of the space microgravity and ionizing radiation conditions that significantly influence organisms. Changes in the genomics, physiology, phenotype, growth and metabolites of organisms in real and simulated microgravity and radiation conditions are illustrated. Results of space biological experiments show that the space environment has significant scientific, technological and commercial potential. Combined these potentials can help address the future of life on Earth, part of goal e of astrobiology. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.

VL  - 41

AB  - Insects have been influential models in research on color variation, its evolutionary drivers and the mechanistic basis of such variation. More recently, several studies have indicated that insect color is responding to rapid climate change. However, it remains challenging to ascertain drivers of color variation among populations and species, and across space and time, as multiple biotic and abiotic factors can interact and mediate color change. Here, we describe some of the challenges and recent advances made in this field. First, we outline the main alternative hypotheses that exist for insect color variation in relation to climatic factors. Second, we review the existing evidence for contemporary adaptive evolution of insect color in response to climate change and then discuss factors that can promote or hinder the evolution of color in response to climate change. Finally, we propose future directions and highlight gaps in this research field. Pigments and structures producing insect color can vary concurrently or independently, and may evolve at different rates, with poorly understood effects on gene frequencies and fitness. Disentangling multiple competing hypotheses explaining insect coloration should be key to assign color variation as an evolutionary response to climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 453-468
AB  - Premise of the Study: Polyploids possess unique attributes that influence their environmental tolerance and geographic distribution. It is often unknown, however, whether cytotypes within mixed-ploidy populations are also uniquely adapted and differ in their responses to environmental change. Here, we examine whether diploids and hexaploids from a single mixed-ploidy population of Solidago altissima differ in plasticity and potential response to natural selection under conditions simulating climate change. Methods: Clonal replicates of diploid and hexaploid genotypes were grown in a randomized split-plot design under two temperature (+1.9°C) and two watering treatments (–13% soil moisture) implemented with open-top passive chambers placed under rainout shelters. Physiological, phenological, morphological traits, and a fitness correlate, reproductive biomass, were measured and compared among treatments. Key Results: Differences in traits suggest that diploids are currently better adapted to low- water availability than hexaploids. Both ploidy levels had adaptive plastic responses to treatments and are predicted to respond to selection, but often for different traits. Water availability generally had a stronger effect than temperature, but for some traits the effect of water depended on temperature. Conclusions: Diploid and hexaploid S. altissima may maintain fitness in the short term through adaptive plasticity and evolution depending on which traits are important in a warmer, drier environment. Hexaploids may be at a disadvantage compared to diploids because fewer traits were heritable. Our results underscore the importance of studying combinations of climate variables that are predicted to change simultaneously. © 2019 Botanical Society of America

TI  - Thicker Shells Compensate Extensive Dissolution in Brachiopods under Future Ocean Acidification
VL  - 53
IS  - 9
SP  - 5016-5026
AB  - Organisms with long generation times require phenotypic plasticity to survive in changing environments until genetic adaptation can be achieved. Marine calcifiers are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification due to dissolution and a reduction in shell-building carbonate ions. Long-term experiments assess organisms' abilities to acclimatize or even adapt to environmental change. Here we present an unexpected compensatory response to extensive shell dissolution in a highly calcium-carbonate-dependent organism after long-term culture in predicted end-century acidification and warming conditions. Substantial shell dissolution with decreasing pH posed a threat to both a polar (Liothyrella uva) and a temperate (Calloria inconspicua) brachiopod after 7 months and 3 months exposure, respectively, with more extensive dissolution in the polar species. This impact was reflected in decreased outer primary layer thickness in the polar brachiopod. A compensatory response of increasing inner secondary layer thickness, and thereby producing a thicker shell, was exhibited by the polar species. Less extensive dissolution in the temperate brachiopod did not affect shell thickness. Increased temperature did not impact shell dissolution or thickness. Brachiopod ability to produce a thicker shell when extensive shell dissolution occurs suggests this marine calcifier has great plasticity in calcification providing insights into how similar species might cope under future environmental change. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 304
AB  - Contemporary climate change is exposing plant populations to novel combinations of temperatures, drought stress, [CO2] and other abiotic and biotic conditions. These changes are rapidly disrupting the evolutionary dynamics of plants. Despite the multifactorial nature of climate change, most studies typically manipulate only one climatic factor. In this opinion piece, we explore how climate change factors interact with each other and with biotic pressures to alter evolutionary processes. We evaluate the ramifications of climate change across life history stages,and examine how mating system variation influences population persistence under rapid environmental change. Furthermore, we discuss how spatial and temporal mismatches between plants and their mutualists and antagonists could affect adaptive responses to climate change. For example, plant-virus interactions vary from highly pathogenic to mildly facilitative, and are partly mediated by temperature, moisture availability and [CO2]. Will host plants exposed to novel, stressful abiotic conditions be more susceptible to viral pathogens? Finally, we propose novel experimental approaches that could illuminate how plants will cope with unprecedented global change, such as resurrection studies combined with experimental evolution, genomics or epigenetics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Protective symbionts can allow hosts to occupy otherwise uninhabitable niches. Despite the importance of symbionts in host evolution, we know little about how these associations arise. Encountering a microbe that can improve host fitness in a stressful environment may favor persistent interactions with that microbe, potentially facilitating a long-term association. The bacterium Bacillus subtilis protects Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes from heat shock by increasing host fecundity compared to the nonprotective Escherichia coli. In this study, we ask how the protection provided by the bacterium affects the host's evolutionary trajectory. Because of the stark fitness contrast between hosts heat shocked on B. subtilis versus E. coli, we tested whether the protection conferred by the bacteria could increase the rate of host adaptation to a stressful environment. We passaged nematodes on B. subtilis or E. coli, under heat stress or standard conditions for 20 host generations of selection. When assayed under heat stress, we found that hosts exhibited the greatest fitness increase when evolved with B. subtilis under stress compared to when evolved with E. coli or under standard (nonstressful) conditions. Furthermore, despite not directly selecting for increased B. subtilis fitness, we found that hosts evolved to harbor more B. subtilis as they adapted to heat stress. Our findings demonstrate that the context under which hosts evolve is important for the evolution of beneficial associations and that protective microbes can facilitate host adaptation to stress. In turn, such host adaptation can benefit the microbe. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Evidence for continent-wide convergent evolution and stasis throughout 150 y of a biological invasion
VL  - 119
IS  - 18
AB  - The extent to which evolution can rescue a species from extinction, or facilitate range expansion, depends critically on the rate, duration, and geographical extent of the evolutionary response to natural selection. Adaptive evolution can occur quickly, but the duration and geographical extent of contemporary evolution in natural systems remain poorly studied. This is particularly true for species with large geographical ranges and for timescales that lie between "long-term" field experiments and the fossil record. Here, we introduce the Virtual Common Garden (VCG) to investigate phenotypic evolution in natural history collections while controlling for phenotypic plasticity in response to local growing conditions. Reconstructing 150 y of evolution in Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) as it invaded North America, we analyze phenology measurements of 3,429 herbarium records, reconstruct growing conditions from more than 12 million local temperature records, and validate predictions across three common gardens spanning 10° of latitude. We find that phenological clines have evolved repeatedly throughout the range, during the first century of evolution. Thereafter, the rate of microevolution stalls, recapitulating macroevolutionary stasis observed in the fossil record. Our study demonstrates that preserved specimens are a critical resource for investigating limits to evolution in natural populations. Our results show how natural selection and trade-offs measured in field studies predict adaptive divergence observable in herbarium specimens over 15 decades at a continental scale. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Organisms experience variation in the thermal environment on several different temporal scales, with seasonality being particularly prominent in temperate regions. For organisms with short generation times, seasonal variation is experienced across, rather than within, generations. How this affects the seasonal evolution of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity is understudied, but has direct implications for the thermal ecology of these organisms. Here we document intra-annual patterns of thermal tolerance in two species of Acartia copepods (Crustacea) from a highly seasonal estuary, showing strong variation across the annual temperature cycle. Common garden, split-brood experiments indicate that this seasonal variation in thermal tolerance, along with seasonal variation in body size and phenotypic plasticity, is likely affected by genetic polymorphism. Our results show that adaptation to seasonal variation is important to consider when predicting how populations may respond to ongoing climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 208
IS  - 1
SP  - 339-348
AB  - Gene interactions, or epistasis, play a large role in determining evolutionary outcomes. The ruggedness of fitness landscapes, and thus the predictability of evolution and the accessibility of high-fitness genotypes, is determined largely by the pervasiveness of epistasis and the degree of correlation between similar genotypes. We created all possible pairings of three sets of five beneficial first-step mutations fixed during adaptive walks under three different regimes: selection on growth rate alone, on growth rate and thermal stability, and on growth rate and pH stability. All 30 double-mutants displayed negative, antagonistic epistasis with regard to growth rate and fitness, but positive epistasis and additivity were common for the stability phenotypes. This suggested that biophysically simple phenotypes, such as capsid stability, may on average behave more additively than complex phenotypes like viral growth rate. Growth rate epistasis was also smaller in magnitude when the individual effects of single mutations were smaller. Significant sign epistasis, such that the effect of a mutation that is beneficial in the wildtype background is deleterious in combination with a second mutation, emerged more frequently in intragenic mutational pairings than in intergenic pairs, and was evident in nearly half of the double-mutants, indicating that the fitness landscape is moderately uncorrelated and of intermediate ruggedness. Together, our results indicated that mutations may interact additively with regard to phenotype when considered at a basic, biophysical level, but that epistasis arises as a result of pleiotropic interactions between the individual components of complex phenotypes and diminishing returns arising from intermediate phenotypic optima. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.

TI  - Effects of Fracture Formation Stage on Shale Gas Preservation Conditions and Enrichment in Complex Structural Areas in the Southern Sichuan Basin, China
VL  - 10
AB  - Fractures have significantly impacted the preservation, enrichment, and productivity of shale gas in the Longmaxi Formation in the complex structural area of the southern Sichuan Basin. Based on outcrop, core, imaging logging, inclusion analysis, acoustic emission experiments, and burial and thermal evolution history data, the formation stage, evolution and preservation conditions of structural fractures were comprehensively studied. Shear fractures are the main features of tectonic origin and are characterized by small widths, wide spacing, and high filling degrees. The structural fractures of the Longmaxi Formation can be divided into three groups in terms of their formation stage. The first-stage fractures were formed in the middle-late period of the Yanshanian tectonic movement (86.2–68.5 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 68.33–71.82 MPa; and the homogenization temperature of the fluid inclusions in the corresponding fracture fillings is 150–178°C. The second-stage fractures were formed at the end of the Yanshanian -early Himalayan tectonic movement (68.5–35.2 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 85.2–100.5 MPa; the homogenization temperature of the corresponding fluid inclusions is 123–148°C. The third-stage tectonic fractures formed during the middle-late period of the Himalayan tectonic movement (35.2–0 Ma), when the palaeotectonic stress was 55.6–63.8 MPa; fillings are scarce in these fractures, but the measured homogenization temperature of the corresponding fluid inclusions is 90–110°C. Shale gas preservation conditions were affected by the fracture formation stage, maximum horizontal crustal stress, fault scale, structural burial depth, formation pressure coefficient, etc. Three types of favourable preservation conditions were identified. The Type I target area is the low slope area in the middle of the syncline, which occurs more than 2.0 km from the fault. The research results have guiding significance for the evaluation of the preservation conditions of deep shale gas in the study area and similar areas. Copyright © 2022 Li, Li, Xu, Wu and Gao.

TI  - Genome size drives ecological breadth in Pomacentridae reef fishes
VL  - 540
AB  - Genome size (GS) is known to vary widely among fishes. However, evolutionary drivers that shape this variation are largely unknown in Pomacentridae. GS information is available for several Pomacentridae species, which have adapted over evolutionary time mainly in reef environments. In the present study, we used comparative phylogenetic methods to evaluate the role of ecological variables in driving GS variation in 49 species of this family. We also aimed to understand how GS evolved, evaluating five continuous character evolution models. We found that GS varied 1.98-fold, with C-values ranging from 0.68 pg (Pomacentrus auriventris) to 1.35 pg (Chrysiptera hemicyanea). Our phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, revealed that Pomacentridae diversification into two main clades occurred similar to 58 Mya, with the two clades showing distinct evolutionary trends. Character reconstruction of GS values revealed expansions and retractions in GS with convergences and parallelisms in different lineages. We also found a significant association between GS and body size and proxies of niche breadth (temperature and salinity), suggesting that species with larger genomes tend to occupy a wider niche breadth. Thus, GS variation may influence the life histories of Pomacentridae fishes, independently of their evolutionary relationships.

TI  - Extreme terrestrial environments: Life in thermal stress and hypoxia. A narrative review
VL  - 9
AB  - Living, working and exercising in extreme terrestrial environments are challenging tasks even for healthy humans of the modern new age. The issue is not just survival in remote environments but rather the achievement of optimal performance in everyday life, occupation, and sports. Various adaptive biological processes can take place to cope with the specific stressors of extreme terrestrial environments like cold, heat, and hypoxia (high altitude). This review provides an overview of the physiological and morphological aspects of adaptive responses in these environmental stressors at the level of organs, tissues, and cells. Furthermore, adjustments existing in native people living in such extreme conditions on the earth as well as acute adaptive responses in newcomers are discussed. These insights into general adaptability of humans are complemented by outcomes of specific acclimatization/acclimation studies adding important information how to cope appropriately with extreme environmental temperatures and hypoxia. © 2018 Burtscher, Gatterer, Burtscher and Mairbäurl.

TI  - Vibrio harveyi: A brief survey of general characteristics and recent epidemiological traits associated with climate change
VL  - 154
AB  - Here we briefly review the major characteristics of the emerging pathogen Vibrio harveyi and discuss survival strategies and adaptation mechanisms underlying the capacity of this marine bacterium to thrive in natural and artificial aquatic settings. Recent studies suggest that some adaptation mechanisms can easily be acquired by V. harveyi and other members of the Vibrionaceae family owing to efficient horizontal gene transfer and elevated mutation rate. While discussing the main factors in charge of the expansion of Vibrio spp. habitats and concomitant spread of Vibrio-associated diseases under climate change, this review highlights the need for future studies able to address the joint impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors on the long-term dynamics and virulence of V. harveyi populations at the global scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 118
SP  - 44-54
AB  - Climate change has complex impacts on insect life history traits, biogeography, survival, population dynamics and host-parasitoid seasonal phenologies that affect their synchrony. This is more pronounced in tropical southern Africa, where global warming may be relatively high. While some work on Plutella xylostella (L.) temperature tolerance has been reported, none focussed on African field insect populations and implications of trophic level interaction on biological control. To determine how climate change may affect coevolved trophic level interactions in a host-parasitoid trophic system, we compared the basal thermal tolerance of wild F1 populations of the parasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) to two life stages of herbivorous host P. xylostella (L.), a global economic pest of brassicas. Our results showed significantly lower C. vestalis critical thermal limits (P &lt;.001) compared to the host. Similarly, the parasitoid heat knockdown time and chill comma recovery time tolerance were significantly lower than that of the host (P &lt;.001). Lethal temperature assays revealed significantly lower survival rates (P &lt;.001) for C. vestalis at both upper and lower temperature scales. Observed differential basal temperature responses may offset coevolved host-parasitoid synchrony through differences in host-parasitoid phenologies. Hence, future biological control programmes should aim at ‘creating’ resilience and climate-fitness in natural enemies through enhancing evolutionary potential to buffer them from the changing climate. This is the first report detailing trophic level thermal tolerance of P. xylostella and larval parasitoid, C. vestalis, focussing on ecological service implications of the field-wild parasitoid populations on the herbivore host. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Evidence for genetic isolation and local adaptation in the field cricket Gryllus campestris
VL  - 34
IS  - 10
SP  - 1624-1636
AB  - Understanding how species can thrive in a range of environments is a central challenge for evolutionary ecology. There is strong evidence for local adaptation along large-scale ecological clines in insects. However, potential adaptation among neighbouring populations differing in their environment has been studied much less. We used RAD sequencing to quantify genetic divergence and clustering of ten populations of the field cricket Gryllus campestris in the Cantabrian Mountains of northern Spain, and an outgroup on the inland plain. Our populations were chosen to represent replicate high and low altitude habitats. We identified genetic clusters that include both high and low altitude populations indicating that the two habitat types do not hold ancestrally distinct lineages. Using common-garden rearing experiments to remove environmental effects, we found evidence for differences between high and low altitude populations in physiological and life-history traits. As predicted by the local adaptation hypothesis, crickets with parents from cooler (high altitude) populations recovered from periods of extreme cooling more rapidly than those with parents from warmer (low altitude) populations. Growth rates also differed between offspring from high and low altitude populations. However, contrary to our prediction that crickets from high altitudes would grow faster, the most striking difference was that at high temperatures, growth was fastest in individuals from low altitudes. Our findings reveal that populations a few tens of kilometres apart have independently evolved adaptations to their environment. This suggests that local adaptation in a range of traits may be commonplace even in mobile invertebrates at scales of a small fraction of species' distributions. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 9
IS  - 10
SP  - 1-16
AB  - Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in the environment and are known to cause blinding keratitis and brain infections with greater than 90% mortality rate. Currently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive and promising technique in Acanthamoeba detection. Remarkably, the rate of heating–cooling and convective heat transfer of the PCR tube is limited by low thermal conductivity of the reagents mixture. The addition of nanoparticles to the reaction has been an interesting approach that could augment the thermal conductivity of the mixture and subsequently enhance heat transfer through the PCR tube. Here, we have developed hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanoparticle-based PCR assay for the rapid detection of Acanthamoeba to amplify DNA from low amoeba cell density. As low as 1 × 10−4 wt % was determined as the optimum concentration of hBN nanoparticles, which increased Acanthamoeba DNA yield up to ~16%. Further, it was able to reduce PCR temperature that led to a ~2.0-fold increase in Acanthamoeba DNA yield at an improved PCR specificity at 46.2 °C low annealing temperature. hBN nanoparticles further reduced standard PCR step time by 10 min and cycles by eight; thus, enhancing Acanthamoeba detection rapidly. Enhancement of Acanthamoeba PCR DNA yield is possibly due to the high adsorption affinity of hBN nanoparticles to purine (Guanine—G) due to the higher thermal conductivity achieved in the PCR mixture due to the addition of hBN. Although further research is needed to demonstrate these findings in clinical application, we propose that the interfacial layers, Brownian motion, and percolation network contribute to the enhanced thermal conductivity effect. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Progeny of Xenopus laevis from altitudinal extremes display adaptive physiological performance
VL  - 224
IS  - 7
AB  - Environmental temperature variation generates adaptive phenotypic differentiation in widespread populations. We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (similar to 2000 m above sea level) and low (similar to 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (T-opt) had a >9 degrees C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0 degrees C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5 degrees C; cross-bred, 25.9 degrees C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8 +/- 0.8 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins and all crossbred tadpoles (37.0 +/- 0.8 and 37.1 +/- 0.8 degrees C). Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins and all cross-bred tadpoles had higher CTmin (4.2 +/- 0.7 and 4.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins (2.5 +/- 0.6 degrees C). Our study shows that the varying thermal physiological traits of Xenopus laevis tadpoles are the result of adaptive responses to their parental thermal environments. This study is one of few demonstrating potential intraspecific evolution of critical thermal limits in a vertebrate species. Multi-generation common garden experiments and genetic analyses would be required to further tease apart the relative contribution of plastic and genetic effects to the adaptive phenotypic variation observed in these tadpoles.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - We monitored winter sheltering behavior of Copper Rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) in layered boulders at a shoreline in British Columbia and identified possible links to climate change and evolutionary adaptation. During late autumn and winter, these fish were inside the interstices of the boulder pile (termed “winter sheltering”); these fish were actively swimming above the boulders during spring through early fall. Sheltering duration did not vary between normal and most El Niño years (154–177 days). Sheltering longer than 6 months occurred during strong La Niña winters (197–241 days). Additionally, the proximate stimulus for entry into sheltering was intense Arctic outflow windstorms. Emergence from sheltering appears linked to water temperatures, occasionally related more to spring river flooding (snowmelt). The winter sheltering behavior we describe may be unique to shoreline populations in inland seas. Sheltering may confer a fitness advantage by conserving energy or reducing mortality from predation, thus increasing longevity and chances for successful reproduction. Our observations suggest that an ONI threshold of 0.8 °C or greater would be better suited than the current 0.5 °C threshold used to define ONI events. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Phytoplankton Responses to Climate-Induced Warming and Interdecadal Oscillation in North-Western Australia
VL  - 35
IS  - 3
SP  - no
AB  - Growing evidence has suggested that ocean warming could cause a decline in marine phytoplankton productivity. However, studies in tropical waters have discovered that evolutionary adaptation of local species to warming and positive response to increasing rainfall could avoid the sharp decline in productivity. Here, the decadal trends of phytoplankton biomass, reconstructed using the biomarkers of brassicasterol (diatoms) and dinosterol (dinoflagellates), showed a 1.5-3 times increase since the 1950s along a large section of the Kimberley coast, north-western Australia. Principal component analysis found that 56% of the phytoplankton variance was linked with climate change-induced increases in sea surface temperature and rainfall associated with increased tropical cyclones, which can enhance nutrient supply favoring phytoplankton growth and production; 20.4% of the phytoplankton variance tended to be related to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation through a mechanism of ocean-coast interaction. We empirically predict that the negative impact of rising temperatures on phytoplankton in north-western Australia could be buffered by the increasing tropical cyclones and the coming warm phase of Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. Key Points Phytoplankton biomass has increased in north-western Australia by 1.5-3 times since the 1950s Fifty-six percent of the phytoplankton variance was related to increases in SST and rainfall and 20.4% to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation We empirically predict a more productive coastal environment in north-western Australia in coming decades

TI  - Adaptation to environmental temperature in divergent clades of the nematode Pristionchus pacificus
VL  - 76
IS  - 8
SP  - 1660-1673
AB  - Because of ongoing climate change, populations of organisms are being subjected to stressful temperatures more often. This is especially problematic for ectothermic organisms, which are likely to be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Therefore, we need to know if ectotherms have adapted to environmental temperature and, if so, what are the evolutionary mechanisms behind such adaptation. Here, we use the nematode Pristionchus pacificus as a case study to investigate thermal adaptation on the Indian Ocean island of La Réunion, which experiences a range of temperatures from coast to summit. We study the evolution of high-temperature tolerance by constructing a phylogenetic tree of strains collected from many different thermal niches. We show that populations of P. pacificus at low altitudes have higher fertility at warmer temperatures. Most likely, this phenotype has arisen recently and at least twice independently, consistent with parallel evolution. We also studied low-temperature tolerance and showed that populations from high altitudes have increased their fertility at cooler temperatures. Together, these data indicate that P. pacificus strains on La Réunion are subject to divergent selection, adapting to hot and cold niches at the coast and summit of the volcano. Precisely defining these thermal niches provides essential information for models that predict the impact of future climate change on these populations. © 2022 The Authors.

VL  - 196

AB  - Organisms living at high elevations generally grow and develop more slowly than those at lower elevations. Slow montane ontogeny is thought to be an evolved adaptation to harsh environments that improves juvenile quality via physiological trade-offs. However, slower montane ontogeny may also reflect proximate influences of harsh weather on parental care and offspring development. We experimentally heated and protected nests from rain to ameliorate harsh montane weather conditions for mountain blackeyes (Chlorocharis emiliae), a montane songbird living at approximately 3,200 m asl in Malaysian Borneo. This experiment was designed to test whether cold and wet montane conditions contribute to parental care and postnatal growth and development rates at high elevations. We found that parents increased provisioning and reduced time spent warming offspring, which grew faster and departed the nest earlier compared with offspring from unmanipulated nests. Earlier departure reduces time-dependent predation risk, benefitting parents and offspring. These plastic responses highlight the importance of proximate weather contributions to broad patterns of montane ontogeny and parental care. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - QseC mediates osmotic stress resistance and biofilm formation in Haemophilus parasuis
VL  - 9
AB  - Haemophilus parasuis is known as a commensal organism discovered in the upper respiratory tract of swine where the pathogenic bacteria survive in various adverse environmental stress. QseC, a histidine protein kinase of the two-component regulatory systems CheY/QseC, is involved in the environmental adaptation in bacteria. To investigate the role of QseC in coping with the adverse environment stresses and survive in the host, we constructed a qseC mutant of H. parasuis serovar 13 strain (ΔqseC), MY1902. In this study, we found that QseC was involved in stress tolerance of H. parasuis, by the ΔqseC exhibited a decreased resistance to osmotic pressure, oxidative stress, and heat shock. Moreover, the ΔqseC weakened the ability to take up iron and biofilm formation. We also found that the QseC participate in sensing the epinephrine in environment to regulate the density of H. parasuis. © 2018 He, Dai, Wen, Ding, Cao, Huang, Wu, Zhao, Huang, Yan, Ma, Han and Wen.

TI  - Locomotor activity patterns of takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in a temperate mountain region
VL  - 15
IS  - 7
AB  - Understanding locomotor activity patterns would reveal key information about an animal's foraging strategy, energy budget and evolutionary adaptation. We studied the locomotor activity patterns of the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in a temperate mountain region in China using GPS radio-collar technology from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. Our research showed that takin had a bimodal crepuscular locomotor activity pattern, with an especially obvious movement peak at dusk. The takins showed significant seasonal differences in their movement rates, with the lowest movement rate in winter. The animals also showed sexual differences in their movement rates. In spring, the female movement rate was significantly higher than that of males during daytime, while during nighttime the movement rate of males was higher than that of females. The male movement rate was significantly higher than that of females in summer. The movement rate of the takins were correlated to microenvironment temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in each season. These findings suggest that takin could adjust locomotor activity levels adapt to reproductive requirements, temperature variation and forage variability. © 2020 Yan et al.

TI  - Geographic variation in body size and its relationship with environmental gradients in the Oriental Garden Lizard, Calotes versicolor
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SP  - 4443-4454
AB  - Patterns of geographic variation in body size are predicted to evolve as adaptations to local environmental gradients. However, many of these clinal patterns in body size, such as Bergmann's rule, are controversial and require further investigation into ectotherms such as reptiles on a regional scale. To examine the environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, topography and primary productivity) that shaped patterns of geographic variation in body size in the reptile Calotes versicolor, we sampled 180 adult specimens (91 males and 89 females) at 40 locations across the species range in China. The MANOVA results suggest significant sexual size dimorphism in C. versicolor (F23,124 = 11.32, p &lt;.001). Our results showed that C. versicolor failed to fit the Bergmann's rule. We found that the most important predictors of variation in body size of C. versicolor differed for males and females, but mechanisms related to heat balance and water availability hypotheses were involved in both sexes. Temperature seasonality, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most important predictors of variation in body size in males, whereas mean precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the wettest month were most important for body size variation in females. The discrepancy between patterns of association between the sexes suggested that different selection pressures may be acting in males and females. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Metabolic Rate Diversity Shapes Group Performance in Honeybees
VL  - 199
IS  - 5
SP  - E156-E169
AB  - The metabolic theory of ecology posits that the functional properties at any level of biological organization are a function of the metabolic rate (MR) of its constituent units, although we know little about how heterogeneity among them shapes group-level performance. Using honeybees as a model system, we leveraged the differences in MR associated with “slow” and “fast” malate dehydrogenase alleles to breed genetic lines with low MR and high MR, respectively, and created four experimental groups with different phenotypic compositions. We then measured MR, energetic intake, thermoregulation, and survival of these groups in low-and high-resource conditions. Contrary to expectations, neither the monomorphic fast groups nor the polymorphic (1∶1 slow-to-fast) groups showed a consistent advantage over other groups, but the performance of all groups was consistently better under high-resource conditions. MR had a strong influence on the other performance traits, more so under low-resource conditions. We quantified the effect of heterogeneity in the polymorphic groups as a diversity effect and found different impacts of metabolic heterogeneity, depending on the specific performance measure in question. We discuss these results in the context of how MR plays an important role in shaping division of labor and social evolution. © 2022 The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

VL  - 37

SP  - 385-402
AB  - The Earth’s 24-h planetary rotation, with predictable light and heat cycles, has driven profound evolutionary adaptation, with prominent impacts on physiological mechanisms important for surviving critical illness. Pathways of interest include inflammation, mitochondrial function, energy metabolism, hypoxic signaling, apoptosis, and defenses against reactive oxygen species. Regulation of these by the cellular circadian clock (BMAL-1 and its network) has an important influence on pulmonary inflammation; ventilator-associated lung injury; septic shock; brain injury, including vasospasm; and overall mortality in both animals and humans. Whether it is cytokines, the inflammasome, or mitochondrial biogenesis, circadian medicine represents exciting opportunities for translational therapy in intensive care, which is currently lacking. Circadian medicine also represents a link to metabolic determinants of outcome, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. More than ever, we are appreciating the problem of circadian desynchrony in intensive care. This review explores the rationale and evidence for the importance of the circadian clock in surviving critical illness. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Aptamer-functionalised metal-organic frameworks as an ‘on–off–on’ fluorescent sensor for bisphenol S detection
VL  - 253
AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) is an industrial chemical that is widely used to manufacture daily items, such as plastic water bottles, milk bottles, water cups, and paper products. BPS is a biologically toxic environmental endocrine disruptor. Long-term exposure to BPS can disrupt the reproductive system, endanger health, and increase the risk of cancer. The metal-organic framework UiO-66 is characterised with high thermal and chemical stability, a simple synthetic route, and low preparation cost. In this study, we modified UiO-66 with nucleic acid aptamers to prepare an ‘on–off–on’ fluorescent sensor for the simple and rapid detection of BPS. The FAM-labelled aptamer was selected as the fluorescent probe (i.e. ‘on’). In the presence of UiO-66, the FAM-labelled aptamer adsorbed onto the surface of the UiO-66 material, and the fluorescence of FAM was quenched by photoinduced electron transfer (i.e. ‘off’). When BPS was introduced into the system, the configuration of the FAM-labelled aptamer changed after binding to BPS, and the adsorption of FAM on UiO-66 weakened, resulting in fluorescence recovery (i.e. ‘on’). Based on this principle, the reaction system was optimised, and the BPS content was analysed according to the change in the fluorescence signal. The signals changed linearly in the BPS concentration range of 2.0 × 10−4–4.0 × 10−2 mmol L−1, and the system had a detection limit of 1.84 × 10−4 mmol L−1. The sensor was successfully used to detect the BPS content in commercial plastic bottled water. © 2022

VL  - 126
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-37
AB  - Assessing the genetic adaptive potential of populations and species is essential for better understanding evolutionary processes. However, the expression of genetic variation may depend on environmental conditions, which may speed up or slow down evolutionary responses. Thus, the same selection pressure may lead to different responses. Against this background, we here investigate the effects of thermal stress on genetic variation, mainly under controlled laboratory conditions. We estimated additive genetic variance (VA), narrow-sense heritability (h2) and the coefficient of genetic variation (CVA) under both benign control and stressful thermal conditions. We included six species spanning a diverse range of plant and animal taxa, and a total of 25 morphological and life-history traits. Our results show that (1) thermal stress reduced fitness components, (2) the majority of traits showed significant genetic variation and that (3) thermal stress affected the expression of genetic variation (VA, h2 or CVA) in only one-third of the cases (25 of 75 analyses, mostly in one clonal species). Moreover, the effects were highly species-specific, with genetic variation increasing in 11 and decreasing in 14 cases under stress. Our results hence indicate that thermal stress does not generally affect the expression of genetic variation under laboratory conditions but, nevertheless, increases or decreases genetic variation in specific cases. Consequently, predicting the rate of genetic adaptation might not be generally complicated by environmental variation, but requires a careful case-by-case consideration. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Genetics Society.

TI  - Evolution of the threshold temperature definition of a heat wave vs. evolution of the minimum mortality temperature: a case study in Spain during the 1983–2018 period
VL  - 33
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: An area of current study concerns analysis of the possible adaptation of the population to heat, based on the temporal evolution of the minimum mortality temperature (MMT). It is important to know how is the evolution of the threshold temperatures (Tthreshold) due to these temperatures provide the basis for the activation of public health prevention plans against high temperatures. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal evolution of threshold temperatures (Tthreshold) produced in different Spanish regions during the 1983–2018 period and to compare this evolution with the evolution of MMT. The dependent variable used was the raw rate of daily mortality due to natural causes ICD X: (A00-R99) for the considered period. The independent variable was maximum daily temperature (Tmax) during the summer months registered in the reference observatory of each region. Threshold values were determined using dispersion diagrams (annual) of the prewhitened series of mortality temperatures and Tmax. Later, linear fit models were carried out between the different values of Tthreshold throughout the study period, which permitted detecting the annual rate of change in Tthreshold. Results: The results obtained show that, on average, Tthreshold has increased at a rate of 0.57 ºC/decade in Spain, while Tmax temperatures in the summer have increased at a rate of 0.41 ºC/decade, suggesting adaptation to heat. This rate of evolution presents important geographic heterogeneity. Also, the rate of evolution of Tthreshold was similar to what was detected for MMT. Conclusions: The temporal evolution of the series of both temperature measures can be used as indicators of population adaptation to heat. The temporal evolution of Tthreshold has important geographic variation, probably related to sociodemographic and economic factors, that should be studied at the local level. © 2021, The Author(s).

Here, we investigated the effects of breeding design and water temperature for offspring on fertilization, hatchability, larval survival, size, abnormality and metamorphosis of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus intermedius, whose dams and sires were exposed to long-term (similar to 15 months) elevated temperature (similar to 3 degrees C above ambient) or ambient temperature. There was no transgenerational effect on fertilization and metamorphosis of S. intermedius, while negative transgenerational effects were found in hatchability and most traits of larval size. Dam and sire effects were highly trait and developmental stage dependent. Interestingly, we found S. intermedius probably cannot achieve transgenerational acclimation to long-term elevated temperature for survival provided their offspring were exposed to an elevated temperature. The present study enriches our understanding of transgenerational effects of ocean warming on sea urchins.

AB  - Solar activity (SA) dynamics increases mankind's evolutionary adaptability to pandemics. Flu pandemics from 1880 to 2020 took place during maximum or minimum of solar cycles. The article discusses several factors that modulated the development of the COVID-19 pandemic: SA dynamic, genetic population features, environment temperature, the effect of lockdowns, and vaccination in various countries. The population genetic composition turned out to be the most significant factor for coronavirus mortalities during a SA global minimum 2019-2020. COVID-19 pandemic is most severe in countries with a dominant haplogroup R1b (the relative number of deaths per million is more than 12-25). Local COVID-19 epidemics were more easily in countries with a dominant haplogroup N (relative number of deaths less than 3). The incidence per million people in haplogroups R1b: R1a: N has a ratio of about 7: 2: 1. This ratio does not depend on the pandemic waves and the population vaccinated rate. Vaccination effectiveness may depend on the population's genetic characteristics too. It is expected to maintain extremely low solar activity during the 30 years. Under these conditions, a twofold increase in the number of pandemics (every 5-6 years instead of 10-11 years) can be expected with pronounced genogeographic differences. © 2021 Maria Ragulskaya, published by De Gruyter.

TI  - Terrestrial insects and climate change: adaptive responses in key traits
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
SP  - 99-115
AB  - Understanding and predicting how adaptation will contribute to species' resilience to climate change will be paramount to successfully managing biodiversity for conservation, agriculture, and human health-related purposes. Making predictions that capture how species will respond to climate change requires an understanding of how key traits and environmental drivers interact to shape fitness in a changing world. Current trait-based models suggest that low- to mid-latitude populations will be most at risk, although these models focus on upper thermal limits, which may not be the most important trait driving species' distributions and fitness under climate change. In this review, we discuss how different traits (stress, fitness and phenology) might contribute and interact to shape insect responses to climate change. We examine the potential for adaptive genetic and plastic responses in these key traits and show that, although there is evidence of range shifts and trait changes, explicit consideration of what underpins these changes, be that genetic or plastic responses, is largely missing. Despite little empirical evidence for adaptive shifts, incorporating adaptation into models of climate change resilience is essential for predicting how species will respond under climate change. We are making some headway, although more data are needed, especially from taxonomic groups outside of Drosophila, and across diverse geographical regions. Climate change responses are likely to be complex, and such complexity will be difficult to capture in laboratory experiments. Moving towards well designed field experiments would allow us to not only capture this complexity, but also study more diverse species. © 2019 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - The Effect of Population Bottleneck Size and Selective Regime on Genetic Diversity and Evolvability in Bacteria
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SP  - 3283-3290
AB  - Population bottlenecks leading to a drastic reduction of the population size are common in the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations; their occurrence is known to have implications for genome evolution due to genetic drift, the consequent reduction in genetic diversity, and the rate of adaptation. Nevertheless, an empirical characterization of the effect of population bottleneck size on evolutionary dynamics of bacteria is currently lacking. In this study, we show that selective conditions have a stronger effect on the evolutionary history of bacteria in comparison to population bottlenecks. We evolved Escherichia coli populations under three different population bottleneck sizes (small, medium, and large) in two temperature regimes (37 °C and 20 °C). We find a high genetic diversity in the large in comparison to the small bottleneck size. Nonetheless, the cold temperature led to reduced genetic diversity regardless the bottleneck size; hence, the temperature has a stronger effect on the genetic diversity in comparison to the bottleneck size. A comparison of the fitness gain among the evolved populations reveals a similar pattern where the temperature has a significant effect on the fitness. Our study demonstrates that population bottlenecks are an important determinant of bacterial evolvability; their consequences depend on the selective conditions and are best understood via their effect on the standing genetic variation. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Accelerating climate change is inciting ecological and evolutionary responses in species across a diverse array of taxa (. Parmesan, 2006). Some species will benefit from climate change, either directly via the release from climatic niche constraints (. Mohan et al., 2006) or indirectly through their interactions with the abiotic or biotic environment (. Currano et al., 2010; Brodie et al., 2012). Others have shifted their distributions to higher latitudes and elevations to track favorable climatic envelopes (. Perry et al., 2005; Lenoir et al., 2008). Such migrations alleviate the immediate effects of climate change, but species are still likely to encounter novel environmental conditions and species assemblages in their new habitats (. Brown and Vellend, 2014). Species incapable of migrating must tolerate climate change or will have to evolve to avoid extinction (. Burger and Lynch, 1995).Here, we review evolutionary responses to climate change. Climate change is forecast to alter temperature and precipitation regimes while also increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. As such, climate change will likely impose strong novel selection. Species can respond to new abiotic and biotic conditions through: (1) local or global extinctions (Cahill et al., 2013); (2) migration and distributional shifts (Parmesan et al., 1999); (3) plasticity (Nicotra et al., 2010); and (4) adaptation (Thompson et al., 2013). The fossil record reveals that species have persevered through rapid periods of environmental change in the past, both through migration and the evolution of morphological traits (Davis and Shaw, 2001). However, the novel selection pressures imposed by climate change are likely to target physiological and life history traits, which cannot be captured by fossilization. The ecological ramifications of climate change are well-studied in many systems, but the corresponding evolutionary responses have been largely ignored empirically, likely because of methodological challenges (however, see Etterson and Shaw, 2001; Franks et al., 2007, 2016; Jump et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2013; Wilczek et al., 2014). To predict the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, sustainability, and ecosystem function it is imperative that we understand the factors that promote adaptive evolution and identify the circumstances in which species' persistence will be jeopardized. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 13

AB  - The comprehensive exploitation of geothermal fields has an impact on the productivity of the reservoirs. To realize sustainable steam production, changes in the rock temperature need to be predicted and controlled. A coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) model employing COMSOL Multiphysics was proposed to study the characteristics of heat transfer, fluid flow, and solid deformation at the Lahendong geothermal field, in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. The numerical results were compared with analytical and measured data in order to validate the numerical simulation. Based on the results, the predicted temperatures of the production wells showed significant decrease with the production time. In addition, a reduction in the reservoir temperature leads to lower specific gross electrical power within the production well, which should significantly reduce the sustainability of the power plant. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Biofilm is the most successful and widely distributed form of life on earth, it is not simply structured collections of cells attached to surfaces but is a dynamic complex biological system able to respond to environmental changes. The biofilm characteristics make it unique and central to microbial evolution and adaptation. The ability to establish biofilms is a key trait for microorganisms growing in extreme environments like extreme temperature, high radiation, acidic or alkaline pH values, heavy metal pollution, and high salinity. In this article, we report the main features of biofilm and how these characteristics make biofilms a successful survival strategy in extreme conditions. All aspects examined in this article help to explain why biofilms are a successful survival strategy in extreme conditions and why the ability to establish biofilms is a key trait for microorganisms growing in extreme environments. © 2022, The Author(s).

VL  - 8
IS  - 18
SP  - 9341-9352
AB  - The capacity of individuals to cope with stress, for example, from pathogen exposure, might decrease with increasing levels of sexual selection, although it remains unclear which sex should be more sensitive. Here, we measured the ability of each sex to maintain high reproductive success following challenges with either heat-killed bacteria or procedural control, across replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolved under either high or low levels of sexual selection. Our experiment was run across four separate sampling blocks. We found an interaction between bacterial treatment, sexual selection treatment, and sampling block on female reproductive success. Specifically, and only in the fourth block, we observed that bacterial-challenged females that had evolved under high sexual selection, exhibited lower reproductive success than bacterial-challenged females that had evolved under low sexual selection. Furthermore, we could trace this block-specific effect to a reduction in viscosity of the ovipositioning substrate in the fourth block, in which females laid around 50% more eggs than in previous blocks. In contrast, patterns of male reproductive success were consistent across blocks. Males that evolved under high sexual selection exhibited higher reproductive success than their low-selection counterparts, regardless of whether they were subjected to a bacterial challenge or not. Our results are consistent with the prediction that heightened sexual selection will invoke male-specific evolutionary increases in reproductive fitness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that females might pay fitness costs when exposed to high levels of sexual selection, but that these costs may lie cryptic, and only be revealed under certain environmental contexts. © 2018 The Authors.

VL  - 368

AB  - Forest dynamics arise from the interplay of environmental drivers and disturbances with the demographic processes of recruitment, growth, and mortality, subsequently driving biomass and species composition. However, forest disturbances and subsequent recovery are shifting with global changes in climate and land use, altering these dynamics. Changes in environmental drivers, land use, and disturbance regimes are forcing forests toward younger, shorter stands. Rising carbon dioxide, acclimation, adaptation, and migration can influence these impacts. Recent developments in Earth system models support increasingly realistic simulations of vegetation dynamics. In parallel, emerging remote sensing datasets promise qualitatively new and more abundant data on the underlying processes and consequences for vegetation structure. When combined, these advances hold promise for improving the scientific understanding of changes in vegetation demographics and disturbances. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

VL  - 47

AB  - Fish mortality generally occurs during extreme summer temperatures in India which are apprehended to be more frequent in near future and may reduce the fish population, particularly in closed aquatic systems. This present study is conducted with the objectives to find out heat shock and associated oxidative stress responses that occurred in selected fish Labeo rohita due to extremely high water temperature (treated, 37–38 °C against control, 28–30 °C) exposure for 2 weeks. Calculated mortality was 30% during the experimental period. The results revealed the biomolecules associated with both the anti-oxidative response (reduced glutathione in serum, liver, muscle; catalase activity in liver, muscle; superoxide dismutase gene expression in the liver) and the heat shock response (hsp70 gene expression in the liver) were elevated under thermal stress. Pro-inflammatory responses (expression of complement protein 3, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver) and oxidative damages (lipid peroxidation in all studied tissue and DNA fragmentation in the liver) were more under thermal stress. Extreme thermal stress induced by partial lethal temperature exposure in this study led to the activation of both the heat shock response and the anti-oxidative response. However, these responses were not elicited to the level so that they can protect from oxidative damages and inflammation in the liver of all the studied fish that caused partial mortality in fish. Thermal stress–induced hepatotoxicity caused fish death which was documented for the first time in freshwater fish. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

VL  - 74

AB  - Although the impacts of climate change and invasive species are typically studied in isolation, they likely interact to reduce the viability of plant and animal populations. Indeed, invasive species, by definition, have succeeded in areas outside of their native range and may therefore have higher adaptive capacity relative to native species. Nevertheless, the genetic architecture of the thermal niche, which sets a limit to the potential for populations to evolve rapidly under climate change, has never been measured in an invasive species in its introduced range. Here, we estimate the genetic architecture of thermal performance in the harlequin beetle (Harmonia axyridis), a Central Asian species that has invaded four continents. We measured thermal performance curves in more than 400 third-generation offspring from a paternal half-sib breeding experiment and analyzed the genetic variance–covariance matrix. We show that while the critical thermal limits in this species have an additive genetic basis, most components of the thermal performance curve have low heritability. Moreover, we found evidence that genetic correlations may constrain the evolution of beetles under climate change. Our results suggest that some invasive species may have limited evolutionary capacity under climate change, despite their initial success in colonizing novel environments. © 2019 The Author(s).

VL  - 55
IS  - 5
AB  - We revisit the problem of the production of light atomic nuclei in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. While their production systematics is well produced by hadro-chemical freezeout at temperatures near the QCD pseudo-critical temperature, their small binding energies of a few MeV per nucleon suggest that they cannot survive as bound states under these conditions. Here, we adopt the concept of effective chemical potentials in the hadronic evolution from chemical to thermal freezeout (at typically T fo ≃ 100 MeV), which, despite frequent elastic rescatterings in hadronic matter, conserves the effective numbers of particles which are stable under strong interactions, most notably pions, kaons and nucleons. It turns out that the large chemical potentials that build up for antibaryons result in thermal abundances of light nuclei and antinuclei, formed at thermal freezeout, which essentially agree with the ones evaluated at chemical freezeout. Together with their transverse-momentum spectra, which also indicate a kinetic freezeout near T fo , this provides a natural explanation for their production systematics without postulating their survival at high temperatures. © 2019, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Cellular Innovation of the Cyanobacterial Heterocyst by the Adaptive Loss of Plasticity
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 344-350.e4
AB  - Cellular innovation is central to biological diversification, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood [1]. One potential source of new cellular traits is environmentally induced phenotypic variation, or phenotypic plasticity. The plasticity-first hypothesis [2–4] proposes that natural selection can improve upon an ancestrally plastic phenotype to produce a locally adaptive trait, but the role of plasticity for adaptive evolution is still unclear [5–10]. Here, we show that a structurally novel form of the heterocyst, the specialized nitrogen-fixing cell of the multicellular cyanobacterium Fischerella thermalis, has evolved multiple times from ancestrally plastic developmental variation during adaptation to high temperature. Heterocyst glycolipids (HGs) provide an extracellular gas diffusion barrier that protects oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase [11, 12], and cyanobacteria typically exhibit temperature-induced plasticity in HG composition that modulates heterocyst permeability [13, 14]. By contrast, high-temperature specialists of F. thermalis constitutively overproduce glycolipid isomers associated with high temperature to levels unattained by plastic strains. This results in a less-permeable heterocyst, which is advantageous at high temperature but deleterious at low temperature for both nitrogen fixation activity and fitness. Our study illustrates how the origin of a novel cellular phenotype by the genetic assimilation and adaptive refinement of a plastic trait can be a source of biological diversity and contribute to ecological specialization. Cellular innovation is central to biological diversification, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Miller et al. show that a structurally novel nitrogen-fixing cell has evolved multiple times during high-temperature adaptation by the cyanobacterium Fischerella thermalis. Adaptation involved the loss and refinement of developmental variation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of synechococcus sp. CS-601 (SynAce01), a cold-adapted cyanobacterium from an oligotrophic antarctic habitat
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - Marine picocyanobacteria belonging to Synechococcus are major contributors to the global carbon cycle, however the genomic information of its cold-adapted members has been lacking to date. To fill this void the genome of a cold-adapted planktonic cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. CS-601 (SynAce01) has been sequenced. The genome of the strain contains a single chromosome of approximately 2.75 MBp and GC content of 63.92%. Gene prediction yielded 2984 protein coding sequences and 44 tRNA genes. The genome contained evidence of horizontal gene transfer events during its evolution. CS-601 appears as a transport generalist with some specific adaptation to an oligotrophic marine environment. It has a broad repertoire of transporters of both inorganic and organic nutrients to survive in inhospitable environments. The cold adaptation of the strain exhibited characteristics of a psychrotroph rather than psychrophile. Its salt adaptation strategy is likely to rely on the uptake and synthesis of osmolytes, like glycerol or glycine betaine. Overall, the genome reveals two distinct patterns of adaptation to the inhospitable environment of Antarctica. Adaptation to an oligotrophic marine environment is likely due to an abundance of genes, probably acquired horizontally, that are associated with increased transport of nutrients, osmolytes, and light harvesting. On the other hand, adaptations to low temperatures are likely due to prolonged evolutionary changes. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Genetic relationships and biofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from the smoked salmon industry
VL  - 356
AB  - Among pathogens, L. monocytogenes has the capability to persist on Food Processing Environment (FPE), first of all posing safety issues, then economic impact on productivity. The aim of this work was to determine the influence of biofilm forming-ability and molecular features on the persistence of 19 Listeria monocytogenes isolates obtained from FPE, raw and processed products of a cold-smoked salmon processing plant. To verify the phenotypic and genomic correlations among the isolates, different analyses were employed: serotyping, Clonal Complex (CC), core genome Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (cgMLST) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) clustering, and evaluation of the presence of virulence- and persistence-associated genes. From our results, the biofilm formation was significantly higher (*P < 0.05) at 37 °C, compared to 30 and 12 °C, suggesting a temperature-dependent behaviour. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability showed a strain-specific trend, not correlated with CC or with strains persistence. Instead, the presence of internalin (inL), Stress Survival Islet (SSI) and resistance to erythromycin (ermC) genes was correlated with the ability to produce biofilms. Our data demonstrate that the genetic profile influences the adhesion capacity and persistence of L. monocytogenes in food processing plants and could be the result of environmental adaptation in response to the external selective pressure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The mating system affects the temperature sensitivity of male and female fertility
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 92-106
AB  - To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is important to understand species' responses to increasing temperatures. This has often been done by studying survival or activity at temperature extremes. Before such extremes are reached, however, effects on fertility may already be apparent. Sex differences in the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) could impact species persistence under climate warming because female fertility is typically more limiting to population growth than male fertility. However, little is known about sex differences in TSF. Here we first demonstrate that the mating system can strongly influence TSF using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We exposed populations carrying artificially induced mutations to two generations of short-term experimental evolution under alternative mating systems, manipulating the opportunity for natural and sexual selection on the mutations. We then measured TSF in males and females subjected to juvenile or adult heat stress. Populations kept under natural and sexual selection had higher fitness, but similar TSF, compared to control populations kept under relaxed selection. However, females had higher TSF than males, and strikingly, this sex difference had increased over only two generations in populations evolving under sexual selection. We hypothesized that an increase in male-induced harm to females during mating had played a central role in driving this evolved sex difference, and indeed, remating under conditions limiting male harassment of females reduced both male and female TSF. Moreover, we show that manipulation of mating system parameters in C. maculatus generates intraspecific variation in the sex difference in TSF equal to that found among a diverse set of studies on insects. Our study provides a causal link between the mating system and TSF. Sexual conflict, (re)mating rates and genetic responses to sexual selection differ among ecological settings, mating systems and species. Our study therefore also provides mechanistic understanding for the variability in previously reported TSFs which can inform future experimental assays and predictions of species responses to climate warming.

TI  - Evolution of heat-shock protein expression underlying adaptive responses to environmental stress
VL  - 27
IS  - 15
SP  - 3040-3054
AB  - Heat-shock proteins (Hsps) and their cognates are primary mitigators of cell stress. With increasingly severe impacts of climate change and other human modifications of the biosphere, the ability of the heat-shock system to affect evolutionary fitness in environments outside the laboratory and to evolve in response is topic of growing importance. Since the last major reviews, several advances have occurred. First, demonstrations of the heat-shock response outside the laboratory now include many additional taxa and environments. Many of these demonstrations are only correlative, however. More importantly, technical advances in “omic” quantification of nucleic acids and proteins, genomewide association analysis, and manipulation of genes and their expression have enabled the field to move beyond correlation. Several consequent advances are already evident: The pathway from heat-shock gene expression to stress tolerance in nature can be extremely complex, mediated through multiple biological processes and systems, and even multiple species. The underlying genes are more numerous, diverse and variable than previously appreciated, especially with respect to their regulatory variation and epigenetic changes. The impacts and limitations (e.g., due to trade-offs) of natural selection on these genes have become more obvious and better established. At last, as evolutionary capacitors, Hsps may have distinctive impacts on the evolution of other genes and ecological consequences. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 12

SP  - 221-243
AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to measure Chinese regional thermal industries’ evolution. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and global Malmquist–Luenberger productivity (GMLP) index. Findings: The results reveal that the development of Chinese thermal power industry varies significantly in different regions, and it is highly correlated with the level of local economic development. Although the change of technical efficiency and scale efficiency had different impacts on different regions from year to year, the overall GMLP index change shows a close relationship with the contemporaneous frontier shift. Practical implications: The results indicate that the Chinese Government should make efforts to promote its policy implementations and regulations in thermal industries so that the contemporaneous frontier will shift toward the global technology frontier with more desirable outputs and less undesirable outputs. Originality/value: As an application, this study uses DEA and GMLP index to measure the productivity of Chinese thermal industries in 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2013. The results have the meaningful policy implications for decision makers in charge of Chinese thermal industries. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background and objective Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are the most useful microorganisms to society, LAB are used in the production of many fermented food products that stimulate digestion and immunity. Therefore, the objective study aimed to isolate, characterize, and identify new LAB members and determining their potential probiotic properties. Materials and methods This study was performed through isolation, selection, and identification of LAB strains morphologically, biochemically, and genetically. Then, to determine their probiotics traits, which include acid resistance, bile-salt tolerance, β-galactosidase activity, heat sensitivity, salinity, cholesterol reduction, and antioxidant activity. Results and discussion Eight LAB isolates were isolated and purified from milk and cheeses, out of eight isolates, K 2 showed the highest resistance to acidic pH 2.0, where Log CFU/ml reduced from the initial count 8.79±0.17 at pH 7.0 to 4.57±0.10 at pH 2.0 with 51.99% survival rate. Also, the six bile-tolerant isolates (K 1, K 2, K 3, K 4, A 11, and A 5) were found tolerant to 1% bile-salt concentrations for 3 h with 92.50, 71.10, 64.35, 60.72, 71.11, and 72.21% rate of survival, respectively. Also, antibiotic susceptibility of A 11 isolate was the most sensitive, but isolate A 2 was the most resistant against antibiotics. Besides, heat sensitivity of selected LAB isolates (K 1, K 2, A 11, and B 1) were able to survive at temperatures 15, 37, and 45°C, but isolates (K 3, K 4, A 5, and A 2) did not grow at 45°C. Additionally, NaCl tolerance clearly revealed that both isolates (K 2 and A 11) were able to tolerate a wide range of NaCl (1-8% w/v), then the growth declined with the increase of salt (10%) concentration. The results showed that the cholesterol assimilation was reduced by 32.66 and 30.20% for A 11 and K 1 isolates, respectively. Also, K 2 isolate showed the highest antioxidant activity (86.93%), and the best β-galactosidase producer (24.65 U/ml). Therefore, the 16S-rRNA sequencing was carried out to identify four promising LAB isolates that could be employed as a probiotic strain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates belonged to three genera, including Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. Strains were Lactobacillus casei (A 5) KU510332, Enterococcus faecium (A 11) KU510333, Lactococcus lactis (K 1) KU510334, and E. faecium (K 2) KU510335.

TI  - Transcriptomes of saussurea (Asteraceae) provide insights into high-altitude adaptation
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
AB  - Understanding how species adapt to extreme environments is an extension of the main goals of evolutionary biology. While alpine plants are an ideal system for investigating the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation, genomic resources in these species are still limited. In the present study, we generated reference-level transcriptomic data of five Saussurea species through highthroughput sequencing and de novo assembly. Three of them are located in the highland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and the other two are close relatives distributed in the lowland. A series of comparative and evolutionary genomics analyses were conducted to explore the genetic signatures of adaptive evolution to high-altitude environments. Estimation of divergence time using single-copy orthologs revealed that Saussurea species diversified during the Miocene, a period with extensive tectonic movement and climatic fluctuation on the QTP. We characterized gene families specific to the alpine species, including genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, pectin catabolic process, lipid transport, and polysaccharide metabolic process, which may play important roles in defense of hypoxia and freezing temperatures of the QTP. Furthermore, in a phylogenetic context with the branch model, we identified hundreds of genes with signatures of positive selection. These genes are involved in DNA repair, membrane transport, response to UV-B and hypoxia, and reproductive processes, as well as some metabolic processes associated with nutrient intake, potentially responsible for Saussurea adaptation to the harsh environments of high altitude. Overall, our study provides valuable genomic resources for alpine species and gained helpful insights into the genomic basis of plants adapting to extreme environments. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Integrating speed breeding with artificial intelligence for developing climate-smart crops
AB  - Introduction: In climate change, breeding crop plants with improved productivity, sustainability, and adaptability has become a daunting challenge to ensure global food security for the ever-growing global population. Correspondingly, climate-smart crops are also the need to regulate biomass production, which is imperative for the maintenance of ecosystem services worldwide. Since conventional breeding technologies for crop improvement are limited, time-consuming, and involve laborious selection processes to foster new and improved crop varieties. An urgent need is to accelerate the plant breeding cycle using artificial intelligence (AI) to depict plant responses to environmental perturbations in real-time. Materials and methods: The review is a collection of authorized information from various sources such as journals, books, book chapters, technical bulletins, conference papers, and verified online contents. Conclusions: Speed breeding has emerged as an essential strategy for accelerating the breeding cycles of crop plants by growing them under artificial light and temperature conditions. Furthermore, speed breeding can also integrate marker-assisted selection and cutting-edged gene-editing tools for early selection and manipulation of essential crops with superior agronomic traits. Scientists have recently applied next-generation AI to delve deeper into the complex biological and molecular mechanisms that govern plant functions under environmental cues. In addition, AIs can integrate, assimilate, and analyze complex OMICS data sets, an essential prerequisite for successful speed breeding protocol implementation to breed crop plants with superior yield and adaptability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

In Lake Tinnsjøen, one of the largest and deepest lakes in Norway, the salmonid fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)), has likely radiated within 9,700 years after deglaciation into ecologically and genetically segregated Piscivore, Planktivore, Dwarf, and Abyssal morphs in the pelagial, littoral, shallow-moderate profundal, and deep-profundal habitats. We compared trait variation in the size of the head, the eye and olfactory organs, as well as the volumes of five brain regions of these four Arctic charr morphs. We hypothesised that specific habitat characteristics have promoted divergent body, head, and brain sizes related to utilized depth differing in environmental constraints (e.g., light, oxygen, pressure, temperature, and food quality). The most important ecomorphological variables differentiating morphs were eye area, habitat, and number of lamellae. The Abyssal morph living in the deepest areas of the lake had the smallest brain region volumes, head, and eye size. Comparing the olfactory bulb with the optic tectum in size, it was larger in the Abyssal morph than in the Piscivore morph. The Piscivore and Planktivore morphs that use more illuminated habitats have the largest optic tectum volume, followed by the Dwarf. The observed differences in body size and sensory capacities in terms of vision and olfaction in shallow and deepwater morphs likely relates to foraging and mating habitats in Lake Tinnsjøen. Further seasonal and experimental studies of brain volume in polymorphic species are needed to test the role of plasticity and adaptive evolution behind the observed differences. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Quarkonium suppression is one of the more useful observables to obtain information about the hot medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this manuscript, we discuss a simple way to implement both the initial-state effects and the hot-medium evolution, and to compute the quarkonium nuclear modification factor if the survival probability for a bound state at a given energy density is known. Based on the Glauber model, the temperature of the evolving medium and the centrality dependence of the nuclear modification factor will be analyzed. © 2022 authors.

AB  - In this paper the expected fitness improvement metric is proposed to visualize the parameter search space in Differential Evolution. The expected fitness improvement is estimated at every generation of the algorithm and plotted in a heatmap profile. The spread of promising scaling factor values is analyzed for the SHADE and jDE algorithms with two different mutation strategies. In addition, the distance between the individuals in the population is considered, and the connection between distance and scaling factor values is observed. The performed experiments reveal important properties of Differential Evolution mutation operators, as well as widely used parameter adaptation techniques. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Reheat furnace production scheduling based on the improved differential evolution algorithm
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 422-432
AB  - The reheat furnace, located between the continuous caster and the hot rolling mill, plays the role of buffer coordination zone, and is one of the most important production equipment in the hot rolling process. As reheat furnaces were the largest energy-consumer group in the hot rolling process, their schedule optimization was of great importance to achieve high production efficiency and reduce energy consumption. In this paper, a new reheat furnace production scheduling method with the target of minimum fuel consumption was proposed. First, the energy inputs and outputs from the reheat furnace were analyzed based on the first law of thermodynamics, then the equation for calculating of the fuel consumption was derived. Second, various production constraints were summarized to consider the actual characteristics of the dispatching plan in reheat furnaces, and the mathematical model of scheduling optimization was constructed with the minimum fuel consumption set as the optimization objective. The adaptive differential evolution algorithm and the tabu search algorithm were applied to obtain the optimal solution. The differential evolution algorithm could dynamically adjust the scaling factor and the crossover rate according to the change of the fitness function value of each generation of individuals, and this adaptive strategy could balance the ability of development and exploration of the algorithm. After the model was validated with actual production data, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm were verified by nine groups of actual billet production cases. Furthermore, to explore the influencing factors of energy consumption of reheat furnace, two evaluation parameters, μ1 and μ2, were defined to quantify the matching degree of time series of the buffer waits and the heating processes to ideal production in reheat furnaces. According to the sensitivity analysis of the relationship between the fuel consumption and the two evaluation parameters, it was found that their sensitivity gradually decreased when the ratio of continuous casting billet arriving at the reheat furnace to hot rolling increased from 0.5 to 2.

TI  - Biotic Versus Abiotic Control of Primary Production Identified in a Common Garden Experiment
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Understanding drivers of ecosystem primary production is a foundational question in ecology that grows in importance with anthropogenic stresses (e.g., climate change). Traditionally, ecosystem production is considered to be abiotically controlled at large spatial scales (e.g., precipitation, temperature, etc.), which underlies forecasting climate change impacts. Using a “common garden” experiment over 10 years at two sites with the same plant and grasshopper species, we show that primary production is strongly influenced by biotic factors (herbivory and plant adaptations to it) at finer spatial scales by creating positive feedbacks, which reverse relative productivity of ecosystems expected from abiotic conditions alone. Our results without herbivory indicate that one site has 26% less annual net primary production (ANPP) than the other site. With herbivory, the sites reverse in ANPP, so the site with lower ANPP without herbivory now is 15% greater than the site with higher ANPP without herbivory, as they respectively increase by 6% and decline by 33%. This reversal is due to changing nitrogen availability (N), as N becomes 16% greater at the higher ANPP site with herbivory, respectively a 3% increase and 41% decline in N. The ANPP and N changes are observed, even though the sites are a few kilometers apart and have the same grasshopper and plant species. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Heightened among-individual variation in life history but not morphology is related to developmental temperature in reptiles
VL  - 34
IS  - 11
SP  - 1793-1802
AB  - Increases in phenotypic variation under extreme (e.g. novel or stressful) environmental conditions are emerging as a crucial process through which evolutionary adaptation can occur. Lack of prior stabilizing selection, as well as potential instability of developmental processes in these environments, may lead to a release of phenotypic variation that can have important evolutionary consequences. Although such patterns have been shown in model study organisms, we know little about the generality of trait variance across environments for non-model organisms. Here, we test whether extreme developmental temperatures increase the phenotypic variation across diverse reptile taxa. We find that the among-individual variation in a key life-history trait (post-hatching growth) increases at extreme cold and hot temperatures. However, variations in two measures of hatchling morphology and in hatchling performance were not related to developmental temperature. Although extreme developmental temperatures may increase the variation in growth, our results suggest that plastic responses to stressful incubation conditions do not generally make more extreme phenotypes available to selection. We discuss the reasons for the general lack of increased variability at extreme incubation temperatures and the implications this has for local adaptation in hatchling morphology and physiology. © 2021 European Society for Evolutionary Biology

TI  - Cenozoic exhumation and shale-gas enrichment of the Wufeng-Longmaxi formation in the southern Sichuan basin, western China
VL  - 125
AB  - Based on low-temperature thermochronological data (i.e., apatite fission-track (AFT) and (U-Th)/He (AHe)), structural evolution, burial and thermal history, this paper examines the relationship of multi-stage evolution between the upper Ordovician Wufeng and lower Silurian Longmaxi formations (i.e., the WL formation) and rapid exhumation at the Changning shale gas field in the southern Sichuan basin. AFT ages are generally young from southeast to northwest, decreasing from ca. 40 to 15 Ma while AHe single-grain ages range from -35 to-5 Ma. Inverse thermal histories show that a multi-stage cooling history with initial cooling began in the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic (middle Eocene), followed by accelerated rapid cooling in the late Cenozoic, with cooling rates of 2-4 degrees C/Myr across the Changning shale gas field. In particular, thermal models of samples in the western Changning area show a substantial increase in the cooling rates, i.e., from less than 1 degrees C/Myr to 3-5 degrees C/Myr in the Miocene. Integrated with inverse T-t models of low-temperature thermochronological data, the burial history indicates a four-stage thermal evolution of the WL Formation in the Changning shale-gas field: Early Mature from the middle Silurian to middle Permian, Middle Mature from the late Permian to Late Triassic, Late Mature from the Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, and Over mature since the middle Cretaceous, reaching a maximum burial depth of-6000 m and maximum temperature of 190-200 degrees C at ca. 70-80 Ma. This evolution further suggests that a normal hydrostatic pressure index dominated the WL Formations in the Paleozoic. The gas generation and pressure index, however, have substantially increased since the Late Jurassic, particularly from the Early to middle Cretaceous, with a maximum pressure index of 2.1, which is indicative of the main shale gas accumulation and enrichment period in the WL Formation. Post-gas-generation structural deformation, uplift, and exhumation had a significant impact on shale gas enrichment, mainly through their influence on shale gas preservation. This suggests some relationships among the higher pressure coefficient of the WL Formation, the higher productivity and total gas content of the WL Formation, a weaker post-gas-generation structural deformation, and a weaker uplift, as indicated by the erosion and burial depth across the Changning shale gas field. Due to a significantly stronger cooling and uplift that occurred the in Late Cenozoic across the western Changning area, the pressure index decreased rapidly from similar to 2.0 to 1.0 with a normal pressure condition, indicating the destruction of the reservation condition in the WL Formation.

VL  - 14

AB  - We can understand the ecology and evolution of plant thermal niches through thermal performance curves (TPCs), which are unimodal, continuous reaction norms of performance across a temperature gradient. Though there are numerous plant TPC studies, plants remain under-represented in syntheses of TPCs. Further, few studies quantify plant TPCs from fitness-based measurements (i.e. growth, survival and reproduction at the individual level and above), limiting our ability to draw conclusions from the existing literature about plant thermal adaptation. We describe recent plant studies that use a fitness-based TPC approach to test fundamental ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, some of which have uncovered key drivers of climate change responses. Then, we outline three conceptual questions in ecology and evolutionary biology for future plant TPC studies: (i) Do populations and species harbour genetic variation for TPCs? (ii) Do plant TPCs exhibit plastic responses to abiotic and biotic factors? (iii) Do fitness-based TPCs scale up to population-level thermal niches? Moving forward, plant ecologists and evolutionary biologists can capitalize on TPCs to understand how plasticity and adaptation will influence plant responses to climate change. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Despite intensive research activity within the area of climate change, substantial knowledge gaps still remain regarding the potential future impacts of climate change on human health. A key shortcoming in the scientific understanding of these impacts is the lack of studies that are conducted in a coordinated and consistent fashion, producing directly comparable outputs. This Viewpoint discusses and exemplifies a bottom-up initiative generating new research evidence in a more coordinated and consistent way compared with previous efforts. It describes one of the largest model comparisons of projected health impacts due to climate change, so far. Yet, the included studies constitute only a selection of health impacts in a variety of geographical locations, and are therefore not a comprehensive assessment of all possible impact pathways and potential consequences. The new findings of these studies shed light on the complex and multidirectional impacts of climate change on health, where impacts can be both adverse or beneficial. However, the adverse impacts dominate overall, especially in the scenarios with more greenhouse gas forcing. Overall, the future population at risk of disease and incidence rates are predicted to increase substantially, but in a highly location-specific and disease-specific fashion. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation can substantially reduce risk and resultant morbidity and mortality. The potential positive impact of adaptation has not been included in the models applied, and thus remains a major source of uncertainty. This bottom-up initiative lays out a research strategy that brings more meaningful research outputs and calls for greater coordination of research initiatives across the health community. © 2021 The Author(s).

VL  - 44

SP  - 289-298
AB  - Introductions of Coregonus artedi from Lake Superior into several inland lakes in Minnesota in the 1920s and 1930s constituted a natural experiment of how phenotypic plasticity and adaptation can shape cisco diversity. Genetic data were consistent with a Lake Superior origin for the introduced populations, which resembled contemporary Lake Superior cisco in possessing large, elongated bodies and short fins, and in maturing at older ages. Native inland cisco had smaller, deeper bodies, longer fins, and matured at younger ages. Introduced populations also retained the Lake Superior characteristic of inhabiting the upper portion of the water column and showed a high degree of planktivory. However, introduced cisco exhibited small but measurable shifts in body shape and fin lengths toward native inland forms. These morphological shifts were possibly associated with greater benthivory after translocation. Assuming that native inland populations were well adapted to inland lakes and that selective pressures on native and introduced populations were similar, these results indicated that substantial further phenotypic, behavioral, and life history change is required before the introduced populations become similarly adapted to their new environments. The findings suggest that anthropogenic environmental alterations such as climate change and eutrophication might occur at a faster pace than adaptive evolutionary responses. In addition, translocated Great Lakes coregonines could possibly maintain traits exhibited in their source lake, and may not fully restore ecological functions of extirpated populations. © 2017 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought the entire world to a near lockdown. Having infected more than 6,54,08,787 people and claiming more than 15,09,743 lives as on 4th December 2020 it has made mankind to rethink over its claim of being highly advanced. Although we have come a long way both in terms of technology and medical advancements from 1918’s Spanish flu to latest novel coronavirus outbreak, still somehow we feel ourselves somewhat as helpless as we were back in 1918. There still remains a gap in understanding the full mechanism of the infection cycle of zoonotic diseases and their intensive relationships with their reservoir hosts. In this review we will be discussing why it’s still a challenge for us to fight these viral diseases and also how out of nowhere these diseases appear claiming millions of life every now and then. Also, we will try to understand how the reservoir ‘bats’ escape virulence. © RJPT All right reserved.

Thereby, the h-BN nanomesh serves as a chemically inert eggbox-like template for clusters with a narrow size distribution. The thermal evolution of ethylene is investigated by synchrotron-based high-resolution in situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on the Pt nanoclusters. We compare our results with data on Pt(111) and Pt(355). Interestingly, the Pt nanoclusters and Pt(355) behave very similarly. Both open a new reaction pathway via vinylidene in addition to the route via ethylidyne known for Pt(111). Due to the importance of coking in ethylene dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts, we also studied C2H4 adsorption and decomposition on carbon precovered Pt nanoclusters. While the amount of adsorbed ethylene decreases linearly with the carbon coverage, we found that edge sites are more affected than facet sites and that the vinylidene reaction pathway is effectively suppressed by carbon residues.

AB  - Cities are often hotter and drier compared with nearby undeveloped areas, but how organisms respond to these multifarious stressors associated with urban heat islands is largely unknown. Terrestrial isopods are especially susceptible to temperature and aridity stress as they have retained highly permeable gills from their aquatic ancestors. We performed a two temperature common garden experiment with urban and rural populations of the terrestrial isopod, Oniscus asellus, to uncover evidence for plastic and evolutionary responses to urban heat islands. We focused on physiological tolerance traits including tolerance of heat, cold, and desiccation. We also examined body size responses to urban heat islands, as size can modulate physiological tolerances. We found that different mechanisms underlie responses to urban heat islands. While evidence suggests urban isopods may have evolved higher heat tolerance, urban and rural isopods had statistically indistinguishable cold and desiccation tolerances. In both populations, plasticity to warmer rearing temperature diminished cold tolerance. Although field-collected urban and rural isopods were the same size, rearing temperature positively affected body size. Finally, larger size improved desiccation tolerance, which itself was influenced by rearing temperature. Our study demonstrates how multifarious changes associated with urban heat islands will not necessarily contribute to contemporary evolution in each of the corresponding physiological traits. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 49
SP  - 15-21
AB  - Climate change facilitates biological invasions globally. Predicting potential distribution shifts of invasive crop pests under climate change is essential for global food security in the context of ongoing world population increase. However, existing predictions often omit the capacity of crop pests to mitigate the impacts of climate change by using microclimates, as well as through thermoregulation, life history variation and evolutionary responses. Microclimates provide refugia buffering climate extremes. Thermoregulation and life history variation can reduce the effects of diurnal and seasonal temperature variability. Evolutionary responses allow insects to adapt to long-term climate change. Neglecting these ecological processes may lead to overestimations in the negative impacts of climate change on invasive pests whereas in turn cause underestimations in their range expansions. To improve model predictions, we need to incorporate the fine-scale microclimates experienced by invasive crop pests and the mitigation responses of insects to climate change into species distribution models. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Distribution and evolution of thermal stress during multi-laser powder bed fusion of Ti-6Al-4 V alloy
VL  - 284
AB  - The multi-laser powder bed fusion (MLPBF) has attracted more and more attention due to high productivity and large area. However, thus far the distribution and evolution of the thermal stress with different laser beams are rarely investigated. A block-by-block numerical model considering the laser scanning strategy and part-scale was developed to study the residual stress in MLPBF. As the laser beam number increased from 1 to 4, the residual stress at the top surface of the part decreased but the internal residual stress at the bottom center of the part significantly increased. The average and maximum stresses increased with the laser beam number, indicating that the cracks were more likely to occur with an increase of the laser beam number. The residual stress in the multi-laser overlap area was reduced, resulting in an important influence on the residual stress distribution. More frequent tension-compression stress transitions occurred during MLPBF, and the compressive stress along the deposition direction had a more important influence when the laser beam number increased. The simulated results agreed well with the experimental data. The results of the study provide a significant understanding of the residual stress and are helpful to the process optimization in MLPBF. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Replicated latitudinal clines in reproductive traits of European and North American yellow dung flies
VL  - 127
IS  - 11
SP  - 1619-1632
AB  - Geographic variation in phenotypic traits is commonly correlated with spatial variation in the environment, e.g. seasonality and mean temperature, providing evidence that natural selection generates such patterns. In particular, both body size and egg size of ectothermic animals are commonly larger in northern climates, and temperature induces plastic responses in both traits. Size-independent egg quality can also vary with latitude, though this is rarely investigated. For the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae) we investigated whether there are latitudinal clines in reproductive traits (clutch size, egg size and egg composition), whether these clines are due to variation in body and/or egg size, and whether such clines replicate across independent experiments performed on different continents (North America and Europe). Egg size generally increased with latitude (especially in Europe), an effect largely explained by body size of the mother, while clutch size did not; overall reproductive effort thus increased with latitude. Both the absolute and relative (correcting for egg size) amount of egg protein increased with latitude, egg glycogen decreased with latitude, while latitudinal trends for egg lipids and total egg energy content were complex and non-linear. Altitude sometimes showed relationships analogous to those of latitude (egg proteins and glycogen) but occasionally opposite (egg size), possibly because latitude and altitude are negatively related among populations of this cold-adapted species. There was no evidence of a tradeoff between egg size and number across latitudinal populations; if anything, the relationship was positive. All traits, including body and egg size, varied with rearing temperature (12°C, 18°C, 24°C), generally following the temperature–size rule. Clines based on common garden rearing, thus reflecting genetic differentiation, were qualitatively but not always quantitatively consistent between continents, and were similar across rearing temperatures, suggesting they evolved due to natural selection, although the concrete selective mechanisms involved require further study. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Convergent Adaptation of Ootheca Formation as a Reproductive Strategy in Polyneoptera
VL  - 39
IS  - 3
AB  - Insects have evolved numerous adaptations and colonized diverse terrestrial environments. Several polyneopterans, including dictyopterans (cockroaches and mantids) and locusts, have developed oothecae, but little is known about the molecular mechanism, physiological function, and evolutionary significance of ootheca formation. Here, we demonstrate that the cockroach asymmetric colleterial glands produce vitellogenins, proline-rich protein, and glycine-rich protein as major ootheca structural proteins (OSPs) that undergo sclerotization and melanization for ootheca formation through the cooperative protocatechuic acid pathway and dopachrome and dopaminechrome subpathway. Functionally, OSP sclerotization and melanization prevent eggs from losing water at warm and dry conditions, and thus effectively maintain embryo viability. Dictyopterans and locusts convergently evolved vitellogenins, apolipoprotein D, and laminins as OSPs, whereas within Dictyoptera, cockroaches and mantids independently developed glycine-rich protein and fibroins as OSPs. Highlighting the ecological-evolutionary importance, convergent ootheca formation represents a successful reproductive strategy in Polyneoptera that promoted the radiation and establishment of cockroaches, mantids, and locusts. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Integrating genetics, physiology and morphology to study desert adaptation in a lizard species
VL  - 91
IS  - 6
SP  - 1148-1162
AB  - Integration of multiple approaches is key to understand the evolutionary processes of local adaptation and speciation. Reptiles have successfully colonized desert environments, that is, extreme and arid conditions that constitute a strong selective pressure on organisms. Here, we studied genomic, physiological and morphological variations of the lizard Liolaemus fuscus to detect adaptations to the Atacama Desert. By comparing populations of L. fuscus inhabiting the Atacama Desert with populations from the Mediterranean forests from central Chile, we aimed at characterizing features related to desert adaptation. We combined ddRAD sequencing with physiological (evaporative water loss, metabolic rate and selected temperature) and morphological (linear and geometric morphometrics) measurements. We integrated the genomic and phenotypic data using redundancy analyses. Results showed strong genetic divergence, along with a high number of fixed loci between desert and forest populations. Analyses detected 110 fixed and 30 outlier loci located within genes, from which 43 were in coding regions, and 12 presented non-synonymous mutations. The candidate genes were associated with cellular membrane and development. Desert lizards presented lower evaporative water loss than those from the forest. Morphological data showed that desert lizards had smaller body size, different allometry, larger eyeballs and more dorsoventrally compressed heads. Our results suggest incipient speciation between desert and forest populations. The adaptive signal must be cautiously interpreted since genetic drift could also contribute to the divergence pattern. Nonetheless, we propose water and resource availability, and changes in habitat structure, as the most relevant challenges for desert reptiles. This study provides insights of the mechanisms that allow speciation as well as desert adaptation in reptiles at multiple levels, and highlights the benefit of integrating independent evidence. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

AB  - The book compiles the latest studies on microorganisms thriving in extreme conditions. Microbes have been found in extremely high and low temperatures, highly acidic to saline conditions, from deserts to the Dead sea, from hot-springs to underwater hydrothermal vents- the diversity is incredible. The various chapters highlight the microbial life and describe the mechanisms of tolerance to these harsh conditions, and show how an understanding of these phenomena can help us exploit the microbes in biotechnology. The theme of the book is highly significant since life in these environments can give vital clues about the origin and evolution of life on earth, as a lot of these conditions simulate the environment present billions of years ago. Additionally, the study of adaptation and survival of organisms in such environments can be important for finding life on other planets. This book shall be useful for students, researchers and course instructors interested in evolution, microbial adaptations and ecology in varied environments. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

TI  - The genomes of two Eutrema species provide insight into plant adaptation to high altitudes
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 307-315
AB  - Eutrema is a genus in the Brassicaceae, which includes species of scientific and economic importance. Many Eutrema species are montane and/or alpine species that arose very recently, making them ideal candidates for comparative studies to understand both ecological speciation and high-altitude adaptation in plants. Here we provide de novo whole-genome assemblies for a pair of recently diverged perennials with contrasting altitude preferences, the high-altitude E. heterophyllum from the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its lowland congener E. yunnanense. The two assembled genomes are 350Mb and 412Mb, respectively, with 29,606 and 28,881 predicted genes. Comparative analysis of the two species revealed contrasting demographic trajectories and evolution of gene families. Gene family expansions shared between E. heterophyllum and other alpine species were identified, including the disease resistance R genes (NBS-LRRs or NLRs). Genes that are duplicated specifically in the high-altitude E. heterophyllum are involved mainly in reproduction, DNA damage repair and cold tolerance. The two Eutrema genomes reported here constitute important genetic resources for diverse studies, including the evolution of the genus Eutrema, of the Brassicaceae as a whole and of alpine plants across the world. © The Author 2017.

VL  - 88
IS  - 3
SP  - 473-483
AB  - Most studies of climate change impacts focus on the effects of summer temperatures, which can immediately impact fitness of breeders, but winter temperatures are expected to have a greater impact on development and growth of animals with long-lasting consequences. Exposure to warmer temperatures can increase cellular oxidative damage in ectotherms. Yet, it is unknown whether thermal stress during early life has prolonged effects on oxidative status during adulthood. In an experiment using F1 fish originated from a wild three-spined stickleback population at the southern edge of its European distribution, we examined whether experimental thermal conditions experienced in winter had carry-over effects on oxidative status and telomere length, a marker of accumulated stress, in the soma and germline during adulthood. For this, oxidative DNA damage, enzymatic antioxidant activities and telomere length were measured three months after the termination of the temperature manipulation. In addition, we tested whether such delayed effects, if any, were due to individuals’ compensatory growth after experiencing unfavourable growth conditions in winter. Warm acclimation during winter induced increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in muscle and sperm and increased enzymatic antioxidant defences in muscle during the breeding season. Telomere length of adult fish was not influenced by thermal conditions experienced during early life. Winter temperature manipulation influenced fish to alter the temporal pattern of growth trajectories across the juvenile and adult stages. Fish reared in warm winter conditions grew at a slower rate than the controls during the period of temperature manipulation then accelerated body mass gain to catch up during the breeding season. Faster somatic growth during the breeding season incurred a higher cost in terms of oxidative damage in the warm-treated individuals. For the first time, we experimentally show the long-lasting detrimental effects of thermal stress on and the positive link between catch-up growth and oxidative DNA damage in the soma and germline. Winter temperature increases due to climate change can reduce fertility and survival of fish by inducing catch-up growth. The detrimental effects of winter climate change may accumulate across generations through the pre-mutagenic DNA damage in the germline. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Simultaneous inversion of fractal morphology and particle size distribution of soot aggregate based on light scattering intensity
VL  - 46
IS  - 5
SP  - 925-932
AB  - The use of light scattering signals to achieve the simultaneous inversion of the fractal morphology and particle size distribution parameters of soot aggregates have important application value in flame radiation heat transfer simulation and pollution control. The direct model of inversion is based on the Rayleigh-Debye-Gans Polydisperse Fractal Approximation (RDG-PFA) light scattering theory. Two signal schemes were investigated: multi-angle scattering, multi-angle scattering and collimated transmittance. Before the inversion, by comparing the residual fitness value distributions of the two signal schemes, it is found that the simultaneous use of scattering and transmission signals effectively reduces the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. The inversion process is based on the Covariance Matrix Adaptive Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, which has a strong local search capability and provides a guarantee for fast and stable inversion of each target parameter. The final inversion results demonstrate the feasibility and universality of the method in a large search space. And it is also proved that the combination of multi-angle scattering and collimated transmittance effectively improves the inversion accuracy of the target parameters. © 2020, Editorial Board of JBUAA.

VL  - 10
SP  - 39-62
AB  - Antarctic notothenioid fishes are the classic example of vertebrate adaptive radiation in a marine environment. Notothenioids diversified from a single common ancestor ∼22 Mya to between 120 and 140 species today, and they represent ∼90% of fish biomass on the continental shelf of Antarctica. As they diversified in the cold Southern Ocean, notothenioids evolved numerous traits, including osteopenia, anemia, cardiomegaly, dyslipidemia, and aglomerular kidneys, that are beneficial or tolerated in their environment but are pathological in humans. Thus, notothenioids are models for understanding adaptive radiations, physiological and biochemical adaptations to extreme environments, and genetic mechanisms of human disease. Since 2014, 16 notothenioid genomes have been published, which enable a first-pass holistic analysis of the notothenioid radiation and the genetic underpinnings of novel notothenioid traits. Here, we review the notothenioid radiation from a genomic perspective and integrate our insights with recent observations from other fish radiations. © 2022 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lateral hydrological connectivity (LHC) maintains the high biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the river–floodplain system. We investigated the changes in the taxonomic and functional composition of fish assemblages in the lateral connection channel between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, China, during the dry and wet seasons and which factors drive the changes. The results indicated more lake-residence species and fewer river–lake species in the channel during the wet season than the dry season, leading to significant seasonal differences in taxonomic compositions and trait patterns. Water temperature, water level and fish migration influenced fish assemblage structures in the channel. Water-level fluctuations that limited food sources and suitable habitats promoted the migration of riverine and lake-residence fish during both seasons. Water temperature and level also significantly influenced species-specific migration. Water temperature influenced the spawning migration of river–lake fish during the wet season. Based on these results, we found temporal species-specific migration dynamics in fish assemblages in the lateral channel that were related to species’ life-history traits. Therefore, we inferred that the temporal–spatial interaction of the fish community in the river–floodplain system is essentially derived from the evolutionary adaption to the monsoon climate. This process is well studied and predictable, and can be beneficial for managing the river–floodplain systems. The invasion risk of the exotic species, including fish and macroinvertebrates, should be assessed before implementing LHC restoration. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Biting rhythm and demographic attributes of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) females from different urbanized settings in Penang Island, Malaysia under uncontrolled laboratory conditions
VL  - 15
IS  - 11
AB  - Urbanization could potentially modify Aedes albopictus’ ecology by changing the dynamics of the species, and affecting their breeding sites due to environmental changes, and thus contribute to dengue outbreaks. Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the biting rhythm, fecundity and longevity of adult female Ae. albopictus in relation to urbanization strata; urban, suburban and rural areas in Penang Island, Malaysia. The experiments were done in comparison to a laboratory strain. Twenty-four hours biting activity of all the mosquito strains showed a clear bimodal biting activity, with morning and evening twilight peaks. The interaction effect between biting time and mosquito strains was not significant. Meanwhile, differences in fecundity among mosquito strains were statistically significant (F (3,442) = 10.559, P < 0.05) with urban areas having higher mean number of eggs (mean = 107.69, standard error = 3.98) than suburban (mean = 94.48, standard error = 5.18), and rural areas (mean = 72.52, standard error = 3.87). Longevity of adult females were significantly higher (F(3,441) = 31.259, P < 0.05) for mosquito strains from urban areas compared to the other strains. These findings would provide crucial information for the planning of control programs in Malaysia, particularly Penang. © 2020 Muhammad et al.

AB  - Microorganisms are highly versatile living beings that have survived nearly 4 billion years of evolutionary change. Microbes have adapted to environmental conditions that range from cold to hot and from anoxic to oxic. Their life forms range from free living to symbiotic. During the harsh environment, bacteria adopt various strategies to acquire multiple systems so as to thrive against adverse conditions. Among them, secreted proteins play a major role and facilitate most of the interactions of the cells with their surrounding environment as well as with neighbouring cells. Bacterial cells secrete the proteins, metabolites and various molecules to the extracellular environments to sustain nutrient depletion conditions, adhesion on substrate (biofilm formation), invasion of host or antagonism, etc. These microbial functions are managed through their secretion system, which are very sophisticated molecular machines that include export/secretion of required proteins or metabolic factors required for the conjugation and survival processes. Hence, the present chapter is aimed to describe the microbes, specially bacteria adapted to survival in extreme temperature. Further, the chapter highlights the secretion system to understand how these bacteria deal with the extreme environments. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.

TI  - Effects of Concentrate Supplementation on Growth Performance, Rumen Fermentation, and Bacterial Community Composition in Grazing Yaks during the Warm Season
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of concentrate supplementation on the growth performance, serum biochemical parameters, rumen fermentation, and bacterial community composition of grazing yaks during the warm season. Eight male yaks (body weight, 123.96 ± 7.43 kg; 3‐years) were randomly allocated to two treatments groups: grazing (n = 4, GY) and concentrate supplement group (n = 4, GYS). Concentrate supplementation increased the average daily gain (ADG) (p < 0.05). Glucose (GLU), total protein (TP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum concentrations were significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.05). Ammonia‐N, MCP: microbial protein, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations were significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.01), whereas the pH and acetate: propionate values were significantly decreased (p < 0.01). The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rumen fluid was significantly higher in the GYS group than in the GY group (p < 0.01). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum, Prevotellaceae_UCG_003, Prevotellaceae_UCG_005, and Ruminococcus_1 were significantly greater in the GY group than in the GYS group (p <0.01). In conclusion, concentrate supplementation improved yaks’ growth potential during the warm season, improved ruminal fermentation, and altered core bacteria abundance. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A simple model for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination explains the temperature sensitivity of embryonic mortality in imperiled reptiles
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-14
AB  - A common reptile conservation strategy involves artificial incubation of embryos and release of hatchlings or juveniles into wild populations. Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in most chelonians, permitting conservation managers to bias sex ratios towards females by incubating embryos at high temperatures, ultimately allowing the introduction of more egg-bearing individuals into populations. Here, we revisit classic sex allocation theory and hypothesize that TSD evolved in some reptile groups (specifically, chelonians and crocodilians) because male fitness is more sensitive to condition (general health, vigor) than female fitness. It follows that males benefit more than females from incubation environments that confer high-quality phenotypes, and hence high-condition individuals. We predict that female-producing temperatures, which comprise relatively high incubation temperatures in chelonians and crocodilians, are relatively stressful for embryos and subsequent life stages. We synthesize data from 28 studies to investigate how constant temperature incubation affects embryonic mortality in chelonians with TSD. We find several lines of evidence suggesting that warm, female-producing temperatures are more stressful than cool, male-producing temperatures. Further, we find some evidence that pivotal temperatures (TPiv, the temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio) may exhibit a correlated evolution with embryonic thermal tolerance. If patterns of temperature-sensitive embryonic mortality are also indicative of chronic thermal stress that occurs post-hatching, then conservation programs may benefit from incubating eggs close to species-specific TPivs, thus avoiding high-temperature incubation. Indeed, our models predict that, on average, a sex ratio of >75% females can generally be achieved by incubating eggs only 1°C above TPiv. Of equal importance, we provide insight into the enigmatic evolution of TSD in chelonians, by providing support to the hypothesis that TSD evolution is related to the quality of the phenotype conferred by incubation temperature, with males produced in high-quality incubation environments. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This paper is focused on solving the sizing optimization problem for the combined heat and power (CHP) microgrid systems. Firstly, multiple optimization objectives are selected in terms of reliability, economy and renewable energy usage to comprehensively assess the system performances. A triangular evaluation model is adopted to combine the chosen objectives and calculate the system fitness. Then, the compulsory constraints are given to ensure the reliable system operation, and the self-adaptive genetic algorithm is developed to implement the optimization process. Finally, a sample system of the CHP microgrid is simulated, which have validated the feasibility of the proposed multiobjective sizing optimization method. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Plasticity of cold hardiness in the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana
VL  - 259
AB  - High latitude insect populations must cope with extreme conditions, particularly low temperatures. Insects use a variety of cold hardiness mechanisms to withstand this temperature stress, and these can drive geographic distributions through overwintering mortality. The degree of cold hardiness can be altered by two evolved responses: phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation. Phenotypic plasticity can occur within or between generations (transgenerational plasticity; TGP), and local adaptation can evolve through directional selection in response to regional climatic differences. We used the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) as a model to explore the role that variable winter temperatures play in inducing two aspects of plasticity in cold hardiness: TGP and local adaptation in phenotypic plasticity. This species is one of the most destructive boreal forest pests in North America, therefore accurately predicting overwintering survival is essential for effective management. While we found no evidence of TGP in cold hardiness, there was a long term fitness cost to larvae that experienced repeated cold exposures. We also found evidence of local adaptation in both seasonal and short-term plasticity of cold hardiness, as our more northerly populations that would experience lower overwintering temperatures had more plastic responses to cold exposure. These findings provide evidence for the importance of phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation when modelling species distributions. © 2021

SP  - 103-109
AB  - A central goal of ecology is to understand what drives the abundance, distribution, and diversity of life, and one process that is shared by all of life on Earth is metabolism. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) posits that temperature and body size impose universal constraints on the flux, storage, and turnover of energy, matter, and information. Thus, principles of chemistry, physics, and biology operating on metabolic processes at lower levels of biological organization (i.e., molecules and cells) constrain organismal performance and give rise to predictable patterns at higher levels (i.e., populations, communities, and ecosystems). MTE can be a powerful framework to project future ecological states from a theoretical basis with a broad empirical domain. Future work should incrementally increase the complexity of the test systems, and further investigate the factors that limit or facilitate the evolution of temperature dependence. Answering this question is critical to achieving a coherent picture of what generates and maintains current and future patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity. In an era of rapid climate change, ecologists must improve our ability to predict changes in the functioning of the ecosystems on which human well-being depends. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Macroevolutionary diversification with limited niche disparity in a species-rich lineage of cold-climate lizards
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Life diversifies via adaptive radiation when natural selection drives the evolution of ecologically distinct species mediated by their access to novel niche space, or via non-adaptive radiation when new species diversify while retaining ancestral niches. However, while cases of adaptive radiation are widely documented, examples of non-adaptively radiating lineages remain rarely observed. A prolific cold-climate lizard radiation from South America (Phymaturus), sister to a hyper-diverse adaptive radiation (Liolaemus), has extensively diversified phylogenetically and geographically, but with exceptionally minimal ecological and life-history diversification. This lineage, therefore, may offer unique opportunities to investigate the non-adaptive basis of diversification, and in combination with Liolaemus, to cover the whole spectrum of modes of diversification predicted by theory, from adaptive to non-adaptive. Using phylogenetic macroevolutionary modelling performed on a newly created 58-species molecular tree, we establish the tempo and mode of diversification in the Phymaturus radiation. Results: Lineage accumulation in Phymaturus opposes a density-dependent (or 'niche-filling') process of diversification. Concurrently, we found that body size diversification is better described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolutionary model, suggesting stabilizing selection as the mechanism underlying niche conservatism (i.e., maintaining two fundamental size peaks), and which has predominantly evolved around two major adaptive peaks on a 'Simpsonian' adaptive landscape. Conclusions: Lineage diversification of the Phymaturus genus does not conform to an adaptive radiation, as it is characterised by a constant rate of species accumulation during the clade's history. Their strict habitat requirements (rocky outcrops), predominantly invariant herbivory, and especially the constant viviparous reproduction across species have likely limited their opportunities for adaptive diversifications throughout novel environments. This mode of diversification contrasts dramatically with its sister lineage Liolaemus, which geographically overlaps with Phymaturus, but exploits all possible microhabitats in these and other bioclimatic areas. Our study contributes importantly to consolidate these lizards (liolaemids) as promising model systems to investigate the entire spectrum of modes of species formations, from the adaptive to the non-adaptive extremes of the continuum. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Numerical-experimental investigation of load paths in DP800 dual phase steel during Nakajima test
VL  - 1960
AB  - Fuel efficiency requirements demand lightweight construction of vehicle body parts. The usage of advanced high strength steels permits a reduction of sheet thickness while still maintaining the overall strength required for crash safety. However, damage, internal defects (voids, inclusions, micro fractures), microstructural defects (varying grain size distribution, precipitates on grain boundaries, anisotropy) and surface defects (micro fractures, grooves) act as a concentration point for stress and consequently as an initiation point for failure both during deep drawing and in service. Considering damage evolution in the design of car body deep drawing processes allows for a further reduction in material usage and therefore body weight. Preliminary research has shown that a modification of load paths in forming processes can help mitigate the effects of damage on the material. This paper investigates the load paths in Nakajima tests of a DP800 dual phase steel to research damage in deep drawing processes. Investigation is done via a finite element model using experimentally validated material data for a DP800 dual phase steel. Numerical simulation allows for the investigation of load paths with respect to stress states, strain rates and temperature evolution, which cannot be easily observed in physical experiments. Stress triaxiality and the Lode parameter are used to describe the stress states. Their evolution during the Nakajima tests serves as an indicator for damage evolution. The large variety of sheet metal forming specific load paths in Nakajima tests allows a comprehensive evaluation of damage for deep drawing. The results of the numerical simulation conducted in this project and further physical experiments will later be used to calibrate a damage model for simulation of deep drawing processes. © 2018 Author(s).

TI  - Little lasting impact of the paleocene-eocene thermal maximum on shallow marine molluscan faunas
VL  - 4
IS  - 9
AB  - Global warming, acidification, and oxygen stress at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) are associated with severe extinction in the deep sea and major biogeographic and ecologic changes in planktonic and terrestrial ecosystems, yet impacts on shallow marine macrofaunas are obscured by the incompleteness of shelf sections. We analyze mollusk assemblages bracketing (but not including) the PETM and find few notable lasting impacts on diversity, turnover, functional ecology, body size, or life history of important clades. Infaunal and chemosymbiotic taxa become more common, and body size and abundance drop in one clade, consistent with hypoxia-driven selection, but within-clade changes are not generalizable across taxa. While an unrecorded transient response is still possible, the long-term evolutionary impact is minimal. Adaptation to already-warm conditions and slow release of CO2 relative to the time scale of ocean mixing likely buffered the impact of PETM climate change on shelf faunas.

TI  - Validation of Potential Reference Genes for Real-Time qPCR Analysis in Pharaoh Ant, Monomorium pharaonis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
VL  - 13
AB  - Ants are highly diverse social insects living in colonies consisted of up to millions of individuals with reproductive division of labors. Due to the interests in disclosing the genetic and epigenetic regulation mechanisms underlying the distinct developmental trajectories between castes and division of labor in colonies, many ant species have recently been established as laboratory models for evolutionary development and social behavior studies. These functional studies often request a precise quantification of the relative gene expression level, which relies on a stably expressed reference genes for normalization. A core set of reliable reference genes for this purpose however has not been established yet in ants. In the present study, we tested the expression patterns and amplification efficiencies of 12 abundantly expressed candidate genes in Monomorium pharaonis, one of the few ant species that are suitable for laboratory rearing and experimentation. We quantified the expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR in seven different conditions: embryo development, sexual development, worker development, adult phenotypes, tissues, and two abiotic manipulative treatments in pharaoh ant. Finally, five genes, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1A), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TATA), tubulin gamma-2 chain-like (TBLg2), heat shock protein 67B2-like (HSP67) were found to be the most stable reference genes across seven conditions. We also identified the most stable reference genes applicable for each distinct condition and the optimal number of reference genes entailed were evaluated. Our study validates reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis which lays the foundation for future studies in pharaoh ant. Copyright © 2022 Ding, Gao, Chen, Zhao, Zhang and Liu.

TI  - N-6-methyldeoxyadenine and histone methylation mediate transgenerational survival advantages induced by hormetic heat stress
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Environmental stress can induce survival advantages that are passed down to multiple generations, representing an evolutionarily advantageous adaptation at the species level. Using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we found that heat shock experienced in either parent could increase the longevity of themselves and up to the fifth generation of descendants. Mechanistic analyses revealed that transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, heat shock factor HSF-1, and nuclear receptor DAF-12/FXR functioned transgenerationally to implement the hormetic stress response. Histone H3K9me3 methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 and DNA N6-methyl methyltransferase DAMT-1 participated in transmitting high-temperature memory across generations. H3K9me3 and N6-methyladenine could mark heat stress response genes and promote their transcription in progeny to extend life span. We dissected the mechanisms responsible for implementing and transmitting environmental memories in descendants from heat-shocked parents and demonstrated that hormetic stress caused survival benefits could be transmitted to multiple generations through H3K9me3 and N6-mA modifications.

TI  - Transcriptional reprogramming caused by cold acclimation in Meloidogyne incognita eggs
VL  - 43
IS  - 5
SP  - 533-541
AB  - Background: Egg hatching in Meloidogyne incognita is a highly regulated developmental event and is strictly correlated with temperature. It has been demonstrated that exposure of M. incognita eggs to low temperature seriously affects their embryonic development. On the other hand, clear evidence has shown that M. incognita is able to overwinter at subzero soil temperatures in certain open fields. Therefore, subtle physiological and genetic adaptations may occur in M. incognita to minimize freezing injuries. Objective: A growing body of evidence indicates that cold acclimation plays a large role in an individual organism’s ability to cope with freezing-induced cellular damage. Given the decreasing temperatures in late autumn or early winter, we hypothesize that natural cold acclimation occurring during these periods may assist M. incognita in overwintering. Methods: Transcriptomic analysis and functional enrichment analyses were used to identify and annotate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in acclimated eggs. The expression of DEGs involved in signal transduction and protein assembly was subsequently validated by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Relatively long-term preacclimation at 4 °C significantly accelerated the hatching of M. incognita eggs that were subjected to freezing at − 1 °C. Using a transcriptomic approach, we further identified 686 and 460 up- and downregulated transcripts, respectively, in pre-cold-acclimated eggs. Additionally, we used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology annotations for functional enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Conclusion: The phenomenon in which M. incognita safely overwinters at subzero soil temperatures in certain areas may be attributed to the natural cold acclimation occurring in late autumn. Here, the identification of DEGs between acclimated and nonacclimated eggs will provide us with promising directions for future studies on the mechanisms of M. incognita freezing tolerance. © 2021, The Genetics Society of Korea.

VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 482-493
AB  - The precision and the extent of behavioral thermoregulation are likely to provide fitness benefits to ectotherms. Yet the factors driving variation in selected or preferred body temperature (Tset) and its usefulness as a proxy for optimal physiological temperature (Topt) are still debated. Although Tset is often conserved among closely related species, substantial variation at the individual, population and species level has also been reported. However, the repeatability (calculated as the intra-class correlation coefficient) of Tset is generally low. One factor that influences Tset is feeding status, with fed reptiles typically showing higher Tset, a process thought to aid meal digestion. Here, using experiments simulating realistic feeding and fasting regimes in Agama atra, a heliothermic lizard from southern Africa, we test if Tset and its repeatability under these 2 states significantly differ. Daily Tset ranged from 33.7 to 38.4 °C, with a mean (± SE) of 36.7 ± 0.1 °C for fed and 36.6 ± 0.1 °C for unfed individuals. Comparisons of repeatability showed that females tend to be more consistent in the selection of body temperature than males, but not significantly so regardless of feeding status. We report some of the highest repeatability estimates of Tset to date (full range: 0.229–0.642), and that the weak positive effects of feeding status on Tset did not increase its repeatability. In conclusion, one of the major prerequisites for natural selection, consistent among-individual variation, is present, making the adaptive significance of Tset considerably more plausible. © 2018 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is an important bioleaching bacterium, widely used in leaching, recovery of low-grade metals and environmental bioremediation. In bio-metallurgy industry, fluoride existing in some hard rock uranium deposits in south China severely affects the bacteria viability and inhibit leaching reproduction. In this study, the flr-4 gene that has strong resistance to fluorine ion in Caenorhabditis elegans, was cloned into pET30a vector and expressed in E. coli BL21. the ability of fluoride resistance in E. coli was increased obviously. To increase the fluorideresistance of bioleaching bacterium T. ferrooxidans strain 1 (T.f1), the flr-4 shuttle recombinant plasmid pJRD215-flr-4 was constructed and transferred into T.f1 by conjugation. pJRD215-flr-4 was stable in T.f1 with more than 70% retention after 50 generations. Recombinant T.f1 was tolerant to fluorine ions and grew well under fluoride (F-) stress especially at F- concentrations ranging from 10 mg/L to 60 mg/L. © 2018 Yun-Chang Cao, Hong-Bo Wen, 1Nan Hu, Yong-Dong Wang, Guang-Yue Li and De-Xin Ding.

AB  - Using two sibling species, Drosophila jambulina and D. punjabiensis, interspecific crossabilty were examined in natural as well as laboratory conditions. Collection record showed that hybrids are found only in specific hybrid zone having higher temperature variation suggesting an increased fitness in hybrid zone. In laboratory condition, plastic effects on thermo-tolerance traits (heat knockdown and cold recovery) were investigated by growing parental species [D. jambulina and D. punjabiensis at four growth temperatures (17 to 28 °C)] and their hybrids at six growth temperatures (15 to 31 °C). Hybrids showed higher plasticity for melanization (~ 58%) and thermo-tolerance traits (CV = 39.14 for heat resistance and CV = 43.15 for cold resistance) at different growth temperatures. Acclimation effects were also significant in hybrids (F = 47.89 for heat resistance and F = 56.87 for cold resistance) suggesting an adaptive potential. Results of this study imply that hybridization increases genetic variation which in turn leads to adaptation to new environments. The genetic data obtained in this study would be useful not only for testing basic predictions about evolution but also for understanding the evolutionary significance of hybrids. © 2019, © 2019 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.

VL  - 10

SP  - 4299-4314
AB  - Turtles are iconic reptiles that inhabit a range of ecosystems from oceans to deserts and climates from the tropics to northern temperate regions. Yet, we have little understanding of the genetic adaptations that allow turtles to survive and reproduce in such diverse environments. Common snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina, are an ideal model species for studying adaptation to climate because they are widely distributed from tropical to northern temperate zones in North America. They are also easy to maintain and breed in captivity and produce large clutch sizes, which makes them amenable to quantitative genetic and molecular genetic studies of traits like temperature-dependent sex determination. We therefore established a captive breeding colony and sequenced DNA from one female using both short and long reads. After trimming and filtering, we had 209.51Gb of Illumina reads, 25.72Gb of PacBio reads, and 21.72 Gb of Nanopore reads. The assembled genome was 2.258 Gb in size and had 13,224 scaffolds with an N50 of 5.59Mb. The longest scaffold was 27.24Mb. BUSCO analysis revealed 97.4% of core vertebrate genes in the genome. We identified 3.27 million SNPs in the reference turtle, which indicates a relatively high level of individual heterozygosity. We assembled the transcriptome using RNA-Seq data and used gene prediction software to produce 22,812 models of protein coding genes. The quality and contiguity of the snapping turtle genome is similar to or better than most published reptile genomes. The genome and genetic variants identified here provide a foundation for future studies of adaptation to climate. Copyright © 2020 Das et al.

VL  - 11

AB  - The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that belongs to the Lactobacillaceae family is classified into fifteen different genera. Some LAB, including the Lactobacillus casei, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. acidophilus, Lb. fermentum, Lb. reuteri, Lb. sakei, and Lb. plantarum, are recognized worldwide as probiotics. International agencies such as the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization have defined probiotics as "living microorganisms of which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host." LAB selection as probiotics must include criteria such as safety for human consumption, stability against acid and bile conditions, and the capacity to colonize the human gastrointestinal tract. Probiotic microorganisms have been associated with improvements in the host's health, which has stimulated the consumption of LAB-added functional foods. There are some concerns associated with probiotics survival during manufacturing, storage, and specific preparation processes for the final product. Different approaches have been studied in order to increase LAB feasibilty in meat products. Microencapsulation could be employed as an alternative since it is a LAB protective method consisting of isolating the microorganism to obtain spherical-shaped and micrometer-sized products, in which a membrane shields the LAB. The probiotics ought to survive and dominate other microorganisms present in the food product, evidencing the use of microencapsulation for cellular viability increase. The probiotics used in fermented meat products are primarily associated with salami, which differs in terms of raw material composition, ripening time, appearance, and flavor. Fermented meat products encounter some barriers such as pH, water activity, lower sugars content, temperature, and preparation form limitations. On the other hand, the instinctive search for better a quality of life demands practical and functional foods and the added value is imperative to make a difference in the meat food industry. In this context, microorganisms are added to food aiming at increasing its properties, creating new functional foods capable to promote healthy benefits to the host. This chapter focused on the microencapsulated probiotic LAB potentials and their application in fermented meat products. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

SP  - 2213-2218
AB  - Thermal unfolding of proteins is used extensively in screening of drug candidates because molecular interactions with ligands and substrates affect strongly protein stability, transition temperature, and cooperativity. We use synchrotron radiation circular dichroism to monitor the thermal evolution of secondary structure in proteins as they approach the melting point and the impact of substrate on their thermal behavior. Using Landau free energy expansion, we quantify transition strength and proximity to a critical point through the relative separation τ + between the transition temperature Tm and the spinodal T+, obtained from the equation of state. The weakest transition was observed in lysozyme with τ + = -0.0167 followed by holo albumin with τ + = -0.0208 with the strongest transition in monomeric apo albumin τ + = -0.0242. A structural transition at 45 °C in apo albumin leads to a noncooperative melt with τ + = -0.00532 and amyloidogenic increase in beta content. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

Females were maintained in captivity from early pregnancy under thermal environments differing in basking opportunity (low, mid and high regimes). Thermal regime during pregnancy had little influence on maternal behaviours, including basking behaviour prior to birth and the duration of, and site selection for, labour. The majority of births (78%) occurred in the open and warm areas. Most females (61%; n = 102 births, n = 36 females) aided offspring post-birth by biting them free of the enclosing extra-embryonic membrane. Some females from the low regime consumed non-viable offspring, but whether this is a consistent difference among females held under different basking regimes requires further study. Many females (c. 79%) also exhibited a brief transient decrease in control of hind-limbs post-birth. Further studies on other squamates are recommended to shed light on the evolutionary history and possible conservation consequences of maternal behaviour during parturition. © 2018, © 2018 The Royal Society of New Zealand.

TI  - The integrative conjugative element clc (ICEclc) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa JB2
VL  - 9
AB  - Integrative conjugative elements (ICE) are a diverse group of chromosomally integrated, self-transmissible mobile genetic elements (MGE) that are active in shaping the functions of bacteria and bacterial communities. Each type of ICE carries a characteristic set of core genes encoding functions essential for maintenance and self-transmission, and cargo genes that endow on hosts phenotypes beneficial for niche adaptation. An important area to which ICE can contribute beneficial functions is the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds. In the biodegradation realm, the best-characterized ICE is ICEclc, which carries cargo genes encoding for ortho-cleavage of chlorocatechols (clc genes) and aminophenol metabolism (amn genes). The element was originally identified in the 3-chlorobenzoate-degrader Pseudomonas knackmussii B13, and the closest relative is a nearly identical element in Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (designated ICEclc-B13 and ICEclc-LB400, respectively). In the present report, genome sequencing of the o-chlorobenzoate degrader Pseudomonas aeruginosa JB2 was used to identify a new member of the ICEclc family, ICEclc-JB2. The cargo of ICEclc-JB2 differs from that of ICEclc-B13 and ICEclc-LB400 in consisting of a unique combination of genes that encode for the utilization of o-halobenzoates and o-hydroxybenzoate as growth substrates (ohb genes and hyb genes, respectively) and which are duplicated in a tandem repeat. Also, ICEclc-JB2 lacks an operon of regulatory genes (tciR-marR-mfsR) that is present in the other two ICEclc, and which controls excision from the host. Thus, the mechanisms regulating intracellular behavior of ICEclc-JB2 may differ from that of its close relatives. The entire tandem repeat in ICEclc-JB2 can excise independently from the element in a process apparently involving transposases/insertion sequence associated with the repeats. Excision of the repeats removes important niche adaptation genes from ICEclc-JB2, rendering it less beneficial to the host. However, the reduced version of ICEclc-JB2 could now acquire new genes that might be beneficial to a future host and, consequently, to the survival of ICEclc-JB2. Collectively, the present identification and characterization of ICEclc-JB2 provides insights into roles of MGE in bacterial niche adaptation and the evolution of catabolic pathways for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds. © 2018 Obi, Vayla, de Gannes, Berres, Walker, Pavelec, Hyman and Hickey.

TI  - Sexual selection, environmental robustness, and evolutionary demography of maladapted populations: A test using experimental evolution in seed beetles
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
SP  - 1371-1384
AB  - Whether sexual selection impedes or aids adaptation has become an outstanding question in times of rapid environmental change and parallels the debate about how the evolution of individual traits impacts on population dynamics. The net effect of sexual selection on population viability results from a balance between genetic benefits of “good-genes” effects and costs of sexual conflict. Depending on how these facets of sexual selection are affected under environmental change, extinction of maladapted populations could be either avoided or accelerated. Here, we evolved seed beetles under three alternative mating regimes to disentangle the contributions of sexual selection, fecundity selection, and male–female coevolution to individual reproductive success and population fitness. We compared these contributions between the ancestral environment and two stressful environments (elevated temperature and a host plant shift). We found evidence that sexual selection on males had positive genetic effects on female fitness components across environments, supporting good-genes sexual selection. Interestingly, however, when males evolved under sexual selection with fecundity selection removed, they became more robust to both temperature and host plant stress compared to their conspecific females and males from the other evolution regimes that applied fecundity selection. We quantified the population-level consequences of this sex-specific adaptation and found evidence that the cost of sociosexual interactions in terms of reduced offspring production was higher in the regime applying only sexual selection to males. Moreover, the cost tended to be more pronounced at the elevated temperature to which males from the regime were more robust compared to their conspecific females. These results illustrate the tension between individual-level adaptation and population-level viability in sexually reproducing species and suggest that the relative efficacies of sexual selection and fecundity selection can cause inherent sex differences in environmental robustness that may impact demography of maladapted populations. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Hydrodynamic effects of the caudal fin shape of fish in carangiform undulatory swimming
VL  - 236
IS  - 12
SP  - 6385-6394
AB  - As an important structure for generating thrust, the shapes of fish tails have adaptively evolved to achieve great swimming performance through natural selection over hundreds of millions of years. The particular optimal tail shape of fish is not universal for all situations but significantly varies with other factors, such as undulatory kinematics. In this study, using a sharp-interface immersed boundary method with a self-propelled model, we investigated the hydrodynamic performance of swimmers that equipped with three different caudal fins in a common undulatory mode, carangiform locomotion, to determine the optimal shape. The three caudal fins tested are as follows: a round fin emulating that of snakehead fish (channidae), an indented fin emulating that of saithe (Pollachius virens), and a lunate fin emulating that of tuna (Thunnus thynnus). At the regular undulating amplitude A = 0.1 L at the tail tip (L is the body length), the swimmer with the indented tail achieves the highest speed U = 1.45 L/s with a relatively high quasi-propulsive efficiency of ηq = 0.324; at a higher undulating amplitude A = 0.15 L, the indented tail swimmer achieves slightly lower speed than the lunate fin swimmer, who has the highest speed (2.06 L/s vs. 2.07 L/s), but the efficiency of the former is higher than that of the latter. Therefore, the indented fin is believed to perform the best among the three fins tested regarding carangiform undulatory swimming. This finding is consistent with observations made on fish in nature, for example, carangiform swimming fish that have been evolving for hundreds of millions of years have a caudal fin similar to the indented caudal fin in the current study. © IMechE 2022.

TI  - Noncoding Variation and Transcriptional Plasticity Promote Thermal Adaptation in Oysters by Altering Energy Metabolism
VL  - 38
IS  - 11
SP  - 5144-5155
AB  - Genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity are both important to adaptive evolution. However, how they act together on particular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we integrated phenotypic, genomic, and transcriptomic data from two allopatric but closely related congeneric oyster species, Crassostrea angulata from southern/warm environments and Crassostrea gigas from northern/cold environments, to investigate the roles of genetic divergence and plasticity in thermal adaptation. Reciprocal transplantation experiments showed that both species had higher fitness in their native habitats than in nonnative environments, indicating strong adaptive divergence. The southern species evolved higher transcriptional plasticity, and the plasticity was adaptive, suggesting that increased plasticity is important for thermal adaptation to warm climates. Genome-wide comparisons between the two species revealed that genes under selection tended to respond to environmental changes and showed higher sequence divergence in noncoding regions. All genes under selection and related to energy metabolism exhibited habitat-specific expression with genes involved in ATP production and lipid catabolism highly expressed in warm/southern habitats, and genes involved in ATP consumption and lipid synthesis were highly expressed in cold/northern habitats. The gene for acyl-CoA desaturase, a key enzyme for lipid synthesis, showed strong selective sweep in the upstream noncoding region and lower transcription in the southern species. These results were further supported by the lower free fatty acid (FFA) but higher ATP content in southern species and habitat, pointing to significance of ATP/FFA trade-off. Our findings provide evidence that noncoding variation and transcriptional plasticity play important roles in shaping energy metabolism for thermal adaptation in oysters. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - A simple finite element model to study the effect of plasma plume expansion on the nanosecond pulsed laser ablation of aluminum
VL  - 125
IS  - 9
AB  - In this paper, a simple model was proposed using finite element analysis (FEA) with a commercial FEA software ABAQUS to simulate the two-dimensional (2-D) laser heat transfer in an aluminum material. Without relying on the conventional hydrodynamic model, the proposed model not only predicts the evolutions of the temperature field and ablation profiles in the target material, but also provides an estimation on the evolutions of electron density, plasma temperature, and plasma absorption coefficient. The assumptions used in the model include the local thermal equilibrium and additional assumptions regarding the average plasma temperature and vapor density. The assumptions allowed the laser heat transfer equation to be solved together with the Saha–Eggert equation and conservation equations of matter and charge. When compared to the existing hydrodynamic models, the proposed model solves a less number of nonlinear equations and hence is computationally more efficient. The proposed FE model was employed to study the plasma-shielding effect on PLA produced by a 193 nm Excimer laser and a 266 nm Nd:YAG laser. The predictions of ablation depths, electron density, and plasma temperature agree well with the experimental data. Moreover, effects of the laser intensity and the average plasma temperature on the efficiency of the plasma shielding during PLA were also investigated and discussed in this study. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Experimental investigations of the in-die quenching efficiency and die surface temperature of hot stamping aluminium alloys
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - The in-die quenching is a key stage in the hot stamping volume production chain which determines the post-formed strength of lightweight alloy components, tool life, and hot stamping productivity. In this paper, the performance of in-die quenching, reflected by the quenching efficiency (the time of work-piece held within stamping dies) and die surface temperature during the simulated hot stamping process of AA6082, was experimentally and analytically investigated. A range of in-die quenching experiments were performed for different initial work-piece and die temperatures, quenching pressures, work-piece thickness, and die clearances, under hot stamping conditions. In addition, a one-dimensional (1D) closed-form heat transfer model was used to calculate the die surface temperature evolution that is difficult to obtain during practical manufacture situations. The results have shown that the in-die quenching efficiency can be significantly increased by decreasing the initial work-piece and die temperatures. Die clearances are required to be designed precisely to obtain sufficiently high quenching rates and satisfying post-formed strength for hot-stamped panel components. This study systematically considered an extensive variety of influencing factors on the in-die quenching performance, which can provide practical guides for stamping tool designers and manufacture systems for hot-stamping volume production. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Evolution of sex-specific heat stress tolerance and larval Hsp70 expression in populations of Drosophila melanogaster adapted to larval crowding
VL  - 34
IS  - 9
SP  - 1376-1385
AB  - The ability to tolerate temperature stress is an important component of adult fitness. In holometabolous insects like Drosophila melanogaster, adult stress resistance can be affected by growth conditions experienced during the larval stages. Although evolution under crowded larval conditions is known to lead to the correlated evolution of many adult traits, its consequences on adult heat stress tolerance have not been investigated. Therefore, in the present study, we assessed the adult heat stress tolerance in populations of D. melanogaster adapted to a stressful larval crowding environment. We used replicate populations of D. melanogaster, selected for adaptation to larval crowding stress (MCUs), for more than 230 generations, and their respective controls (MBs). Larvae from selected and control populations were grown under crowded and uncrowded conditions, and their adult heat shock resistance at two different temperatures was measured. Further, we compared Hsp70 expression in crowded and uncrowded larvae of both populations and also measured the Hsp70 expression after a mild heat treatment in adults of selected and control populations. Our results showed that adaptation to larval crowding leads to the evolution of Hsp70 gene expression in larval stages and improves adult heat stress tolerance ability in males, but not in females. © 2021 European Society for Evolutionary Biology

VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 283-291
AB  - Introduction: Within the moss genus Timmia, three or four sections have been suggested based on morphology. Earlier studies conflicted in suggesting that T. austriaca Hedw. either displays limited phylogeographical structure or includes large molecular variation with potential for geographical structure. Methods: Relationships within Timmia were inferred from variation in the nuclear 26S and plastid atpB–rbcL and trnL–trnF. New sequences were generated for 64 specimens of T. austriaca. For other Timmia species, sequences came primarily from earlier studies or GenBank. Key results: Timmia includes two main, well-supported molecular lineages. Within T. austriaca, four arctic or subarctic specimens resolved in a small-lineage sister to all other specimens. Conclusions: Recognition of two sections is suggested: Timmia Hedw. sect. Timmia (syn. sect. Timmiaurea Brassard; syn. sect. Sphaerocarpa Y.Jia & Yang Liu bis) and sect. Norvegica Brassard. Timmia fossils, including T. austriaca, were deposited at least 3 Myr BP in northernmost North America under a milder climate than presently in that area. It is theorised that plants of the small T. austriaca lineage evolved adaptations to survive only under cold conditions, when the Arctic was gradually cooling. Timmia austriaca disperses easily, and because the numerous temperate region samples studied included no representatives of the northern lineage, the restricted distribution of this lineage is suggested to have resulted from adaptation to cold environments. In situ survival of T. austriaca in Fennoscandia during the Late Glacial Maximum, as previously theorised, is deemed unlikely due to glacial erosion and submergence of large areas as a result of isostatic depression. © British Bryological Society 2021.

SP  - 1060-1066
AB  - This study was focused on developing and obtaining a kimchi starter for use in commercial kimchi production. Kimchi varieties made with selected starters are of high quality, have high levels of mannitol, and extended shelf life. The starters were screened for properties such as mannitol production, low gas/acid production, and acid resistance. Finally, kimchi fermentation testing was performed using selected LAB starters. Kimchi samples were prepared with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starters, including Leuconostoc mesenteroides PBio03 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides PBio104. The LAB starters are isolated from kimchi and can grow under pH 3.0 and low temperature conditions of 5C. Four kimchi samples were fermented and stored for 28 days at 5C. The kimchi samples made with starters (PBio03 and PBio104) had better quality (production of mannitol and maintenance of heterofermentative LAB dominance) than the non-starter kimchi samples. In the starter kimchi, Leu. mesenteroides was the dominant LAB, comprising 80% and 70% of total LAB counts at 7 and 21 days, respectively. Mannitol content of the kimchi with Leu. mesenteroides PBio03 was 1,423 19.1 mg/ 100 g at 28 days, which was higher than that of the non-starter kimchi sample (1,027 12.2 mg/100 g). These results show the possibility of producing kimchi with improved qualities using Leu. mesenteroides PBio03 and PBio104 as starters. © 2020 Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Dynamic light scattering optical coherence microscopy (DLS-OCM) integrates DLS, which measures diffusion or flow of particles by analyzing fluctuations in light scattered by the particles, and OCM, which achieves single-cell resolution by combining coherence and confocal gating, integratively enabling cellular-resolution 3D mapping of the diffusion coefficient, and flow velocity. The diffusion coefficient mapping has a potential for the non-destructive measurement of cellular viability in the standard unit but has not been validated yet. Here, we present DLS-OCM imaging of intra-cellular motility (ICM) as a surrogate of cellular viability. For this purpose, we have simultaneously obtained and compared ICM-contrast DLS-OCM images and calcium fluorescence-contrast images of retinal ganglion cells, and then characterized the responses of the measured ICM to a change in cellular viability induced by environmental conditions such as temperature and pH. The diffusion-coefficient-represented ICM exhibits consistent changes with the manipulated cellular viability. © 2018 Optical Society of America.

TI  - The DEAD-box RNA helicase RhlE2 is a global regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lifestyle and pathogenesis
VL  - 49
IS  - 12
SP  - 6925-6940
AB  - RNA helicases perform essential housekeeping and regulatory functions in all domains of life by binding and unwinding RNA molecules. The bacterial RhlE-like DEAD-box RNA helicases are among the least well studied of these enzymes. They are widespread especially among Proteobacteria, whose genomes often encode multiple homologs. The significance of the expansion and diversification of RhlE-like proteins for bacterial fitness has not yet been established. Here, we study the two RhlE homologs present in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that, in the course of evolution, RhlE1 and RhlE2 have diverged in their biological functions, molecular partners and RNA-dependent enzymatic activities. Whereas RhlE1 is mainly needed for growth in the cold, RhlE2 also acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts indispensable for both environmental adaptation and virulence. The global impact of RhlE2 is mediated by its unique C-terminal extension, which supports the RNA unwinding activity of the N-terminal domain as well as an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery. Overall, our work reveals how the functional and molecular divergence between two homologous RNA helicases can contribute to bacterial fitness and pathogenesis. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The biological activity of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) against the larvae and adults of the economically important Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chysomelidae) was assessed under laboratory conditions. The EPNs assessed were five native isolates of the species Steinernema feltiae (Filipjev) and Heterorhabditis megidis (Poinar, Jackson, and Klein). Steinernema feltiae (isolate ZAG15) demonstrated the highest biological activity, causing 100% of mortality of larvae and beetles. The lowest activity occurred with H. megidis (isolate Wipsowo), with mortality that did not exceed 58%. At a concentration of 100 infective juveniles/adult, greatest mortality of beetles was observed at 25°C as opposed to lower temperatures for all EPN isolates except the Wipsowo isolate, which showed no statistical significance of mortality among the temperatures tested. At 15°C, adult beetle mortality was concentration-dependent with the S. feltiae isolates ZWO4 and ZAG15. However, neither concentration nor temperature had statistically significant effects on larval mortality. © 2019 Georgia Entomological Society Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temperature increase altered Daphnia community structure in artificially heated lakes: a potential scenario for a warmer future
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Under conditions of global warming, organisms are expected to track their thermal preferences, invading new habitats at higher latitudes and altitudes and altering the structure of local communities. To fend off potential invaders, indigenous communities/populations will have to rapidly adapt to the increase in temperature. In this study, we tested if decades of artificial water heating changed the structure of communities and populations of the Daphnia longispina species complex. We compared the species composition of contemporary Daphnia communities inhabiting five lakes heated by power plants and four non-heated control lakes. The heated lakes are ca. 3–4 °C warmer, as all lakes are expected to be by 2100 according to climate change forecasts. We also genotyped subfossil resting eggs to describe past shifts in Daphnia community structure that were induced by lake heating. Both approaches revealed a rapid replacement of indigenous D. longispina and D. cucullata by invader D. galeata immediately after the onset of heating, followed by a gradual recovery of the D. cucullata population. Our findings clearly indicate that, in response to global warming, community restructuring may occur faster than evolutionary adaptation. The eventual recolonisation by D. cucullata indicates that adaptation to novel conditions can be time-lagged, and suggests that the long-term consequences of ecosystem disturbance may differ from short-term observations. © 2020, The Author(s).

VL  - 311

SP  - 13-22
AB  - Similar phenotypes evolve under equivalent environmental conditions through parallel evolution. Because they have repeatedly invaded and adapted to new freshwater environments, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offers a powerful system for understanding the agents of selection in nature that drive parallel evolution. Here, we examine the ecological and environmental variables responsible for morphological variation in three-spined stickleback populations across its European range. We collected fish from 85 populations, encompassing much of the European latitudinal range of the species and including lowland rivers and lakes, coastal lagoons and moorland ponds. We measured biotic and environmental variables at all sites along with morphological traits for 2,358 individuals. Using an information theory approach, we identified body size, minimum average winter temperature and pH as primary predictors of stickleback armour evolution, challenging current hypotheses for stickleback morphological diversification and demonstrating the fundamental role played by body size and scaling in mediating responses to selection. Stickleback lateral plate phenotype represents a potentially powerful tool for monitoring change in climate variables across the northern temperate region. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

VL  - 16
IS  - 4
AB  - This project examined evidence linking green building design strategies with the potential to enhance community resilience to extreme heat events. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method for a systematic review, it assessed the strength of the evidence supporting the potential for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) credit requirements to reduce the adverse effects of extreme heat events and/or enhance a building’s passive survivability (i.e., the ability to continue to function during utility outages) during those events. The PRISMA Flow Diagram resulted in the selection of 12 LEED for New Construction (LEED NC) credits for inclusion in the review. Following a preliminary scan of evidence supporting public health co-benefits of the LEED for Neighborhood Development rating system, queries were submitted in PubMed using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings Terms. Queries identified links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to extreme heat, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits included reducing the risk of vulnerability to heat stress and reducing heat-related morbidity and mortality. The results lay the groundwork for collaboration across the public health, civil society, climate change, and green building sectors. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Developmental temperature influences color polymorphism but not hatchling size in a woodland salamander
VL  - 192
IS  - 4
SP  - 909-918
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can be an important adaptive response to climate change, particularly for dispersal-limited species. Temperature frequently alters developmental and phenotypic traits including morphology, behavior, and reproductive cycles. We often lack crucial information about if and how thermal conditions during development will interact with genetic responses and facilitate persistence or adaptation under climate change. Polymorphic species offer an ideal test for this, as alternative morphs often confer differential adaptive advantages. However, few studies have examined the effects of incubation temperature on color expression or development in polymorphic taxa. Here we test if developmental temperature mediates morph frequency in the polymorphic salamander Plethodon cinereus. Although previous research suggests geographic variation in morph proportions results from differential climate adaptation, it remains unknown if plasticity also contributes to this variation. We used a split-clutch common garden experiment to determine the effects of developmental temperature on the color and development of P. cinereus. Our results indicate developmental temperature affects coloration in P. cinereus, either via plasticity or differential mortality, with eggs incubated at warmer temperatures yielding a higher proportion of unstriped individuals than those from cooler temperatures. This temperature response may contribute to the spatial variation in morph frequencies in natural populations. Surprisingly, we found neither temperature nor egg size affected hatchling size. Our study provides important insights into the potential for climate-induced responses to preserve diversity in dispersal-limited species, like P. cinereus, and enable time for adaptive evolution. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 28

SP  - 744-760
AB  - Upgrading the energy efficiency of existing buildings is a well-known issue around the globe. Given the very low renewal rate of the building stock, thermal retrofit of the existing buildings seems to be a good solution to improve the environmental performance of the building sector. Several studies have acknowledged the lack of knowledge, experience and best-practice examples as barriers in thermal retrofit of existing buildings. Therefore, this study has focused on developing recommendations on the most effective and feasible retrofitting techniques for existing buildings and performing financial analysis of initial investment vs. return based on the quantitative results of the energy modelling. Thermal comfort modelling software FirstRate5 has been used to simulate the annual heating and cooling energy consumption of nine benchmark buildings through a range of retrofitting techniques. Dwellings of varying construction materials including weatherboard, cavity brick and brick veneer have been simulated to improve accuracy. Examining seven different thermal retrofitting options in this study, it has become apparent that there is significant heating and cooling energy reduction, with payback period of less than three years, by implementing two options of the examined retrofitting cases to existing residential dwellings. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - For the echo state network, it is difficult to select the suitable reservoir parameters for different time series. In this paper, we propose a new prediction model which uses an improved differential evolution algorithm to optimize the parameters of the echo state network. The scale factor and crossover probability of differential evolution algorithms are adaptively adjusted. In addition, offspring generation strategy is also adaptively adjusted. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on Lorenz time series, and monthly average temperature - rainfall time series of Dalian. Experimental results show that the model can improve forecast accuracy and has good generalization ability and practicability. Copyright © 2021 Acta Automatica Sinica. All rights reserved.

TI  - Flexibility Is Costly: Hidden Physiological Damage From Seasonal Phenotypic Transitions in Heterothermic Species
VL  - 11
AB  - Heterothermy allows organisms to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. The use of regulated hypometabolism allows seasonal heterothermic species to cope with annual resource shortages and thus to maximize survival during the unfavorable season. This comes with deep physiological remodeling at each seasonal transition to allow the organism to adjust to the changing environment. In the wild, this adaptation is highly beneficial and largely overcomes potential costs. However, researchers recently proposed that it might also generate both ecological and physiological costs for the organism. Here, we propose new perspectives to be considered when analyzing adaptation to seasonality, in particular considering these costs. We propose a list of putative costs, including DNA damage, inflammatory response to fat load, brain and cognitive defects, digestive malfunction and immunodeficiency, that should receive more attention in future research on physiological seasonality. These costs may only be marginal at each transition event but accumulate over time and therefore emerge with age. In this context, studies in captivity, where we have access to aging individuals with limited extrinsic mortality (e.g., predation), could be highly valuable to experimentally assess the costs of physiological flexibility. Finally, we offer new perspectives, which should be included in demographic models, on how the adaptive value of physiological flexibility could be altered in the future in the context of global warming. © Copyright © 2020 Landes, Pavard, Henry and Terrien.

VL  - 27
IS  - 23
SP  - 4744-4757
AB  - Invasive species provide powerful in situ experimental systems for studying evolution in response to selective pressures in novel habitats. While research has shown that phenotypic evolution can occur rapidly in nature, few examples exist of genomewide adaptation on short “ecological” timescales. Burmese pythons (Python molurus bivittatus) have become a successful and impactful invasive species in Florida over the last 30 years despite major freeze events that caused high python mortality. We sampled Florida Burmese pythons before and after a major freeze event in 2010 and found evidence for directional selection in genomic regions enriched for genes associated with thermosensation, behaviour and physiology. Several of these genes are linked to regenerative organ growth, an adaptive response that modulates organ size and function with feeding and fasting in pythons. Independent histological and functional genomic data sets provide additional layers of support for a contemporary shift in invasive Burmese python physiology. In the Florida population, a shift towards maintaining an active digestive system may be driven by the fitness benefits of maintaining higher metabolic rates and body temperature during freeze events. Our results suggest that a synergistic interaction between ecological and climatic selection pressures has driven adaptation in Florida Burmese pythons, demonstrating the often-overlooked potential of rapid adaptation to influence the success of invasive species. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Degrees of change: between and within population variation in thermal reaction norms of phenology in a viviparous lizard
VL  - 101
IS  - 10
AB  - As the earth warms, populations will be faced with novel environments to which they may not be adapted. In the short term, populations can be buffered against the negative effects, or maximize the beneficial effects, of such environmental change via phenotypic plasticity and, in the longer term, via adaptive evolution. However, the extent and direction of these population-level responses will be dependent on the degree to which responses vary among the individuals within them (i.e., within population variation in plasticity), which is, itself, likely to vary among populations. Despite this, we have estimates of among-individual variation in plastic responses across multiple populations for only a few systems. This lack of data limits our ability to predict the consequences of environmental change for population and species persistence accurately. Here, we utilized a 16-yr data set from climatically distinct populations of the viviparous skink Niveoscincus ocellatus tracking over 1,200 litters from more than 600 females from each population to examine inter- and intrapopulation variability in the response of parturition date to environmental temperature. We found that these populations share a common population-mean reaction norm but differ in the degree to which reaction norms vary among individuals. These results suggest that even where populations share a common mean-level response, we cannot assume that they will be affected similarly by altered environmental conditions. If we are to assess how changing climates will impact species and populations accurately, we require estimates of how plastic responses vary both among and within populations. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Many ways to make darker flies: Intra- and interspecific variation in Drosophila body pigmentation components
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SP  - 8136-8155
AB  - Body pigmentation is an evolutionarily diversified and ecologically relevant trait with substantial variation within and between species, and important roles in animal survival and reproduction. Insect pigmentation, in particular, provides some of the most compelling examples of adaptive evolution, including its ecological significance and genetic bases. Pigmentation includes multiple aspects of color and color pattern that may vary more or less independently, and can be under different selective pressures. We decompose Drosophila thorax and abdominal pigmentation, a valuable eco-evo-devo model, into distinct measurable traits related to color and color pattern. We investigate intra- and interspecific variation for those traits and assess its different sources. For each body part, we measured overall darkness, as well as four other pigmentation properties distinguishing between background color and color of the darker pattern elements that decorate each body part. By focusing on two standard D. melanogaster laboratory populations, we show that pigmentation components vary and covary in distinct manners depending on sex, genetic background, and temperature during development. Studying three natural populations of D. melanogaster along a latitudinal cline and five other Drosophila species, we then show that evolution of lighter or darker bodies can be achieved by changing distinct component traits. Our results paint a much more complex picture of body pigmentation variation than previous studies could uncover, including patterns of sexual dimorphism, thermal plasticity, and interspecific diversity. These findings underscore the value of detailed quantitative phenotyping and analysis of different sources of variation for a better understanding of phenotypic variation and diversification, and the ecological pressures and genetic mechanisms underlying them. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Evolution and connectivity influence the persistence and recovery of coral reefs under climate change in the Caribbean, Southwest Pacific, and Coral Triangle
VL  - 27
IS  - 18
SP  - 4307-4321
AB  - Corals are experiencing unprecedented decline from climate change-induced mass bleaching events. Dispersal not only contributes to coral reef persistence through demographic rescue but can also hinder or facilitate evolutionary adaptation. Locations of reefs that are likely to survive future warming therefore remain largely unknown, particularly within the context of both ecological and evolutionary processes across complex seascapes that differ in temperature range, strength of connectivity, network size, and other characteristics. Here, we used eco-evolutionary simulations to examine coral adaptation to warming across reef networks in the Caribbean, the Southwest Pacific, and the Coral Triangle. We assessed the factors associated with coral persistence in multiple reef systems to understand which results are general and which are sensitive to particular geographic contexts. We found that evolution can be critical in preventing extinction and facilitating the long-term recovery of coral communities in all regions. Furthermore, the strength of immigration to a reef (destination strength) and current sea surface temperature robustly predicted reef persistence across all reef networks and across temperature projections. However, we found higher initial coral cover, slower recovery, and more evolutionary lag in the Coral Triangle, which has a greater number of reefs and more larval settlement than the other regions. We also found the lowest projected future coral cover in the Caribbean. These findings suggest that coral reef persistence depends on ecology, evolution, and habitat network characteristics, and that, under an emissions stabilization scenario (RCP 4.5), recovery may be possible over multiple centuries. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Mitogenomic data to study the taxonomy of Antarctic springtail species (Hexapoda: Collembola) and their adaptation to extreme environments
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
SP  - 715-732
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for proteins mainly involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process, and due to its molecular features, it is one of the most used molecular markers for phylogenetic and taxonomic purposes. Since mitochondria are the primary source of energy for aerobic organisms, it has been suggested that modifications of the mitochondrial genome’s features could be linked with major adaptive processes to particular environmental conditions. In this respect, Antarctic Collembola (springtails) may be considered an interesting model to study whether positive selective pressure has occurred, inducing significant changes in the mtDNA characteristics that have eventually led to cold adaptation. In this study, we describe the molecular features of the mitochondrial genome of Cryptopygus terranovus, a springtail species endemic to Victoria Land. Molecular data are also employed to support the new taxonomic placement of C. terranovus, and to establish if the conspecific lineages of Friesea antarctica, that lives in separated biogeographical regions of the Antarctic Continent, are indeed distinct species. Finally, all the mitochondrial genomes of springtails, so far sequenced, were applied for calculating the ratio (ω) of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide substitutions. This approach allowed us to investigate if Antarctic collembolans could have experienced Darwinian selective pressures compared to the non-Antarctic springtail species. Indeed, our data does indicate positive selection (ω > 1), suggesting that survival at extreme environmental conditions could be also related to mtDNA modifications. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Economic carbon cycle feedbacks may offset additional warming from natural feedbacks
VL  - 116
IS  - 3
SP  - 759-764
AB  - As the Earth warms, carbon sinks on land and in the ocean will weaken, thereby increasing the rate of warming. Although natural mechanisms contributing to this positive climate–carbon feedback have been evaluated using Earth system models, analogous feedbacks involving human activities have not been systematically quantified. Here we conceptualize and estimate the magnitude of several economic mechanisms that generate a carbon–climate feedback, using the Kaya identity to separate a net economic feedback into components associated with population, GDP, heating and cooling, and the carbon intensity of energy production and transportation. We find that climate-driven decreases in economic activity (GDP) may in turn decrease human energy use and thus fossil fuel CO 2 emissions. In a high radiative forcing scenario, such decreases in economic activity reduce fossil fuel emissions by 13% this century, lowering atmospheric CO 2 by over 100 ppm in 2100. The natural carbon–climate feedback, in contrast, increases atmospheric CO 2 over this period by a similar amount, and thus, the net effect including both feedbacks is nearly zero. Our work highlights the importance of improving the representation of climate–economic feedbacks in scenarios of future change. Although the effects of climate warming on the economy may offset weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, a loss of economic productivity will have high societal costs, potentially increasing wealth inequity and limiting resources available for effective adaptation. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) influence permeability, antimicrobial peptide resistance, biofilm formation and membrane phospholipid structure in an A-layer and non-A-layer strain of Aeromonas salmonicida
AB  - Aeromonas salmonicida is a Gram-negative bacterium that can infect a wide host range of fish populations, including salmonids and non-salmonids as well as freshwater and marine life. Some strains of A. salmonicida cause the disease furunculosis, which can cause lethargy, intestinal inflammation, ulcers, haemorrhaging and death. The infection is spread through fish-to-fish contact, and the presence of infection can have devastating effects on cultivated fish populations. The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of non-A-layer and A-layer A. salmonicida strains to incorporate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into their lipid profile and test the phenotypic effects thereof. Lipids were extracted from PUFA-exposed cultures and analysed for lipid modification by thin-layer chromatography and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, showing A. salmonicida, regardless of A-layer, capable of incorporating all seven of the PUFAs studied. Phenotypic effects were determined through the use of assays that tested for biofilm formation, membrane permeability and cyclic peptide susceptibility. Temperature-dependent effects on biofilm formation were observed, and PUFA exposure showed significant (p <.001) increases in membrane permeability as tested by the uptake of the hydrophobic compounds crystal violet and ethidium bromide. Additionally, some PUFAs elicited modest protection and vulnerability against the membrane-targeting cyclic peptides polymyxin B (PMB) and colistin. The diverse, strain-specific responses to exogenous PUFAs may allude to evolved adaptive strategies that enhance survival, persistence and virulence of non-pathogenic and pathogenic members of bacteria that oscillate between environmental and fish host niches. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Multi-Omics Approaches Revealed the Associations of Host Metabolism and Gut Microbiome With Phylogeny and Environmental Adaptation in Mountain Dragons
VL  - 13
AB  - The molecular basis enabling the adaptation of animals to spatially heterogeneous environments is a critical clue for understanding the variation, formation, and maintenance of biodiversity in the context of global climate change. Mountain dragons (Agamidae: Diploderma) thrive in the Hengduan Mountain Region, a biodiversity hotspot and a typical spatially heterogeneous environment. Here, we compare the liver and muscle metabolome and gut microbiome of 11 geographical populations from three Diploderma species (D. iadinum, D. yulongsense, and D. vela) after 7 days acclimation in the same laboratory conditions. Amino acid metabolism, particularly the products of the glutathione cycle, accounted for major interspecies variations, implying its significance in genetic differentiation among mountain dragons. Notably, the cold-dwelling D. vela and D. yulongense populations tended to have higher glycerophosphate, glycerol-3-phosphocholine, and kinetin levels in their liver, higher carnosine levels in their muscle, and higher Lachnospiraceae levels in their gut. Phylogeny, net primary productivity (NPP), and the temperature had the highest explanation rate to the variations in muscle metabolome, liver metabolome, and gut microbiome, respectively, suggesting heterogeneity of biological systems in response to climatic variations. Therefore, we suggested that the organ heterogeneity in environmental responsiveness might be substantial for mountain dragons to thrive in complicated environments.

TI  - Comparative Study of Cooked and Uncooked Food Waste Co-composting with Green Waste and Sewage Sludge: A Case Study of Tunisia
SP  - 777
AB  - Worldwide, substantial quantities of food waste are produced daily causing several environmental issues, such as the need for large landfills and significant spending for them to be well-managed. So, the development of novel processes to handle this alarming organic waste problem seems to be urgent. Its conversion into value-added products is ensured by aerobic digestion. That kind of process decreases the need for chemical fertilizers and the degradation of the soil by biofertilizer production. This work aims to evaluate the effect of cooked and uncooked food waste when it is co-composted with sewage sludge and green waste. Two windrows (A1 and A2) were conducted during 14 weeks, in which sewage sludge (SS) and green waste (GW) were mixed at the same ratio of 25% with uncooked food waste (UFW) and cooked food waste (CFW) to form A1 and A2, respectively. Several parameters, such as temperature, pH, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Nitrogen (TN), and C:N ratio, were monitored to evaluate the co-composting experiments and its evolution during the whole process. Results show that windrow containing CFW reached 62 °C only two days after its setting-up and the thermophilic phase lasted 15 days. However, for the windrow containing UFW, the maximum temperature reached was 59 °C after four days, and the thermophilic phase lasted 14 days. During the thermophilic phase of A1 and A2, temperature was above 50 °C. Temperature and C:N ratios acted as a detector of the stability and the maturity of the obtained end-product. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Baseline information of reproduction parameters of an amphidromous croaker Johnius coitor (Hamilton, 1822) from Ganga river basin, India with special reference to potential influence of climatic variability
VL  - 31
AB  - Reproductive biology of female amphidromous croaker Johnius coitor (Hamilton, 1822) was studied for the first time from various freshwater stretches of Ganga river basin, India in relation to climatic variability. The species showed high spatial variation in reproductive phenology and capable of breeding during pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon and winter. Water temperature is the most crucial environmental parameter influencing gonadal maturation and breeding. Generalized additive model (GAM) models revealed water temperature near 23-25 °C as optimum and threshold GSI above 3 units necessary for breeding. Pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn50) and size at 50% maturity (LM50) benchmarked through Kaplan-Meier survival fit estimates were in the range 1.27-1.37 units and 19-24.5 cm respectively. First maturity of females was encountered at 11.4 cm within the size range 7.2-28.5 cm. Egg parameters in mature-ripe females ranged between 0.29-0.80 mm (diameter), 0.05-0.19 mg (weight) and 5687-121 849 eggs (absolute fecundity). Mapping of climate preferendum through LOESS smoothing technique hinted water temperatures <20 °C and >32 °C to be detrimental for attainment of pre-spawning fitness while no dependence on rainfall was observed. Based on the climato-hydrological influence on breeding and regional trends of changing climate along river Ganga, we infer minimal climate driven changes in breeding phenology of this amphidromous fish species. Results of this study may serve as baseline information for future studies assessing climate driven changes and evolutionary adaptations in croakers from river Ganga. © EDP Sciences 2017.

AB  - Leaf is one of the important organs of plants that facilitates the exchange of water and air with the surrounding environment. The morphological variation of leaves directly affect the physiological and biochemical processes of plants, which also reflects the adaptive strategies of plants to obtain resources. By focusing on several leaf morphological traits, including leaf size, leaf shape, leaf margin (with or without teeth) and leaf type (i.e. single vs. compound leaf), here, we reviewed the relevant research progresses in this field. We summarized the ecological functions of leaf morphological traits, identified their geographical distribution patterns, and explored the underlying environmental drivers, potential ecological interactions, and their effects on ecosystem functioning. We found that the current studies exploring the distribution and determinants of leaf size and leaf margin states mainly focused on single or specific taxon in local regions. Studies have also explored the genetic mechanisms of leaf morphology development. Leaf traits trade off with other functional traits, and their spatial variation is driven by both temperature and water availability. Leaf morphological traits, especially leaf size, influence water and nutrient cycling, reflect the response of communities to climate change, and can be scaled up to predict ecosystem primary productivity. Further studies should pay attention to combine new approaches to obtain unbiased data with high coverage, to explore the long-term adaptive evolution of leaf morphology, and to generalize the scaling in leaf morphology and its effect on ecosystem functioning. Leaf provides an important perspective to understand how plants respond and adapt to environmental changes. Studying leaf morphological traits provides insight into species fitness, community dynamics and ecosystem functioning, and also improves our understanding of the research progresses made in related fields, including plant community ecology and functional biogeography. © 2021 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.

TI  - Metabolism Interactions Promote the Overall Functioning of the Episymbiotic Chemosynthetic Community of Shinkaia crosnieri of Cold Seeps
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
AB  - Remarkably diverse bacteria have been observed as biofilm aggregates on the surface of deep-sea invertebrates that support the growth of hosts through chemosynthetic carbon fixation. Growing evidence also indicates that community-wide interactions, and especially cooperation among symbionts, contribute to overall community productivity. Here, metagenome-guided metatranscriptomic and metabolic analyses were conducted to investigate the taxonomic composition, functions, and potential interactions of symbionts dwelling on the seta of Shinkaia crosnieri lobsters in a methane cold seep. Methylococcales and Thiotrichales dominated the community, followed by the Campylobacteriales, Nitrosococcales, Flavobacteriales, and Chitinophagales Metabolic interactions may be common among the episymbionts since many separate taxon genomes encoded complementary genes within metabolic pathways. Specifically, Thiotrichales could contribute to detoxification of hydroxylamine that is a metabolic by-product of Methylococcales. Further, Nitrosococcales may rely on methanol leaked from Methylococcales cells that efficiently oxidize methane. Elemental sulfur may also serve as a community good that enhances sulfur utilization that benefits the overall community, as evidenced by confocal Raman microscopy. Stable intermediates may connect symbiont metabolic activities in cyclical oxic-hypoxic fluctuating environments, which then enhance overall community functioning. This hypothesis was partially confirmed via in situ experiments. These results highlight the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in symbiosis and deep-sea adaptation. 2022 Xu et al.

TI  - Maternal effect and dietary supplementation of estradiol-17 beta on female zebrafish (Danio rerio) affects the swimming behavior and stress-coping styles of its offspring
VL  - 252
AB  - Extrinsic estradiol-17β (E2) is an environmental hormone. Female fish exposure to waterborne E2 might affect the development of craniofacial cartilage of its offspring. The present study investigates the effects of maternal E2 on larval craniofacial cartilage development by administering oral feed containing E2 (F-E2) to female zebrafish, and examines whether the swimming behavior and their stress coping style are influenced by maternal E2. The results showed that E2 contents responded to dosage and time in male fish after being fed with a diet containing E2. In addition, the E2 contents in female ovaries showed a significant increase after 250 mg of E2/kg treatment for 14 d. On the other hand, the fecundity rate of F-E2 group was lower around 2 folds than F[sbnd]C (female fed 0 mg of E2/kg) group. Craniofacial chondrogenesis on 72 hpf (hours of post fertilization) of F-E2 larvae were abnormalities, and a recovery to a normal developmental pattern was observed at the 96 hpf stage. The swimming speed was slower for F-E2 larvae compared to the F[sbnd]C larvae; and the F-E2 juvenile seems to be less responsive to cortisol (LRC) after cold stress. According to the results, we suggested that F-E2 larvae might have worse environmental adaptability than F[sbnd]C larvae. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Phenological responses to climate warming in temperate moths and butterflies: species traits predict future changes in voltinism
VL  - 129
IS  - 7
SP  - 1051-1060
AB  - Changes in the number of generations per year (voltinism) have been among the most common phenological responses to climate warming in insects inhabiting seasonal environments. Nevertheless, numerous species have maintained univoltine (one generation per year) phenology with increasing temperatures, indicating the involvement of phylogenetic, ecological or some other constraints on phenological change. I examined geographic variation in voltinism in moths and butterflies of northern Europe to identify species traits that might predispose species to univoltine/multivoltine phenology. I focused on species with a wide latitudinal distribution range (15 degrees as a minimum) which makes it unlikely that constraints imposed by season length could preclude multivoltinism across their distribution. Almost half of the 731 moth and butterfly species considered appear to have a single generation throughout their entire European range. A univoltine life-cycle across a wide latitudinal gradient suggests the presence of some constraint that makes additional generations either impossible or at least strongly disadvantageous, which will unlikely change with future climate warming. The scattered distribution of univoltine and multivoltine species across the lepidopteran phylogeny indicates that phylogenetic constraints do not strongly limit changes in voltinism, and the trait is open to ecologically-driven adaptive evolution. My data show that species with one generation per year are generally larger than multivoltine species, but size forms no absolute constraint to having multiple generations per year. Obligately univoltine species dominate among egg and adult overwinterers (life-histories typical of so-called spring-feeders), whereas species with capacity for multiple generations prevail among pupal overwinterers. Multivoltinism is also infrequent among species feeding on grasses, particularly in endophagous grass-feeders. Larval diet breadth has no discernible effect on voltinism. Given the diverse ecological consequences of voltinism and its changes, accounting for the species’ capacity for multivoltinism may be a key to address future challenges in biodiversity conservation and pest management. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

TI  - Assessing farmers’ perspectives on climate change for effective farm-level adaptation measures in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
VL  - 191
IS  - 9
AB  - Agriculture is considered as the backbone of the economy of Pakistan. However, current changes in climate have been adversely affecting agricultural productivity. In this paper, perceived impacts of climate change on agriculture and adaptation towards it have been studied in Charsadda district (lowlands) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan through extensive field surveys, involving 116 farm households. Results have revealed that climate change factors including fluctuating temperature, evidence of yearly long droughts, and a steady shift in rainfall patterns have pressured the agriculture sector and livelihoods of the local peasants. The staggering floods of 2010 and 2011 in Pakistan have evidenced severe climatic changes in Pakistan. These countrywide floods have washed fertile soil in the study area that has directly contributed to losses in agricultural yield and increased vector-borne diseases in crops. The local farmers have commonly deployed adaptive measure such as crops diversification, changing fertilizer, and planting shaded trees to minimize the impacts of changes in climate. However, these adjustments measures are perceived as not appropriate for improving farm yield. Therefore, the study suggests that improved understanding of the climate change impacts and knowledge on adapting adequately will lead to no-regret adaptation. It will also help protecting farmer’s lives and livelihoods and will boost their resilience towards changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Seascape genomics reveals population isolation in the reef-building honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata (L.)
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Under the threat of climate change populations can disperse, acclimatise or evolve in order to avoid fitness loss. In light of this, it is important to understand neutral gene flow patterns as a measure of dispersal potential, but also adaptive genetic variation as a measure of evolutionary potential. In order to assess genetic variation and how this relates to environment in the honeycomb worm (Sabellaria alveolata (L.)), a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out RAD sequencing using individuals from along its complete latitudinal range. Patterns of neutral population genetic structure were compared to larval dispersal as predicted by ocean circulation modelling, and outlier analyses and genotype-environment association tests were used to attempt to identify loci under selection in relation to local temperature data. Results: We genotyped 482 filtered SNPs, from 68 individuals across nine sites, 27 of which were identified as outliers using BAYESCAN and ARLEQUIN. All outlier loci were potentially under balancing selection, despite previous evidence of local adaptation in the system. Limited gene flow was observed among reef-sites (FST = 0.28 ± 0.10), in line with the low dispersal potential identified by the larval dispersal models. The North Atlantic reef emerged as a distinct population and this was linked to high local larval retention and the effect of the North Atlantic Current on dispersal. Conclusions: As an isolated population, with limited potential for natural genetic or demographic augmentation from other reefs, the North Atlantic site warrants conservation attention in order to preserve not only this species, but above all the crucial functional ecological roles that are associated with their bioconstructions. Our study highlights the utility of using seascape genomics to identify populations of conservation concern. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Gene expression profiles provide insights into the survival strategies in deep-sea mussel (Bathymodiolus platifrons) of different developmental stages
VL  - 23
AB  - Background: Deep-sea mussels living in the cold seeps with enormous biomass act as the primary consumers. They are well adapted to the extreme environment where light is absent, and hydrogen sulfide, methane, and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occur. Despite previous studies on diversity, role, evolution, and symbiosis, the changing adaptation patterns during different developmental stages of the deep-sea mussels remain largely unknown. Results: The deep-sea mussels (Bathymodiolus platifrons) of two developmental stages were collected from the cold seep during the ocean voyage. The gills, mantles, and adductor muscles of these mussels were used for the Illumina sequencing. A total of 135 Gb data were obtained, and subsequently, 46,376 unigenes were generated using de-novo assembly strategy. According to the gene expression analysis, amounts of genes were most actively expressed in the gills, especially genes involved in environmental information processing. Genes encoding Toll-like receptors and sulfate transporters were up-regulated in gills, indicating that the gill acts as both intermedium and protective screen in the deep-sea mussel. Lysosomal enzymes and solute carrier responsible for nutrients absorption were up-regulated in the older mussel, while genes related to toxin resistance and autophagy were up-regulated in the younger one, suggesting that the older mussel might be in a vigorous stage while the younger mussel was still paying efforts in survival and adaptation. Conclusions: In general, our study suggested that the adaptation capacity might be formed gradually during the development of deep-sea mussels, in which the gill and the symbionts play essential roles. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Conservation genomics aims to preserve the viability of populations and the biodiversity of living organisms. Invertebrate organisms represent 95% of animal biodiversity; however, few genomic resources currently exist for the group. The subset of marine invertebrates includes the most ancient metazoan lineages and possesses codes for unique gene products and possible keys to adaptation. The benefits of supporting invertebrate conservation genomics research (e.g., likely discovery of novel genes, protein regulatory mechanisms, genomic innovations, and transposable elements) outweigh the various hurdles (rare, small, or polymorphic starting materials). Here we review best conservation genomics practices in the laboratory and in silico when applied to marine invertebrates and also showcase unique features in several case studies of acroporid corals, crown-of-thorns starfish, apple snails, and abalone. Marine conservation genomics should also address how diversity can lead to unique marine innovations, the impact of deleterious variation, and how genomic monitoring and profiling could positively affect broader conservation goals (e.g., value of baseline data for in situ/ex situ genomic stocks).

VL  - 376
IS  - 6599
SP  - 1333-1338
AB  - Polar bears are susceptible to climate warming because of their dependence on sea ice, which is declining rapidly. We present the first evidence for a genetically distinct and functionally isolated group of polar bears in Southeast Greenland. These bears occupy sea-ice conditions resembling those projected for the High Arctic in the late 21st century, with an annual ice-free period that is >100 days longer than the estimated fasting threshold for the species. Whereas polar bears in most of the Arctic depend on annual sea ice to catch seals, Southeast Greenland bears have a year-round hunting platform in the form of freshwater glacial mélange. This suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, although of limited availability, may serve as previously unrecognized climate refugia. Conservation of Southeast Greenland polar bears, which meet criteria for recognition as the world's 20th polar bear subpopulation, is necessary to preserve the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - A number of insects have been suggested to perform seasonal migration between low- and high-altitude areas. In these insects, support for the occurrence of migration mainly came from observations that focal insects disappeared from a certain range of altitudes but appeared at different altitudes with short time lags. In some insects, further support was obtained by mark–recapture studies, analyses of the seasonal change of age structure or reproductive conditions in individuals from different altitudes and studies on dormancy or temperature tolerance. Other means that can be used to assess the occurrence of altitudinal migration are briefly mentioned. Two types of migration, the dormancy-associated and dormancy-independent types, are discriminated. In the former type, insects usually breed in spring, migrate to high-altitude areas in late spring or early summer, usually for aestivation, and return to low-altitude areas in autumn. In this type, the same individuals perform upward and downward migration. In the latter type, insects also perform upward migration in late spring or early summer and downward migration in autumn, but they breed both in low- and high-altitude areas. The adaptive and evolutionary aspects of altitudinal migration are briefly mentioned. © 2020 The Entomological Society of Japan

VL  - 96

AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics can mediate species and community responses to habitat warming and fragmentation, two of the largest threats to biodiversity and ecosystems. The eco-evolutionary consequences of warming and fragmentation are typically studied independently, hindering our understanding of their simultaneous impacts. Here, we provide a new perspective rooted in trade-offs among traits for understanding their eco-evolutionary consequences. On the one hand, temperature influences traits related to metabolism, such as resource acquisition and activity levels. Such traits are also likely to have trade-offs with other energetically costly traits, like antipredator defences or dispersal. On the other hand, fragmentation can influence a variety of traits (e.g. dispersal) through its effects on the spatial environment experienced by individuals, as well as properties of populations, such as genetic structure. The combined effects of warming and fragmentation on communities should thus reflect their collective impact on traits of individuals and populations, as well as trade-offs at multiple trophic levels, leading to unexpected dynamics when effects are not additive and when evolutionary responses modulate them. Here, we provide a road map to navigate this complexity. First, we review single-species responses to warming and fragmentation. Second, we focus on consumer–resource interactions, considering how eco-evolutionary dynamics can arise in response to warming, fragmentation, and their interaction. Third, we illustrate our perspective with several example scenarios in which trait trade-offs could result in significant eco-evolutionary dynamics. Specifically, we consider the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of (i) evolution in thermal performance of a species involved in a consumer–resource interaction, (ii) ecological or evolutionary changes to encounter and attack rates of consumers, and (iii) changes to top consumer body size in tri-trophic food chains. In these scenarios, we present a number of novel, sometimes counter-intuitive, potential outcomes. Some of these expectations contrast with those solely based on ecological dynamics, for example, evolutionary responses in unexpected directions for resource species or unanticipated population declines in top consumers. Finally, we identify several unanswered questions about the conditions most likely to yield strong eco-evolutionary dynamics, how better to incorporate the role of trade-offs among traits, and the role of eco-evolutionary dynamics in governing responses to warming in fragmented communities. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society

VL  - 287

AB  - The relationship of evolution with diet and environment can provide insights into modern disease. Fossil evidence shows apes, and early human ancestors were fruit eaters living in environments with strongly seasonal climates. Rapid cooling at the end of the Middle Miocene (15–12 Ma: millions of years ago) increased seasonality in Africa and Europe, and ape survival may be linked with a mutation in uric acid metabolism. Climate stabilized in the later Miocene and Pliocene (12–5 Ma), and fossil apes and early hominins were both adapted for life on ground and in trees. Around 2.5 Ma, early species of Homo introduced more animal products into their diet, and this coincided with developing bipedalism, stone tool technology and increase in brain size. Early species of Homo such as Homo habilis still lived in woodland habitats, and the major habitat shift in human evolution occurred at 1.8 Ma with the origin of Homo erectus. Homo erectus had increased body size, greater hunting skills, a diet rich in meat, control of fire and understanding about cooking food, and moved from woodland to savannah. Group size may also have increased at the same time, facilitating the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The earliest fossils of Homo sapiens appeared about 300 kyr, but they had separated from Neanderthals by 480 kyr or earlier. Their diet shifted towards grain-based foods about 100 kyr ago, and settled agriculture developed about 10 kyr ago. This pattern remains for many populations to this day and provides important insights into current burden of lifestyle diseases. © 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine

AB  - Changes in temperature associated with climate change can alter species' distributions, drive adaptive evolution, and in some cases cause extinction. Research has tended to focus on the direct effects of temperature, but changes in temperature can also have indirect effects on populations and species. Here, we test whether temperature can indirectly affect the fitness of Drosophila santomea and Drosophila yakuba by altering the nature of interspecific competition. We show that when raised in isolation, both D. santomea and D. yakuba display similar variation in relative fitness across temperatures of 18 degrees, 22 degrees, and 25 degrees C. However, D. santomea has higher fitness than D. yakuba when experiencing interspecific competition at 18 degrees C, while the inverse is true at 25 degrees C. Patterns of fitness across thermal and competitive environments therefore indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition varies with temperature. We then use a coexistence experiment to show that D. santomea is rapidly (within eight generations) extirpated when maintained with D. yakuba at 25 degrees C. By contrast, D. santomea remains as (or more) abundant than D. yakuba over the course of similar to 10 generations when maintained at 18 degrees C. Our results provide an example of how the thermal environment can affect interspecific competition and suggest that some species may become more prone to extinction under scenarios of climate change through indirect effects of the thermal environment on competitive advantages between species.

VL  - 45

SP  - 437-448
AB  - Characterizing the relationships between genotype and phenotype for developmental adaptive traits is essential to understand the evolutionary dynamics underlying biodiversity. In holometabolous insects, the time to reach the reproductive stage and pupation site preference are two such traits. Here we characterize aspects of the genetic architecture for Developmental Time (decomposed in Larval and Pupal components) and Pupation Height using lines derived from three natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster raised at two temperatures. For all traits, phenotypic differences and variation in plasticity between populations suggest adaptation to the original thermal regimes. However, high variability within populations shows that selection does not exhaust genetic variance for these traits. This could be partly explained by local adaptation, environmental heterogeneity and modifications in the genetic architecture of traits according to environment and ontogenetic stage. Indeed, our results show that the genetic factors affecting Developmental Time and Pupation Height are temperature-specific. Varying relationships between Larval and Pupal Developmental Time between and within populations also suggest stage-specific modifications of genetic architecture for this trait. This flexibility would allow for a somewhat independent evolution of adaptive traits at different environments and life stages, favoring the maintenance of genetic variability and thus sustaining the traits’ evolvabilities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Optimisation of tool path shape in trochoidal milling using B-spline curves
VL  - 121
IS  - 5
SP  - 3801-3816
AB  - In recent years, trochoidal milling has become greatly widespread since it provides high productivity and long tool life, especially when cutting difficult-to-machine materials. Numerous studies have dealt with the analytical description and the experimental investigation of the evolution of cutting force, temperature, tool wear, chatter stability, etc. However, most of these analyses are focusing on the conventional circular and cycloid-shape trajectories. Only a few studies address the potential of improving the efficiency by modifying the tool path shape, leaving significant reserves untapped. If the mathematical formulation of the trajectory cannot be described easily, then a sophisticated optimisation algorithm is needed to determine the appropriate tool path shape. To overcome these difficulties at trochoidal milling of straight slots, the present work proposes a new tool path generation algorithm that can maximize the average material removal rate (MRR) while controlling the tool load. In this approach, the tool path is modelled by a B-spline curve whose control points are optimised using a differential evolution algorithm. The developed tool path generation strategy was compared through simulations and experiments with two widely used solutions viz the traditional cycloid-shaped tool path and a modern approach used in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems. The results reveal that the developed method is able to control the tool load and the smoothness of the tool path, and most importantly, also exceeds the existing methods in terms of productivity. © 2022, The Author(s).

VL  - 61
IS  - 3
SP  - 1134-1146
AB  - Life history events, from mating and voltinism to migration and emergence, are governed by external and historically predictable environmental factors. The ways humans have altered natural environments during the Anthropocene have created myriad and compounding changes to these historically predictable environmental cues. Over the past few decades, there has been an increased interest in the control temperature exerts on life history events as concern over climate change has increased. However, temperature is not the only life history cue that humans have altered. In stream ecosystems, flow and light serve as important life history cues in addition to temperature. The timing and magnitude of peak flows can trigger migrations, decreases in stream temperature may cause a stream insect to enter diapause, and photoperiod appears to prompt spawning in some species of fish. Two or more of these cues may interact with one another in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways. Large dams and increasing impervious cover in urban ecosystems have modified flows and altered the timing of spawning and migration in fish. Precipitation draining hot impervious surfaces increases stream temperature and adds variability to the general pattern of stream warming from climate change. The addition of artificial light in urban and suburban areas is bright enough to eliminate or dampen the photoperiod signal and has resulted in caddisfly emergence becoming acyclical. The resulting changes in the timing of life history events also have the potential to influence the evolutionary trajectory of an organism and its interactions with other species. This paper offers a review and conceptual framework for future research into how flow, temperature, and light interact to drive life history events of stream organisms and how humans have changed these cues. We then present some of the potential evolutionary and ecological consequences of altered life history events, and conclude by highlighting what we perceive to be the most pressing research needs. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Potential of continental shale gas accumulation in medium-and small-sized fault basins in eastern China: A case study from the Fuxin Basin
VL  - 38
IS  - 5
SP  - 26-33
AB  - A great number of Mesozoic medium- and small-sized fault basins are developed in eastern China. In these fault basins, the sedimentary thickness of continental organic-rich shale is great, and the Cretaceous volcanic activities accelerate the maturity of organic matters in the shale, which provide favorable prerequisites for shale gas accumulation. In this paper, the potential of continental shale gas accumulation in the mentioned Mesozoic medium- and small-sized fault basins was analyzed with the Fuxin Basin as an example. Based on the latest drilling, core and cutting test data, six elements of shale gas accumulation in organic-rich shale in the Fuxin Basin were discussed, including thickness, distribution, total organic carbon (TOC) content, thermal evolution maturity of organic matter (Ro), reservoir capacity and compressibility. Then, depending on the characteristics of shale reservoirs, the potential of continental shale gas accumulation in the study area was investigated, and the suggestions on further exploration and development were proposed. The following results were obtained. First, continental shale in the medium- and small-sized fault basins in eastern China is characterized by great total reservoir thickness, high TOC content and moderate thermal maturity, which are advantageous for shale gas accumulation, while larger lateral thickness variation, lower reservoir capacity and weaker stimulation feasibility, which are disadvantageous for shale gas accumulation. Second, continental shale has high TOC content (averagely 5.4%), and high Ro (>1.2%) under the effect of Mesozoic volcanic activities, suggesting a gas generating window, so there is a superior material basis for shale gas accumulation. Third, it is uncertain whether the multi-stage fracturing technique of horizontal wells for the development of marine shale gas is applicable to the development of continental shale gas, so it is necessary to develop the 3D vertical multi-layer development technique of vertical wells suitable for continental shale gas. Fourth, the single-well production rate of continental shale gas is lower than that of marine shale gas, so it is necessary to strengthen the single-well economic productivity evaluation of continental shale gas in fault basins. In conclusion, the fault basins in eastern China are mostly similar to the Fuxin Basin and they have the material basis for shale gas accumulation, so these basins are the new targets for achieving breakthroughs in continental shale gas exploration. Further exploration shall focus on the identification of zones with a high reservoir capacity and of intervals with strong simulation feasibility. © 2018, Natural Gas Industry Journal Agency.

TI  - Heat tolerance may determine activity time in coprophagic beetle species (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae)
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 1076-1086
AB  - Although reports have documented loss of species diversity and ecological services caused by stressful temperature changes that result from climate change, some species cope through behavioral compensation. As temperatures and magnitudes of temperature extremes increase, animals should compensate to maintain fitness (such as through temporary behavioral shifts in activity times). Appropriate timing of activity helps avoid competition across species. Although coprophagic dung beetles exhibit species-specific temporal activity times, it is unknown whether temperature drives evolution of these species-specific temporal activity times. Using nine dung beetle species (three each of diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal species), we explored differences in heat stress tolerance measured as critical thermal maxima (CTmax; the highest temperature allowing activity) and heat knockdown time (HKDT; survival time under acute heat stress) across these species, and examined the results using a phylogenetically informed approach. Our results showed that day-active species had significantly higher CTmax (diurnal &gt; crepuscular = nocturnal species), whereas crepuscular species had higher HKDT (crepuscular &gt; nocturnal &gt; diurnal species). There was no correlation between heat tolerance and body size across species with distinct temporal activity, and no significant phylogenetic constraint for activity. Species with higher CTmax did not necessarily have higher HKDT, which indicates that species may respond differently to diverse heat tolerance metrics. Acute heat tolerance for diurnal beetles indicates that this trait may constrain activity time and, under high acute temperatures with climate change, species may shift activity times in more benign environments. These results contribute to elucidate the evolution of foraging behavior and management of coprophagic beetle ecosystem services under changing environments. © 2020 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

VL  - 90
IS  - 2
SP  - 100-106
AB  - Human activity has had severe effects on the changes in climate over the last decades affecting, as a consequence, human security overall. The importance of changes in climate and their consequent effects have been long overlooked to the point that nowadays human health is being threatened by sea rise, extreme weather events, lack of adequate basic resources, and the spread of numerous diseases, to name some. This article aims to demonstrate how these variations have promoted the spread of vector-borne diseases (VBD). More specifically, it follows the developments of Dengue fever (DENV) as a result of higher temperatures and abundant precipitations, with a particular focus on the effects of humidity and a warm environment on the proliferation of VBD. To provide evidence of these climate consequences, two empirical cases are analysed and explained, one in Bangladesh and another in Ecuador. Overall, the analysis shows a positive correlation between the increase in temperatures and the changes in the weather and the proliferation of DENV in the above-mentioned territories. This article concludes that the increased temperatures, together with the evolution of extreme weather events have facilitated the reproduction of mosquitoes carrying DENV, and have enlarged the geographic and temporal distribution in which they inhabit. On this basis, the importance of climate change and its effects on human health should be tagged as a primary concern when facing challenges over human security. © 2021, University of Defence, Faculty of Military Health Sciences.

VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SP  - 6798-6809
AB  - In the Southern United States, the widely distributed loblolly pine contributes greatly to lumber and pulp production, as well as providing many important ecosystem services. Climate change may affect the productivity and range of loblolly pine. Nevertheless, we have insufficient knowledge of the adaptive potential and the genetics underlying the adaptability of loblolly pine. To address this, we tested the association of 2.8 million whole exome-based single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with climate and geographic variables, including temperature, precipitation, latitude, longitude, and elevation data. Using an integrative landscape genomics approach by combining multiple environmental association and outlier detection analyses, we identified 611 SNPs associated with 56 climate and geographic variables. Longitude, maximum temperature of the warm months and monthly precipitation associated with most SNPs, indicating their importance and complexity in shaping the genetic variation in loblolly pine. Functions of candidate genes related to terpenoid synthesis, pathogen defense, transcription factors, and abiotic stress response. We provided evidence that environment-associated SNPs also composed the genetic structure of adaptive phenotypic traits including height, diameter, metabolite levels, and gene transcript abundance. Our study promotes understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation in loblolly pine and provides promising tools for selecting genotypes adapted to local environments in a changing climate. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Quantitative mismatch between empirical temperature-size rule slopes and predictions based on oxygen limitation
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - In ectotherms, adult body size commonly declines with increasing environmental temperature, a pattern known as the temperature-size rule. One influential hypothesis explaining this observation is that the challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen to support metabolism becomes greater with increasing body size, and more so at high temperatures. Yet, previous models based on this hypothesis do not account for phenotypic plasticity in the physiology of organisms that counteracts oxygen limitation at high temperature. Here, we model the predicted strength of the temperature-size response using estimates of how both the oxygen supply and demand is affected by temperature when allowing for phenotypic plasticity in the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna. Our predictions remain highly inconsistent with empirical temperature-size responses, with the prior being close to one order of magnitude stronger than the latter. These results fail to provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that oxygen limitation drives temperature-size clines in aquatic ectotherms. Future studies into the role of oxygen limitation should address how the strength of the temperature-size response may be shaped by evolution under fluctuating temperature regimes. Finally, our results caution against applying deterministic models based on the oxygen limitation hypothesis when predicting future changes in ectotherm size distributions under climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Rethinking the extrinsic incubation period of malaria parasites
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The time it takes for malaria parasites to develop within a mosquito, and become transmissible, is known as the extrinsic incubation period, or EIP. EIP is a key parameter influencing transmission intensity as it combines with mosquito mortality rate and competence to determine the number of mosquitoes that ultimately become infectious. In spite of its epidemiological significance, data on EIP are scant. Current approaches to estimate EIP are largely based on temperature-dependent models developed from data collected on parasite development within a single mosquito species in the 1930s. These models assume that the only factor affecting EIP is mean environmental temperature. Here, we review evidence to suggest that in addition to mean temperature, EIP is likely influenced by genetic diversity of the vector, diversity of the parasite, and variation in a range of biotic and abiotic factors that affect mosquito condition. We further demonstrate that the classic approach of measuring EIP as the time at which mosquitoes first become infectious likely misrepresents EIP for a mosquito population. We argue for a better understanding of EIP to improve models of transmission, refine predictions of the possible impacts of climate change, and determine the potential evolutionary responses of malaria parasites to current and future mosquito control tools. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Invasion biology of the cotton mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley: Current knowledge and future directions
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 758-770
AB  - The cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), which is native to North America, emerged as a major invasive insect pest of multiple crops in Asia at the beginning of the 21st century. Considering the economic significance of this insect and its rapid worldwide spread, we examined the possible factors driving its invasions. In this paper, we summarize the life history traits of P. solenopsis conceivably related to population development in invaded regions; these traits include its use of diverse host plants, reproductive capacity and mode, adaptation to temperature, response to food shortage, and insecticidal resistance. Then, focusing on the multiple trophic interactions that may promote or hinder invasion, we review the mutualistic relationship of this mealybug with ants and predation and parasitism by natural enemies. Finally, we suggest topics for future research and provide our perspective on the biological invasions of this mealybug. We speculate that specific biological factors associated with this mealybug, particularly its wide host range, high reproductive potential, evolved changes in life history traits, and mutualism with ants have played important roles in its invasions, allowing this pest to become established and rapidly increase its population upon its introduction into new regions. © 2019 CAAS.

TI  - Temperature fluctuations during development reduce male fitness and may limit adaptive potential in tropical rainforest Drosophila
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 405-415
AB  - Understanding the potential for organisms to tolerate thermal stress through physiological or evolutionary responses is crucial given rapid climate change. Although climate models predict increases in both temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 °C) fluctuating (±3 °C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 °C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 °C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins. Our data suggest that even small increases in temperature variability will threaten tropical ectotherms living close to their upper thermal limits, both through direct effects on fitness and by limiting their adaptive potential. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Adaptations, life-history traits and ecological mechanisms of parasites to survive extremes and environmental unpredictability in the face of climate change
VL  - 12
SP  - 308-317
AB  - Climate change is increasing weather unpredictability, causing more intense, frequent and longer extreme events including droughts, precipitation, and both heat and cold waves. The performance of parasites, and host-parasite interactions, under these unpredictable conditions, are directly influenced by the ability of parasites to cope with extremes and their capacity to adapt to the new conditions. Here, we review some of the structural, behavioural, life history and ecological characteristics of parasitic nematodes that allow them to persist and adapt to extreme and changing environmental conditions. We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on parasitic nematodes in the Arctic, where temperature extremes are pronounced, climate change is happening most rapidly, and changes in host-parasite interactions are already documented. We discuss how life-history traits, phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation and evolutionary history can influence the short and long term response of parasites to new conditions. A detailed understanding of the complex ecological processes involved in the survival of parasites in extreme and changing conditions is a fundamental step to anticipate the impact of climate change in parasite dynamics. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - Growth kinetics of intermetallic compound layers at the interface during laser-assisted bonding depending on surface finish
VL  - 2020
SP  - 1916-1921
AB  - Mass reflow (MR) has been widely used in the interconnecting process of electronic packaging. However, use of conventional MR shows a limitation in the miniaturization trend of electronic devices because of thermal damage to heat- sensitive polymer components from the high process temperature and long bonding time. Furthermore, MR cannot avoid warpage issues because it cannot provide thermal selectivity to the bonding area. These representative problems of MR indicate the need for an advanced bonding process with selectivity and mass product possibility. To meet the requirements of electronic packaging, advanced bonding processes were needed. Laser-assisted bonding (LAB) has been spotlighted as a next-generation interconnection technology to overcome the problems of MR. LAB has extremely fast ramping up speed with accurately controlled wavelength and excellent thermal selectivity. The LAB process could be applied in bonding of flexible, foldable, and even stretchable applications involving a polymer component with a low glass transition temperature. Furthermore, the short process time of LAB could provide not only enhanced productivity, but improvement in mechanical properties as a result of finer grain size and reduction in intermetallic compound (IMC) formation.SAC305 solder paste was printed on two kinds (OSP and ENEPIG) of surface-finished Cu electrode, and MR and LAB processes were performed to create solder joints. The mechanical reliability of solder joint was evaluated with shear test according to the JEDEC standard. Formation and growth of an IMC layer at the interface between SAC solder and Cu after soldering were identified with FESEM. A high- temperature storage test was performed to evaluate the longterm reliability of LAB compared to that of MR. Voids in solder joints were identified by x-ray scanner to compare the soldering processes and surface finish depending on aging time. Smaller IMC layer between solder joint and electrode thickness and fewer voids in solder joints were produced with LAB compared to MR. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - The thermal environment at fertilization mediates adaptive potential in the sea
VL  - 5
IS  - 2
SP  - 154-163
AB  - Additive genetic variation for fitness at vulnerable life stages governs the adaptive potential of populations facing stressful conditions under climate change, and can depend on current conditions as well as those experienced by past stages or generations. For sexual populations, fertilization is the key stage that links one generation to the next, yet the effects of fertilization environment on the adaptive potential at the vulnerable stages that then unfold during development are rarely considered, despite climatic stress posing risks for gamete function and fertility in many taxa and external fertilizers especially. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model exploring the effects of environmental stress at fertilization and development on the adaptive potential in early life. We then test our model with a quantitative genetic breeding design exposing family groups of a marine external fertilizer, the tubeworm Galeolaria caespitosa, to a factorial manipulation of current and projected temperatures at fertilization and development. We find that adaptive potential in early life is substantially reduced, to the point of being no longer detectable, by genotype-specific carryover effects of fertilization under projected warming. We interpret these results in light of our fitness landscape model, and argue that the thermal environment at fertilization deserves more attention than it currently receives when forecasting the adaptive potential of populations confronting climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - An attempt to select non-genetic variation in resistance to starvation and reduced chill coma recovery time in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 221
IS  - 23
AB  - Phenotypic variance is attributed to genetic and non-genetic factors, and only the former are presumed to be inherited and thus suitable for the action of selection. Although increasing amounts of data suggest that non-genetic variability may be inherited, we have limited empirical data in animals. Here, we performed an artificial selection experiment using Drosophila melanogaster inbred lines. We quantified the response to selection for a decrease in chill coma recovery time and an increase in starvation resistance. We observed a weak response to selection in the inbred and outbred lines, with variability across lines. At the end of the selection process, differential expression was detected for some genes associated with epigenetics, the piRNA pathway and canalization functions. As the selection process can disturb the canalization process and increase the phenotypic variance of developmental traits, we also investigated possible effects of the selection process on the number of scutellar bristles, fluctuating asymmetry levels and fitness estimates. These results suggest that, contrary to what was shown in plants, selection of non-genetic variability is not straightforward in Drosophila and appears to be strongly genotype dependent. © 2018.

TI  - Summer is coming! tackling ocean warming in atlantic salmon cage farming
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) cage farming has traditionally been located at higher latitudes where cold seawater temperatures favor this practice. However, these regions can be impacted by ocean warming and heat waves that push seawater temperature beyond the thermo-tolerance limits of this species. As more mass mortality events are reported every year due to abnormal sea temperatures, the Atlantic salmon cage aquaculture industry acknowledges the need to adapt to a changing ocean. This paper reviews adult Atlantic salmon thermal tolerance limits, as well as the deleterious eco-physiological consequences of heat stress, with emphasis on how it negatively affects sea cage aquaculture production cycles. Biotechnological solutions targeting the phenotypic plasticity of Atlantic salmon and its genetic diversity, particularly that of its southernmost populations at the limit of its natural zoogeographic distribution, are discussed. Some of these solutions include selective breeding programs, which may play a key role in this quest for a more thermotolerant strain of Atlantic salmon that may help the cage aquaculture industry to adapt to climate uncertainties more rapidly, without compromising profitability. Omics technologies and precision breeding, along with cryopreservation breakthroughs, are also part of the available toolbox that includes other solutions that can allow cage farmers to continue to produce Atlantic salmon in the warmer waters of the oceans of tomorrow. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 78
IS  - 11
SP  - 4471-4479
AB  - BACKGROUND: The whitefly Bemisia tabaci causes severe damage to cultivated tomato plants, but actively avoids the wild tomato Solanum habrochaites. Moreover, the mortality of whitefly increases significantly after feeding with the wild tomato. However, additional experiments are warranted to more carefully elucidate the specific molecular elements underlying the interaction between whitefly and wild tomato. RESULTS: Our results showed that S. habrochaites significantly increases the mortality of whitefly adults and decreases both their fertility and fecundity. In addition, the expression of stress-response genes in whitefly after exposure to S. habrochaites was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was conducted to identify the hub genes to determine their potential associations with the mortality of whitefly. These results suggested that the expression of heat-shock protein (HSP), multicopper oxidase, and 2-Oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) decarboxylase genes were induced in whitefly. To validate the gene associations with whitefly mortality, a high-throughput in vivo model system and RNAi-based gene silencing were used. The results revealed that the RNAi-mediated depletion of the HSP gene, which belongs to the HSP70 subfamily, increased the mortality of whitefly. Furthermore, the selection pressure analysis showed that a total of five amino acid sites of positive selection were identified, three of which were located in the nucleotide-binding domain and the other two in the substrate-binding domain. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on the potential implication of HSPs in whitefly–wild plant interactions. This study could more precisely identify the molecular mechanisms of whitefly in response to wild tomatoes. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - To test the general assumption that global warming will induce body size reduction in aquatic organisms, we used a system of lakes continually heated for six decades by warm water discharge from power plants. Their temperature elevation of 3–4°C corresponds with climate change forecasts for the end of the 21st century. We compared body size and reproduction of Daphnia longispina complex communities inhabiting heated and non-heated (control) lakes nearby. No difference in body size was found, but Daphnia communities from heated lakes had a wider thermal breadth for reproduction. The two lake groups varied in the taxonomic composition of Daphnia communities. Thus, to disentangle inter- and intraspecific sources of variation, and to examine evolution vs. phenotypic plasticity of investigated traits, we performed two life history experiments: (1) a between-species experiment compared D. galeata inhabiting heated lakes with D. longispina typical of nearby control lakes, under three temperature regimes; (2) a within-species experiment compared D. galeata from heated lakes with conspecifics from high latitude (cold control) and low latitude (warm control) lakes, under two temperature regimes. The experiments revealed countergradient variation: environmental constraints on body size in situ concealed evolution of larger potential body size in Daphnia from heated lakes. In turn, evolution of increased body size plasticity resulted in an efficient resource allocation trade-off: more effective reproduction at high temperature, at the cost of size reduction. We suggest that large size is adaptive during active overwintering, while plastic size reduction is a coping strategy for high temperatures. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Is extreme climate or moderate climate more conducive to longevity in China?
VL  - 62

SP  - 971-977
AB  - Climate is closely related to human longevity. In China, there are many climate types. According to national population censuses from 1982 to 2000, most provinces with a high ratio of centenarians are located in western and northwestern China far from the sea; these areas are characterized by a dry, cold climate, very high altitude, very high daily temperature range, strong winds, and partial hypoxia. Meanwhile, provinces with a high ratio of nonagenarians from 1982 to 2000 are located in southern China near the sea. Previous studies have attributed the high ratio of centenarians in western and northwestern China to the extreme local climate. However, centenarians in these areas decreased greatly in 2010, whereas residents in southern China frequently reached 90 to 100 years old in 2010. This study aims to explain this strange phenomenon and find whether extreme climate in Tibetan plateau and northwestern China or moderate climate in southern China is more conducive to longevity. The study found that mortality rate in Tibetan plateau is much higher than southern China, then a population evolution experiment was proposed to compare longevity indicators between low mortality rate and high mortality rate and shows that longevity indicators will decrease in the near future and increase above their original levels after several decades when the mortality rate is decreased. Results of this study show individuals in northwestern China do not live as long as those in eastern and southern China. A moderate climate is more conducive to longevity than extreme climate in China. The longevity of a region should be judged by long-term longevity indicators. © 2018, ISB.

VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 111-116
AB  - We conducted a study of the peculiarities of the motor activity of juvenile and adult individuals of Daphnia magna in the process of thermal selection. On the example of Daphnia, we experimentally proved the assumption that the decrease in the motor activity of the ectotherms in the selected temperature range is a behaviour mechanism typical for thermal selection. The experiment was conducted on the offspring of one parthenogenetic female (pure line) of a laboratory culture maintained over several years at room temperature. The Daphnia individuals had been beforehand acclimated over several generations to 23.4 ºС, and then were placed in a thermogradient apparatus. The control individuals were maintained at room temperature. The final temperature preference was determined using the so-called "chronic" method, when the tested organisms are maintained in a thermogradient apparatus over several days. The positions of the Daphnia individuals were recorded daily during 24 days. As a parameter which would characterize the motor activity of Daphnia, we used the parameter of average relative shifting, which was calculated as a difference (in cm) between the position they were found in two sequential records, divided by time (in min) between these records. Over the first 3 days, in the conditions of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia mostly selected heightened temperatures (24–28 ºС). During the period from the 4th to 24th day, 74% of the Daphnia selected the range of 18–23 ºС and 85% – 17–24 ºС. Thus, the range of the ultimate selected temperatures decreased by 4 ºС compared to the initially selected temperatures and enlarged by 3 ºС towards the lower temperatures. In the thermogradient apparatus, the parthenogenetic females had the lowest value of the mean relative movement. In the control, at room temperature, this parameter of the adults was by 43% higher compared to the gradient. The pattern of the dynamic of the indicator in both variants of the experiment was similar for the periods and phases of fluctuations. With the juveniles the value of the parameter of mean relative shifting in the gradient was higher by 40% compared to the adult Daphnia, but close to the parameter of the adults in the control. We determined a relationship between the juveniles selecting the higher temperatures and higher mean relative shifting, which indicates a relationship between the behavioural selective reaction of juvenile Daphnia and general physiological condition of their organism. During the absence of the temperature gradient, the Daphnia were observed to show symmetry in their motor reaction. Occurrence of the asymmetry of the motor reaction of the Daphnia in the condition of the thermogradient, manifesting in the prevalence of shifting to lower or higher temperatures, can indicate more clearly manifested search reaction in the condition of a non-uniform environment. © 2018 Oles Honchar Dnipro National University.

VL  - 27

AB  - Scleractinian corals occur in tropical regions near their upper thermal limits and are severely threatened by rising ocean temperatures. However, several recent studies have shown coral populations can harbour genetic variation in thermal tolerance. Here, we have extended these approaches to study heat tolerance of corals in the Persian/Arabian Gulf, where heat-tolerant local populations experience extreme summer temperatures (up to 36°C). To evaluate whether selection has depleted genetic variation in thermal tolerance, estimate potential future adaptive responses and understand the functional basis for these corals’ unusual heat tolerance, we conducted controlled crosses in the Gulf coral Platygyra daedalea. Heat tolerance is highly heritable in this population (h 2  = 0.487–0.748), suggesting substantial potential for adaptive responses to selection for elevated temperatures. To identify genetic markers associated with this variation, we conducted genomewide SNP genotyping in parental corals and tested for relationships between paternal genotype and offspring thermal tolerance. Resulting multilocus SNP genotypes explained a large fraction of variation in thermal tolerance in these crosses (69%). To investigate the functional basis of these differences in thermal tolerance, we profiled transcriptional responses in tolerant and susceptible families, revealing substantial sire effects on transcriptional responses to thermal stress. We also studied sequence variation in these expressed sequences, identifying alleles and functional groups of differentially expressed genes associated with thermal tolerance. Our findings demonstrate that corals in this population harbour extensive genetic variation in thermal tolerance, and heat-tolerant phenotypes differ in both gene sequences and transcriptional stress responses from their susceptible counterparts. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - In the complex granular flow, the shear and flow of particles lead to increase in temperature that can enchain behavioral modifications. However, their thermo-mechanical and electrical behavior is of great interest for applications such as rail transport, grinding, and granular material reproduction systems. To study these behaviors, a numerical experiment is carried out on a rotating drum model. This device makes it possible to generate continuous and controlled free surface flows. Relying on the NSCD approach, the location of the hottest zone and the evolution of the temperature are correlated with the evolution of the velocity field. © 2019 AFM, EDP Sciences.

VL  - 53

SP  - 1121-1133
AB  - Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are thermal specialists, having evolved in aseasonal thermal environments. However, even within the tropics, habitat structure can influence opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. Open (and edge) habitats likely promote more effective thermoregulation due to the high spatial heterogeneity of the thermal landscape, while forests are thermally homogenous and may constrain opportunities for behavioral buffering of environmental temperatures. Nevertheless, the ways in which behavior and physiology interact at local scales to influence the response to climate change are rarely investigated. We examined the thermal ecology and physiology of two lizard species that occupy distinct environments in the tropics. The brown anole lizard (Anolis sagrei) lives along forest edges in The Bahamas, whereas the Panamanian slender anole (Anolis apletophallus) lives under the canopy of mature forests in Panama. We combined detailed estimates of environmental variation, thermoregulatory behavior, and physiology to model the vulnerability of each of these species. Our projections suggest that forest-dwelling slender anoles will experience severely reduced locomotor performance, activity time, and energy budgets as the climate warms over the coming century. Conversely, the forest-edge-dwelling brown anoles may use behavioral compensation in the face of warming, maintaining population viability for many decades. Our results indicate that local habitat variation, through its effects on behavior and physiology, is a major determinant of vulnerability to climate change. When attempting to predict the impacts of climate change on a given population, broad-scale characteristics such as latitude may have limited predictive power. © 2021 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

TI  - Leptogenesis and fermion mass fit in a renormalizable SO(10) model
VL  - 2021
IS  - 12
AB  - A non-supersymmetric renormalizable SO(10) model is investigated for its viability in explaining the observed fermion masses and mixing parameters along with the baryon asymmetry produced via thermal leptogenesis. The Yukawa sector of the model consists of complex 10H and 126 ¯ H scalars with a Peccei-Quinn like symmetry and it leads to strong correlations among the Yukawa couplings of all the standard model fermions including the couplings and masses of the right-handed (RH) neutrinos. The latter implies the necessity to include the second lightest RH neutrino and flavor effects for the precision computation of leptogenesis. We use the most general density matrix equations to calculate the temperature evolution of flavoured leptonic asymmetry. A simplified analytical solution of these equations, applicable to the RH neutrino spectrum predicted in the model, is also obtained which allows one to fit the observed baryon to photon ratio along with the other fermion mass observables in a numerically efficient way. The analytical and numerical solutions are found to be in agreement within a factor of O(1). We find that the successful leptogenesis in this model does not prefer any particular value for leptonic Dirac and Majorana CP phases and the entire range of values of these observables is found to be consistent. The model specifically predicts (a) the lightest neutrino mass mv1 between 2–8 meV, (b) the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay mββ between 4–10 meV, and (c) a particular correlation between the Dirac and one of the Majorana CP phases. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Effect of Application of Different Activation Media on Fertilization and Embryo Survival of Northern Pike, (Esox lucius) under Hatchery Conditions
VL  - 12
IS  - 8
AB  - One of the finfish species that European and North American breeders are most interested in is the northern pike, Esox lucius. Artificial reproduction and the production of viable larvae has a huge impact on further culture. The quality of stripped gametes is highly variable. Therefore, it is important to use gametes with maximum efficiency, which has a direct impact on the amount of stocking material produced and therefore on the economics of production. The aim of this study was to compare northern pike fertilization efficiency, expressed as the survival rate of embryos until hatching. In the first experiment, the highest percentage of hatched embryos was observed in groups of eggs fertilized in a saline diluent prepared with deionized water (after reverse osmosis: group D), at 61.2% and 56.5% in the NaCl5-D and NaCl6-D groups, respectively. The highest percentage of hatched embryos in the second experiment was observed in the egg groups activated with Woynarovich solution (V) at 75.5% and 74.7% for V-D (D—deionized water) and V-T (T—tap water), respectively. In all cases, preparing the activation medium using T versus D water resulted in lower fertilization percentages and lower percentages of hatched larvae. At the same time, two variants (V and B1— Billard solution) were tested during mass spawning in three hatcheries using hatchery water (tap water). The results showed that repeatability was the highest when using activation medium B1. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 825

SP  - 189-196
AB  - In this study, we used a comparative transcriptomic approach using 35nt paired-end reads from three individuals each from two highly divergent lineages of the Australian freshwater shrimp, Paratya australiensis. The two lineages are widespread and largely sympatric in many regions; however, they occupy slightly differing habitats within respective river systems. From BLAST searches, we were able to identify 50 genes, based on gene ontology, involved in temperature tolerance, egg size control and more broadly osmoregulation, as well as genes associated with reproduction and life history characteristics predicted to be associated with adaptation to local aquatic environments. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 660 highly differentially expressed transcripts between the populations. Divergence in SNPs detected in the two lineages was consistent with the level of neutral divergence found in previous studies, but they appear not to correlate with differentially expressed candidate genes. However, we hypothesise that the 2554 filtered SNPs identified in this study will continue to further our understanding of how these lineages have evolved and adapted to their respective habitats and will contribute to further our interpretation of the enigmatic biogeographical history of the species. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Climatic factors shape plastic trade-offs in the polyphenic black scavenger fly Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae)
VL  - 45
IS  - 3
SP  - 593-603
AB  - Aim: Trade-offs allow individuals to optimize their fitness by tailoring the investment into different traits to variable environmental conditions, such as along geographical gradients. Trade-offs thus can help in adjusting to changing thermal and insolation profiles, especially in small ectotherms, whose body temperature typically follows environmental temperatures closely. Two traits usually involved in latitudinal adaptation are body size and melanism. Since both traits are costly, individuals need to optimize investment into each trait. Here, we studied how environmental factors influence this trade-off in the short and long-term. Location: Europe. Methods: We raised flies from 15 latitudinal populations at three constant temperatures in a laboratory common garden to differentiate plastic and evolutionary responses to temperature. We further analysed how the different insolation components of the populations’ habitats influenced the evolution of the trade-off. Results: Male Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae) feature a sigmoid relationship between melanism and body size, defining two strikingly different male morphs: obsidian (small and black) and amber (large and orange). This relationship was altered by the developmental temperature, documenting its plasticity. The relationship further evolved across populations in response to the environmental characteristics of their habitat, notably temperature, insolation and UV radiation, suggesting that plasticity also has an underlying genetic basis. Nevertheless, melanism, but not body size, merely slightly increased with latitude. Main conclusions: As the plastic and evolutionary responses of the relationship to temperature differed, plasticity does not necessarily follow the direction of evolution of this trade-off, but rather adds to it. Our study evinces the role of several environmental factors in shaping the evolution of a plastic melanism—body size relationship defining a rare male polymorphism in temperate sepsid flies. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - To identify the sedimentary environment characteristics and the genesis of black rocks in Upper Permian Dalong Formation, Hefeng area, Hubei province, the detailed element geochemistry of black rocks was analyzed in Well HD1. The results show that the reducing environment of Dalong Formation is the key control factor of organic matter enrichment. The early sedimentary was relatively stable as the reducing environment with lean oxygen and rich H 2 S, while the mid-late sedimentary presented the oxygen lean-oxygen deficit environment with significant fluctuations. In the sedimentary period of Dalong Formation, the upwelling development provided a lot of nutrient-rich materials, leading to the oxygen deficit environment in sedimentary water mass and the high paleo-productivity. The upwelling of thermal water along the contemporaneous faults had no adverse effect on the development of shale gas, which mainly caused the formation of authigenic dolomite and albite, the dissolution and re-cementation of siliceous organisms and the promotion of thermal evolution on organic matters. The layered silicalite locally developed in Dalong Formation are of two genetic types, i. e., biological genesis and authigenic chemical precipitation. © 2018, Editorial Office of ACTA PETROLEI SINICA.

TI  - Compounding Effects of Climate Warming and Antibiotic Resistance
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
AB  - Bacteria have evolved diverse mechanisms to survive environments with antibiotics. Temperature is both a key factor that affects the survival of bacteria in the presence of antibiotics and an environmental trait that is drastically increasing due to climate change. Therefore, it is timely and important to understand links between temperature changes and selection of antibiotic resistance. This review examines these links by synthesizing results from laboratories, hospitals, and environmental studies. First, we describe the transient physiological responses to temperature that alter cellular behavior and lead to antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Second, we focus on the link between thermal stress and the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance mutations. Finally, we explore how local and global changes in temperature are associated with increases in antibiotic resistance and its spread. We suggest that a multidisciplinary, multiscale approach is critical to fully understand how temperature changes are contributing to the antibiotic crisis. © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Artificial selection to a nonlethal cold stress in trogoderma variabile shows associations with chronic cold stress and body size
VL  - 49

SP  - 422-434
AB  - Extreme temperature has been used as an alternative to chemical treatments for stored product pests for years. Resistance to heat or cold treatments has not been documented in stored product insects, but repeated use of ineffective treatments could lead to adaptive tolerance. Trogoderma variabile (Dermestidae) is a common pest of stored products, and the larval stage is highly resistant to cold and destructive.We artificially selected populations by inducing chill coma at four different cold temperature treatments: 3 and 5 h at −10°C and 3 and 5 h at 0°C. Recovery time was highly heritable after selection for seven generations for decreased recovery time (cold tolerance) and increased recovery time (cold susceptibility) at all time and temperature combinations.Three replicate populations for each time and temperature combination varied substantially, suggesting different mutations in each population were probably responsible for selected phenotypes. Body size decreased in populations selected for cold susceptibility compared with those selected for cold tolerance and survivorship to long-term cold stress increased in the cold-tolerant populations compared with the susceptible populations. After the cessation of the selection experiment, cold tolerance dissipated within four generations from the populations at −10°C, but was maintained in populations exposed to 0°C. Our results suggest that warehouse beetles can adapt to cold stress quickly, but in the absence of cold stress, the proportion of cold-tolerant/susceptible individuals is quickly reduced, suggesting that some of the mutations responsible for these phenotypes may be associated with fitness costs under normal conditions. © 2020 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - 2la paracentric chromosomal inversion and overexpressed metabolic genes enhance thermotolerance and pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector anopheles gambiae
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
AB  - Simple Summary While shifts in temperature may promote the spread of insects, exacerbating the intensity of vector-borne diseases like malaria, very high temperatures exert deleterious effects in insect vectors, forcing them to evolve/adapt genetically. These genetic adaptations may facilitate insecticide resistance through common genes involved in both processes. Here, the impact of thermal tolerance on pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.l. from four localities spanning the savanna and sub-Sahel of northern Nigeria was investigated. In all four localities, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the only malaria vectors found. The populations were highly thermotolerant, with similar to 50% of mosquitoes in two sites surviving 44 degrees C. Thermotolerant larvae and adult mosquitoes (survivors of 44 degrees C) were significantly more resistant to permethrin, suggesting that prior heat-hardening facilitates insecticide resistance. Thermal tolerance and permethrin resistance were found to be associated with the 2La rearrangement (a form of chromosomal inversion). Transcriptional analysis revealed six major genes commonly overexpressed in the highly thermotolerant mosquitoes and those resistant to permethrin, suggesting common mechanisms involved in thermotolerance and insecticide resistance. These findings highlight challenges associated with insecticide-based malaria vector control, stressing the need to take environmental variables and other pleiotropic mechanisms into account for the choice of control measures. Changes in global temperature are impacting the spread/intensity of vector-borne diseases, including malaria, and accelerating evolutionary/adaptive changes in vector species. These changes, including chromosomal inversions and overexpression and/or changes in allele frequencies of thermotolerance-associated genes, may facilitate insecticide resistance through pleiotropy. This study investigated the impact of thermotolerance on pyrethroid resistance in four populations of the malaria vector An. gambiae s.l., from the savanna/sub-Sahel of northern Nigeria. Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. were the only malaria vectors found, sympatric in all the sites, with the former species predominant. High thermotolerance was observed, with no mortality at 38 degrees C, and LT50 of similar to 44 degrees C. Significantly high permethrin resistance was observed (mortality < 50%) in 44 degrees C heat-hardened (exposure to an intermediately high temperature provides protection to a more severe temperature or insecticide) larvae from two sites, BUK and Pantami, compared with the control, and heat-hardened adult females from Auyo (mortality = 3.00% +/- 1.20, chi(2) = 5.83, p < 0.01) compared with the control (12.00% +/- 4.65). The 2La chromosomal inversion was detected at similar to 50% in subset of larvae and 58% in subset of adult females genotyped. A significant association was observed (OR = 7.2, p < 0.03) between permethrin resistance and the 2La/+(a) rearrangement compared with 2L+(a)/+(a), in BUK larvae. For all sites, permethrin resistance correlated with 2La/a homozygosity in adult females (R = 5.02, p = 0.01). qRT-PCR identified six genes commonly induced/overexpressed, including the heat shock protein 70 (AGAP004581) which was 2468x and 5x overexpressed in heat-hardened and permethrin-resistant females, respectively; trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (AGAP008227); and the ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, IR25a (AGAP010272) and IR21a (AGAP008511). This study highlights challenges associated with insecticide-based malaria vector control, and the epidemiological significance of taking climate variables into account for the design/choice of control measures.

TI  - Comparison of the sensitivity as optical temperature sensor of nano-perovskite doped with Nd3+ ions in the first and second biological windows
VL  - 255
SP  - 970-976
AB  - The temperature evolution of the infrared luminescence of yttrium orthoaluminate nano-perovskite, doped with 1.0 mol% of Nd3+ ions, was analyzed in order to check its viability as optical thermal sensor in the well-known "near infrared biological windows" of the human tissue. For this purpose, the dependences of the emission bands of the (H-2(9/2), F-4(5/2)), F-4(3/2) -> I-4(9/2) transitions from RT up to 610 K and the emission band of the F-4(3/2) -> I-4(3/2) transition from RT up to 370 K for the first and second biological windows respectively, were measured and calibrated as functions of the temperature. From the calibration procedure of the optical sensor in the first biological window, the maximum value of the relative sensitivity was obtained and compared with others Nd-based optical sensors of the literature, showing a notable sensitivity. In addition, the relative sensitivity in the second biological window at RT was almost twice higher than the obtained one in the first biological window at the same temperature, showing a high sensitivity of the nano-perovskite in the biophysical temperature range (30-45 degrees C). Moreover, it has been studied among the emission sub-tissue penetration depth through a phantom tissue, taking advantage of the emission of Nd3+ in the second biological window. These results show the potential use of the yttrium orthoaluminate nano-perovskite doped with 1.0 mol% of Nd+3 for both sub-tissue luminescence imaging and luminescence-based thermal sensing.

TI  - Cold Tolerance in Pinewood Nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus Promoted Multiple Invasion Events in Mid-Temperate Zone of China
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
AB  - Pinewood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is a highly destructive invasive species, causing extensive economic and ecological losses across Eurasia. It has recently invaded mid-temperate zone of northern China, threating large areas of coniferous forests. Herein, we evaluated the physiological and molecular basis of cold tolerance in pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones of China. After exposure to −5 °C and −10 °C, the survival rates of five pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones were 93.94%–94.77% and 43.26%–45.58% after 8 h, and 93.04%–94.85% and 9.93%–10.56% after 24 h, without significant differences among isolates. In a comparison of an isolate from a mid-temperate zone and an isolate from a subtropical zone under gradient cooling, the survival rates remained steady at nearly 95% when minimum temperature ranged from −5 °C to −15 °C, with no significant difference between isolates. In addition, phylogenetic and population structure analyses based on whole genome resequencing data suggested that isolates from mid-temperate and warm temperate zones are clustered with different isolates from subtropical zone, with no obvious geographic pattern. We did not detect significant variation in cold tolerance ability and selected gene among pinewood nematode isolates from different temperature zones. The recently invaded pinewood nematodes in the mid-temperate zone of northern China may spread by multiple invasion events from southern China, without adaptive revolution. Our research implies that it is important to reinforce quarantine inspection to control the rapid spread of pinewood nematode. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of semi-constant temperature on embryonic and hatchling phenotypes of six-tubercled Amazon River turtles, Podocnemis sextuberculata
VL  - 108
AB  - Purpose: We evaluated how constant incubation temperatures affect life-history traits pre-hatching and post-hatching of the six-tubercled Amazon River turtle, Podocnemis sextuberculata. Methods: We incubated eggs from natural nests at ten semi-constant temperatures between 22.26 ± 1.01 °C and 37.37 ± 0.38°C (2013) and at six temperatures between 25.75 ± 0.22 °C and 36.17 ± 0.15°C (2016). In 2013, we raised hatchling for 90 days to evaluate effects of temperature on early hatchling growth. We evaluated maternal effects in 2016. Results: P. sextuberculata displays temperature-dependent sex determination and produces males at colder and females at warmer temperatures (TSD Ia). The estimated pivotal temperature was 33.73 ± 0.15 °C and the transitional range of temperatures (TRT) 1.16 ± 0.59 °C. Semi-constant temperatures below 26 °C and above 38 °C were lethal. Intermediate temperatures (32.25 °C and 31.5 °C, respectively) were optimal for hatching success and produced larger hatchlings that grew slower early in life compared to colder or warmer conditions, which produced smaller hatchlings. Warmer incubation temperatures within the optimal range (28°C–37 °C) accelerated embryonic development. In contrast, comparisons of 30, 60 and 90 days-old suggests that warmer incubation temperatures reduced growth and mass gain rates post-hatching, such that incubation temperature effects on body size at emergence disappeared by 3 months of age. Conclusions: Six-tubercled Amazon River turtles showed the highest pivotal temperature reported for any turtle. The relatively narrow TRT may limit the evolutionary potential of this vulnerable turtle in the face of global warming. Future incubation experiments at a finer scale (33°C–36 °C) are warranted to refine the sex-ratio reaction norm. Field studies that monitor natural nests are imperative to evaluate conservation measures and the effect of female-biased illegal hunting and climate change. By providing data about the thermal biology of an understudied lineage of non-model species, our study helps fill gaps in our understanding of the evolution of vertebrate sex determination and its potential adaptive value. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 329

SP  - 185-190
AB  - Body size is a fundamental trait correlated with nearly every aspect of animal life. It is influenced by numerous genetic and non-genetic factors. Despite its central importance, proximate mechanisms of intra- and interspecific variability in body size are still not well understood even in such a largely studied group as reptiles. For our study, we concentrated on the gecko species Paroedura picta. We investigated whether differences in sexual size dimorphism and in final and asymptotic snout-vent length (induced by a range of incubation and rearing temperatures) are correlated with differences in the number of presacral vertebrae. Moreover, we tested whether changes in this number were associated with evolutionary changes in sexual size dimorphism and body size in the genus Paroedura. We found that the variation in the number of presacral vertebrae is very limited both intra- and interspecifically, ranging between 26 and 28 vertebrae with most individuals possessing the modal number of 27. We conclude that changes in the number of vertebrae do not contribute to developmental plasticity or evolutionary changes in body size nor, in contrast to some other squamate lineages, to sexual size dimorphism. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Aerobic scope does matter in the temperature–size rule, but only under optimal conditions
VL  - 224
IS  - 23
AB  - We united theoretical predictions of the factors responsible for the evolutionary significance of the temperature–size rule (TSR). We assumed that (i) the TSR is a response to temperature-dependent oxic conditions, (ii) body size decrease is a consequence of cell shrinkage in response to hypoxia, (iii) this response enables organisms to maintain a wide scope for aerobic performance, and (iv) it prevents a decrease in fitness. We examined three clones of the rotifer Lecane inermis exposed to three experimental regimes: mild hypoxia, severe hypoxia driven by too high of a temperature, and severe hypoxia driven by an inadequate oxygen concentration. We compared the following traits in normoxia- and hypoxia-exposed rotifers: nuclear size (a proxy for cell size), body size, specific dynamic action (SDA, a proxy of aerobic metabolism) and two fitness measures, the population growth rate and eggs/female ratio. The results showed that (i) under mildly hypoxic conditions, our causative reasoning was correct, except that one of the clones decreased in body size without a decrease in nuclear size, and (ii) in more stressful environments, rotifers exhibited clone- and condition-specific responses, which were equally successful in terms of fitness levels. Our results indicate the importance of the testing conditions. The important conclusions were that (i) a body size decrease at higher temperatures enabled the maintenance of a wide aerobic scope under clone-specific, thermally optimal conditions, and (ii) this response was not the only option to prevent fitness reduction under hypoxia. © 2021.

TI  - Climate change alters plant–herbivore interactions
VL  - 229
IS  - 4
SP  - 1894-1910
AB  - Plant–herbivore interactions have evolved in response to coevolutionary dynamics, along with selection driven by abiotic conditions. We examine how abiotic factors influence trait expression in both plants and herbivores to evaluate how climate change will alter this long-standing interaction. The paleontological record documents increased herbivory during periods of global warming in the deep past. In phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses, we find that elevated temperatures, CO2 concentrations, drought stress and nutrient conditions directly and indirectly induce greater food consumption by herbivores. Additionally, elevated CO2 delays herbivore development, but increased temperatures accelerate development. For annual plants, higher temperatures, CO2 and drought stress increase foliar herbivory. Our meta-analysis also suggests that greater temperatures and drought may heighten florivory in perennials. Human actions are causing concurrent shifts in CO2, temperature, precipitation regimes and nitrogen deposition, yet few studies evaluate interactions among these changing conditions. We call for additional multifactorial studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple climatic factors, which will enable us to generate more robust predictions of how climate change could disrupt plant–herbivore interactions. Finally, we consider how shifts in insect and plant phenology and distribution patterns could lead to ecological mismatches, and how these changes may drive future adaptation and coevolution between interacting species. © 2020 The Authors New Phytologist © 2020 New Phytologist Foundation

TI  - Sperm competition in yellow dung flies: No consistent effect of sperm size
VL  - 35
IS  - 10
SP  - 1309-1318
AB  - The male competition for fertilization that results from female multiple mating promotes the evolution of increased sperm numbers and can impact sperm morphology, with theory predicting that longer sperm can at times be advantageous during sperm competition. If so, males with longer sperm should sire more offspring than competitors with shorter sperm. Few studies have directly tested this prediction, and findings are inconsistent. Here we assessed whether longer sperm provide a competitive advantage in the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae). Initially, we let brothers with different temperature-mediated mean sperm lengths compete – thus minimizing confounding effects of genetic background – and found no clear advantage of longer sperm. We then used flies from lines subjected to bidirectional selection on phenoloxidase activity that had shown correlated evolutionary responses in sperm and female spermathecal duct lengths. This experiment also yielded no main effect of sperm size on siring success. Instead, there was a trend for a shorter-sperm advantage, but only when competing in females with longer spermathecal ducts. Our data corroborated many previously reported findings (last-male precedence, effects of copula duration and body size), suggesting our failure to find sperm size effects is not inherently due to our experimental protocols. We conclude that longer sperm are not competitively superior in yellow dung flies under most circumstances, and that, consistent with previous work, in this species competitive fertilization success is primarily determined by the relative numbers of sperm competing. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Modeling pre-spawning fitness and optimal climate of spotted snakehead Channa punctata (Bloch, 1793) from a Gangetic floodplain wetland of West Bengal, India
VL  - 64

AB  - The spawning and well-being of fish in an ecosystem are closely linked to climatic cues, viz., temperature and rainfall. Reduced fitness can affect the reproductive performance and lead to skipped spawning. Benchmarking the threshold fitness required for a fish population to achieve readiness for spawning, and understanding how climatic parameters influence the fitness will aid in predicting the fate of its reproductive success in future climatic conditions. This study determined the threshold condition factor pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn50) at which 50% of the female Channa punctata population can be deemed fit for spawning. The optimal climate within which pre-spawning fitness is attained by this species under Indian climatic conditions was also identified. The study was conducted from June 2015 to September 2016, covering two spawning seasons (June–August) in a Gangetic floodplain wetland of West Bengal, India. The non-parametric Kaplan–Meier method (survival fit) was used for estimation of pre-spawning fitness. “Ready to spawn” females were classified based on binary coding of the gonadal maturity stages. The thermal and precipitation range within which spawning fitness is achieved was identified by using the locally weighted smoothing technique. Female C. punctata pre-spawning fitness (Kspawn50) ranged from 1.26 to 1.39 with an estimated median of 1.29 units. Temperatures between 29 and 32 °C and rainfall above 100 mm were conducive to attaining the requisite pre-spawning fitness in C. punctata. This is the first study benchmarking the pre-spawning fitness and optimal climate for C. punctata. Understanding spawning requirements can inform the climate change–induced impacts on reproductive plasticity and evolutionary adaptations of snakeheads in the Ganga river basin. © 2020, ISB.

TI  - Macroclimatic and maternal effects on the evolution of reproductive traits in lizards
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Much of life-history theory rests on fundamental assumptions about constraints on the acquisition and allocation of energy to growth and reproduction. In general, the allocation of energy to reproduction depends on maternal size, which in turn depends on environmental factors experienced throughout the life of the mother. Here, we used phylogenetic path analyses to evaluate competing hypotheses about the environmental and maternal drivers of reproductive traits in lizards. In doing so, we discovered that precipitation, rather than temperature, has shaped the evolution of the life history. Specifically, environments with greater rainfall have enabled the evolution of larger maternal size. In turn, these larger mothers produce larger clutches of larger offspring. However, annual precipitation has a negative direct effect on offspring size, despite the positive indirect effect mediated by maternal size. Possibly, the evolution of offspring size was driven by the need to conserve water in dry environments, because small organisms are particularly sensitive to water loss. Since we found that body size variation among lizards is related to a combination of climatic factors, mainly precipitation and perhaps primary production, our study challenges previous generalizations (e.g., temperature-size rule and Bergmann's rule) and suggests alternative mechanisms underlying the evolution of body size. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Transcriptional homogenization of Lactobacillus rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 under heat stress and oxidative stress
VL  - 104
IS  - 6
SP  - 2611-2621
AB  - Cross-adaptation, which can improve the stress tolerance of strains, temporarily supplies more matching bases in transcriptome-phenotype matching approaches to reveal novel gene functions in stress responses. Transcriptome-phenotype matching based on RNA sequencing was implemented to reveal the cross-adaptation mechanism of Lactobacillus rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 in response to heat stress and oxidative stress. A total of 242 genes were upregulated and 320 genes were downregulated under heat stress, while 135 genes were upregulated and 206 genes were downregulated under oxidative stress. There were 154 overlapping genes that responded to both stresses, and 97.4% of the overlapping DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were codirectionally regulated. The overlapping DEGs were mainly classified into amino acid or oligopeptide ABC transporters, amino acid metabolism, and quorum sensing pathways. Correspondingly, the heat and oxidative tolerance of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 was stronger in low nitrogen source environment. Thus, the high proportion of transcriptional homogenization, especially the decrease in abundance of nitrogen source transporter and metabolism enzyme genes, was a reason for the cross-adaptation of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 to heat stress and oxidative stress. The survival rate of L. rhamnosus during processes with heat stress and oxidative stress can be improved by reducing the concentration of nitrogen source in the culture medium. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Integrating morphological and genetic data at different spatial scales in a cosmopolitan marine turtle species: Challenges for management and conservation
VL  - 191
IS  - 2
SP  - 434-453
AB  - Patterns of genetic structure in highly mobile marine vertebrates may be accompanied by phenotypic variation. Most studies in marine turtles focused on population genetic structure have been performed at rookeries. We studied whether genetic and morphological variation of the endangered green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is consistent geographically, focusing on foraging grounds. An association between population genetic structure and body shape variation at broad (inter-lineage) and fine (foraging grounds) scales was predicted and analysed using mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometrics. Although genetic and phenotypic differentiation patterns were congruent between lineages, no fine-scale association was found, suggesting adaptive divergence. Connectivity among Pacific foraging grounds found here suggests that temperatures of ocean surface currents may influence the genetic structure of C. mydas on a broad scale. Our results suggest that vicariance, dispersal, life-history traits and ecological conditions operating in foraging grounds have shaped the intraspecific morphology and genetic diversity of this species. Considering a range of geographic and temporal scales is useful when management strategies are required for cosmopolitan species. Integrating morphological and genetic tools at different spatial scales, conservation management is proposed based on protection of neutral and adaptive diversity. This approach opens new questions and challenges, especially regarding conservation genetics in cosmopolitan species. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

TI  - Cold-adaptive evolution at the reproductive stage in Geng/japonica subspecies reveals the role of OsMAPK3 and OsLEA9
VL  - 111
IS  - 4
SP  - 1032-1051
AB  - Cold stress at the reproductive stage severely affects the production and geographic distribution of rice. The Geng/japonica subpopulation gradually developed stronger cold adaptation than the Xian/indica subpopulation during the long-term domestication of cultivated rice. However, the evolutionary path and natural alleles underlying the cold adaptability of intra-Geng subspecies remain largely unknown. Here, we identified MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (OsMAPK3) and LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT PROTEIN 9 (OsLEA9) as two important regulators for the cold adaptation of Geng subspecies from a combination of transcriptome analysis and genome-wide association study. Transgenic validation showed that OsMAPK3 and OsLEA9 confer cold tolerance at the reproductive stage. Selection and evolution analysis suggested that the Geng version of OsMAPK3 (OsMAPK3Geng) directly evolved from Chinese Oryza rufipogon III and was largely retained in high-latitude and high-altitude regions with low temperatures during domestication. Later, the functional nucleotide polymorphism (FNP-776) in the Kunmingxiaobaigu and Lijiangxiaoheigu version of the OsLEA9 (OsLEA9KL) promoter originated from novel variation of intra-Geng was selected and predominantly retained in temperate Geng to improve the adaptation of Geng together with OsMAPK3Geng to colder climatic conditions in high-latitude areas. Breeding potential analysis suggested that pyramiding of OsMAPK3Geng and OsLEA9KL enhanced the cold tolerance of Geng and promotes the expansion of cultivated rice to colder regions. This study not only highlights the evolutionary path taken by the cold-adaptive differentiation of intra-Geng, but also provides new genetic resources for rice molecular breeding in low-temperature areas. © 2022 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Eggs features and tactical variability in the reproduction of different egg-laying species of reptiles (Testudines, Ophidia) in Azerbaijan
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SP  - 1-8
AB  - The article discusses the features of eggs, the confinement of oviposition to certain stages of embryonic development, and its adaptive significance in some oviparous reptile species in Azerbaijan. Information is reported on the size and numbers of eggs in clutches, stages of development of embryos at the time of oviposition, as well as the timing of natural incubation of eggs in the Mediterranean tortoise (Testudo graeca ibera) and the Levantine viper (Macrovipera lebetina obtusa), including providing information on the size and number of eggs in clutches, as well as the relationship between the number of eggs in clutches and their size and weight. It has been experimentally proven that it is by the day of oviposition that embryos acquire the greatest resistance to temperature factors of the external environment. The embryos are most protected in eggs of a turtle with a hard shell (Testudo graeca), eggs are laid in the early stages of embryonic development (beginning and middle of gastrulation). However, in the Levantine viper (Macrovipera lebetina obtusa), the eggs are covered only with a fibrous membrane and the laying of eggs occurs at later stages of embryonic development (the stage of laying the tongue). It was also identified that in both species the ranges of morphological variability of embryos at the time of oviposition, in populations living at different heights, are the same. The tactical variability in the reproduction of oviparous reptiles is thought to be a result of their evolutionary adaptation to land reproduction. The incubation of eggs in the external environment lasted 80-85 days in the tortoise and 50-55 days in the viper. This is because in turtles, eggs are laid earlier, and in the Levantine viper at later stages of embryo development. In the Levantine viper, a significant part of the development of the embryos (30-35 days) occurs while the eggs are in the oviducts of the female. © 2022, Department of Environmental Sciences, Arak University.

SP  - 48-55
AB  - For the study, mulberry silk was used for different feeding seasons (spring, summer, autumn) and adverse environmental conditions (high temperature, low humidity, poor quality feed) using Atlas-1 and Atlas-2 lines. During the study, we calculated the selection and genetic parameters (selection variance (SD), genetic growth (R) and realized heritability (h2R) ratios) of the leading adaptive selection traits in successive generations of the Atlas-1 and Atlas-2 lines. As a result, compared to the line control population, the Atlas 1 line had a higher rate than the Atlas 2 line for the selection variance. Genetic growth was higher in F7 and F8 than the F6 lineage of the Atlas 1 line. The satin 2 line was the lowest in F7 and the highest in F7 and F8 generations. The biological parameters of both lines have a high barometric mass due to the hereditary coefficient, the barrel curtain mass is moderate, and the survival barrel silence is even lower. Generally, both lines have the ability to be inherited by biological indicators. The results from our selection experiments confirmed our theoretical provisions and made it clear that adaptive breeding carried out under pessimistic feeding of all generations would be beneficial. © 2020, Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture.

TI  - Mechanistic simulations predict that thermal and hydrological effects of climate change on Mediterranean trout cannot be offset by adaptive behaviour, evolution, and increased food production
VL  - 693
AB  - Streamflow is a main driver of fish population dynamics and is projected to decrease in much of the northern hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean region, due to climate change. However, predictions of future climate effects on cold-water freshwater fish populations have typically focused only on the ecological consequences of increasing temperatures, overlooking the concurrent and interacting effects of climate-driven changes in streamflow regimes. Here, we present simulations that contrasted the consequences of changes in thermal regime alone versus the combined effects of changes in thermal regime and streamflow for resident trout populations in distinct river types with different sensitivities to climatic change (low-altitude main river vs. high-altitude headwaters). We additionally assessed the buffering effect of increased food production that may be linked to warming. We used an eco-genetic individual-based model that integrates the behavioural and physiological effects of extrinsic environmental drivers -temperature and flow- with intrinsic dynamics density-dependence, phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary responses - across the entire trout life cycle, with Mediterranean brown trout Salmo trutta as the model species. Our simulations indicated that: (1) Hydrological change is a critical dimension of climate change for the persistence of trout populations, in that neither river type supported viable populations under strong rates of flow change, even under scenarios of increased food production. (2) Climate-change-related environmental change most affects the largest, oldest trout via increased metabolic costs and decreased energy inputs. In both river types, populations persisted under extreme warming alone but became dominated by younger, smaller fish. (3) Density-dependent, plastic and evolutionary changes in phenology and life-history traits provide trout populations with important resilience to warming, but strong concurrent shifts in streamflow could exceed the buffering conferred by such intrinsic dynamics.

TI  - Scalable, flexible and resilient parallelization of fused filament fabrication: Breaking endemic tradeoffs in material extrusion additive manufacturing
VL  - 56
AB  - Low build time in Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MatEx) is key to economic printing of large parts and bigger batch sizes on an industrial scale. A prevalent solution is to print large roads at the cost of reduced geometric resolution and greater post-processing waste. The alternative of parallelization, i.e., using multiple printheads to concurrently print distinct sections of a part, suffers from limited geometric complexity, high cost, and complex machine design. We create a new paradigm for parallelized MatEx of thermoplastics called Multiplexed Fused Filament Fabrication (MF3). MF3 prints concurrently with multiple FFF extruders without controlling each extruder motion's individually by using a new toolpath strategy that is rooted in our discovery of continuous filament retraction and advancement. MF3 can print non-periodic 3D structures, larger contiguous parts or multiple smaller distinct parts or a mixture of both, on the same machine, at an unprecedented throughput-resolution combination, without the limitations of state-of-the-art parallelization methods. MF3 also enables a form of hardware-fault-tolerance that is lacking in conventional single-nozzle printing by allowing printing to continue despite extruder failure. We reveal key parametric effects in continuous retraction/advancement and uncover new insight into the corresponding extrudate behavior. We also develop a unique thermal model which shows the impact of the extruder array's configuration and the inter-section interface type on part-scale temperature evolution. Finally, we discuss how MF3 will realize new economies of scale and productivity in MatEx. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Heat-hardening effects on mating success at high temperature in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 80
SP  - 172-177
AB  - Reproduction is strongly influenced by environmental temperature in insects. At high temperature, mating success could be influenced not only by basal (non-inducible) thermotolerance but also by inducible plastic responses. Here, mating success at high temperature was tested in flies carrying contrasting genotypes of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. The possible heat-hardening effect was tested. Mating success did not differ between heat-resistant and heat-sensitive genotypes when tested both at high (33 degrees C) and benign (25 degrees C) temperature, independently of the heat-hardening status. Importantly, heat-hardening pre-treatment increased in a 70% the number of matings at 33 degrees C in a mass-mating experiment. Further, mating latency at 33 degrees C was shorter with heat hardening than without it in single-pair assays Heat-hardening had previously been showed to improve short-term thermotolerance in many organisms including Drosophila, and the present results show that heat hardening also improve mating success at elevated temperature. Previous exposures to a mild heat stress improve short-term mating success as a plastic response of ecological relevance. Such heat-hardening effects on mating success should be relevant for predicting potential evolutionary responses to any possible current scenery of global warming, as well as in sterile insect release programs for pest control in elevated temperature environments.

VL  - 8

AB  - Sex determination in Australian agamid lizards shows a complex framework of different mechanisms, varying even among closely related taxa. It is clear that discrete classification of these species as either having genetic (GSD) or environmental sex determination (ESD) does not agree with empirical data. Although many species in this group show temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short-lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature-biased sex ratios in species with intense male-male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons (Ctenophorus pictus) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with TSD, our data cannot rule out a temperature-by-sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality. However, our findings together with the observed differences of sex determination systems in closely related species within this genus may provide novel opportunities to address fundamental questions in the evolution of sex determination systems. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - The cellular stress response (CSR) is critical for enabling organisms to cope with thermal damage to proteins, nucleic acids, and membranes. It is a graded response whose properties vary with the degree of cellular damage. Molecular damage has positive, as well as negative, function-perturbing effects. Positive effects include crucial regulatory interactions that orchestrate involvement of the different components of the CSR. Thermally unfolded proteins signal for rapid initiation of transcription of genes encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs), central elements of the heat shock response (HSR). Thermal disruption of messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structures in untranslated regions leads to the culling of the mRNA pool: thermally labile mRNAs for housekeeping proteins are degraded by exonucleases; heat-resistant mRNAs for stress proteins like HSPs then can monopolize the translational apparatus. Thus, proteins and RNA function as “cellular thermometers,” and evolved differences in their thermal stabilities enable rapid initiation of the CSR whenever cell temperature rises significantly above the normal thermal range of a species. Covalent DNA damage, which may result from increased production of reactive oxygen species, is temperature-dependent; its extent may determine cellular survival. High levels of stress that exceed capacities for molecular repair can lead to proteolysis, inhibition of cell division, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Onset of these processes may occur later in the stress period, after initiation of the HSR, to allow HSPs opportunity to restore protein homeostasis. Delay of these energy costly processes may also result from shortfalls in availability of adenosine triphosphate and reducing power during times of peak stress. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Direct evidence of sex and a hypothesis about meiosis in Symbiodiniaceae
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Dinoflagellates in the family Symbiodiniaceae are obligate endosymbionts of diverse marine invertebrates, including corals, and impact the capacity of their hosts to respond to climate change-driven ocean warming. Understanding the conditions under which increased genetic variation in Symbiodiniaceae arises via sexual recombination can support efforts to evolve thermal tolerance in these symbionts and ultimately mitigate coral bleaching, the breakdown of the coral-Symbiodiniaceae partnership under stress. However, direct observations of meiosis in Symbiodiniaceae have not been reported, despite various lines of indirect evidence that it occurs. We present the first cytological evidence of sex in Symbiodiniaceae based on nuclear DNA content and morphology using Image Flow Cytometry, Cell Sorting and Confocal Microscopy. We show the Symbiodiniaceae species, Cladocopium latusorum, undergoes gamete conjugation, zygote formation, and meiosis within a dominant reef-building coral in situ. On average, sex was detected in 1.5% of the cells analyzed (N = 10,000–40,000 cells observed per sample in a total of 20 samples obtained from 3 Pocillopora colonies). We hypothesize that meiosis follows a two-step process described in other dinoflagellates, in which diploid zygotes form dyads during meiosis I, and triads and tetrads as final products of meiosis II. This study sets the stage for investigating environmental triggers of Symbiodiniaceae sexuality and can accelerate the assisted evolution of a key coral symbiont in order to combat reef degradation. © 2021, The Author(s).
