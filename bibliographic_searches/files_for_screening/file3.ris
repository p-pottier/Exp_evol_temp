TI  - Thermal preferenda and behavior of Atlantic eels (genus Anguilla) in relation to their spawning migration
VL  - 31
IS  - 2
SP  - 171-184
AB  - This study addressed the thermal behavior of Atlantic eels (Genus Anguilla) with respect to their migration from freshwater and estuarine habitats to the spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. The overall objective of the study was to relate the responses of eels to thermal conditions in order to infer the effect of temperature on migratory metamorphosis, timing and depth of migration, sexual maturation and spawning. Chapter I describes laboratory experiments in which thermal preferenda of four sequential adult life history phases of American eels were determined using a horizontal thermal gradient. Long-term chronic tests of 48 h duration were used to obtain estimates of individual final preferred temperatures (FPTs). Mean FPTs for all four phases were between 17 and 20$\sp\circ$C and were not significantly different. There was no significant difference between temperatures selected during light and dark portions of LD 12:12, 16:8 or DD photoperiods. Light appeared to inhibit behavioral thermoregulation by promoting shelter-seeking. Thermal behavior of eels was highly variable, both between individuals of the various test groups and between repeated tests of single individuals. The strong eurythermality observed in eels may facilitate their occupation of thermally diverse and unpredictable habitats. Chapter II integrates the laboratory findings of Chapter I with observations of eels in the North Atlantic. The following inferences are drawn: (1) decreasing temperatures may initiate downstream migration of freshwater silver eels, (2) latitudinal differences in temperature, photoperiod and distance from the spawning area may affect the timing of downstream migration and contribute to the synchronization of arrival of eels at the spawning area, (3) yellow and silver eels may select temperatures close to their FPT in thermally stratified environments, but will tolerate higher and lower temperatures depending on illumination or other physical constraints, (4) the oceanic phase of the migration to the Sargasso Sea takes place mainly at relatively shallow depths in the open ocean, presumably within the upper 1000 meters. Eels may use temperature as an orientation cue in their spawning migration, but probably only on a local scale that allows them to identify strong thermal gradients or water masses of differing temperature.

TI  - Noble-gas state in the earth's interior - Some constraints on the present state
VL  - 52
IS  - 1
SP  - 75-95
AB  - The noble-gas state in the present Earth's interior is discussed on the basis of selected data on recent samples. For this purpose, careful sample selection, experimental procedures and the usage of suitable isotope systems are discussed in detail. Based on the 3He/4He-40Ar/36Ar diagram, we can infer at least four typical sources for noble-gas isotopes: MORB type (M-type), plume type (P-type), atmosphere type (A-type) and crust type (C-type). Among them, only M- and P-type sources are directly related to the mantle materials. The M-type source is assigned to the depleted mantle, whereas the P-type source to the fertile mantle which is supposed to be located beneath the former. The P-type source materials are characterized by higher 3He4He and lower 40Ar36Ar ratios compared to the MORB's values. All observed data for terrestrial samples seem to be explained by the mixing of these components including those derived from the arc areas and from the hot-spot areas. The apparent lesser heterogeneity of noble-gas isotopes in the Earth's deep interior probably reflect the easier mobility of noble gases at high temperatures compared with those of solid elements. Based on higher 3He4He and lower 40Ar36Ar ratios in the P-type source materials compared with MORB's values, we infer that noble gases (and probably volatiles) are still retained in the Earth's deep interior with significant amounts, which might play an important role to form mantle plumes and some other processes. The 40Ar36Ar ratio for the total Earth is estimated to be ∼350 or less at present. Compared with the values for the other planets, it is conjectured that the K36Ar ratio for each planet might have been already determined during the accretion process. © 1985.

TI  - Measurement and crystal field analysis of energy levels of Ho3+ and Er3+ in KGd(WO4)(2) single crystal
VL  - 323
SP  - 321-325
AB  - Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra performed on Ho3+ (4f(10)) and Er3+ (4f(11)) doped KGd(WO4)(2) single crystals were measured at selected temperatures between 5 and 80 K. In this monoclinic matrix. space group C2/c (No. 15) the lanthanide ions replacing Gd3+ occupy a single crystallographic site with symmetry C-2. The interpretation of these spectra and the simulation of the splitting of L-2S+1(J) levels were carried out in the frame of the phenomenological single-electron crystal field theory, through the simultaneous diagonalization of the energy matrices of the free-ion (fi) and crystal field (cf) interactions. A total of 20 fi and 14 cf adjustable parameters were considered for the reproduction of experimental energy levels and their associated wavefunctions. The simulated energy level series are in excellent accordance with the experimental data. i.e. rms deviations, sigma =14.5 and 15.6 cm(-1) for Ho3+ and Er3+, respectively. The comparison with similar results for Pr3+. (4f(2)) and Nd3+ (4f(3)) allowed establishment of the variation trends of the cf parameters with the number of 4f electrons.

TI  - Effect of temperature stress on immature stages and susceptibility of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to chikungunya virus
VL  - 70
IS  - 4
SP  - 346-350
AB  - A high temperature stress of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes on the larval stages was found to affect the susceptibility of adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to chikungunya virus. At this temperature, the mortality of the mosquito larvae was found to be approximately 95%, whereas a temperature greater than 45 degreesC for to minutes was found to be lethal. A temperature tolerant (TT) strain was developed by exposing the larvae to a temperature of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes at every generation for five generations. This strain was established to determine whether increase in the susceptibility was due to any selection pressure of higher temperature or to the influence of other intrinsic factors such as expression of immunoresponsive (IR) genes. Other studies on these mosquito strains showed that when maintained at 28 +/- 1degreesC, there was no difference in the larval duration and mortality in the immature stages, but the mean survival of female mosquitoes in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer. Conversely, when mosquitoes were maintained throughout at 37 degreesC the mean survival of' the mosquitoes decreased drastically in both strains, but the mean survival of females in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer compared with the unstressed controls. This increases the probability of at least one more blood meal. Fecundity of the TT strain was found to be lower than that of the control mosquitoes. Data suggest that expression of certain IR genes was affected by the heat shock. Sonic of these genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, which may have affected the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the virus. Although there was some selection in the temperature-tolerant individuals in the TT strain. when stressed by heat they showed expression of IR genes in a pattern similar to that in the normal controls. It appears that an increase in temperature above the average temperature of an area might help increase the proportion of virus-susceptible mosquitoes in the population. Such in increase in temperature in an endemic area would not only enhance the selection of temperature-tolerant individuals in a population having more longevity, but would also affect both intrinsic and extrinsic factors by reducing the extrinsic incubation period and increasing susceptibility of mosquitoes to viruses due to affected expression of IR genes.

TI  - Adaptation capacity of the larvae of marine invertebrates under variation of environmental parameters as a sensitive test of sea water pollution
VL  - 35

SP  - 127-131
AB  - The possibility of using the adaptive capacity of the larvae of marine invertebrates under the variation of environmental parameters was studied as a sensitive test of sea water pollution. The object of the research was the larvae of Cryptonatica janthostoma (Naticidae), the environmental factor was the freshening of sea water, and the toxic factor used was copper ions. Adding copper to sea water at a concentration of 0.005 mg/l did not reveal any pronounced effect on the development, behavior and growth of larvae in conditions of normal salinity (32‰), however their adaptive potential decreased with a decrease of salinity to 24‰. The results of the present work and experiments carried out previously enabled us to conclude that before assessing any concentration of pollutant as one not affecting marine organisms, it is necessary to investigate not only their development, growth and survival, but also their adaptive capacity relative to the variation of natural environmental parameters, such as even temperature and salinity. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2009.

TI  - Rates of embryonic development of Sceloporus lizards: Do cold climates favor the evolution of rapid development?
IS  - 3
SP  - 692-700
AB  - Rapid embryonic development is a potential adaptation to cold climates. We tested this hypothesis for nine species of Sceloporus lizards from four species groups and one species of Urosaurus, an outgroup, using observations corrected for incubation temperature and hatchling size. Phylogenetically based comparisons indicated that relatively rapid development is characteristic of the scalaris species group and relatively slow development is characteristic of the undulatus species group. Comparisons within these lineages were therefore used to determine whether develop mental rate was related to climate, as judged by elevation and latitude. Within the scalaris species group, developmental rates of cool climate populations of S. aeneus and S, scalaris were not faster than that of a warm climate population of S. scalaris, Within the undulatus species-group, the developmental rate of cool climate populations or species were not faster than those of warm climate populations or species. In general, developmental rates of Sceloporus are lineage specific and do not appear to be adapted to local climates.

TI  - Alpine dandelions originated in the native and introduced range differ in their responses to environmental constraints
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 175-183
AB  - Few studies have compared the response of native and invasive populations under stressful conditions. Furthermore, there is little consensus as to whether a plastic response is related to invasiveness in stressful environments. Exotic species have recently been reported in the high Andes of central Chile, where individuals have to cope with drought and poor soils, in addition to extreme temperatures. We explored if the exotic species Taraxacum officinale (dandelion) has plastic responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability, and whether two sets of alpine populations derived from native and introduced populations can converge to similar plastic responses to environmental constraints. Using a common garden approach, we compared plants grown from seeds collected in alpine populations of its native range (Alps, France) and in alpine populations of its introduced range (Andes, Chile) under a drought experiment, a potassium gradient, and a nitrogen gradient. Plasticity was only found as a response to drought. Moreover, different responses were found between both origins. Andean individuals are drought-resistant, while individuals from the Alps were drought-sensitive. According to the nutrient experiments, Andean dandelions behave as a nitrogen demanding-potassium avoiding species, whereas individuals from the Alps did not show any particular dependency or repulsion tendency to either of these two nutrients. Results suggest that differences in life history traits of both derived sets of populations may have an important role in determining the response of dandelions under the evaluated conditions. However, the relative importance of genetic adaptation in these responses is still unclear. Although T. officinale is a cosmopolite weed, this is the first study that compares individuals coming from its native and invaded range under stressful conditions. © 2008 The Ecological Society of Japan.

AB  - Adults and larvae of Chrysomela aenicollis (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) feed on foliage of Salix species (Salicaceae) between 2,400-3,400 m above sea level in the eastcentral Sierra Nevada mountains of California. We predicted that (1) cold climatic conditions would be a more frequent source of mortality at higher elevations, (2) mildweather agents of mortality such as predation should be more severe at lower elevations, and (3) populations of C. aenicollis would be adapted to the local selective regime at each elevation. We tested these predictions in 1984 and 1985 by transferring over 6,000 eggs and larvae within and between two sites at 2,810 and 3,240 m elevation above sea level. During mild summer weather at both sites, survivorship on Salix branches isolated by a barrier of sticky resin was similar to that on control branches, and we concluded that aerial predators were the primary cause of mortality. At least one major predator, a solitary wasp (Symmorphus sp., Hymenoptera: Eumenidae), was specifically associated with C. aenicollis at the lower site, where beetle mortality was highest. At both sites in 1984 and 1985, larvae originating from the lower site remained in aggregations and survived more frequently than larvae from the upper site, suggesting that they are better defended against predators. During a storm with cold weather late in the 1984 season, larvae and pupae died more frequently at the upper site, and there was a marginally significant trend (P<0.1) for the lower site individuals to die more frequently than upper site larvae during the cold storm. Upper site larvae grew approximately 10% faster than lower site larvae at the lower site and under controlled conditions in the laboratory. These findings indicate that upper and lower site populations were adapted to the local selective regime, which suggest how populations of montane phytopagous insects may adapt to changing elevations. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Females of the Australian scincid lizard Eulamprus tympanum can manipulate the sex of their offspring in response to gender imbalances in the population using temperature-dependent sex determination. Here we show that when adult males are scarce females produced male-biased litters and when adult males were common females produced female-biased litters. The cues used by a female to assess the adult population are not known but presumably depend upon her experience throughout the breeding season. Maternal manipulation of the sex ratio of the offspring in E. tympanum illustrates a selective advantage of temperature-dependent sex determination in a viviparous species.

TI  - Genetic and environmental determinants of hypopus duration in the stored-product mite Lepidoglyphus destructor
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 231-258
AB  - This paper reports a series of experiments over many years on hypopus duration and extends the preceding investigation (1987) on hypopus formation in Lepidoglyphus destructor (Schrank, 1781). The length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis (diapause development) is genetically programmed but influenced by environmental factors. This span of time is highly variable, and may extend from one week to more than a year. Spreading out the potential for hypopus completion over time is adaptive, since a pool of hypopodes with prolonged and staggered dormancies serves to spread the risk of emergence of tritonymphs over extended periods of time; it buffers the population against sudden drought to which all other stages of the life-cycle succumb. The additive structure and large variance of the genetic system underlying the length of time required for hypopus physiogenesis allows for the reconstitution of a broad spectrum of genotypes in every generation through the process of meiotic segregation and recombination during sexual reproduction. It favours stored variability, provides a 'fail-safe device' both for survival as well as development in irregularly fluctuating environments, and facilitates the adaptation of populations to local conditions. The trait for hypopus physiogenesis varies independently from that of hypopus formation, and is apparently free to adjust, without genetic constraints, towards an adaptive optimum. The response to selection is fast. Low environmental humidities and high temperatures accelerate physiogenesis of the hypopus. Completion of the hypopus stage and moulting to the tritonymph is triggered by high humidities at moderate temperatures. If environmental conditions preclude moulting, the hypopus following ending of physiogenesis enters a state of quiescence. In contrast the seasonal and largely predictably varying environments, in which essentially anticipatory and season-related token cues like photoperiod regulate the timing of so many arthropod lifecycles, L. destructor copes with sudden and fatal drought, as well as with unheralded and favourable humidities in its ephemeral habitats, mainly by excessive genetic polymorphism in hypopus duration and formation; some genotypes are always instantaneously fit to meet the respective environmental situation. The mite faces gradual food deterioration of its patchily distributed microhabitats by a short-term anticipatory and environmentally cued developmental switch mechanism, which lowers the threshold for hypopus induction. On top of genetic variability and phenotypic plastivity, any genotype×environment interaction provides for increasing flexibility above that from genetic polymorphism and environmental polyphenism alone. This extraordinary measure of adaptedness fits L. destructor for life in irregularly fluctuating environments. © 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

SP  - 269-277
AB  - Wheat yield prediction using different agrometeorological indices, spectral index (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and trend predicted yield (TPY) were developed in Hoshiarpur and Rupnagar districts of Punjab. On the basis of examination of Correlation Coefficients (R), Standard Error of Estimate (SEOE) and Relative Deviation (RD) values resulted from different agromet models, the best agromet subset were selected as Minimum Temperature (Tmin). Maximum Temperature (Tmax) and accumulated Heliothermal Units (HTU) in case of Hoshiarpur district and Minimum Temperature (T--min), accumulated Temperature Difference (TD) and accumulated Pan Evaporation (E) for Rupnagar district at reproductive stage (2nd week of March) of wheat. It was found that Agromet-Spectral-Trend-Yield model could explain 96 % (SEOE = 87 kg/ha) and 91% (SEOE = 146 kg/ha) of wheat yield variations for Hoshiarpur and Rupnagar districts, respectively.

AB  - The effect of selected constant temperatures (15.6°, 21.1°, 26.7°, 32.2°, 37.8°C) on oviposition, feeding, and longevity of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) was examined in the laboratory with chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat, as a host plant. There was no significant difference in total feeding at 21.1°, 26.7°, and 32.2°C nor was there significant difference in egg deposition at these temperatures. The ratio egg deposition : feeding was significantly larger at 26.7°C. Longevity was similar (12–16 days) at all temperatures except 37.8°C where it was reduced to ca. 3 days. The effect of temperature was more pronounced when feeding and oviposition were analyzed per day. Maximum feeding occurred at 32.2°C while significantly more oviposition was found at 26.7°C. An estimate of the threshold temperature for oviposition was 12.2°C which was higher than that observed experimentally (10°C). Ninety percent of oviposition occurred with 550°D of adult female life (above base 10°C). © 1984, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.

AB  - We collected southern grass lizards, Takydromus sexlineatus, from a population in Shaoguan (Guangdong, southern China), and used adult males and non-reproductive females to study the thermal dependence of food assimilation and locomotor performance. We did not find sex differences in selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax). Tsel measured on a laboratory thermal gradient was 31.5degreesC; CTMin and CTMax averaged 6.4degreesC and 42.2degreesC, respectively. Within the range from 24degreesC to 36degreesC, food passage time, daily food intake, daily production of faeces, apparent digestive coefficient (ADC) and assimilation efficiency (AE) were affected by body temperature, and daily production of urates was not. Food passage time decreased with increase in body temperature within the range from 24degreesC to 34degreesC, and then increased at higher body temperatures. Lizards at 32degreesC and 34degreesC took more food than did those at higher or lower body temperatures. When influence of variation in the total food intake was removed by an ANCOVA, lizards at 36degreesC produced faeces containing significantly higher energy as compared with those at body temperatures lower than 32degreesC. Energy in urates did not differ among lizards at different body temperatures, when removing the influence of variation in total food intake by an ANCOVA. Lizards at 36degreesC had apparently lower ADC and AE than did those at body temperatures lower than 34degreesC, mainly because they produced faeces with higher energy contents. Sprint speed increased with increase in body temperature within the range from 20degreesC to around 32degreesC, and then decreased at higher body temperatures. Inter-specific comparison among three species of Takydromus lizards occupying different latitudinal (climatic) ranges reveal that (1) the maximal sprint speed is greater in T wolteri and T sexlineatus than in T septentrionalis, (2) the optimal body temperature for sprint speed decreases with increase in latitude, and (3) the thermal sensitivity of sprint speed is more pronounced in species occupying lower and higher latitudinal ranges.

VL  - 22

SP  - 459-470
AB  - SUMMARY. 1. Resting eggs (ephippia) of Daphnia galeata, D. hyalina, D. cucullata and D. galeata X D. hyalina hybrids were collected from the upper 8 cm of sediments at various water depths from two glacial lakes in the Northern Federal Republic of Germany. 2. The horizontal distribution of ‘intact’ ephippia (i.e. those containing two apparently healthy eggs) was extremely patchy, with mean densities in the upper 8 cm ranging from 1325 to 113,907 m−2 (coefficient of variation, C=65.5%; Schöhsee, Holstein) and 25,343–159,143 m−2 (C=58.5%; Kel‐lersee. Holstein). Ephippial densities were greatest in sediments from deep waters. The highest densities of intact ephippia were in the upper 4 cm of sediment, with progressively fewer with increasing depth. 3. A proportion of eggs obtained from sediments during autumn (September‐November 1985) and spring (March‐May 1986) were exposed to continuous light (approximately 18 W m−2) at three temperatures (6, 12, 20°C), and the incidence of hatches recorded. 4. Hatching success was consistently low (maximum 14.4%), with most hatching occurring at 12°C. There was no significant difference between the hatching success of ephippia collected during autumn and spring. Decapsulation of ephippial eggs inhibited hatching. Hatching was highly synchronous within each treatment, and the pattern did not differ significantly with sediment depth, though hatching success was lower in deep sediments. A huge reservoir of ephippia is present in lake sediments, of which a proportion may remain viable for many years. Periodic recruitment of hatchlings to the pelagic population may provide an important mechanism for the maintenance of genetic diversity in Daphnia populations, as well as affecting rates of evolutionary change.

AB  - Heritabilities of wing length and abdominal bristle number, as well as genetic correlations between these characters, were determined within and among populations of Drosophila melanogaster in nature. Substantial "natural" heritabilities were found when wild-caught flies from one population were compared to their laboratory-reared offspring. Natural heritabilities of bristle number approximated those derived from laboratory-raised parents and offspring, but wing length heritability was significantly lower in nature than in the laboratory. Among-population heritabilities, estimated by regressing population means of wild-caught flies against those of their laboratory-reared descendants, were close to 0.5. The genetic differentiation of populations was clinal with latitude, and was accompanied by significant geographic differences in the norms of reaction to temperature. These clines are similar to those reported on other continents and in other Drosophila species, and are almost certainly caused by natural selection. Genetic regressions between the characters reveal that the cline in bristle number may be a correlated response to geographic selection on wing length, but not vice versa. Our results indicate that there is a sizable genetic component to phenotypic variation within and among populations of D. melanogaster in nature.

VL  - 43

AB  - Flies from the first generation of isofemale lines of D, melanogaster founded by wild flies collected in spring, summer and autumn in two French populations have been studied for 4 successive years. Cyclical seasonal variations occur in various genetically determined characteristics involved in reproductive potential. The number of ovarioles of the females and female capacity to control oviposition are subject to variation consisting of an increase in frequency of genotypes controlling large number of ovarioles and strong oviposition blocking control in spring and autumn samples. The opposed genotypes (low number of ovarioles and weaker blocking of oviposition control) are favored in summer generations. This balancing selection, induced by temperature variations, modifies temporarily the genetic equilibrium of the population. This enhances the frequency of better adapted genotypes when conditions become less favorable. L'étude pendant 4 ans de lignées isofemelles, fondées par des mouches capturées dans la nature, au printemps, en été et en automne, dans deux population françaises de D. melanogaster, a mis en évidence des variations saisonnières cycliques portant sur différents caractères liés au potentiel reproducteur. Les individus observés appartenaient à la première génération de laboratoire, élévée en conditions standard; les fluctuations observées correspondaient donc à des variations d'ordre génétique. Le nombre d'ovarioles des femelles et leur capacité à controler leur ponte en présence d'un substrat peu favorable sont soumis à ce type de variations cycliques. Il consiste en une augmentation de la fréquence de certains phénotypes (nombre d'ovarioles élevé et forte capacité de blocage de l'oviposition) au printemps et en automne, tandis que les génotypes opposés (faible nombre d'ovarioles et faible capacité de blocage) sont favorisés pendant les générations estivales. Ces variations correspondent à une sélection balancée induite par les fluctuations de la température. Elles conduisent à une modification temporaire de l'équilibre génétique de la population et à un accroissement de la fréquence des génotypes considérés comme mieux adaptés au climat tempéré, lorsque les conditions environnementales deviennent moins favorables. 1987 The Netherlands Entomological Society

VL  - 87
IS  - 3
SP  - 593-600
AB  - Material was collected from Kaneohe Bay, Oahu. Nehu spawning is concentrated in a 1hr period shortly after sunset; the delay after sunset is longer in the winter than in summer. Incubation time (22-35hr) is inversely related to temperature. Development time between hatching and first feeding shows relatively greater seasonal differences; total embryonic development time during the coldest months is almost twice that of the warmest months. Nehu egg size is inversely related to temperature. The potential adaptive value of the seasonal change in egg size in this tropical species is more likely related to size-specific differences in predation rates rather than to seasonal changes in abundance or size of food for larvae. Seasonal changes in total development time result in marked differences in the time of the diel cycle at which larvae reach first-feeding status; these differences could have more influence on survival of small larvae than effects related to either predation or food availability. -from Author

AB  - The majority of experimental studies of the effects of population bottlenecks on fitness are performed under laboratory conditions, which do not account for the environmental complexity that populations face in nature. In this study, we test inbreeding depression in multiple replicates of inbred when compared with non-inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster under different temperature conditions. Egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and sex ratio of emerging adults are studied under low, intermediate and high temperatures under laboratory as well as semi-natural conditions. The results show inbreeding depression for egg-to-adult viability. The level of inbreeding depression is highly dependent on test temperature and is observed only at low and high temperatures. Inbreeding did not affect the developmental time or the sex ratio of emerging adults. However, temperature affected the sex ratio with more females relative to males emerging at low temperatures, suggesting that selection against males in pre-adult life stages is stronger at low temperatures. The coefficient of variation (CV) of egg-to-adult viability within and among lines is higher for inbred flies and generally increases at stressful temperatures. Our results contribute to knowledge on the environmental dependency of inbreeding under different environmental conditions and emphasize that climate change may impact negatively on fitness through synergistic interactions with the genotype. © 2008 The Royal Society.

VL  - 3

SP  - 36-46
AB  - Under certain conditions two temperature sensitive mutants of reovirus type 3 (strain Dearing) yield particles that lack either one or two of the ten genome RNA segments. They resemble the wild type strain in this respect, but there are significant differences. When passaged at low multiplicity neither wild type virus nor the group F mutant ts 556 yields significant numbers of defective particles, but the group C mutant ts 447 yields progeny that consists of roughly equal amounts of nondefective particles and particles that lack genome RNA segment L3. When passaged three to four times at high multiplicity (more than 500 virus particles, equivalent to 5 to 10 PFU per cell), yields of ts 556 decrease precipitously and consist of roughly equal numbers of particles that lack RNA segment L1 and particles that lack both segments L1 and L3. Only a small proportion of the yield consists of nondefective particles. Yields of wild type virus only begin to decline and contain defective particles after about eight passages at high multiplicity; progeny then consists of about one quarter of nondefective particles and three quarters of particles that lack segment L1. Yields of ts 447 also begin to contain particles that lack L1 at this stage. All defective particles contain the normal complement of capsid polypeptides and possess full transcriptase activity. Ts 447 and ts 556 may be useful in studies on the mechanism that is responsible for selecting unique sets of single stranded RNA molecules for encapsidation in progeny virions. (21 references.)

AB  - A protocol has been developed for the negative selection of plant auxotrophs using the nucleoside analogues BUdR and FUdR. The protocol was optimised using nitrogen-starved protoplast-derived cells of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia to simulate auxotrophy. The present results represent a significant improvement over previous reports in that: 1) The background of colonies escaping BUdR/FUdR kill is low and reproducible. 2) The protocol was improved to the point where background survival was 0.03% for non-starved cultures and 0.09% for auxin-starved cultures. 3) It was shown that UV irradiation decreases BUdR sensitivity of dividing cells and that this is overcome by increased exposure to BUdR. 4) Application of the method to auxin-starved haploid protoplast-derived cell suspensions resulted, for the first time, in the selection of temperature-sensitive (ts) auxin auxotrophs. 5) It could be demonstrated, for the first time, that the method in practice enriches for auxotrophs, in this case by a factor of 10 for auxin auxotrophs and at least 60 for ts auxin auxotrophs. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This study was performed to determine the thermal preferences and optimum temperature for growth of age-0 lake trout Salvelinus namaycush to help predict the thermal habitat they select when they leave the spawning grounds and to assess the risk posed to them in the Great Lakes by piscivorus, nonnative fishes whose thermal habitat preferences are known. The test fish were hatched in the laboratory from eggs taken from wild fish, acclimated to 5, 10, 15, and 18°C, and fed to excess with commercial trout food for 47 d. The test fish grew at all of the temperatures, and the specific growth rate was highest at about 12.5°C (3.8% wet body weight/d). Fish used in the growth study were also tested in a vertical thermal gradient tank and had a final thermal preferendum between 10.1°C and 10.2°C. These results, which generally agreed with those of an earlier laboratory study of the temperature preference of age-1 lake trout and the limited information on thermal habitat use by age-0 lake trout in the Great Lakes, indicated age-0 lake trout would tend to seek temperatures near 10°C, or as high as 12.5°C, during summer if food was abundant. Published information on thermal habitat use of age-1 and adult alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax indicated they would be expected to co-occur with age-0 lake trout during much of the time when the lake trout were small enough to be eaten by these two introduced piscivores.

TI  - Towards the quantitative traits regulation: Fountain theory implications in comparative and developmental biology
VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 923-931
AB  - A fountain mechanism of quantitative regulation of gene expression level during development is proposed. The mechanism is based on postulated ability of a special class of RNA molecules, so called fountain RNAs (fRNAs), to induce passive and selective ionic channels in the internal nuclear membrane. Ions diffuse via channel from the nuclear lumen into the chromatin compartment. An RNA-dependent battery of ion channels is assumed to produce <<a fountain>> of ions in close vicinity to the corresponding genes. An ion atmosphere, in its turn, locally changes the chromatin configuration and effectiveness of transcription and processing of transcripts. Hence this mechanism can be used to change genes productivity. It is a basic mechanism of quantitative traits regulation. A passive selective ion flux periodically stops after a threshold ion concentration induces local chromatin compactization and arrests the activity of ion channels in a given chromatin compartment. This process serves as a basis for many cellular biorhythms that are relatively temperature-independent because of the passive nature of ion channel. It is postulated that eukaryotes became eukaryotes just to obtain this fountain mechanism that allows them to perform gradual quantitative modulation of corresponding genes expression levels. The fountain mechanism is partly responsible for dominance and heterosis, X-chromosome inactivation, gene position effects, end some other epigenetic events. It plays an important role in embryonic and postembryonic development. A significant portion of the former <<junk>> DNA can be referred to as fDNA involved in the proposed mechanism functioning. Genomic rearrangements of fDNA could lead to micro- and macroevolutionary changes in the animal and plant kingdoms. The pivotal evolutionary function of transposons could reside in their ability to contain and relocate fDNA along the chromosomes.

TI  - How age, sex, and reproductive condition affect retreat-site selection and emergence, patterns in a temperate-zone lizard, Elgaria coerulea
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-32
AB  - Minimising predation risk is critical to fitness in all animals. For animals that utilise retreat sites as an anti-predator strategy, there are many factors that influence retreat site selection and determine when to emerge from a hiding place. In this paper we test for seasonal and daily variation in cover use in a temperate-zone lizard (Elgaria coerulea). We also test for age- and sex-related differences in capture-site temperature, cover use, and sprint speed. We conducted a mark-recapture study on Elgaria coerulea in south-eastern British Columbia, Canada. We recorded temperature, precipitation, lizard's position, proximity to cover, and rock size. The results showed seasonal variation in both. retreat-site selection and emergence patterns. Lizards selected thicker rocks during the summer compared to spring, perhaps to avoid lethal high temperatures. Adult males used larger, thicker rocks than adult females and juveniles. Emergence patterns also differed between the sexes. The probability of capturing an adult female in the open steadily increased over the summer, while male emergence declined over the season. The tendency to be in the open also increased with the amount of rain that fell the previous day. This study shows that while remaining under cover is important in Elgaria coerulea, specific circumstances (lethal temperatures, reproduction, precipitation) will modify their cover use.

AB  - A study was conducted on the effect of pressure at different temperature (10, 25, and 60 degrees C) and pH (7.6 and 8.8) levels on selected properties of egg white solutions (turbidity, solubility, residual denaturation enthalpy, surface hydrophobicity, sulfhydryl content, susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis and trypsin inhibition activity). The pressure-induced changes in these properties were dependent on the pressure and temperature applied and the pH. The most pronounced changes were observed in the pressure range of 400-700 MPa. Pressure induced ail increase in turbidity, surface hydrophobicity, exposed SH content and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, while it resulted in a decrease in protein solubility, total SH content, denaturation enthalpy and trypsin inhibitory activity.

The crystallisation type was selected from thermal data. Yield and productivity were fixed from the solubility curve. Solution eutectic data were used to set the specification of enantiomeric purity for the input material. Agitation and cooling parameters were established using scale-down laboratory trials. Heat transfer was the rate-limiting step for crystal growth. In-line technology was beneficial in the laboratory but not necessary on scale-up. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Developmental plasticity mirrors differences among taxa in spadefoot toads linking plasticity and diversity
VL  - 103
IS  - 50
SP  - 19021-19026
AB  - Developmental plasticity is found in most organisms, but its role in evolution remains controversial. Environmentally induced phenotypic differences may be translated into adaptive divergence among lineages experiencing different environmental conditions through genetic accommodation. To examine this evolutionary mechanism, we studied the relationship between plasticity in larval development, postmetamorphic morphology, and morphological diversity in spadefoot toads, a group of closely related species that are highly divergent in the larval period and body shape and are distributed throughout temperate areas of both the New and the Old World. Previous studies showed that accelerated metamorphosis is adaptive for desert-dwelling spadefoot toads. We show that even under common garden conditions, spadefoot toad species show divergent reaction norms for the larval period. In addition, experimentally induced changes in the larval period caused correlated morphological changes in postmetamorphic individuals such that long larval periods resulted in relatively longer hindlimbs and snouts. A comparative analysis of morphological variation across spadefoot toad species also revealed a positive correlation between the larval period and limb and snout lengths, mirroring the effects of within-species plasticity at a higher taxonomic level. Indeed, after ≈ 110 Ma of independent evolution, differences in the larval period explain 57% of the variance in relative limb length and 33% of snout length across species. Thus, morphological diversity across these species appears to have evolved as a correlated response to selection for a reduced larval period in desert-dwelling species, possibly diverging from ancestral plasticity through genetic accommodation. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

TI  - Heat tolerance as an indicator of climate change impacts: General considerations and a case study in poeciliid fish
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 46-66
AB  - Heat tolerance of organisms is an important determinant of the potential impact of global warming and could thus be a very relevant bioindicator. If heat tolerance increases due to acclimation or adaptation, climate change impacts will be less than anticipated. In contrast, a decreased heat tolerance may indicate that a population is already stressed. As a case study, we compared heat tolerances among fish collected from pairs of sites with different thermal regimes, for the least killifish (Heterandria formosa) and the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We quantified heat tolerance as temperature-at-death and time-to-death when field-collected fish were exposed in the laboratory to increasing water temperatures. For the four pairs of populations that were compared, two differed in heat tolerance. Fish from a site with above-normal temperatures had a reduced heat tolerance indicative of being stressed. Fish from another site with above-normal temperatures had an elevated heat tolerance and this increase appeared due to acclimation rather than adaptation - since it was not maintained in their offspring. While these results provide no evidence that populations will be able to adapt to climate change, they do show that a population's heat tolerance is not a fixed characteristic. The research also showed that heat tolerance is affected by many factors, making for a bioindicator that is not easily quantified. Since a population's heat tolerance is an important variable with respect to climate change impacts, further development and validation of this potential bioindicator is warranted.

TI  - Maternal and individual effects in selection of bed sites and their consequences for fawn survival at different spatial scales
VL  - 159
IS  - 3
SP  - 669-678
AB  - We examined the relationship between survival of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) fawns at Trois Fontaines, Champagne-Ardennes, France, and factors related to bed-site selection (predator avoidance and thermoregulation) and maternal food resources (forage availability in the maternal home range). Previous studies have demonstrated that at small scales, the young of large herbivores select bed sites independently from their mothers, although this selection takes place within the limits of their mother's home range. Fawn survival was influenced largely by the availability of good bed sites within the maternal home range, not by the fawn's selection of bed sites; however, selection for thermal cover when selecting bed sites positively influenced survival of young fawns. Typical features of a good home range included close proximity to habitat edges, which is related to forage accessibility for roe deer. The availability of bed sites changed as fawns aged, probably due to an increased mobility of the fawn or a different use of the home range by the mother; sites offering high concealment and thermal protection became less available in favor of areas with higher forage accessibility. Despite the minor influence of bed-site selection on survival, roe deer fawns strongly selected their bed sites according to several environmental factors linked to predator avoidance and thermoregulation. Fawns selected for sites providing concealment, light penetration, and avoided signs of wild boar (Sus scrofa) activity. Avoidance of sites with high light penetration by young fawns positively affected their survival, confirming a negative effect on thermoregulation due to reduced thermal cover. Selection for light penetration by older fawns was less clear. We discuss these results in the context of cross-generational effects in habitat selection across multiple scales, and the potential influence of the 'ghost of predation past'. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Trophodynamic modeling of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Doto area, northern Japan: Model description and baseline simulations
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 138-154
AB  - An age-structured trophodynamic model was constructed to quantitatively analyze factors affecting post-settlement mortality and growth of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) in the Doto area, the main nursery ground of the Japan Pacific population. The model included (i) multiple age classes of pollock, (ii) a generic predator, (iii) fisheries, and (iv) major prey of pollock. Major processes considered were (i) recruitment, (ii) bottom-up control of somatic growth, (iii) mortality because of predation, cannibalism and fishing, GO size-selective prey selection, (v) temperature-dependent bioenergetics such as conversion efficiency and daily consumption rate, and (vi) production and advective supply of prey. By assuming that pollock select prey based upon both relative abundance and predator-prey size relationships, the model accurately simulated seasonal and ontogenetic variations in the diet. However considering ontogenetic segregation, the model showed that, due to cannibalism, newly recruited fish would be totally consumed within 6 months after settlement. By considering segregation (10% overlap during spring and 0.1% during other seasons), an agreement of diet between the simulation and empirical data averaged 82.7% for the different seasons and fish sizes. Euphausiids, the most important prey of pollock, suffered the highest predation impact (22.2 +/- 5.3 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)) exceeding annual production in the model domain (17.2 +/- 0.1 WWg m(-2) yr(-1)), indicating that an advective supply of prey is necessary to support the pollock population. The daily ration of pollock during spring and summer averaged at 1.2 and 0.6% BW day(-1) for small (less than or equal to200 mm) and large (>200 mm) pollock, respectively; this daily ration was reduced by half during autumn and winter.

TI  - Change in filter-screen morphology and depth selection: Uncoupled responses of Daphnia to the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria
VL  - 52
IS  - 6
SP  - 2358-2363
AB  - In many eutrophic lakes, ability to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria is crucial to Daphnia fitness, as the filaments can reduce food intake by interference with food-particle retention. Two basic mechanisms were proposed to explain food collection by Daphnia: mechanical sieving, in which filtering appendages act as sieves, and direct interception, in which appendages act as paddles and water does not pass through. As was recently suggested, both mechanisms may be active, and their relative importance is determined by the Reynolds number on filtering appendages. Mechanical sieving seems particularly sensitive to the interference from filamentous cyanobacteria, which can clog the meshes while passing through the filtering chamber. We therefore hypothesized that in the presence of filaments, Daphnia minimizes the interference with filtration by decreasing the Reynolds number on the filters and by thus reducing the relative importance of sieving. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responses of nine clones of the Daphnia longispina group to the presence of nontoxic, filamentous cyanobacteria. The presence of cyanobacteria triggered in Daphnia responses of both behavioral (descending to deep, cold waters) and morphological nature (decreased intersetal and intersetular distances in the filtering apparatus). Both responses led to a decrease in the Reynolds number on the filters. Moreover, the two responses were inversely correlated: individuals with larger meshes descended to colder strata than did those with smaller meshes. These modifications of phenotype are regarded as adaptive, since they allow for minimized filament-induced interference with the filtration process. © 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.

When the scrap price is US$ 100 per ton, it is more ideal to operate, producing and charging DRI at 550°C. When the scrap price is US$ 180 per ton, the difference in liquid steel production cost is practically same. It is suggested that the temperature must be selected according to the scrap prices to optimize the cost.

AB  - Dynamics of the Adh activity and frequencies of alleles Adh(F) and Adh(S) were analyzed under selection for delayed senescence. The experiments were performed on Drosophila melanogaster. Lines Adh(S)cn and Adh(F)vg and experimental populations cn and vg, selected for an increased duration of reproductive period (late oviposition) were used. Analysis of fertility, longevity, viability and resistance to starvation showed that selection for late oviposition resulted in delayed senescence of flies of the experimental populations. Genetic structure of population vg changed considerably with regard to the Adh locus. This was confirmed by parameters of activity thermostability and electrophoretic mobility of the enzyme isolated from flies after 30 generations of selection. Analysis of frequencies of the Adh alleles showed that in both selected populations, which initially had different genetic composition, accumulated allele Adh(S), which encodes the isozyme that is less active but more resistant to inactivation. Genetic mechanism of delayed senescence in Drosophila is assumed to involve selection at vitally important enzyme loci, including Adh.

AB  - 1. 1. The heat shock proteins (hsps) system has been studied in two replicate cage populations (1D, 1C) of Drosophila melanogaster, which were maintained under different environmental conditions (temperature and relative humidity) for approximately 7 yr and exhibited different survival when they were subjected to temperature shock. 2. 2. The kinetics of protein synthesis in ovaries from D and C flies (and their reciprocal hybrids DC and CD) were subjected to heat stress, and the electrophoretic patterns of heat shock proteins (especially of the hsp 70 K), are correlated with the survival of the fly. 3. 3. These results confirm already obtained results using different stocks which were subjected to different type of selection (indirect selection; Stephanou et al., 1982), which represents good evidence for the biological significance of the hsps. 4. 4. The capacity of protein synthesis (and especially of hsp 70 K) following temperature shock is higher in ovaries from D (25°C) or DC flies as compared with those from C (14°C) or CD ones. 5. 5. It is proposed that the regulation of hsps synthesis can be considered as a major target of temperature-induced selection, and an effective molecular mechanism for temperature compensation. © 1982.

AB  - F1 hybrid true potato seed progenies with multiple sources of specific resistance to Pseudomonas solanacearum and adaptation were evaluated under tropical greenhouse conditions for resistance to a race 1 isolate of P. solanacearum. Results indicated that genes for adaptation are involved in conferring resistance to bacterial wilt. The effect of a particular resistant parent clone on the resistance level of its progeny depended on the resistance, adaptation or the combination of both characteristics of its mate. A heat tolerant parent gave a higher frequency of resistant offspring in combination with an ascertained source of resistance. Combining ability was an apparent feature of resistance to bacterial wilt and resistance was highest in the majority of the crosses that had a wide genetic background for both resistance and adaptation. The possible genetic nature of the resistance to bacterial wilt is discussed. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Climate change is likely to disrupt the timing of developmental events (phenology) in insect populations in which development time is largely determined by temperature. Shifting phenology puts insects at risk of being exposed to seasonal weather extremes during sensitive life stages and losing synchrony with biotic resources. Additionally, warming may result in loss of developmental synchronization within a population making it difficult to find mates or mount mass attacks against well-defended resources at low population densities. It is unknown whether genetic evolution of development time can occur rapidly enough to moderate these effects. We present a novel approach to modeling the evolution of phenology by allowing the parameters of a phenology model to evolve in response to selection on emergence time and density. We use the Laplace method to find asymptotic approximations for the temporal variation in mean phenotype and phenotypic variance arising in the evolution model that are used to characterize invariant distributions of the model under periodic temperatures at leading order. At these steady distributions the mean phenotype allows for parents and offspring to be oviposited at the same time of year in consecutive years. Numerical simulations show that populations evolve to these steady distributions under periodic temperatures. We consider an example of how the evolution model predicts populations will evolve in response to warming temperatures and shifting resource phenology. © 2008 Society for Mathematical Biology.

TI  - Recovery of hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cells of Vibrio vulnificus gives the appearance of resuscitation from a viable but nonculturable state
VL  - 182
IS  - 18
SP  - 5070-5075
AB  - The viabilities of five strains of Vibrio vulnificus were evaluated during the storage of the organisms in sterile seawater at 5 degrees C. The number of CFU was measured by plate count methods on rich media. The total cell numbers were determined by direct microscopic count methods. The titer of CPU declined logarithmically to undetectable levels over a period of 2 to 3 weeks, while the total cell numbers were unchanged. Midway through each study, higher culturable cell counts began to be observed on plates containing catalase or sodium pyruvate; during the latter stages of the study, the plate counts on such media were up to 1,000-fold higher than those on unsupplemented plates. Because autoclaving is known to generate hydrogen peroxide in rich media, and because catalase and sodium pyruvate are known to eliminate hydrogen peroxide, it appears that the conditions of the experiments led to the selection of a hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cell subpopulation, at the time of the final stage of the decline in viability of each culture, hydrogen peroxide-sensitive cells were the only culturable cells present. Warming samples of the cultures to room temperature led to the growth of these residual culturable cells, utilizing nutrients provided by the nonculturable cells. The cells that grew recovered hydrogen peroxide resistance. When mixtures of culturable and nonculturable cells mere diluted to the point where only nonculturable cells were present, or when the hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cells had declined to undetectable levels, warming had no effect; no culturable cells were recovered. Warming has been reported to "resuscitate" nonculturable cells. Recognition of the existence of hydrogen peroxide-sensitive culturable cell populations, as well as their ability to grow to high levels in the warmed sea,vater microcosms, leads instead to the conclusion that while warming permits culturable cells to grow, it has no effect on nonculturable cells.

TI  - Time of recombination in the Drosophila melanogaster oocyte. III. Selection and characterization of temperature-sensitive and -insensitive, recombination-deficient alleles in Drosophila
VL  - 108
IS  - 2
SP  - 425-443
AB  - The procedure for the selection of a temperature-sensitive recombination mutant in Drosophila is described. Use of this procedure has led to the recovery of three alleles at a new recombination locus called rec-1, located within the region of chromosome 3 circumscribed by Deficiency(3R)sbd105. 0ne allele, rec-126, is temperature sensitive, and the other two alleles, rec-16 and rec-116m are temperature insensitive. Gene dosage studies reveal rec-126 to be a leaky mutant with greater recombination activity in two doses than in one. The other two alleles show no dose response, implying that they may be null mutants. The temperature response curves of rec-126 as a homozygote and in heteroallelic combination with rec-116 suggest that the sharp decrease in recombination between 28° and 31° indicates temperature denaturation of an enzyme or other protein specified by the mutant and associated with the recombination process. The ability of small changes in temperature to reverse or abolish polarity in recombination along the X chromosome arm in rec-126/rec-116 females brings into question the use of the 'polarity' criterion to partition mutants into two functional types, i.e., precondition mutants that display polarity and exchange mutants that do not. Evidence that rec-1 may be part of a complex locus residing in a chromosome segment harboring a variety of recombination-related genes is presented.

VL  - 35

SP  - 379-386
AB  - A functional response study of the eight most common arthropod predators of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), eggs was conducted in the laboratory. Predators were starved for 24 h, and single predators were exposed to different prey density treatments. Predation response was observed at 6, 12, and 24 h after reeding trials began. At the highest prey density (150 eggs per predator), Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville and Collops quadrimaculatus (F.) adults and Chrysopa oculata Say larvae showed the highest consumption rates (116, 85, and 119 eggs/24 h, respectively), followed by H. convergens larvae (51 eggs/24 h), adult Geocoris punctipes (Say) (45 eggs/24 h), and adult Scymnus loewii Mulsant, Orius insidiosus (Say), Notoxus spp., and Nabis capsiformis Germar (1, 1, 10, and 12 eggs/24 h, respectively). Adult Notoxus spp., N. capsiformis, and O. insidiosus showed type 1 functional response, whereas adult C. quadrimaculatus, G. punctipes, H. convergens, and larval H. convergens and C. oculata showed type 2 response. All predators consumed the highest number of bollworm eggs at 35°C and the lowest numbers at 15°C; predation rate at 35°C was four times higher than that at 15°C. The prey density- dependent behavior of predators and effect of temperature on their predation behavior are discussed. © 2006 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - An empirical test of the 'predictability' hypothesis for the evolution of viviparity in reptiles
VL  - 15
IS  - 4
SP  - 553-560
AB  - Viviparity (live-bearing) has evolved from oviparity (egg-laying) >100 times in reptile phylogeny, but the selective forces responsible remain unclear. Tinkle & Gibbons (1977) proposed that prolonged uterine retention of eggs (leading ultimately to viviparity) is favoured by natural selection when it allows the reproducing female to better predict the incubation conditions that will occur in alternative potential nest-sites, and hence select the optimal site in which to deposit her eggs. This ingenious hypothesis has never been tested empirically. Over a 7-year period, I monitored temperatures inside 124 natural nests of egg-laying scincid lizards at three different elevations in the Brindabella Range of south-eastern Australia. As a measure of thermal predictability, I used correlation coefficients from comparisons of temperatures early vs. later in incubation among nests within each site. Both the mean and standard deviation of nest temperatures were examined in this way for each week through incubation. I performed these calculations under two models: one where the female assesses nest temperatures at the time of oviposition only, and one where she monitors temperatures constantly from the usual oviposition date until the actual time of laying. These analyses falsified two major assumptions of the 'predictability' hypothesis. First, nest temperatures at higher elevations were no less predictable than were those at lower elevations; instead, predictability was high in all situations. Secondly, a longer delay before oviposition decreased rather than increased the predictability of thermal conditions during subsequent incubation. I conclude that critical assumptions of the 'predictability' hypothesis are not supported in this study system.

TI  - Effect of E(sev) and Su(Raf) Hsp83 mutants and trans-heterozygotes on bristle trait means and variation in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 171
IS  - 1
SP  - 119-130
AB  - The Hsp90 protein encoded by the Hsp83 gene is required for the development of many traits in Drosophila. Hsp83 is also thought to play a role in the expression of phenotypic and genetic variability for subsequent selection and evolutionary change. Here we examine the impact of different E(sev) and Su(Raf) Hsp83 mutants on means and phenotypic variances of invariant and variable bristle traits. One of the mutants influenced the normally invariant thoracic bristle number, while none affected invariant scutellar bristle number. E(sev) alleles consistently influenced variable bristle traits while there were fewer effects of the Su(Raf) alleles. For the variable traits, none of the Hsp83 alleles had any effect on phenotypic variance, environmental variance, or developmental stability of the bristle traits. When alleles were combined in trans-heterozygotes, there were both cumulative and complementary effects on thoracic and variable bristle trait numbers, depending on the allelic combination. Overall, the results suggest that Hsp83 mutants do not have detectable effects on the phenotypic orenvironmental variance of bristle traits and that complementation of E(sev) and Su(Raf) Hsp83 mutants can extend to thoracic bristles as well as previously reported effects on viability. Some allelic combinations lead to more severe effects on variable bristle trait means than do single Hsp83 mutations. Copyright © 2005 by the Genatics Society of America.

VL  - 28

SP  - 260-265
AB  - A study on the preferred physicochemical and metallurgical properties of fluxed pellets has been undertaken assuming a higher pellet ratio in order to maintain a higher productivity of sinter plants. Experimental conditions were selected to simulate a high PCR operation at the blast furnace for evaluating commercial pellets under high production rate operation. The higher PCR would potentially result in a wider cohesive zone due to the relatively increased load distributed onto the burdens and encourage gradual widening of the cohesive zone due to the higher level of hydrogen and a virtual load increase onto the burdens. As a result of various changes inside the furnace with increased PCR, the size consistency of all charge materials must be controlled and maintained, aside from monitoring their metallurgical properties. Experiments were carried out to determine the effects of the load, pre-reduction and hydrogen gas on the high temperature characteristics of the commercial pellets. The results indicated that the high PCR operation would have a wider cohesive zone compared to the all-coke operation.

VL  - 61

SP  - 2925-2941
AB  - Alpine environments are particularly susceptible to environmental changes associated with global warming but there is potential for alpine plants to adapt to warming if local adaptation occurs and gene flow allows genotypes adapted to low altitudes to colonize higher altitude sites. Here we examine the adaptive potential of a common alpine grass, Poa hiemata, within the restricted alpine habitat of Australian mountains, across a narrow altitudinal gradient replicated in three areas. Grasses at high altitude sites had shorter leaf lengths and larger circumferences than those at lower sites. Transplant experiments with clonal material and plants grown from seed indicated that these differences were partly genetic, with environmental and genetic factors both contributing to the differences between altitudes. Differences in altitudinal forms were also evident in a common garden experiment. Plants showed a home-site advantage in terms of survival. A fitness analysis indicated that at high altitude sites, selection favored plants with short leaves and larger circumferences, whereas these traits were selected in the opposite direction at the low altitude sites. These findings indicate cogradient selection and potential for both plastic and genotypic shifts in response to climate change in P. hiemata. © 2007 The Author(s).

VL  - 147
IS  - 5
SP  - 569-580
AB  - Understanding how crop systems might respond to recent climate change is fundamental to the successful adaptation of efforts for sustainable agriculture. In the present paper, records over the period 19872004 from a long-term agroecosystem experiment carried out in Northeast China were used to explore the impacts of global warming on soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) yields under different controlled fertilization treatments. The results indicated that soybean yields were closely related to growing season temperatures. In most fertilization treatments, soybean yields showed a significant negative response to higher daily maximum temperature and greater diurnal temperature range (DTR), whereas they showed a significant positive response to higher daily minimum temperature. Analysis of covariance showed that these responses of soybean yields to temperature variables did not differ across fertilization treatments. Overall, soybean yields have declined significantly due to the warming trends since 1987. This has been mainly attributed to the higher daily maximum temperature. The present report demonstrates that soybean production in Northeast China may face challenges due to global warming unless potential adaptation options are adopted. The true mechanisms behind these yield impacts need further investigation to address effective agricultural adaptations for soybean systems to adapt to global warming. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Optimal egg size in marine invertebrates: Theory and phylogenetic analysis of the critical relationship between egg size and development time in echinoids
VL  - 156
IS  - 2
SP  - 175-192
AB  - Life-history models for marine invertebrate larvae generally predict a dichotomy in egg size in different species: eggs should be either minimal in size or large enough to support development fully without larval feeding. This prediction is contradicted, however, by the empirical observation of wide, continuous variation in egg size between these extremes. The prediction of dichotomy rests on the assumption of a negative linear relationship between egg size and development time. Here, I present a simple model in which development time is inversely proportional to egg size. Incorporating this relationship into an optimality model produces predictions of intermediate rather than extreme egg size. Modeled variations in mortality, food availability, fertilization rates, and temperature all produce continuous shifts in the value of the intermediate optimal size, in direct contrast to those produced by previous models, which predict shifts between two extreme optima. Empirical data on echinoid egg size and development time strongly support the model's assumption of an inverse proportional relationship between egg size and development time. A composite phylogeny is constructed of the 37 species for which egg size, development time, water temperature, and phylogenetic relatedness are known. Independent contrasts are made of the evolutionary changes in egg size and development time. This analysis indicates that evolutionary shifts in development time are correlated with the inversely proportional shifts in egg size assumed in the model. The assumption of a negative linear relationship used in previous models is rejected. This model provides a potential explanation for intraspecific variation in egg size along environmental gradients, sympatric differences in egg size among species, and biogeographic trends in egg size and development mode across taxa.

TI  - Further evidence of the equivocal effects of cortisol on in vitro steroidogenesis by ovarian follicles of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss
VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SP  - 315-323
AB  - Previous studies on salmonids have yielded equivocal results as to the role of cortisol in directly inhibiting ovarian steroidogenesis. In an effort to determine why this might be so, isolated ovarian follicles of rainbow trout were incubated with and without cortisol under varying conditions of gonadotropin or steroid precursor stimulation, incubation time and temperature. Cortisol at concentrations of 100-1000 ng ml(-1) suppressed basal production of 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) in only 4 out of 20 experiments, had no effect on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated production, and no suppressive effect on 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17P)-stimulated production in 14 experiments, but increased E(2) production in response to 17P in 2 experiments. Cortisone had no effect on basal E(2) production, suggesting that cortisol was unlikely to be exerting any effect indirectly after further metabolism. Extended incubation times at 12 degrees C resulted in overall decreased levels of E(2) in incubation media, but this had no obvious effect on patterns generated by treatment with cortisol. Extended incubation at 18 degrees C did change the pattern of response to treatment with cortisol in 1 out of 3 experiments. All incubations examined produced substantial amounts of E(2)-glucuronide but this showed no obvious relationship to whether or not inhibition of E(2) production by cortisol was observed. Effect of stress history was examined by incubating follicles from stressed or unstressed fish. In follicles from fish nearing the end of vitellogenesis, stress resulted in reduced production of both testosterone and E(2) in response to hCG, but increased conversion of 17P to E(2). The same effect was not observed in follicles from fish at an earlier stage of vitellogenesis. Measurement of E(2) uptake by follicles from selected experiments showed that follicles contained considerable amounts of E(2) and were potentially a sink for steroid produced during incubation. The experiments show that a consistent effect of cortisol on ovarian steroidogenesis remains elusive, but that stimulatory effects are as likely to occur as inhibitory effects. All responses are potentially further confounded by loss of free steroid from the medium by conjugation or absorption into the oocytes.

TI  - Effects of nest temperature and moisture on phenotypic traits of hatchling snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Colubridae) from tropical Australia
VL  - 89
IS  - 1
SP  - 159-168
AB  - Previous research on developmentally plastic responses by reptile embryos has paid relatively little attention to tropical species, or to possible interactions between the effects of thermal and hydric regimes. In the present study, eggs of keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii), from a tropical area with strong temporal and spatial variation in soil temperatures and moisture levels, were incubated. The phenotypic traits of hatchling snakes (body size, shape, muscular strength) were affected by moisture content of the incubation medium (vermiculite plus 100% vs. 50% water by mass), by mean incubation temperatures (25.7 vs. 27.9 degrees C) and by diel thermal variation (diel range 6.0 vs. 8.4 degrees C). Interactions between these factors were negligible. Cooler, more thermostable, moister conditions resulted in larger offspring, a trait under strong selection in this population. Thermal and hydric conditions covary in potential nest-sites (e.g. deeper nests are more thermostable as well as moister). This covariation may influence the evolution of reaction norms for embryogenesis. For example, if moister nests enhance offspring fitness and are cooler, then selection will favour the ability to develop in cool as well as moist conditions. Thus, the evolution of optimal incubation conditions with respect to one variable (e.g. temperature) may be driven by patterns of association with another variable (e.g. soil moisture) among natural nest-sites. Perhaps for this reason, the thermal optimum for incubation is surprisingly low in this tropical species.

TI  - Ecology in mare pentium: An individual-based spatio-temporal model for fish with adapted behaviour
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 163-178
AB  - A conceptual approach to study spatial movements of fish using an individual-based neural network genetic algorithm model is presented. Artificial neural networks, where the weights are adapted using a genetic algorithm, are applied to evolve individual movement behaviour in a spatially heterogeneous and seasonal environment. A 2D physical model (for the Barents Sea) creates monthly temperature fields, which again are used to calculate zooplankton production and predation pressure. Daily fish movement is controlled by reactive or predictive mechanisms. Reactive movement governs search for local optimal habitats, whereas predictive control enables adaptation to seasonal changes. Levels of growth and predation pressure at the time of decision are used to assess whether to apply reactive or predictive movement control. To make the model realistic on a large scale, each of the individuals are scaled up to represent a clone of one million siblings acting and growing synchronously. The fish lives for up to two years, and may reproduce in its second year. In order to spawn it has to be at the designated spawning area in the south-western part of the lattice in January. During spawning it produces a number of offspring in proportion to its body size. The "genetic constitution" of offspring (the weights of the synapses in the neural networks) is a mix of their "mother's" and a randomly picked member of the population. The model is able to solve the problem of navigating in a heterogeneous and seasonal environment. The movement of the artificial fish follows a seasonal pattern, typical for migrating pelagic fish stocks. During summer and autumn the distribution is widespread whereas during spring it is more concentrated. When trophic feedback is removed (i.e. zooplankton survival is independent of fish predation) the distribution of the fish is less dispersed which shows that the model allows for density dependent behaviour. Large-scale migration is an interplay between reactive and predictive movement control and when only one of these is allowed, the individuals are unable to adapt properly. Throughout most of its life the fish relies heavily on reactive movement, but during the spawning migration predictive movement control is applied almost exclusively. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Genetic experssion of temperature tolerance in the copepod Eurytemora affinis in different salinity and temperature environments
VL  - 91
IS  - 4
SP  - 561-565
AB  - The genetic expression of temperature tolerance in Eurytemora affinis Poppe in different environments was investigated by testing temperature tolerances of broods in pairs of salinity and temperature environments. Three methods were used to identify interaction between genotype and environment: (1) the correlation between mean tolerances of halves of broods grown in the two environments, (2) brood by environment interaction and (3) heritabilities in the two environments. All correlations between means of half broods were positive, only one of six brood by environment interactions was significant and the heritability estimates were not markedly different. Thus, the variability in temperature tolerance in different salinities and in different temperatures seems to be due to the same genes; and selection pressure on temperature tolerance is in the same direction with seasonal changes in temperature and salinity. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. Methods are reported for the cultivation of harpacticoid copepods in the laboratory and their utilization for genetic research. 2. Experimental evidence has been obtained that certain ecological parameters, such as salinity and temperature, act as powerful selective agents. This has been demonstrated by considering the effects of the physical environment on the visible polymorphism as well as on the concealed genetic variability. 3. The first results of a series of experiments show that biotic factors can play a selective role which is at least as much effective as that played by physical factors. 4. Another line of investigation followed consists in the study of reproductive isolation between geographic populations of the same species. © 1970 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.

TI  - Effect of rearing temperatures on the sex ratios of Oreochromis niloticus populations
VL  - 258
IS  - 1
SP  - 270-277
AB  - A comprehensive experiment was carried out to study the effect of different temperature regimes (18 degrees C for 20 days, 36 degrees C for 10 days or 38 degrees C for 10 days starting on day 10 post fertilization) on sex ratios in two different Nile tilapia populations (Lake Manzala-Egypt, Lake Rudolph-Kenya) and their crosses, as well as to study the repeatability of the obtained results and the effects of mating partners, including temperature-treated males, on temperature responsiveness. In total about 15,000 temperature-treated fish and their corresponding 10,000 fullsib controls were sexed. Results of this study confirmed results from other studies that high temperature treatments could increase the percentage of males in the offspring of Nile tilapia by converting females into functional males (XX neomales). Compared to the 36 degrees C treatment, a further increase in males was not obtained with a treatment of 38 degrees C in the majority of the tested progenies in both populations. The low temperature treatment (18 degrees C) was, in general, not effective in influencing the sex ratios. Significant differences between populations to high temperature responsiveness were observed with regard to the degree and the range of response. In the Lake Manzala population, 66% of the temperature-treated progenies (36 degrees C) showed sex ratios with more than 80% males, while in the Lake Rudolph population, no temperature-treated progeny (36 degrees C) showed such a corresponding surplus of males, neither did the crossbreds. Spawns within the Lake Manzala population were repeated and the percentage of males in the 36 degrees C-treated replicated spawns differed only by 2% to 6%. Temperature-treated progenies derived from genetic males out of temperature-sensitive progenies reflected the sex ratios of the progenies the sires had been taken from and indicated that the sensitivity to temperature treatment is heritable. Data on paternal and maternal half sibs used as experimental fish, showed that the sensitivity of sex ratios to temperature treatment varied between breeding pairs. Both parents, male and female, contributed to the different sex ratios after treatment. It was concluded that the sensitivity of sex determination to temperature treatments is under genetic control and suggests very promising chances for a selection response. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 100
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-30
AB  - Supercooling point (SCP), survival at low temperatures, rate of water loss in dry air at 20degreesC and survival under desiccating conditions of eggs of Polydesmus angustus (Diplopoda) were determined. The results were compared with those obtained previously for the eight post-embryonic stadia, to obtain an overview of the changes in resistance to cold and desiccation throughout the species' development. The SCP temperatures of egg batches ranged from -14.8 to -30.6degrees C and were significantly lower than those of the active stadia. Eggs were not affected by prolonged exposure to low temperature above 0degreesC and survived much better than active stadia when cooled to -6 and -10degreesC. This indicates that the cold hardiness of P. angustus is highest in the egg stage and decreases during development. On the other hand, the rate of water loss was significantly higher from eggs than from active stadia. When eggs were taken out of their protective nest, they lost water at the high rate of 7% min(-1) in dry air. They also survived for a shorter time than active stadia at 76% RH and 20degreesC. The resistance to desiccation of P. angustus is lowest at the egg stage and increases during development. The results suggest that the life cycle of P. angustus may have responded to selection pressures other than cold and drought, and do not support the hypothesis that cold hardiness and resistance to desiccation are overlapping adaptations in terrestrial arthropods.

TI  - Survival of Salmonella sp. in surface waters under variable thermal conditions
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 935-943
AB  - The majority of cases of salmonellosis reported in the journals are related with food. Nevertheless, a number of studies have investigated the incidence and survival of salmonella in rivers, coastal water and lakes. Salmonella is frequently isolated from water sources, which serve as bacterial reservoirs and may possibly aid transmission between hosts. Salmonella is constantly released into the environment from infected humans, farm animals, pets, and wildlife. Compared to other microorganisms, Salmonella sp. has high survival ratio in aquatic environments it outlives Staphylococcus aureus and even the waterborne Vibrio cholerae in surface waters and in heavily eutro-phied river water. Nutrient lack, osmotic stress, visible light and temperature appear to be the abiotic factors that most negatively influence survival. The presence of Salmonella sp. in aquatic environments does not vary seasonally and is independent of water temperature. Due to its common accessibility, water is an environment which plays an essential role in spread of diseases. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of selected temperatures on the survival rate of bacilli of the genus Salmonella, and the dynamics of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time in bathing waters used for recreation, tested under laboratory conditions. The samples for the study were collected from Borowno lake in the commune of Dobrez, county Bydgoszcz. In the experiment it was stated that Salmonella bacilli survived longer in water at 4 degrees C (20 weeks), as compared with 20 degrees C (12 weeks). According to regression analysis, reduction rate of bacterial population in the present study at 4 degrees C was 0.54 log, while at 20 degrees C it was higher and amounted to 0.62 log. Therefore, it can be concluded that a lower temperature has a stabilizing effect on bacilli of the genus Salmonella.

VL  - 27

SP  - 485-510
AB  - The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most economically valuable pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide. Bees are also crucial in maintaining biodiversity by pollinating numerous plant species whose fertilisation requires an obligatory pollinator. Apis mellifera is a species that has shown great adaptive potential, as it is found almost everywhere in the world and in highly diverse climates. In a context of climate change, the variability of the honey bee's life-history traits as regards temperature and the environment shows that the species possesses such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise to the selection of development cycles suited to new environmental conditions. Although we do not know the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change, there is a large body of data at our disposal indicating that environmental changes have a direct influence on honey bee development. In this article, the authors examine the potential impact of climate change on honey bee behaviour, physiology and distribution, as well as on the evolution of the honey bee's interaction with diseases. Conservation measures will be needed to prevent the loss of this rich genetic diversity of honey bees and to preserve ecotypes that are so valuable for world biodiversity.

AB  - An experimental design was applied to improve the reaction conditions for enzymatic synthesis of ampicillin from phenylglycine methyl ester (PGME) and 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), catalyzed by penicillin G acylase from E. coli immobilized on an agarose-glyoxyl derivative. The presence and magnitude of interactions between reaction variables were estimated using a 25 factorial design. A batch reactor was employed to assess the influence of the following variables: pH, temperature, initial 6-APA concentration, buffer concentration, and the presence of methadol. Response variables were productivity, selectivity, and yield (based on initial 6-APA concentration). The best synthesis yield (56.9%) was at T = 4degreesC and pH 6.5. The highest productivity (49.3 x 10(-3)mM of antibiotic/min) was achieved at T = 25degreesC and pH 6.5. Our results indicate that it is possible to achieve high productivity for this system while maintaining a high selectivity and yield.

TI  - Metabolomics reveals unique and shared metabolic changes in response to heat shock, freezing and desiccation in the Antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica
VL  - 54
IS  - 4
SP  - 645-655
AB  - The midge, Belgica antarctica Jacobs, is subjected to numerous environmental stressors during its 2-year life cycle on the Antarctic Peninsula, and in response it has evolved a suite of behavioral, physiological, and life-cycle modifications to counter these stressors, but thus far only a limited number of biochemical adaptations have been identified. In this study, we use a metabolomics approach to obtain a broad overview of changes in energy metabolism, amino acids, and polyols in response to three of the midge's major stresses: heat, freezing, and desiccation. Using GC-MS analysis, a total of 75 compounds were identified. Desiccation (50% water loss) elicited the greatest physiological response (as determined by principal components analysis) when compared to untreated controls, with many elevated metabolites from pathways of central carbohydrate metabolism and a decrease in free amino acids. When larvae were frozen (6 h at -10 degrees C), alanine and aspartate increased as well as urea. Freezing also increased three polyols (glycerol, mannitol, erythritol), while desiccation increased only two polyols (glycerol, erythritol). Heating the midges for 1 h at 30 degrees C elevated alpha-ketoglutarate and putrescine while suppressing glycerol, glucose, and serine levels. Freezing and desiccation elicited elevation of four shared metabolites, whereas no shared metabolites were elevated by heat. All three treatments resulted in a reduction in serine, potentially identifying this amino acid as a marker for stress in this species. A number of metabolic changes, especially those in the sugar and polyol pools, are adaptations that have potential to enhance survival during both cold and desiccation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cells of a diploid line obtained from embryos with the Down's syndrome, known to be unable to repair gamma-induced DNA damage, were treated with natural (garlic extract, retinol) and synthetic (crown compound) antimutagens and with adapting factors (heat shock, low CdCl2 concentrations, 10 -8 M). The protective effect was evaluated by registering DNA breaks and cell survival, and the protection coefficients were calculated. The most effective results were obtained with the use of the garlic extract and retinol. No protection of the DNA structure was observed when cells were treated with low concentrations of cadmium chloride and then with high concentrations, i. e., no adaptive response (AR) was formed under these conditions. The spectrum of proteins in treated and control cells as well as detoxication genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, CYP1A1) were determined. © 2009 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

SP  - 345-352
AB  - Experimental protocols for the selective production of 6-O-acylhexoaldose emulsifiers from precursor sugars (mannose, glucose, galactose) and corresponding fatty acids are compared. The protocols employ an immobilized Candida antarctica lipase in a solvent (acetone) which is both easily eliminated and accepted by the European Economic Community for use as an extraction solvent in the manufacture of foods and/or food additives. This comparative study provides guidelines for selection of appropriate conditions for quantitative monoacylation of aldoses in acetone, on the basis of the solubilities of the precursor sugar and the monoester in acetone at different temperatures. Although relatively low temperatures (<40°C) favor precipitation of glucose monoesters, higher temperatures (e.g., 55°C) should be used to increase solubility of mannose and thus selectivity of the reaction leading to the mannose ester. Galactose is transformed with poor selectivity to the desired monoester by these procedures. Factors affecting the viability of these synthetic reactions in acetone are also discussed.

TI  - Quantitative genetics of sexual plasticity: The environmental threshold model and genotype-by-environment interaction for phallus development in the snail Bulinus truncatus
VL  - 54
IS  - 5
SP  - 1614-1625
AB  - Sexual polymorphisms are model systems for analyzing the evolution of reproductive strategies. However, their plasticity and other binary traits have rarely been studied, with respect to environmental variables. A possible reason is that, although threshold models offer an adequate quantitative genetics framework for binary traits in a single environment, analyzing their plasticity requires more refined empirical and theoretical approaches. The statistical framework proposed here, based on the environmental threshold model (ETM), should partially fill this gap. This methodology is applied to an empirical dataset on a plastic sexual polymorphism, aphally, in the snail Bulinus truncatus. Aphally is characterized by the co-occurrence of regular hermaphrodites (euphallics) together with hermaphrodites deprived of the male copulatory organ (aphallics). Reaction norms were determined for 40 inbred lines, distributed at three temperatures, in a first experiment. A second experiment allowed us to rule out maternal effects. We confirmed the existence of high broad-sense heritabilities as well as a positive effect of high temperatures on aphally. However a significant genotype-by-environment interaction was detected for the first time, suggesting that sexual plasticity itself can respond to selection. A nested series of four ETM-like models was developed for estimating genetical effects on both mean aphally rate and plasticity. These models were tested using a maximum-likelihood procedure and fitted to aphally data. Although no perfect fit of models to data was observed, the refined versions of ETM models conveniently reduce the analysis of complex reaction norms of binary traits into standard quantitative genetics parameters, such as genetic values and environmental variances.

TI  - Variation in thermal tolerance among three Mississippi river populations of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 221-226
AB  - To investigate the occurrence of thermal adaptation in the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, inhabiting the lower reaches of the Mississippi River, we compared lethal heat-tolerance among three populations (mussels collected at Lake Pepin, MN; Alton, IL; and Baton Rouge, LA). We determined time-to-death at 32 degrees C for 160 individuals per site, for mussels collected at a water temperature of 15 degrees C and then maintained in the laboratory for about 8 wk under uniform conditions. Both shell length and condition index significantly affected survival time and were included as covariates in the analysis for interpopulation differences in heat-tolerance. Zebra mussels from our southernmost location had a higher heat-tolerance than those from the two northern locations. This difference in heat-tolerance among sites may indicate adaptation to local temperature regimes. In addition, in a comparison of heat tolerance within populations, we separated mussels into size classes (where larger mussels have been exposed to local conditions longer) and calculated an adjusted mean time-to-death (TTD). We found a different TTD/size relationship depending on sampling location. Minnesota mussels had decreasing heat tolerance as size increased, where Louisiana mussels had the opposite relationship. These patterns of heat-tolerance within populations indicate a selection pressure for increased heat-tolerance at Louisiana. However, even if the selection pressure is strong at the Louisiana site, it has not (at least not yet) resulted in an adaptation, as high heat-tolerance is not ubiquitous within this population. Zebra mussels may have insufficient genetic variation for heat-tolerance or gene flow may have been too strong for genetic adaptation to occur in the short amount of time that zebra mussels have occurred in the lower Mississippi River.

TI  - Cryopreservation of red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus) sperm: Effect of cryoprotectants and cooling rates on sperm motility, sperm viability, and fertilization capacity
VL  - 72
IS  - 1
SP  - 129-138
AB  - Sperm cryopreservation of red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus) is essentially unexplored, although many species of the Lutjanidae family are considered to be high-value commercial species. The objective of this study was to develop a species-specific cryopreservation protocol for red snapper (L. argentimaculatus) sperm by optimizing cryoprotectants and cooling rates in the cryopreservation procedure. Tell cryoprotectants at four concentrations and two freezing protocols were examined ill two separate experiments. In the first experiment, toxicity studies of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol, propylene glycol (PG), ethylene glycol (EG), formamide, methanol, ethanol, sucrose, trehalose, and dimethylacetamide (DMA) on sperm motility were performed. Semen diluted 1: 1 in Ringer solution were exposed to cryoprotectants at four final concentrations of 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% for periods of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 min at room temperature (25 degrees C). The cryoprotectants and concentrations that showed the least toxic effect oil sperm motility were selected for cryopreservation trials. In the second experiment, selected cryoprotectants were then assessed for freezing capacity of sperm as follows: DMSO 5% and 10%, PG 5% and 10%, EG 5% and 10%, ethanol 5%, and methanol 5%. Semen was diluted 1:1 in Ringer solution and equilibrated with selected cryoprotectants for 10 min at room temperature. Sperm were frozen in a controlled-rate programmable freezer at four cooling rates of 3, 5, 10, and 12 degrees C/min from all initial temperature of 25 degrees C to final temperatures of -40 or -80 degrees C before plunging into liquid nitrogen. Sperm equilibrated in 10% DMSO and cooled at a rate of 10 degrees C/min to a final temperature of -80 degrees C had the highest motility (91.1 +/- 2.2%) and viability (92.7 +/- 2.3%) after thawing. The fertilization rate of frozen-thawed sperm (72.4 +/- 2.4%) was not different (P > 0.05) from that of fresh sperm (75.5 +/- 2.4%). This study apparently represents the first reported attempt for cryopreservation of L. argentimaculatus sperm. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of soil freezing events in interannual patterns of stream chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire
VL  - 37
IS  - 8
SP  - 1575-1580
AB  - Soil freezing is a disturbance of the below ground environment, potentially resulting in increased losses of NO3- and surface water acidification. Here, we report the effects of soil freezing on interannual variation in stream chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Data from 1970 to 1997 of soil frost depth, snow cover, precipitation, air temperature, and stream discharge and chemistry were used in a stepwise linear regression model to select the variables that best predicted deviations of annual stream concentrations from 4-year running averages. Variables quantifying soil freezing severity were selected as significant predictors of short-term fluctuations in stream K+, NO3-, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations from 1970 to 1989, explaining 59 and 47% of the short-term variability in K+ and NO3-, respectively. Fine-root mortality and disturbance of root-soil-microbe interactions, with subsequent effects on decomposition and nutrient uptake, likely contributed to the mobilization of K+ and NO3- to streamwater following severe soil freezing events. The relationship between soil freezing and stream chemistry, however, weakened during the period 1990-1997. Because soil freezing has had inconsistent effects on stream chemistry during the period 1970-1997, it is unclear whether future changes in the frequency, duration, and depth of soil freezing events as the result of changes in the snow cover regime under a warmer climate will have significant impacts on the losses of NO3- and nutrient-base cations from temperate northern ecosystems.

VL  - 177

SP  - 637-643
AB  - Along a thermal gradient and under a LD 12:12 h cycle, nurse workers of the ant Camponotus mus select for the brood two different temperatures daily: 30.8°C at the middle of the light period (circadian phase = 90°), and 27.5°C 8 h later, during the dark period (CP = 210°). Brood-carrying activity proved to be self-sustained, running its two daily bursts free with a similar period of 23.5 h, under both LL and DD. The LD alternation acted as a strong Zeitgeber. A phase-delay of the LD 12:12 h cycle reset the overt rhythm at once, being both daily events locked-on to the delayed light: dark transition. However, changes in expression, non-occurrence, or even splitting of the two daily brood-carrying events during resetting depended on the phase of the delayed DL transition. By comparing the occurrence of activity with predictions based on a threshold curve of thermal sensitivity, results indicated that an immediate resetting of the involved pacemaker actually takes place. Nurse workers do not directly control the total time spent by the brood at the selected temperature. Instead, the endogenously-driven thermal sensitivity triggers their thermal-searching behavior at two critical times of the day, when environmental temperature is expected to reach its maximum and minimum. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 238

SP  - 1-19
AB  - RNA/DNA ratios and the condition factor, as determined by weight and length of glass-eels, Anguilla japonica, were evaluated for assessment of nutritional status. The negative correlation of RNA/DNA ratios and condition factor between capture months corresponded to an increase in DNA content and to a decrease in dry weight, respectively. These findings indicated that the body material decreased in the later caught glass-eels, but, in contrast, DNA content and ossification increased. These phenomena were explained by such factors as food density and metabolic energy requirements. We concluded that the development of the glass-eel with poor feeding is influenced by differences in ambient water temperature, and that expended endogenous nutrition originates in the leptocephali.

VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 451-475
AB  - This paper is a general introduction to a series dealing with the state of the trout fishery in Tasmania. Methods of collecting and analysing information are described, and the general scope of the survey is outlined. The examination of a large number of scales in relation to the length of fish has shown that scales normally appear when the fish are about 3.6 cm in length. They grow rapidly at first and quickly establish a straight-line relationship between fish length and scale length. Tagging tests carried out on small fish have shown that a large proportion of fish under 14 cm are unable to carry jaw-tags for more than 2 months. This is related to the relative weight of fish and tag in water, when the fish weight is reduced to about one-twentieth of its weight in air, and the tag is thus heavier than the fish. Experimental work on selective breeding failed to yield significant results, probably owing to nutritional deficiencies associated with hatchery rearing. The growth of individual brown and rainbow trout in relation to temperature was followed for about 3 years. © 1957, CSIRO. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trigger factor is induced upon cold shock and enhances viability of Escherichia coli at low temperatures
VL  - 94
IS  - 10
SP  - 4978-4981
AB  - Trigger factor (TF) in Escherichia coli is a molecular chaperone with remarkable properties: it has prolyl-isomerase activity, associates with nascent polypeptides on ribosomes, binds to GroEL, enhances GroEL's affinity for unfolded proteins, and promotes degradation of certain polypeptides, Because the latter effects appeared larger at 20 degrees C, we studied the influence of temperature on TF expression, Unlike most chaperones (e.g., GroEL), which are heat-shock proteins (hsps), TF levels increased progressively as growth temperature decreased from 42 degrees C to 16 degrees C and even rose in cells stored at 4 degrees C, Upon temperature downshift from 37 degrees C to 10 degrees C or exposure to chloramphenicol, TF synthesis was induced, like that of many cold-shock proteins, We therefore tested if TF expression might be important for viability at low temperatures, When stored at 4 degrees C, E, coli lose viability at exponential rates, Cells with reduced TF content die faster, while cells overexpressing TF showed greater viability, Although TF overproduction protected against cold, it reduced viability at 50 degrees C, while TF deficiency enhanced viability at this temperature, By contrast, overproduction of GroEL/ES, or hsps generally, while protective against high temperatures, reduced viability at 4 degrees C, which may explain why expression of hsps is suppressed In the cold. Thus, TF represents an example of an E. coli protein which protects cells against low temperatures, Moreover, the differential induction of TF at low temperatures and hsps at high temperatures appears to provide selective protection against these opposite thermal extremes.

TI  - Reproductive strategy in Drosophila melanogaster: Significance of a genetic divergence between temperate and tropical populations
VL  - 53
IS  - 3
SP  - 323-329
AB  - Reproductive capacities of tropical and temperate populations of D. melanogaster were compared using three complementary techniques: (1) measure of egg production by females grown in the laboratory under uncrowded conditions and provided as adults with abundant food; (2) study of egg production of flies of unknown ages, collected in nature and then kept in similar conditions; and (3) analysis of ovarian activity of wild females dissected just after their capture. Tropical populations showed a lower fecundity in the laboratory and this was also observed in laboratory reared adults. On the average, flies also appeared to be older in the tropics than in temperate countries. These data, together with ecological observations showing that tropical populations live in a more predictable and stable environment, suggest that temperature populations are r-selected, while tropical ones are K-selected. The study of ovarian activity of wild females failed however to confirm this expectation. Tropical flies, which have a lower genetic fecundity, generally appeared to produce more propagules than did temperate flies. Such a contradiction shows how the ideas of r- and K-selection are difficult to apply to natural populations of Drosophila. Population density and interindividual competition are probably not the main selective forces in nature. Attention must also be paid to the necessity of exploring the environment to find resources, to the role of predation and parasitism, and to the occurrence in temperate countries of seasonal fluctuations with different selective pressures on successive generations. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 361-367
AB  - ABSTRACT. Adults of Hippodamia convergens Guerin‐Meneville (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) form massive overwintering aggregations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. These diapausing pre‐reproductive adults may remain in the aggregations for up to 10 months. Beetles were collected from overwintering sites in Nevada County, California, and held at 4d̀C for 6 weeks. In order to simulate the winter to summer transition, the beetles were transferred to 20d̀C and 68% r.h. under a LD 12:12h cycle. Supercooling points increased slightly from ‐ 16d̀C on day 0 to ‐ 12.9CC on day 21. In contrast, low temperature tolerance decreased markedly within 2 weeks. On day 0 nearly all beetles survive 2 h of exposure to ‐ 5d̀C, whereas only 50% survived this treatment on day 4. These data demonstrate the general lack of correlation between the supercooling point and the lower lethal temperature in warm‐acclimated beetles. Within 1 day of transfer to 20d̀C, oxygen consumption decreased by 26%. This decrease continued through day 14 when the rate of oxygen consumption had decreased to 40% of initial values. Beetles acclimated to 20d̀C selected temperatures significantly higher than cold‐acclimated beetles. The parametric shifts observed in this study are consistent with a physiological transition from cold‐hardiness and energy conservation during winter to one of dispersal, feeding and reproduction in summer beetles.

AB  - The effect of additives, such as an inorganic alkali and a nickel catalyst, on the hydrothermal process was examined to generate hydrogen from biomass with high selectivity at relatively low temperatures around 400 degrees C. At first, a cellulose sample as model biomass was subjected to the hydrothermal process at 400 degrees C under 25 MPa in the presence of an alkali (Na(2)CO(3)) and a nickel catalyst (Ni/SiO(2)). The combination of these two additives led not only to highly efficient generation of hydrogen but also to effective dissolution of CO(2) into an alkaline liquid layer. Here the molar yields of gas products from the cellulose sample were compared with the equilibrium quantities obtained using a thermodynamics calculation software. Furthermore, the hydrothermal process of real biomass, such as wood chips, organic fertilizer and food waste, in the presence of both the two additives resulted in highly selective production of hydrogen even at 400 degrees C.

AB  - This study examined the effects of two selection treatments (elevated water temperature and air exposure) on the genetic and physiological characteristics of the juvenile marine mussel, Mytilus edulis (<10 mm). Genetic effects were measured on five allozymes and fitness assessed using physiological tests to estimate energy balance (scope for growth) as well as size, growth and survival. The in vitro treatments resulted in 48% mortality from an air exposure of 11 h at 27°C and 76% mortality from a 6-h exposure to 33°C water. Survivors (n = 1,152) of each treatment along with controls (n = 2,304) were measured and randomly placed in compartmentalized cages. Mussels were deployed to three bays in Prince Edward Island, Canada and monitored over a 10-month period. Initially, both of the treatments had an effect on mussel size and increased the heterozygosity of the surviving mussels. Physiological analyses after 3 months in the field showed that the two treated mussels showed lower metabolic rate that the control group. After 10 months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality than the untreated control mussels. Unexplained environmental interaction in each of the bays had an effect on allelic frequencies and heterozygosity. Overall, the results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness. However, more field data is needed to determine the consistency of the increased productivity and if the increased productivity justifies the costs of a selective treatment. Furthermore, because the level of heterozygosity in juvenile mussel populations can vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, it may be effective as a warning of future natural mass mortality when overall heterozygosity levels are found to be low. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Diel locomotor activity of brook charr, as determined by radiotelemetry
VL  - 49
IS  - 6
SP  - 1174-1185
AB  - Locations by radiotelemetry during eight 24-h sampling periods in 1991, 1992, and 1993 were used to evaluate the diel activity patterns of adult brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis in two lakes of the Laurentian Shield (Quebec, Canada). Based on the minimum distance travelled between two consecutive locations, adult brook charr were more active at dusk and at night than during the day. During daylight periods, individual fish displayed strong site selection, remaining in the same area along the shore from day to day. The fish left their inshore position at dusk, were highly mobile during the night, and returned to their focal point at sunrise, exhibiting diel homing behaviour. These results are supported by an increase in gillnet captures of adult brook charr in Lac Melchior at night. Data obtained by gillnet fishing in lakes Bondi and Simpson shelved that juvenile (1+) brook charr were active throughout the diel cycle and that young-of-the-year were active mainly during the day, suggesting that there is an ontogenetic change in the diel activity of brook charr. Despite its limitations (restrictions on the number and size of tracked individuals, post-manipulation mortality, lifetime of transmitter battery), radiotelemetry allows for collection of multiple behavioural observations (distances travelled, instantaneous activity, site selection and homing) during the activity cycle of individual fish, and thus provides a finer degree of spatial resolution than alternative methods such as gillnetting.

TI  - Elevated temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations: Effects on selected microbial activities in temperate agricultural soils
VL  - 25
IS  - 11
SP  - 1887-1900
AB  - Human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Research has demonstrated this increased concentration will affect our climate by causing increases in temperature and altered weather patterns. The effects of climate change have been studied, including effects on some ecosystems throughout the world. There are studies that report changes in the soil due to climate change, but many did not extend their research to the microorganisms that inhabit soils. In our analysis of soil microorganisms that may be affected by climate change, two microbial outcomes emerged as having particular ecological and societal importance. Perturbations in the soil environment could lead to community shifts and altered metabolic activity in microorganisms involved in soil nutrient cycling, and to increasing or decreasing survival and virulence of soil-mediated pathogenic microorganisms. Alterations in CO2 concentrations and temperature may alter soil respiration, soil carbon dynamics, and microbial community structure. Microbial-mediated processes that play an important role in the nitrogen cycle may also be influenced as a result of climate change. The potential for an increase in frequency of horizontal gene transfer due to changing climatic factors is of concern due to possible evolutionary changes in soil-borne pathogen populations, including the spread of virulence factors and genes that aid in environmental survival. We suggest that soil microbial communities in temperate agricultural systems continue to be researched for alterations to community structure, specifically the increase or decrease of soil activity and respiration, nitrification and denitrification, pathogen survival and alterations to horizontal gene transfer. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

SP  - 210-216
AB  - Orconectes rusticus currently is undergoing an explosive range expansion in the midwestern U.S.A., but information on the potentially important effects of water temperature on the species' biology is lacking. The thermal ecology of O. rusticus in southwestern Ohio, U.S.A., was examined by determining 1) the effects of four water temperatures (16, 20, 25, and 29°C) on survival and growth of juveniles, 2) the responses of juveniles and adults to a thermal gradient (7-27° C), and 3) the thermal tolerances (critical thermal maximum, CTMax, and critical thermal minimum, CTMin) of free-living, field-acclimatized juveniles and adults on a biweekly basis throughout the summer. Month-long growth experiments predicted maximum growth rates of juveniles at water temperatures between 26 and 28°C, but greatest survival between 20 and 22° C. Laboratory-acclimated (22° C) adults and field-acclimatized (2.5° C) juveniles both had an acute preferred temperature of 22° C. CTMaxs and CTMins of juveniles were 0.5-2.6° C higher than those of adults throughout the summer, suggesting that juveniles were exposed to water temperatures 1.5-6.8° C warmer than those of adults. Juvenile and adult O. rusticus prefer habitats where water temperatures favor maximum survival, but they usually are not found together in the same habitat; adults apparently displace the juveniles into warmer habitats. Warmer temperatures can decrease survival of juveniles but improve their growth rates, leading to enhanced fecundity and competitive ability. The past and future success of O. rusticus in expanding its range may depend, in part, on the species ability to adjust to new thermal environments occupied by other species of crayfish. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Different age-specific demographic profiles are generated in the same normal-lived Drosophila strain by different longevity stimuli
VL  - 57
IS  - 11
SP  - B390-B398
AB  - We review the empirical data obtained with our normal-lived Ra control strain of Drosophila and show that this one genome is capable of invoking at least three different responses to external stimuli that induce the animal to express one of three different extended longevity phenotypes, each of which arises from one of three different antagonistic molecular mechanisms of stress resistance. The phenotypes are distinguished by different age-specific mortality patterns. Depending on the selected mechanism, the genome may respond by expressing a delayed onset of senescence (type 1), an increased early survival (type 2), or an increased late survival (type 3) phenotype, suggesting their different demographic effects. We suggest that the different demographic effects stem in part from the differential ability of each selection regime to reallocate the organism's energy from reproduction to somatic maintenance. These data document the complexity of the aging process and argue for a relationship between molecular mechanisms and longevity phenotypes. © Oxford University Press 2002.

SP  - 482-487
AB  - Developmental times of white, orange, and head capsule age classes of pink bollworm (PBW), Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), eggs, five larval instars, and pupae were determined at selected constant temperatures ranging from 20.0 to 35.5°C. Within the egg stage, the orange age class required the longest time to complete development, ca. 50-60% of total egg developmental time. Although most larvae (84-92% of each cohort) developed through only four instars, five instars were also observed for each temperature tested, and at 33.5°C two larvae developed through six instars. The effect of an additional instar increased developmental times 3-6 days for the complete larval stage. At each temperature, developmental time among each of the first three (for four-instar larvae) or four (for five-instar larvae) instars was essentially the same; however the last instar (either fourth or fifth) required ca. 2-to 2.5-fold longer to complete development. Analysis of the developmental rate/temperature relationship for the egg, larval, and pupal stages yielded average lower developmental thresholds of 13.10, 12.38, and 11.69°C, respectively. Degree-day requirements for each age class are reported. © 1986 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - Purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) raised against Salmonella typhimurium flagellin was coupled to a range of magnetic particles. Binding of cells to the immunomagnetic particles was quantified using a bioluminescence technique. Based on the results obtained, Dynabeads were selected for further study. Various factors including the bacterial growth medium and the time and temperature of incubation affected cell binding. A 10 min incubation at ambient temperature was selected to maximise immunological binding and to minimise non-specific interactions. Using these optimised separation parameters, S. typhimurium was enriched from a range of mixed cultures by between 3- and 2,700-fold. Several commercially available genus-specific Salmonella antisera were coupled to Dynabeads and screened for efficacy of cell binding. The optimum immunomagnetic particle system was used to separate viable Salmonella enteritidis from artificially contaminated egg yolk and detected down to a level of about 105cfu.g-1in 20 min using the firefly bioluminescent assay. Further applications of the immunomagnetic particle technique are discussed. © 1991, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - (1) The order principle (o.p.) states: "The grains of an emulsion become developable in the course of an exposure in a given sequence independent of the exposure and development variables." This hypothesis appears to have a wide range of applicability. It forms an ideally simple link for correlating experimental isodense exposures and theoretical single grain response predictions. Moreover, in many cases where the o.p. is not strictly applicable, corrections can be derived (Section 12) which again make quantitative comparison of theory and experimental data possible. (2) Extending ideas of Gurney, Mott, and Webb, a quantitative theory of the low intensity reciprocity law failure (l.i.f.) is developed, by analyzing the statistics of light absorption and the survival function of the electrons. Confrontation of various theoretical possibilities with experimental data selects the following basic assumptions: (a) A monoatomic Ag speck of sub-latent image is unstable against thermal agitation, but a diatomic speck is stable for most practical purposes; finally a triatomic speck is completely stable. (b) The energy required to set free an electron from a monoatomic speck (electron trap depth) is not the same for all traps. There must be a quasi-continuous distribution of depths (e.g. as given by formula (10)). With these assumptions the theory describes satisfactorily the principal features in the shape of experimental l.i.f. curves. It is found that the l.i.f. slope varies systematically with grain size and the theory checks qualitatively with this result. The experimental temperature dependence of l.i.f. curves agrees satisfactorily with the theory.

AB  - The importance of energy saving and pollution reduction for the survival of our planet is tremendous. In order to better characterize the role that may be played by infrared films in this regard, we produced first, photometric spectra for some films, which gives a good idea about their effectiveness in cutting the blackbody radiation from the sun. Second, we considered that a complementary investigation that would allow us to estimate the temperature reduction due to these films will give a better picture of the energy saving role of these films, keeping in mind the need for an experimental method that may play this role in a selective way. We mean that the method should be able to selectively give the temperature reduction from blackbody radiation at the expenses of other contributing processes especially the heat conduction process. The results of these investigations are presented and analyzed. We conclude with some important recommendations.

VL  - 325
IS  - 2
SP  - 157-161
AB  - In ponds, a chemical produced by predaceous Chaoborus (Insecta, Diptera) larvae changes the development of juvenile Daphnia pulex (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) so the juveniles grow spines (neckteeth) on the back of their head. It is generally assumed that the spined phenotype is (or is an indicator of) a morphological predator defense. The research reported here tests the hypothesis that the induced neckteeth do in fact increase Daphnia survivorship, over a range of temperatures. Predation experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures from 6 to 22 degrees C using fourth instar Chaoborus americanus larvae as the predator. The prey were a mixture of spined (induced ''necktooth'' phenotype) and unspined (uninduced) juvenile Daphnia pulex. At 6 and 11 degrees C, Chaoborus selected the unspined phenotype over the spined phenotype, as expected. However, at 22 degrees C, the selectivity was reversed: significantly fewer on the spined survived compared to the unspined phenotype. These results suggest that the spined phenotype may either increase or decrease Daphnia pulex survival, depending on temperature and clone.

AB  - Characteristics of the nesting habitat of Trionyx mutica were studied below Lock and Dam 19, upper Mississippi River. A1/2 km section of sandy shoreline where T. mutica had previously been found to be abundant was examined for nests. Nest construction occurred between mid June and mid July. Active nests, those containing eggs, were found in sandy soils within a narrow range of surface temperatures (36—37°C). The preferred sites were exposed to direct sunlight with little or no vegetation present. Over 90% of the active nests were found at sites with these characteristics. False nests were found in areas with much higher or lower soil surface temperatures, which indicated that turtles may select for optimum temperatures. © 2005, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The response surface methodology (RSM) was used in the optimization of a modified recipe of almond paste cookies to pinpoint the best combination of the most important factors, in order to obtain an enhanced product with quality characteristics similar to the typical one. In this modified recipe, bamboo fiber and fructose were added as humectant and anticrystallizing agents to extend the shelf life of the cookies. Five quantitative controllable factors were selected for the experimental design: weight of bamboo fiber, fructose/saccharose ratio (F/S) and weight of egg white as ingredients, and baking time and temperature as process parameters. To assess the product quality, texture, moisture content and color were considered as dependent variables. The three second-order polynomial models obtained by RSM and the subsequent optimization step indicated that a formulation with 28.95 g of fiber, 252.5 g of egg white, an F/S equal to 0.1, baking time and temperature of 21.5 min and 185.5C, respectively, represents the best recipe to manufacture a new product with quality attributes very similar to the typical one and, in addition, with an extended shelf life. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VL  - 5

AB  - Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment, that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones. We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light, temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses, so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our approach can lead to new links between empirical and simulation studies.

SP  - 1549-1553
AB  - Life history characteristics of Lygus elisus Van Duzee were studied at 10, 15,20, 25, 30, and 35degreesC in the laboratory. The egg incubation period, instar-specific nymphal development, survivorship, and longevity of L. elisus were influenced by temperature. Eggs did not hatch at 10degreesC. For the five remaining selected temperature treatments, the incubation period was longest at 15degreesC and decreased nonlinearly with an increase in temperature. Temperature influenced the developmental period differently for different instars, with the second stadium being the shortest at 10, 20, 25, and 30degreesC, whereas first and third stadia were the shot-test at 15 and 35degreesC, respectively. The final stadium was longest across all six temperatures. The relationships between temperature and total durations were described by the same equation for both males and females. Total nymphal duration was not significant with sexes. Sex ratio (proportion of males) of emerging adults of L. elisus did not deviate from 1:1. Both instar-specific and total nymphal survivorship varied significantly with temperature. Total nymphal survivorship was highest at 15degreesC and lowest at 10degreesC. Adult longevity ranged from 16 (35degreesC) to 122 d (15degreesC), with a curvilinear response to temperature. Females survived approximate to10 d longer than males at 20degreesC, but survivorship of males and females was similar at other temperatures. These life history data will be useful in developing a computer model simulating L. elisus population dynamics in the field.

AB  - The relationship between annual abundance (individuals/m2 of the crab Chasmagnathus granulata Dana and selected environmental factors (temperature,, salinity and dissolved oxygen) was investigated in a salt marsh in the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil. Sampling was performed on a monthly basis over 16 months. Highest abundance, which occured during periods of moderate increasing temperature and salinity, may be explained by the species' reproductive and recruitment strategies. Burrows seem to attenuate temperature and salinity variations and the hypoxia to which crabs are constrained when burrowed is solved by metabolic depression. Although C. granulata is good hyper-osmotic regulator, its resistance to low salinities is decreased when subjected to low temperatures, suggesting a temperature-salinity interaction. © 1992.

VL  - 94
IS  - 3
SP  - 330-338
AB  - Many aphid species have shown remarkable adaptability by invading new habitats and agricultural crops, although they are parthenogenetic and might be expected to show limited genetic variation. To determine if the mode of reproduction limits the level of genetic variation in adaptively important traits, we assess variation in 15 life history traits of the pea aphid, Acyrhosiphon pisum (Harris), for five populations sampled along a north-south transect in central North America, and for three traits for three populations from eastern Australia. The traits are developmental times and rates as affected by temperature, body weights as affected by temperature, fecundity, measures of migratory tendency, and photoperiodic responses. The most southerly population from North America is shown to be obligately parthenogenetic, as are the Australian populations, and the four more northerly North American populations are facultatively parthenogenetic with the number of parthenogenetic generations per year increasing from north to south. The broad-sense heritabilities of life history traits varied from 0.36 to 0.71 for nine quantitive traits based on a comparison of within-and between-lineage variances. Using these traits, 7-13 distinct genotypes (i.e. clones) were identified among each of the 18 lines sampled from the North American populations, but the number did not differ significantly among populations. The level of genetic variation differed from trait to trait. For 4 of 12 quantitative traits, the level of variation in the obligately parthenogenetic population from North America was lowest, but significantly lower than all the sexual populations for only 1 trait. The obligately parthenogenetic population had the highest level of genetic variation for two traits, and had intermediate levels for the others. The most northerly population, which was sexual and had relatively few parthenogenetic generations each year, had the lowest level of variation for 5 of 12 traits and the highest level of variation for 2 traits. There was no decline in variability from north to south correlated with the increase in the annual number of parthenogenetic generations. The Australian populations showed no less variation than the North American populations for two of three traits, although the pea aphid was introduced to Australia only 5 years prior to the study, whereas the aphid has been in North America for at least 100 years. The mode of reproduction has not had a substantial impact on the level of genetic variation in life history traits of the pea aphid, but there are population-specific factors that effect the level of variation in certain traits. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Seasonal and geographic adaptation to temperature and salinity in the harpacticoid copepod Zaus spinatus spinatus Goodsir
VL  - 42
IS  - 3
SP  - 253-266
AB  - Ovigerous females of the phytal harpacticoid Zaus spinatus spinatus Goodsir have been tested in the laboratory to determine seasonal and geographic differences in temperature-salinity (T-S) adaptation. Animals collected from a 'summer' and 'winter' population at Robin Hood's Bay (northeast coast of England) and a 'winter' population from the Danish Øresund were submitted to factorial experiments utilizing up to 30 combinations of T and S. Irrespective of temperature, survival at Robin Hood's Bay (RHB) was highest at 34 and 24‰ S; winter survival at 16‰ S increased beyond that in summer. In the Øresund best salinity tolerance at all temperatures was between 8 to 24‰ The optimum survival temperature is about 5°C and does not appear to shift seasonally or between populations; thus 'low-low, high-low' salinity-temperature relationships point to a cold-water phytogeny of the species. Furthermore, the percentage of nauplii hatching.in Øresund specimens is greatest at optimal (16‰) salinities, and the range of salinities over which this rate is best is at 5°C. Analyses of variance indicated that in both seasonally and geographically different populations T and S affect survival independently, but that in combination there results a significant interaction emphasizing the interdependence of these two factors on survival. Means difference test shows significantly different salinity tolerances between RHB summer and winter emphasizing the existence of efficient compensatory mechanisms, and between the Øresund suggesting possible genetic adaptation. Failure to penetrate into the Baltic and establish a seasonally permanent population further south than the northwest Øresund is a consequence of its inability to tolerate high (>24‰) or low (<8‰) salinities at high temperatures (>15°C). It is proposed that the Californian subspecies Z. s. hopkinsi Lang in being physiologically and geographically isolated from the cold-water nominate subspecies is undergoing allopatric speciation in response to an altered temperature environment. © 1980.

AB  - 1. 1.Activity patterns, movements and thermoregulation of 27 adult blacksnakes containing miniature temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters were monitored in spring and summer in a montane area of eastern Australia. 2. 2.Within each season, mean selected body temperatures were similar in the two sexes, regardless of reproductive status. 3. 3.In spring, male temperatures tended to be more variable than those of females, because the long-range movements of males precluded precise thermoregulation. 4. 4.Although ambient (air) temperatures were higher in summer than in spring, the reverse was true of body temperatures: both male and female snakes were approx. 5°C cooler in summer than in spring. 5. 5.Snakes were less active in summer than in spring, and were cooler in summer even when they were active. 6. 6.We attribute the decreased activity levels in summer to drought, which apparently depressed availability of prey (frogs), and hence foraging by the snakes. Under such circumstances, the metabolic costs of maintaining high body temperatures may exceed the likely benefits of unproductive foraging. © 1990.

TI  - Habitat temperature is an important determinant of cholesterol contents in copepods
VL  - 212
IS  - 1
SP  - 71-77
AB  - Effects of habitat and acclimation temperature on cholesterol contents were examined in oceanic and inshore species of copepods. The cholesterol content of five species of thermally acclimated copepods was determined, and nine species ( representing six families) were sampled to assess the role of habitat temperature. The species selected have maximum habitat temperatures ( and temperature tolerances) that vary at least twofold. Levels of dietary cholesterol required to achieve maximum growth were also studied at different acclimation temperatures in a eurythermal copepod. Both eggs and copepodites of Calanus finmarchicus had higher cholesterol levels at the warm acclimation temperature (16 degrees C) than at the cooler temperature (6 degrees C). Neither Acartia tonsa, Acartia hudsonica, Temora longicornis nor Eurytemora affinis altered cholesterol contents with acclimation temperature. Maximum growth rates were achieved at fourfold higher concentrations of dietary cholesterol in warm-acclimated Eurytemora affinis than in cold-acclimated animals. The most consistent trend is the positive relationship between cholesterol content and habitat temperature. Species residing in warmer habitats ( e. g. Centropages typicus, Eurytemora affinis) had approximately twice the cholesterol of species living in colder waters ( e. g. Calanus glacialis, Euchaeta norvegica). A similar pattern was observed for comparisons of species within genera ( Calanus, Acartia and Centropages), with the species abundant at lower latitudes having more cholesterol than the northern congener. These data indicate that habitat temperature is an important determinant of cholesterol content, and cholesterol endows membranes with the stability required for a range of body temperatures.

VL  - 157
IS  - 3
SP  - 527-537
AB  - Viable cells of Candida guilliermondii were immobilized by inclusion into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel using the freezing-thawing method. Entrapment experiments were planned according to a 2(3) full factorial design, using the PVA concentration (80, 100, and 120 g L-1), the freezing temperature (-10, -15, and -20 degrees C), and the number of freezing-thawing cycles (one, three, and five) as the independent variables, integrated with three additional tests to estimate the errors. The effectiveness of the immobilization procedure was checked in Erlenmeyer flasks as the pellet capability to catalyze the xylose-to-xylitol bioconversion of a medium based on sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolysate. To this purpose, the yield of xylitol on consumed xylose, xylitol volumetric productivity, and cell retention yield were selected as the response variables. Cell pellets were then used to perform the same bioconversion in a stirred tank reactor operated at 400 rpm, 30 degrees C, and 1.04 vvm air flowrate. At the end of fermentation, a maximum xylitol concentration of 28.7 g L-1, a xylitol yield on consumed xylose of 0.49 g g(-1) and a xylitol volumetric productivity of 0.24 g L-1 h(-1) were obtained.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity and interpopulation differences in life history traits of Armadillidium vulgare (Isopoda : Oniscidae)
VL  - 137
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-89
AB  - The hypothesis that the balance of trade-offs between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation in the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare will change when resource input is increased has been investigated experimentally. When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer.

VL  - 90

SP  - 117-130
AB  - A rigid polypyrrolone material that exhibits excellent thermal and chemical stability has been studied to determine its potential for novel applications in membrane-based gas separations at elevated temperatures. Operation at high temperatures produces favorably high membrane productivities; however, losses in permselectivity usually occur as well. Gas transport and sorption measurements have been obtained for this polypyrrolone at temperatures up to 200°C. The loss of permselectivity with increasing temperature that occurs for most gas pairs is discussed in terms of both solubility and diffusivity selectivity. The temperature dependences of productivities and permselectivities for various gas paris are also compared to those of other materials thought to be attractive for high temperature gas separations. In most cases, the structurally rigid polypyrrolone out performs these other materials, demonstrating favorable productivities and permselectivities over the entire range of temperatures studied. © 1994.

Laboratory experiments confirmed the field observations. In addition, a decline in the frequency of heterozygotes was observed in two consecutive winters with long periods of ice cover. It is proposed that at least two factors are involved in maintaining the amylase polymorphism: 1) Relative distribution of food resources through frequency‐dependent selection and 2) low temperatures causing high mortality among heterozygotes. © 1977 Mendelian Society of Lund

VL  - 15

SP  - 1618-1630
AB  - Penguins are adapted to live in extreme environments, but they can be highly sensitive to climate change, which disrupts penguin life history strategies when it alters the weather, oceanography and critical habitats. For example, in the southwest Atlantic, the distributional range of the ice-obligate emperor and Adélie penguins has shifted poleward and contracted, while the ice-intolerant gentoo and chinstrap penguins have expanded their range southward. In the Southern Ocean, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode are the main modes of climate variability that drive changes in the marine ecosystem, ultimately affecting penguins. The interaction between these modes is complex and changes over time, so that penguin responses to climate change are expected to vary accordingly, complicating our understanding of their future population processes. Penguins have long life spans, which slow microevolution, and which is unlikely to increase their tolerance to rapid warming. Therefore, in order that penguins may continue to exploit their transformed ecological niche and maintain their current distributional ranges, they must possess adequate phenotypic plasticity. However, past species-specific adaptations also constrain potential changes in phenology, and are unlikely to be adaptive for altered climatic conditions. Thus, the paleoecological record suggests that penguins are more likely to respond by dispersal rather than adaptation. Ecosystem changes are potentially most important at the borders of current geographic distributions, where penguins operate at the limits of their tolerance; species with low adaptability, particularly the ice-obligates, may therefore be more affected by their need to disperse in response to climate and may struggle to colonize new habitats. While future sea-ice contraction around Antarctica is likely to continue affecting the ice-obligate penguins, understanding the responses of the ice-intolerant penguins also depends on changes in climate mode periodicities and interactions, which to date remain difficult to reproduce in general circulation models. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Seasonal response of juvenile Atlantic salmon to experimental hydropeaking power generation in Newfoundland, Canada
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 964-974
AB  - Variable hydropower production leads to hydropeaking, which causes discharge fluctuations that are potentially harmful to aquatic organisms. In this study, an experimental approach was used to investigate hydropeaking effects and associated hydraulic and habitat conditions on the home range and movement of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Prior studies examined the responses of Atlantic salmon and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis to experimental hydropeaking during summer and autumn. The present study focused on Atlantic salmon, involved more rapid and extreme discharge manipulation, and included winter experiments to reflect influences of reduced temperature, ice conditions, and seasonal differences in behavior and habitat selection. Experiments were conducted over a range in discharge (0.5-5.0 m3/s) that resulted in dramatic habitat changes in the wide, shallow, boulder-strewn study reach. Experiments were repeated in summer and winter; however, the winter range in discharge was narrower due to constraints on water release. Fish response was monitored using manual telemetry in both seasons, and fixed telemetry was used to monitor fine-scale diel winter movements. Atlantic salmon had larger home ranges and were more mobile during all flow conditions and over diel cycles in summer than in winter, and there was anecdotal evidence of stranding in isolated pools in summer. Stream morphology, in addition to the magnitude of discharge change, was an important determinant of the propensity to move. In our study, there were considerable refugia from increased velocity and dewatering, which may have reduced the need to move. In winter, fish remained relatively sedentary in comparison with the summer foraging period, and this behavior may increase the likelihood for dewatering, stranding, and freezing. A secondary concern with hydropeaking regimes is the energetic cost to fish of moving to find suitable habitats, and during summer this cost could affect stored energy reserves, which could, in turn, affect overwinter survival. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2005.

VL  - 46

SP  - 640-650
AB  - This paper describes a 3D FE simulation of the cold ironing process for forming the drum clutch, the main part component of the automatic transmission. The process of the drum clutch with inner gears that was employed in this study consists of 12 steps associated with nine deep drawing processes and three ironing processes to form the inner gear shape. The ironing processes were focused on this study in order to estimate the dimensional accuracy of the inner gear shape according to the process variables such as the punch shape, the approach angle of the punch, and the thickness reduction ratio. A rigid-plastic finite element simulation was applied to analyze the deformation characteristics of the ironing processes and to determine the optimum parameter for selected conditions. Finally, an experiment on the whole drum clutch forming process was carried out to examine the validity of the analytical results and the chosen parameters. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Collective behavior of earthquakes and faults: Continuum-discrete transitions, progressive evolutionary changes, and different dynamic regimes
VL  - 46
IS  - 4
AB  - Crustal deformation patterns are affected by multiscale granulation and healing processes associated with phase transitions between continuum and discrete states of rocks. The ongoing continuum-discrete transitions are accompanied by progressive evolution of disordered fault networks to dominant localized fault zones, development of bimaterial interfaces, and increasing dynamic weakening of fault surfaces. Results on individual fault zones point to three general dynamic regimes. The first is associated with broad range of heterogeneities, little dynamic weakening, power law frequency-size statistics, temporal clustering of intermediate and large events, and accelerated seismic release before large earthquakes. The second is associated with relatively uniform localized structures, significant dynamic weakening, characteristic earthquake statistics, and quasi-periodic temporal occurrence of large events without precursory accelerated release. For a range of conditions, the fault zone response can switch back and forth between the foregoing two dynamic regimes. Higher temperature, fluid content, and thickness of sedimentary cover reduce the seismic coupling in a region and change the properties of local earthquake sequences. Brittle regions with high seismic coupling have few foreshocks and long-duration aftershock sequences with high event productivity, whereas more viscous regions with low seismic coupling have increased foreshocks activity and low-productivity aftershock seqvences or swarms. The results provide criteria for organizing data in classes associated with different evolutionary stages and different regional conditions. An ability to recognize the dynamic regime of a given fault zone or a region can increase the information content of the data and lead to improved strategies for seismic hazard assessment.

VL  - 99
IS  - 1
SP  - 65-76
AB  - In earlier experiments with chives (Allium schoenoprasum L.) temperature‐sensitive and temperature‐insensitive cms plants could be selected. To obtain information about the site and nature of the genetic factor(s) responsible for the temperature sensitivity of the cms, temperature‐insensitive and temperauire‐sensitive cms plants were crossed with maintainers as well as with one another. In the progenies each genotype was cloned into two clone members, and these were examined concerning their male sterility under normal (20 °C/14 °C, day/night) as well as under constantly high temperatures (24 °C/ 24 °C). The results indicate that the temperature‐sensitivity of the cms is controlled by a dominant nuclear gene “T”. This acts like a restorer gene at high temperatures and is ineffective at normal temperatures. Accordingly, important conclusions can be drawn with regard to the selection of temperature‐insensitive cms‐lines as well as to the propagation of the cmi‐lines. The results are discussed in connection with the mitochondrial polypeptides probably responsible for the formation of the cms. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

TI  - Altitudinal variation in behavioural thermoregulation: Local adaptation vs. plasticity in California grasshoppers
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 1087-1096
AB  - We investigated the adaptive significance of behavioural thermoregulation in univoltine populations of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes along an altitudinal gradient in California using laboratory tests of animals raised under different temperatures. Trials consisted of continuous body temperature measurements with semi-implanted microprobes in a test arena, and observation and simultaneous recording of behavioural responses. These responses included mobility, basking and orientation of the body axes (aspect angle) towards a radiation source. Mobility and basking are determined by the altitudinal origin of the parental generation and not by the temperature treatments. With increasing altitude, individuals tend increasingly to raise body temperatures via mobility and increased basking. In contrast, body orientation towards the radiation source is influenced by the temperature treatments but not by the altitude of origin. Individuals experiencing higher temperatures during rearing show a lower tendency to lateral flanking. We conclude that body orientation responses are not adapted locally. In contrast other components of the behavioural syndrome that increase body temperature, such as mobility and basking, are adaptive in response to local selection pressure. The thermoregulatory syndrome of these grasshoppers is an important contribution to life-history adaptations that appropriately match season lengths. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted to investigate the effect of selected temperatures on the development, mortality, sex ratio, and emergence rate of Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura reared from a factitious host, oak silkworm, Antheraea pernyi (Guérin-Méneville) eggs. The comparison tests were conducted to investigate the fecundity on Dendrolimus spectabilis (Butler) eggs of T. dendrolimi reared from natural and factitious hosts, and artificial hosts. Developmental periods from egg to adult of T. dendrolimi reared at 26, 28, 30, and 32°C were 10.9, 9.6, 9.0, 8.6 days, respectively. Emergence rates of T. dendrolimi decreased 78.0, 88.4, 60.7, and 50.1% as temperature increased. The progeny sex ratios (i.e., females per male) were 7.3, 8.4, 8.2 and 6.9 at the respective temperatures. When adult T. dendrolimi emerged from A. pernyi eggs were kept in dark conditions for storage at different temperatures for 34 days, their mortality increased as temperature increased: 0% at 0°C; 10% at 4°C; 40% at 6°C; 50% at 18°C and 100% at ≥26°C. The fecundity of T. dendrolimi reared from three different hosts was investigated on D. spectabilis eggs. During the first day, the adult T. dendrolimi reared on A. pernyi eggs laid most eggs (99.0±10.7), followed by those reared on artificial hosts (76.6±24.5) and D. spectabilis eggs (63.4±35.9). Over the entire lifespan, T. dendrolimi reared on D. spectabilis eggs produced the highest number of eggs (218.0±27.9), followed by A. pernyi eggs (104.0±44.7) and artificial host (98.2±37.1). These results suggest that the temperature and three hosts factors had an effect on rearing of the T. dendrolimi on the factitious host, A. pernyi eggs. © 2000 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.

VL  - 17

SP  - 942-950
AB  - High temperature inhibits the growth of the wild-type bacteriophage phi X174. Three different point mutations were identified that each recovered growth at high temperature. Two affected the major capsid protein (residues F188 and F242), and one affected the internal scaffolding protein (B114). One of the major capsid mutations (F242) is located in a beta strand that contacts B114 in the procapsid during viral maturation, whereas the other capsid mutation (F188) is involved in subunit interactions at the threefold axis of symmetry. Selective coefficients of these mutations ranged from 13.9 to 3.8 in the inhibitory, hot environment, bur all mutations reduced fitness at normal temperature. The selective effect of one of the mutations (F242) was evaluated at high temperature in four different genetic backgrounds and exhibited epistasis of diminishing returns: as log fitness of the background genotype increased from -0.1 to 4.1, the fitness boost provided by the F242 mutation decreased from 3.9 to 0.8. These results support a model in which viral fitness is bounded by an upper limit and the benefit of a mutation is scaled according to the remaining opportunity for fitness improvement in the genome.

VL  - 93
IS  - 1
SP  - 69-75
AB  - Bumblebees are generally believed to be annual insects. However, here we will show that under laboratory conditions the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.) can produce a second generation without a period of cold storage (diapause) or CO2 narcosis (a method to break diapause). It is also shown that this so-called non-diapause trait can be selected for. The percentage of non-diapausing queens increased from 8% (minimum) to 97% (maximum) in two generations of selection. However, it was not possible to maintain isofemale non-diapause lines. Colonies of the fourth and fifth generation remained small (expressed in worker number) and produced a small number of queens. Also the percentage of queens that started laying eggs (defined as the percentage non-diapause) decreased in the fourth and fifth generations. To study whether this decline of the non-diapause lines was caused by inbreeding, a control experiment was conducted. In this control experiment queens were mated with their brothers (full-sib mating) for several generations and the number of queens that start egg laying was measured. This revealed that inbreeding can have a negative effect on the egg-laying capacities of queens thus causing the decline of inbred (non-diapause) lines.

TI  - Thermal effects on movement patterns of yellow baboons
VL  - 29
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-105
AB  - This paper examines the effect of thermal environment on movement patterns of free-ranging yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus). For Amboseli baboons, one source of potential thermal stress is intense midday heat, and a plausible thermoregulatory response is for animals to simply move into the shade. I therefore examined the hypothesis that baboons would choose quadrats with higher shade availability (as measured by vegetation cover) in response to increasing midday heat loads (as measured by air temperature and solar radiation). Surprisingly, this was not the case-neither ambient air temperature, ambient solar radiation, nor quadrat plant species composition had a significant effect on shade availability of quadrat selected. Instead, thermal conditions affected a different aspect of baboon movements; namely, spatial displacement rates. At high air temperatures, baboons as a group traversed woodland habitats more slowly, and bare pans more quickly, than at lower air temperatures. I surmised that this relationship might reflect thermal effects on movement patterns at a smaller scale: if individuals exposed to high heat loads spent more time resting in shade under clumps of vegetation, they would thereby traverse densely-vegetated (hence shaded) quadrats more slowly. To address this question directly, I obtained focal sample data on activity and microhabitat budgets of individual baboons in relation to environmental temperature. The frequency of most combinations of activity state (e.g., grooming, social behavior) and microenvironment state (e.g., elevation, proximity to vegetation) did not vary monotonically with air temperature. However, baboons in shaded locations (but not those in unshaded locations) spent more time resting and less time moving at high air temperatures than low. In other words, baboon activity budgets depended on both microclimate and microhabitat-animals reduced their activity, particularly movement, when they encountered shade under hot conditions. This pattern of microhabitat choice in turn led to temperature-dependent changes in travel rate at the habitat level. These observational studies of movement patterns suggest that Amboseli baboons employ opportunistic thermoregulation-they do not seek out densely-shaded habitats or individual patches of shade at high air temperatures. Instead, they respond to environmental heat loads by resting, and thereby slowing down, when they happen to encounter plant shade. Aspects of baboon ecology that favor such an opportunistic mode of thermoregulation include large body size and non-thermal constraints on movement patterns. © 1988 Japan Monkey Centre.

TI  - Application of rapid infrared heating for processing of aluminum forgings
VL  - 2006
SP  - 125-134
AB  - Rapid infrared (IR) heating has the potential to be used for solutionizing of aluminum forgings with benefits of reduced energy consumption, increased productivity, and improved microstructure and mechanical properties. Standard procedures to take advantage of rapid IR heating for solutionizing are not currently available. Thus, a primary objective of this work was to determine optimum solutionizing cycles for two aluminum alloys; AA2618 and AA6061. Laboratory experiments on aluminum coupons were performed to establish time/temperature solutionizing data for each alloy. Electrical conductivity and hardness measurements were used to evaluate the degree to which samples were solutionized. Grain structure in the solutionized and aged condition was also evaluated for select thermal cycles. The solution data presented herein is the basis for future production tests using rapid IR equipment.

VL  - 176
IS  - 6
SP  - 547-557
AB  - Plasma sodium concentrations in field-caught Western tiger snakes, Notechis scutatus, from semi-arid Carnac Island (CI) varied seasonally, with snakes exhibiting significant hypernatraemia during summer and normal concentrations following autumn rain. In contrast, field-caught tiger snakes from a perennial fresh-water swamp (Herdsman Lake, HL) exhibited no significant increase in plasma sodium concentrations during summer. Laboratory-induced hypernatraemia caused thermal depression in both populations; there was a weak negative relationship between plasma sodium concentration and temperature selection that was significant for CI snakes. Hypernatraemia significantly elevated circulating concentrations of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in both CI and HL snakes. CI snakes injected with a physiological dosage of AVT also evidenced thermal depression. Despite the positive correlation between AVT and both plasma sodium concentration and osmolality for laboratory snakes, field samples from CI snakes indicate that circulating levels of AVT may be influenced more by plasma osmolality than sodium levels. The data suggest that, in CI snakes, chronic dehydration in the field leads to hypernatraemia which may lead to elevated levels of AVT if plasma osmolality also increases. This will in turn invoke a depression in thermal behaviour that may improve the water economy and survival of snakes on semi-arid CI. Although HL snakes do not experience seasonal dehydration, physiological changes away from the stable homeostatic state appear to prompt the same behavioural shifts, illustrating the intrinsic nature of the thermal behaviour in different populations of the same species of snake. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

VL  - 78
IS  - 4
SP  - 410-416
AB  - The interaction between inbreeding and high-temperature stress was examined in the cactsphilic fruit fly, Drosophila buzzatii. Embryos of four inbreeding levels (F=0, F=0.25, F=0.375, F=0.5) were either maintained at 25 degrees C throughout egg-to-adult development or were exposed to 41.5 degrees C for 110 min at an age of 20 h. Hatching, larva-to-pupa survival, pupato-adult survival, and egg-to-adult survival were estimated. Heat shock reduced hatching rates, but survival to adulthood for individuals that hatched was unaffected by the heat shock. Inbreeding reduced the proportion of eggs hatching in the 25 degrees C control group only. For larva-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult survival there was no interaction between inbreeding and stress. The effect of inbreeding on egg-to-adult survival was stronger in the 25 degrees C control group compared with the group exposed to heat shock. The results imply environmental dependency of inbreeding depression and suggest that stress tolerance may not always be reduced by inbreeding. The thermal microenvironment of cactus rots in the field was assessed by measuring temperatures inside 17 rots. Internal rot temperatures varied with a maximum temperature of 48 degrees C during the day. Selection for temperature tolerance in nature may have depleted genetic variation for this trait limiting the effect of inbreeding on thermal resistance.

VL  - 83
IS  - 6
SP  - 671-676
AB  - BACKGROUND. Progressive injury that is refractory to conventional immunosuppression remains the major hurdle to indefinite survival of transplanted organs. Several clinical risk factors of chronic renal allograft rejection have been identified; although some (e.g., acute rejection) are direct manifestations of immunological injury, others (e.g., donor age) have been more difficult to conceptually link with graft dysfunction. METHODS. We conducted formal multivariate statistical analyses to reveal associations between established clinical risk factors and allograft histopathology. In a multicenter protocol biopsy-controlled study, 17 clinical risk factors were studied in relation to either the composite Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) score or, to each of eight individual histological indices, using multiple linear regression with forward selection. RESULTS. Nine clinical risk factors were not significantly associated with any histopathological index. Four (donor age, acute rejection, recipient age, and cold ischemia time) were associated both with the total CADI score and, to varying extents, with the individual histopathological indices. In our analysis, clinical risk factors accounted for, at best, only about 60% of the interindividual variation in histopathological score. CONCLUSIONS. Our study reveals a missing link between specific clinical risk factors and early histopathological findings that are known to presage accelerated failure of clinically healthy grafts. Given the complex relationship between clinical risk factors, early histopathological changes, and graft outcome, we conclude that composite, quantitative histological indices are best suited to for evaluation of the histological status of the transplant. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Parameters related to snow, air/soil temperatures, and soil moisture qualities in the three major plant communities grazed by muskoxen in Sverdrup Pass - the wet sedge meadow, the arctic willow, and the mesic meadow - were investigated in the summers of 1987 and 1988. The factors of particular importance to plant productivity, and therefore to muskoxen, are snow cover, snow depth, sublimation of snow, active layer, and soil moisture. Snow cover and depth are the factors influencing availability of forage. Any significant differences of these factors between the plant communities were also considered. It was found that snow conditions were similar in all three communities whereas the active layer, air/soil temperatures, and soil moisture content were markedly different. -from Authors

TI  - The effect of temperature on sex ratio in the isopod Porcellionides pruinosus: Environmental sex determination or a by-product of cytoplasmic sex determination?
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-215
AB  - The sex ratios of the progenies of woodlice Porcellionides pruinosus (Crustacea, Isopoda) raised at different temperatures were studied. Females from three French populations sampled in the wild produced highly female-biased broods at 20 degrees C and male-biased broods above 30 degrees C. The effect of high temperature was not due to selective mortality of females. Sex determination was thus sensitive to temperature in P. pruinosus. We also found an interpopulation variability of sex ratio thermosensitivity and a weak inheritance of male-biased sex ratios at high temperatures. Samples taken from a wild population throughout the year showed that while the thermal conditions required for changes in the sex ratio occurred, there was no significant variation in the sex ratio. On the other hand, almost all the females and many males in the four populations studied harboured intracytoplasmic bacteria. These maternally inherited symbionts belong to the genus Wolbachia and are known to possess a feminizing effect. While in other arthropods Wolbachia are destroyed at high temperatures, the symbionts of P. pruinosus were detected by a PCR procedure whatever the rearing temperatures. In light of these results, we propose that the thermosensitivity of sex determination in P. pruinosus could reflect the removal of the cytoplasmic effect on sex determination rather than environmental sex determination sensu stricto. The reduction in the amount of bacteria (but not their entire elimination), or the inhibition of bacterial metabolism, may be responsible for sex ratio variations relating to temperature. The incomplete inheritance of male-biased sex ratios at high temperatures might reflect a selection of thermo-tolerant bacterial strains.

TI  - Use of response functions in selecting lodgepole pine populations for future climates
VL  - 12
IS  - 12
SP  - 2404-2416
AB  - Although growth response functions have previously been developed for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) populations in British Columbia, new analyses were conducted: (1) to demonstrate the merit of a new local climate model in genecological analysis; (2) to highlight new methods for deriving response functions; and (3) to evaluate the impacts of management options for existing geographically defined seed planning units (SPUs) for reforestation. Results of this study suggest that new methods for anchoring population response functions, and a multivariate approach for incorporating climate variables into a single model, considerably improve the reliability of these functions. These functions identified a small number of populations in central areas of the species distribution with greater growth potential over a wide range of mean annual temperature (MAT). Average productivity of lodgepole pine is predicted to increase (up to 7%) if moderate warming (∼2 °C MAT) occurs in the next few decades as predicted, although productivity would substantially decline in some SPUs in southern BC. Severe global warming (>3 °C MAT) would result in either a drastic decline in productivity or local populations being extirpated in southern SPUs. New deployment strategies using the best seed sources for future reforestation may not only be able to mitigate the negative impact of global warming, but may even be able to increase productivity in some areas. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effects of phosphorus limitation and temperature on PHA production in activated sludge
VL  - 50
IS  - 8
SP  - 135-143
AB  - The study was designed to investigate the effects of temperature and phosphorus limitation on polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production and storage by activated sludge biomass. The two-stage operation approach, i.e. a growth phase followed by a nutrient limitation phase, was applied to induce PHA accumulation. The pre-selected temperatures of 10, 20 and 30degreesC were investigated under phosphorus limitation conditions using three four-litre fully aerobic SBR systems operated at an SRT of 10 days with cycle time and HRT of 6 and 10 hours. PHA production was greater in the 10degreesC system than in the 20degreesC and 30degreesC systems but there was little difference between the two higher temperatures. The maximum PHA fractions of the sludge were 52, 45 and 47% TSS for the three temperatures from low to high, and the maximum PHA concentrations in the mixed liquors were 1,491, 1,294 and 1,260 mg/l, respectively. However, it was observed that very low values of PHA yield per unit COD consumed were obtained, i.e., 0.05, 0.03 and 0.04 mgPHA/mgCOD(u), for the 10, 20 and 30degreesC reactors, respectively. This was because all three systems required several days to reach maximum PHA accumulation in their mixed liquor biomasses. It is probable the bacteria still had some stored poly-P in their cells upon initiation of the phosphorus limited influent, and PHA accumulation was delayed until the stored phosphorus was depleted. Also, PHA productivity was reduced by the large amounts of biomass lost from the systems because of sludge bulking.

VL  - 19

SP  - 1175-1182
AB  - Under certain environmental situations, selection may favour the ability of females to adjust the sex ratio of their offspring. Two recent studies have suggested that viviparous scincid lizards can modify the sex ratio of the offspring they produce in response to the operational sex ratio (OSR). Both of the species in question belong to genera that have also recently been shown to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Here we test whether pregnant montane water skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) utilise TSD to select offspring sex in response to population wide imbalances in the OSR, by means of active thermoregulation. We use a combination of laboratory and field-based experiments, and conduct the first field-based test of this hypothesis by maintaining females in outdoor enclosures of varying OSR treatments throughout pregnancy. Although maternal body temperature during pregnancy was influenced by OSR, the variation in temperature was not great enough to affect litter sex ratios or any other phenotypic traits of the offspring. © 2006 The Authors.

TI  - Dynamic aggregations of newborn sibling rattlesnakes exhibit stable thermoregulatory properties
VL  - 274
IS  - 3
SP  - 277-283
AB  - Information on behavioural and physiological processes of newborn reptiles is often difficult to obtain under natural conditions, especially in lizards and snakes. Consequently, we lack information on a wide range of biological phenomena (e.g. thermoregulation, digestion, circadian activity rhythms) in neonates of these taxa. Here, we report novel behaviour in newborn sibling sidewinder rattlesnakes Crotalus cerastes, a desert-inhabiting species of south-western North America. At the entrances of their natal burrows, neonates formed aggregations ('balls') during daylight hours, which involved frequent movements of individuals within these balls. Through the study of two radio-telemetered females and their litters (n=20 offspring), we obtained temperature data from the mothers, centre of the snake balls, and from multiple sites in the immediate environment for 10 days post-birth, the period that is coincident with maternal attendance and the first cycle of ecdysis. The core temperatures of the snake balls showed significant stability over the extreme thermal ranges of the environment. Although other functions are possible, such as those related to water conservation and antipredator defence, we suggest that frequent movements of individuals within the balls involved selection of a thermal optimum to enhance ecdysis. Based on other studies of aggregation in animals, dynamic aggregative behaviour in newborn sibling C. cerastes implicates self-assembly and suggests that individuals benefit from behavioural interactions with their siblings. One plausible scenario for the evolution of this type of dynamic aggregation involves thermal selection among sibling neonates for optimal basking sites within natal refugia in extreme environments such as desert landscapes. Moreover, it is possibly limited to species of vipers (and other snakes) that are viviparous and where maternal care is present up to the time of shedding in neonates. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Calculating Salmonella inactivation in nonisothermal heat treatments from isothermal nonlinear survival curves
VL  - 64
IS  - 5
SP  - 606-613
AB  - Salmonella cells in two sugar-rich media were heat treated at various constant temperatures in the range of 55 to 80 degreesC and their survival ratios determined at various time intervals. The resulting nonlinear semilogarithmic survival curves are described by the model log(10)S(t) = -b(T)t(n(T)) where S(t) is the momentary survival ratio N(t)/N-0, and b(T) and n(T) are coefficients whose temperature dependence is described by two empirical mathematical models. When the temperature profile, T(t), of a nonisothermal heat treatment can also be expressed algebraically, b(T) and n(T) can be transformed into a function of time, i.e., b[T(t)] and n[T(t)]. If the momentary inactivation rate primarily depends on the momentary temperature and survival ratio, then the survival curve under nonisothermal conditions can be constructed by solving a differential equation, previously suggested by Peleg and Penchina, whose coefficients are expressions that contain the corresponding b[T(t)] and n[T(t)] terms. The applicability of the model and its underlying assumptions was tested with a series of eight experiments in which the Salmonella cells, in the same media, were heated at various rates to selected temperatures in the range of 65 to 80 degreesC and then cooled. In all the experiments, there was an agreement between the predicted and observed survival curves. This suggests that, at least in the case of Salmonella in the tested media, survival during nonisothermal inactivation can be estimated without assuming any mortality kinetics.

The stress response may involve selective shut down of nonessential metabolic activities and the repair of macromolecular damage resulting from the stress. Messenger RNA splicing in cultured HeLa cells is one of the processes inhibited by heat stress. splicing is protected from such inhibition in stress-preconditioned cells that have acquired a tolerant state characterised by increased cell survival and resistance to other environmental stresses. Stress tolerant cells have heat shock proteins (HSPs) that had been induced by the preconditioning process. To examine the biochemical changes induced by stress in the splicing apparatus, we analysed the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles associated with spliceosomes in normal. stressed, and stress tolerant cells. We show that (a) the spliceosomal component U4/U5/U6 snRNP particle is disassembled by heat stress into intermediates of splicing assembly, (b) prior induction of stress tolerance protects the structural and functional integrity of snRNPs if cells are subsequently exposed to a severe stress and (c) a novel 65 kDa protein is associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in stress tolerant cells.

VL  - 23

AB  - Data on stemwood biomass and mean annual biomass increment (MABI) for seven tropical tree plantation species were synthesized from the literature to evaluate species adaptibility and potential yields in different environments. Stemwood biomass ranged from &lt; 1 to 712 t ha-1, and MABI ranged from about 1 to 30 t ha-1 year-1 in plantations of Pinus caribaea, Tectona grandis, Pinus patula, Gmelina arborea, Cupressus lusitanica, Eucalyptus grandis, and Albizia falcataria. Stemwood biomass and MABI varied with species, plantation age, and climate. Linear models best described the relationship between stemwood biomass and age of plantation, and the slopes of these equations (MABIs) varied among species and among life zones for a given species. Significant relations were found between stemwood biomass and MABI and water availability (the ratio of temperature to precipitation, T/P). In general, stemwood biomass and MABI decreased at high (arid) and low (very humid) T/P ratios. Each tree species had an optimal T/P at which its maximum stemwood biomass and MABI occurred. Other site factors, such as soil fertility, modified plantation response to climate. © 1988.

TI  - Bridging the gap between the genotype and the phenotype: Linking genetic variation, selection and adaptation in fishes
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
SP  - 396-422
AB  - One of the most challenging problems in evolutionary biology is linking the evolution of the phenotype with the underlying genotype, because most phenotypes are encoded by many genes that interact with each other and with the environment. Further, many phenotypes are correlated and selection on one can affect evolution of the other. This challenge is especially important in fishes, because their evolutionary response to harvest, global warming and conservation actions are among the least understood aspects of their management. Here, we discuss two major genetic approaches to studying the evolution of complex traits, multivariate quantitative genetics and molecular genetics, and examine the increasing interaction between the two fields. These interactions include using pedigree-based methods to study the evolution of multivariate traits in natural populations, comparing neutral and quantitative measures of population structure, and examining the contribution that the two approaches have made to each other. We then explore the major role that quantitative genetics is playing in two key issues in the conservation and management of fish populations: the evolutionary effects of fishing and adaptation to climate change. Throughout, we emphasize that it is important to anticipate the availability of improvements in molecular technology and statistical analyses by creating research populations such as inbred lines and families segregating at fitness traits, developing approaches to measuring the full range of phenotypes related to fitness, and collecting biological material and ecological data in natural populations. These steps will facilitate studies of the evolution of complex traits over informative temporal and spatial scales. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Cenomanian (early Late Cretaceous) ammonoid faunas of Western Europe - Part II: Diversity patterns and the end-Cenomanian anoxic event
VL  - 96
IS  - 3
SP  - 381-398
AB  - Diversity patterns of ammonoids are analyzed and compared with the timing of anoxic deposits around the Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) boundary in the Vocontian, Anglo-Paris, and Münster basins of Western Europe. Differing from most previous studies, which concentrate on a narrow time span bracketing the C/T boundary, the present analysis covers the latest Albian to Early Turonian interval for which a high resolution, ammonoid-based biochronology, including 34 Unitary Associations zones, is now available. During the latest Albian-Middle Cenomanian interval, species richness of ammonoids reveals a dynamical equilibrium oscillating around an average of 20 species, whereas the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian interval displays an equilibrium centered on an average value of 6 species. The abrupt transition between these two successive equilibria lasted no longer than two Unitary Associations. The onset of the decline of species richness thus largely predates the spread of oxygen-poor water masses onto the shelves, while minimal values of species richness coincide with the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary only. The decline of species richness during the entire Late Cenomanian seems to result from lower origination percentages rather than from higher extinction percentages. This result is also supported by the absence of statistically significant changes in the extinction probabilities of the poly-cohorts. Separate analyses of species richness for acanthoceratids and heteromorphs, the two essential components of the Cenomanian ammonoid community, reveal that heteromorphs declined sooner than acanthoceratids. Moreover, acanthoceratids showed a later decline at the genus level than at the species level. Such a decoupling is accompanied by a significant increase in morphological disparity of acanthoceratids, which is expressed by the appearance of new genera. Last, during the Late Cenomanian, paedomorphic processes, juvenile innovations and reductions of adult size dominated the evolutionary radiation of acanthoceratids. Hence, the decrease in ammonoid species richness and their major evolutionary changes significantly predates the spread of anoxic deposits. Other environmental constraints such as global flooding of platforms, warmer and more equable climate, as well as productivity changes better correlate with the timing of diversity changes and evolutionary patterns of ammonoids and therefore, provide more likely causative mechanisms than anoxia alone.

AB  - Field‐collected populations of Aphytis holoxanthus DeBach (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) and of A. lingnanensis Compere were selected for malathion and azinphosmethyl resistance, respectively, utilizing the male selection method. In preliminary experiments, fertility of virgin females was not significantly lower than that of mated females, and the rate of development of their progeny was similar. Males proved more susceptible to pesticides than females, and among them the sons of virgins were more susceptible than the sons of mated females. Some after‐effects of sublethal exposure to pesticides were noted in both species. A mating ratio of 1 selected male: 2.0–2.5 females was optimal. Cold storage of female pupae proved feasible for synchronizing availability. Resistance of A. holoxanthus to malathion was not increased by 25 male selection cycles. Resistance of A. lingnanensis to azinphosmethyl, which had already been improved by mass selection, was further increased by 7 cycles of male selection. The different outcomes of the two projects are discussed in relation to the variability of the original field populations, and the results of male selection are compared with those of mass selection of identical populations. 1991 The Netherlands Entomological Society

VL  - 125
IS  - 3
SP  - 131-138
AB  - Hydrorefining of C-4 cuts of unsaturated hydrocarbons involves the selective removal of 1-butyne by catalytic hydrogenation. Due to its technological relevance, we investigated the hydrogenation of 1-butyne over a commercial palladium-based catalyst of the eggshell type. The experimental conditions were selected to reproduce those of industrial hydrorefining reactors: liquid-phase reaction, seven levels of temperature between 27 and 62 degrees C, initial concentrations of 1-butyne up to 0.6 mol/l and hydrogen partial pressure ranging from 0.8 to 8 atm. Under these conditions, the overall effectiveness factor of 1-butyne hydrogenation was less than 0.15. Provided that hydrogen was the limiting reactant inside the active shell, 1-butene was the only product yielded by 1-butyne hydrogenation. The regression analysis of experimental data corresponding to the hydrogenation of 1-butyne to 1-butene was restricted to experimental compositions in which 1-butyne concentration was higher than 0.07 mol/l. An intrinsic kinetic expression with reaction orders 1 and -1 for hydrogen and 1-butyne, respectively, predicts experimental data with an average deviation of 2.1%. Estimates of the activation energy and kinetic coefficient at 44 degrees C are (1.55 +/- 0.06) 10(4) cal/mol and (4.6 +/- 0.1) mol/(kg s). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 12

SP  - 435-456
AB  - The common endemic Australian freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense is recognised as having potential as a culture species. Across the species' natural range high variation exists for external morphological traits of relevance to culture. Previous studies have demonstrated that morphological variation can often be correlated with environmental factors. The current study demonstrated that when exposed to a controlled environment, offspring of two morphologically divergent wild stocks retain little of their parental morphological characteristics. When crossed and grown under identical conditions, 'hybrids' and pure offspring were morphologically uniform. A breeding and growth trial of offspring within a single stock were exposed to a variety of environmental temperatures that resulted in high variability of morphological traits in the offspring. These results suggest that environmental parameters rather than genotype may strongly influence the phenotypic expression of the morphological traits investigated. Morphological traits of interest to culture, such as abdomen length and width show low additive genetic variance and hence may not respond well to traditional selective breeding approaches designed to improve their attributes. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Selective laser sintering (SLS) experiments with polyetherketone (PEK) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) powders are described. The absorption behaviour of the polymer powders has been investigated with respect to the content of carbon black as an IR-absorber in the range from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%. Laser sintering process studies have been carried out at room temperature using a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser system. The sintering depths of single layer substrates have been determined according to the process parameters, such as laser power, scanning speed and hatch distance. These process parameters have been optimised with the goal of achieving good structural integrity of the substrate. The influence of melt viscosity has been determined by comparing PEEK powders of low and standard melt viscosity. Scanning electron micrographs show the morphology of the original polymer powders and the laser sintered specimens. On the basis of the experimental results a qualitative SLS mechanism is proposed to describe the energy transfer from the carbon black particles to the surrounding polymer powder.

AB  - Controlled environmental chambers were used to determine the effect of constant low temperatures (0-18 degrees C) on diapause termination of the eggs of Aulocara elliotti (Thomas) and Ageneotettix deorum (Scudder), species that require low temperatures for diapause termination. When eggs of A. elliotti and A. deorum were incubated at 30 degrees C without low-temperature treatments, 6.1% of A. Elliotti hatched after approximate to 36 d of incubation and 1.5% of A. deorum hatched after approximate to 46 d of incubation. Exposure times (days) to selected constant low temperatures ranged from 15 to 100 d. For both species, the greatest hatch at all tow temperatures was induced with exposures of >60 d. Optimum conditions for diapause termination of A. elliotti were calculated to be between 75 and 98 d exposure to 6.6-8 degrees C. Optimum conditions for diapause termination of A. deorum were calculated to be between 75 and 77 d exposure to 7-8.6 degrees C. These studies provide insight about the univoltinism of these insects and offer evidence that with these species, embryonic diapause terminates before the prolonged subfreezing temperatures of winter.

TI  - Analysis of habitat-selection rules using an individual-based model
VL  - 83
IS  - 7
SP  - 1817-1830
AB  - Despite their promise for simulating natural complexity, individual-based models (IBMs) are rarely used for ecological research or resource management. Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, current survival probability, or "expected maturity" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed. Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were highest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-modeling approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.

TI  - Climate change and temperature-dependent sex determination: Can individual plasticity in nesting phenology prevent extreme sex ratios?
VL  - 81
IS  - 6
SP  - 826-834
AB  - Under temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), temperatures experienced by embryos during development determine the sex of the offspring. Consequently, populations of organisms with TSD have the potential to be strongly impacted by climatic warming that could bias offspring sex ratio, a fundamental demographic parameter involved in population dynamics. Moreover, many taxa with TSD are imperiled, so research on this phenomenon, particularly long-term field study, has assumed great urgency. Recently, turtles with TSD have joined the diverse list of taxa that have demonstrated population-level changes in breeding phenology in response to recent climate change. This raises the possibility that any adverse impacts of climate change on populations may be alleviated by individual plasticity in nesting phenology. Here, we examine data from a long-term study on a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to determine whether changes in phenology are due to individual plasticity and whether individual plasticity in the timing of nesting has the capacity to offset the sex ratio effects of a rise in climatic temperature. We find that individual females show plasticity in the date of first nesting each year, and that this plasticity depends on the climate from the previous winter. First nesting date is not repeatable within individuals, suggesting that it would not respond to selection. Sex ratios of hatchlings within a nest declined nonsignificantly over the nesting season. However, small increases in summer temperature had a much stronger effect on nest sex ratios than did laying nests earlier in the season. For this and other reasons, it seems unlikely that individual plasticity in the timing of nesting will offset the effects of climate change on sex ratios in this population, and we hypothesize that this conclusion applies to other populations with TSD. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - In the present study, we attempted to clarify the effects of lifestyle and body compositions on basal metabolism and to clarify the effects of physical training on thermoregulatory responses to cold. Basal metabolism, body compositions, and questionnaires regarding lifestyle were evaluated in 37 students. From multiple linear regression analysis, sex, muscle weight, fat intake, and diurnal temperature were selected as significant explanatory variables. In a second experiment, rectal and the skin temperature at 7 different points as well as the oxygen uptake of eight males were measured at 10°C for 90 min before and after training. The decline in rectal temperature that was observed before training was not observed after training. In addition, rectal temperature was significantly higher at post-training than at pre-training. These results suggest that some lifestyle factors affect cold tolerance; in particular, daily activity might improve our ability to control heat radiation and basal heat production.

VL  - 28

SP  - 1323-1328
AB  - Several agents are known to induce differentiation in the human erythroleukemic cell line K562. In this work we have studied the ability of hyperthermia to induce differentiation in the K562 cell line. K562 cells were treated with hyperthermia in the range of 41-45°C. Cell proliferation and the plating efficiency of heat treated cells along with their hemoglobin synthesis was measured and compared with controls. Hyperthermia severely inhibited the growth of K562 cells in the suspension culture in a time- and temperature-dependent manner. Sixty minutes of heating and 44 and 40 min of heating at 45°C totally inhibited the growth of the cells. The number of clonogenic cells also decreased as a result of heat treatment. Extended periods of heating for more than 2 h at 41°C resulted in thermal adaptation. Hyperthermia-induced hemoglobin synthesis by these cells, only at 42 and 43°C. Maximum induction was observed after heat treatment for 80 min at 43°C and 180 min at 42°C. At lower temperature, although the fraction of surviving cells was high, but no signs of hemoglobin synthesis could be observed. At temperatures higher than 43°C, the fraction of surviving cells decreased rapidly and also no signs of hemoglobin synthesis could be detected. At the two selective temperatures, hemoglobin synthesis started 4 days after heat treatment. The results showed that hyperthermia caused cytotoxicity and growth arrest and induced differentiation as judged by hemoglobin synthesis and reduced clonogenicity in this cell line. This is the first time that a physical agent has been shown to induce differentiation in erythroleukemic cell lines. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The photoperiodic counter, quantitative day-length effects and scotophase timing in the vetch aphid Megoura viciae
VL  - 36
IS  - 12
SP  - 939-949
AB  - The developement of parthenogenetic or sexual female forms (virginoparae and oviparae, respectively) in the aphid Megoura viciae is determined by the photoperiodic conditions perceived by the mother at any stage in her development from late embryo to young adult. A sensitive period for this response was selected using standard long (16 h light-8 h dark) and short days (12 h light-12 h dark) such that the form of the first ten progeny born was affected. At 12-degrees-C this sensitive period covered the first 11 days of maternal postnatal development, at 15-degrees-C it was 10 days while at higher temperatures (17 and 20-degrees-C) the short-day response (ovipara production) was attenuated. The required day number for a 50% response at 15-degrees-C was 3 days for along days but 7-8 days for short days indicating that long days are photoperiodically more potent. Experiments at 12 and 15-degrees-C showed that the accumulation of long-day information was more temperature sensitive than the accumulation of short-day information. The photoperiodic response of M. viciae depends primarily on the length of the dark period (scotophase). Novel experimental protocols and non-24 h light-dark cycles revealed that the photoperiodic counter accumulated long nights (short days) irrespective of photophase length. Short nights (long days), on the other hand, were not summated; moreover their effect depended on the length of the photophase. It appears that, although short nights are photoperiodically stronger, they serve only to modify the counter's accumulation of long nights. The quantitative effects (i.e. photoperiodic strength) of different 24-h light-dark cycles was investigated over experimental periods close to the required day number. As expected, photoperiodic strength decreased when scotophase lengths were close to critical (9.5 h). Long nights 12-20 h were equally but short nights were maximally effective at 8 h. The four stages of dark-period measurement in the hour-glass clock were also reflected in these experiments.

TI  - Hyperthermia: A new cancer treatment modality
VL  - 27
IS  - 94
AB  - Purpose of this review paper is to provide an overview on the application of hyperthermia (HT) [the controlled increased of tumor temperature by 8-3°C] combined with conventional cancer treatment modalities. HT is applied with different methods e.g. superficial-HT, locoregional deep-HT, interstitial-HT, intracavity-HT, and whole body-HT. Studies show that addition of HT to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both, will result in better tumor response rate, local control, palliative effects and survival rate, without increasing toxicity, in different tumor sites such as breast cancer, melanoma, head and neck, cervix cancer and glioblastoma. In the recent years, due to the substantial technical improvements in achieving selected increase of temperatures in superficial and deep-seated tumors, thermometry, and treatment planning, HT is becoming more accepted clinically worldwide. HT, as an adjunctive cancer treatment modality, is certainly a promising approach, however, it is not well known yet. © 2009, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS). All rights reserved.

VL  - 43

AB  - Freezing tolerance is an environmental adaptation that significantly influences plant geographical distribution. Since differences in winter survival among saltgrass ecotypes have been observed in the field at Fort Collins, CO, the objective of this study was to determine the relative freezing tolerance, seasonal changes in the freezing tolerance, and winter survival of six accessions of saltgrass [Distichlis spicata var. stricta (L.) Greene]. Saltgrass accessions A65 and A29 were originally collected from Denver, CO, while C66 was from Humbolt Sink, NV, 32 from Wanship, UT, 55 from Hereford and 48 from Farmingdale, SD. These accessions were established in a field nursery at Fort Collins, CO. Rhizomes were sampled at monthly intervals from October 1999 through April 2000 and from October 2000 through April 2001 and subjected to laboratory freezing tests. Cold hardiness of the saltgrass accessions increased gradually during the fall with maximum hardiness occurring at midwinter. During midwinter, freezing tolerance was significantly different among accessions. Ranking of accessions for subfreezing temperature resulting in 50% mortality [LT50 (°C)] during January 2000 was A29 = 48 (-20.0) &lt; 55 (-17.0) ≤ 32 (-15.5) ≤ A65 = C66 (-14.0). In January 2001, they were ranked with 48 = 55 (-26.0) &lt; A65 = 32 (-23.0) &lt; A29 (-20.0) = C66 (-18.5). In December and January sampling dates of the first season, accessions A29, 48, and 55 exhibited the highest relative regrowth when exposed to temperatures ≈ -20.0°C. In midwinter of the second season, accession 55 showed the highest regrowth after being subjected to temperatures ≈ -25.0°C. Accession C66 had the lowest regrowth potential after freezing treatments in both seasons. Winter survival in the field correlated negatively with LT50 value, with accessions 48, A29, and 55 demonstrating greater winter survival while C66 had the lowest percentage survival. The difference in freezing tolerance among accessions is in part associated with their origin-inherited adaptation. This information is useful for defining the potential adaptation range of saltgrass and in saltgrass breeding projects to select and develop freezing tolerant saltgrass.

AB  - Arrhenius parameters, 25° and 10°C rate constants for hydrolysis of most EPA 601/602 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their hydrolytic progeny, and selected other VOCs are tabulated. Data include Arrhenius parameters for base‐mediated hydrolysis of bromodichloromethane, bromoform, dibromochloromethane, and the acid‐mediated hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which have not been published before. The average activation energy of the tabulated values, excepting epoxides, is 110,100 joules per mole, which exceeds values reported previously as typical for VOCs. As a result of this high activation energy, the half‐lives of VOCs typically are more than an order of magnitude longer at 10° than 25°C. These data are necessary for calculating hydrolysis rates accurately and, thus, for estimating remediation effectiveness when hydrolysis is being considered for remediation. Other things being equal, hydrolysis rates become much faster with increasing temperature and, for some VOCs, with increasing pH. The hydrolysis half‐lives at 25°C and pH = 7 of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are less than 100 years (yr), many halomethanes (freon‐like compounds), and halogenated aldehydes are less than 1000 yr, and many haloalkenes and aromatic VOCs tend to exceed 1000 yr. These data can be used to select temperature and pH conditions to impose on water to favor fast hydrolysis or, for branching degradation schemes, select the shorter lived or less toxic progeny. Moreover, these data are necessary to calculate the major hydrolysis progeny for any conditions. Also, these data can be used in forensic geochemical applications such as estimating original contamination composition, time since contamination occurred, distance to source, and whether nonaqueous‐phase liquids persist. The main base‐mediated hydrolytic degradation route of haloalkanes is induced to be dehydrohalogenation and the main progeny of these reactions are ethenes. Another degradation phenomenon for chlorinated hydrocarbons in aquifers, chemical reductive dehalogenation by low concentrations of natural organic carbon, is proposed and shown to be consistent with published literature.

VL  - 33

AB  - Conifers rarely undergo asexual reproduction by parthenogenesis (haploid or diploid). When cells of Finnish Norway spruce genotypes are grown in a bioreactor under environmental conditions more typical of the Mesozoic (high temperatures, carbon dioxide, and humidity, abundant food supply, etc.), the barriers to asexual reproduction are removed. Gene(s) for apomixis are now expressed in cell suspensions of the rescued early embryo. A new population of diploid embryos is reconstituted from these cells by an apomeiotic and parthenogenetic process. This signifies that asexual gene expression is latent and suppressed under climatic conditions at the current seed sources. Moreover, cells are reverting to conservative ontogenetic strategies for adapting to atmosphere-biosphere variables that have seen conifers survive through ''bottle-neck'' selective regimes in the deep past. The control of culture parameters with bioreactors enables the experimental testing of genotypes in today's forests for their adaptive reproductive responses to critical parameters in models for atmosphere-biosphere change. Environmental preconditions for reproductive fitness and survival from one generation to the next apomictic population can now be explored under controlled conditions. This enables a new study of experimental phylogenetics as a function of changes in atmosphere-biosphere models. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) virus strains isolated in 8 different areas during epidemics of AHC were tested for the reproductive capacity at 33, 37 and 39°. All of the 25 strains tested grew better at 33° but restrictively at 39°. The degree of temperature sensitivity varied slightly from one strain to the other, but generally exceeded that of attenuated poliovirus type 1, strain LSc2ab. Temperature resistant clones were selected by repeated passages of originally temperature sensitive prototype strains at supraoptimal temperature. The importance of using a low temperature (32-34°) for isolation of virus from external tissues of the body and for subsequent passages is emphasized. It is suggested that the relatively low temperature of the conjunctiva has played a role in perpetuating temperature sensitivity of this virus.

AB  - The objective of this research was to develop a microwave-vapor heat treatment (MW-VHT) for mangoes (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Namdokmai Si Thong to disinfest the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). The mortality of oriental fruit fly eggs and quality acceptability characterized by thermal-death-time and thermal-quality-time overlay plots were initially obtained by hot-water immersion. Two treatments within a range of acceptable quality were selected for inoculation experiments to confirm MW-VHT process. The acceptable range was temperature ranging from 46 to 55C with time ranging from 2 to 20 min. The MW-VHT using microwave for preheating followed by vapor for holding processes effectively disinfested oriental fruit fly eggs. Changes in physiochemical properties of mangoes, e.g., color, titratable acid (TA), total soluble solid (TSS), TSS/TA and firmness, of MW-VHT-treated mangoes were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from physiochemical properties of the nontreated mangoes. MW-VHT resulted in less heat damage of mangoes than conventional vapor heat treatment (VHT) and shortened process time more than 90% during the preheating period. MW-VHT also retained equivalent or better lethality of oriental fruit fly eggs than did conventional VHT. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.

SDS-PAGE analysis of outer membrane proteins prepared from A. hydrophila cultured at 10, 17, 25 and 32degreesC in formulated salt water showed different protein profiles. For example, a 40-kDa band was found only at 17 and 25degreesC. Phagocytic rates of A. hydrophila by goldfish macrophages at 10, 17. 25 and 32degreesC were 20.46 +/- 2.07. 16.15 +/- 1.39, 15.94 +/- 1.85 and 22.22 +/- 2.49%, respectively. The results indicated that temperature affects both the cell membrane structure of A. hydrophila and phagocytic activity of goldfish macrophages. resulting in varying fish mortality when infected at different temperatures.

AB  - The study of the intertidal benthic population dynamics in three estuaries of the English Channel (Baie des Veys, Seine estuary, Baie de Somme:France) brings to light two types of species:ukey-species which directly respond to the local disturbance of the environmental conditions in their densities (Spionidae, Capitellidae) and in their growth rates (Cerastoderma edule); target-species such as Macoma balthica which can endure brief changes in the environmental factors and shows no sign of long-lasting consequences on its population dynamics; yet, it fully integrates long-term changes through its numbers and productivity. The parallel between such a regular study of the seasonal variations on selected sites and various base line surveys allows the authors to discuss the COST 647 sampling programm in order to selectrms, range of temperature) from human disturbances (embankments, chemical pollution, eutrophication). Diverse hypothesis are suggested which bring about several research topics to be developed within a european cooperation. © 1986 Dr W. Junk Publishers.

TI  - The evolution of alternative morphs: Density-dependent determination of larval colour dimorphism in a butterfly
VL  - 98
IS  - 2
SP  - 256-266
AB  - Understanding the ultimate causes for the presence of polymorphisms within populations requires knowledge of how the expression of discrete morphs is regulated. In the present study, we explored the determination mechanism of a colour dimorphism in larvae of the butterfly Pararge xiphia (Satyrinae: Nymphalidae) with the ultimate aim of understanding its potential adaptive value. Last-instar larvae of P. xiphia develop into either a green or a brown morph, although all individuals are invariably green during the preceding three instars. A series of laboratory experiments reveal that morph development is strongly environmentally dependent and not the result of alternative alleles at one locus. Photoperiod, temperature, and in particular larval density, all influenced morph determination. The strong effect of a high larval density in inducing the brown morph parallels other known cases of density-dependent melanization in Lepidopteran larvae. Because melanization is often correlated with increased immune function, this type of determination mechanism is expected to be adaptive. However, the ecology and behaviour of P. xiphia larvae suggests that increased camouflage under high-density conditions may be an additional adaptive explanation. We conclude that the colour dimorphism of P. xiphia larvae is determined by a developmental threshold that is influenced both by heredity and by environmental conditions, and that selection for increased immune function and camouflage under high-density conditions may be responsible for maintaining the dimorphism. © 2009 The Linnean Society of London.

TI  - Osmotic separation of pancreatic exocrine cells from crude islet cell preparations
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
SP  - 31-39
AB  - A novel approach is introduced here to selectively lyse exocrine cells in an islet preparation by hypoosmotic treatment. Time to hypotonic cell lysis required for the islet cells was much longer than that for the exocrine cells, which permits a possibility of selectively killing the exocrine cells by hypotonic treatment. The first set of experiments was designed to select an appropriate osmolality for the hypotonic treatment. Kinetic changes in cell volume in response to extracellular anisosmolalities (30 to 90 mOsm/kg) were recorded using an electronic particle counter. The results indicated that, when exposed to a 30 mOsm/kg solution, islet cells swelled slowly to reach volumetric equilibrium in approximately 3 min. There was no significant hypotonic cell lysis observed even at the end of 4 min (n = 4). In contrast, pancreatic exocrine cells, when exposed to the same solution, expanded rapidly to the lytic volume and burst within 30 s. Significant exocrine cell lysis was invariably achieved within 30 s when cells were exposed to the osmolalities below 60 mOsm/kg. For osmolalities between 70 to 80 mOsm/ kg, exocrine fell lysis was highly variable. When cells were exposed to 80 to 90 mOsm/kg, no significant cell lysis was observed. Thus, an osmolality of 50 mOsm/kg is recommended for hypotonic treatment, as it maximizes the lysis of exocrine cells without unnecessarily stressing (osmotically) the islet cells. The second set of experiments (time-course experiments, 20 to 120 s) was designed to determine the length of exposure time for which the exocrine cells were irreversibly damaged but the islet cells had only swollen to such a degree that cell function is restored upon returning to an isotonic condition. Viability of the hypotonic treated cells was evaluated at two different levels: membrane integrity, measured by combined fluorescent dye staining with propidium iodide (PI) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA), and mitochondrial function, measured by colorimetric MTT assay. The results showed that hypotonic treatment in a 50 mOsm/kg solution for 30 s resulted in over 85% loss of the membrane integrity for the exocrine cells. About 90% of these membrane lysed cells lost mitochondrial function (n = 3). By contrast, under the same treatment, less than 15% of the islet cells lost membrane integrity and mitochondrial Function (n = 3). In conclusion, hypotonic treatment with a 50 mOsm/kg solution for 20 to 30 s at room temperature is sufficient to lyse the majority of the contaminating exocrine cells in an islet cell preparation, while maintaining function in the islet cells.

AB  - In order to improve productivity of unit for manufacturing the thin-walled tubes from corrosion-resistant steels, it is necessary to compensate for technological disturbances by means of adaptive closed system for controlling the welding parameters. Computer-aided system is used in this case. The system turns on devices for evaluating the quality of weld and controls the weld formation. Sensors of parameters of production process of welding play very important role. Photoelectric sensors of VE15V type has been used for measuring the speed of welding. Pyrometer of PChD-131-0,5 type has been selected for measuring the temperature. Sensors of MTU-1 and ShSM M3 types have also been used.

VL  - 69

SP  - 1851-1857
AB  - To evaluate the survival of Salmonella on raw almond surfaces, whole almond kernels were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis phage type (PT) 30 collected from a 24-h broth culture or by scraping cells from an agar lawn. Kernels inoculated with lawn-collected cells to 8, 5, 3, and 1 log CFU per almond alter a 24-h drying period were stored for 161 days at 23 ± 3°C. Calculated rates of reduction were similar for the four inoculum levels (0.22, 0.28, 0.29, and 0.22 log CFU/month, respectively). Kernels inoculated to 7.1 or 8.0 log CFU per almond after drying were stored for 171 or 550 days, respectively, at selected temperatures, including -20 ± 2°C, 4 ± 2°C, 23 ± 3°C, and 35 ± 2°C. No significant reductions of Salmonella were observed during storage at -20 and 4°C over 550 days. At 35°C, a biphasic survival curve was observed, with calculated reductions of 1.1 log CFU/month from days 0 to 59 and no significant reduction from days 59 to 171. At 23°C, reductions of 0.18 and 0.30 log CFU/month were calculated for 171 and 550 days of storage, respectively. When combined with data from the study of inoculum levels, an overall average calculated reduction at 23°C was 0.25 ± 0.05 log CFU/month. Significantly greater reductions were observed during the 24-h drying period when broth-collected cells were used as the inoculum, suggesting that cells collected from agar lawns were more resistant to drying. However, after initial drying, the rates of reduction at 23°C did not differ significantly between the inoculum preparation methods. Salmonella Enteritidis PT 30 survives for long periods on almond kernels under a variety of common storage conditions. Copyright ©, International Association for Food Protection.

VL  - 54

SP  - 1077-1087
AB  - I examined variation in the temperature distribution of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence using data from bottom trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Plaice tended to select cold temperatures relative to those available. Temperature distribution was unrelated to age over the range 3-12(+)years. Females tended to occupy warmer water than males, although the extent of this difference between the sexes varied among years. Annual variation in plaice temperature distribution was positively correlated with variation in the temperatures available. After accounting for annual variation in available temperatures, female temperature distribution was density independent but males tended to occupy colder water at higher levels of abundance. The median temperature occupied by both sexes tended to be warmer at higher levels of abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a competitor of plaice. The difference between the sexes in temperature distribution increased as cod abundance decreased or as plaice abundance increased (depending on the measure of temperature distribution used). The observed difference between the sexes in temperature distribution and its density dependence may reflect differences in foraging rate associated with differences between the sexes in the fitness benefits of growth.

AB  - Temperature effects on fecundity and reproductive capacity of adult fundatrigenia and alienicolae, and development of alienicolae of the poplar petiolegall aphid, Pemphigus populitransversus Riley, were measured at selected constant temperatures. Adult fundatrigenia produced an average of 16 nymphs per adult (range, 13.8-17.9 nymphs per adult). Reproductive capacity of adult alienicolae averaged 49.2 nymphs per adult (range, 17.4-75.22 nymphs per adult). Reproductive rate of fundatrigenia was more responsive to temperature, but reproductive capacity was less sensitive to temperature compared with alienicolae. Development of alienicolae was investigated at 7 constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 29.2 degrees C. Alienicolae development was fitted to a nonlinear, temperature-dependent model. In addition, degree-day requirements for development and the lower developmental threshold of alienicolae were estimated with n-weighted linear regression for comparison with reported lower developmental thresholds of other aphids. The lower developmental threshold estimate for P. populitransversus fell within the range of lower developmental thresholds for other aphids. Development time from birth to adult was similar to Pemphigus betae Doane, but longer than development times reported for some foliar-feeding aphids.

AB  - Despite extensive mariculture of the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, in the Mediterranean basin, there are no heritability estimates for growth in this or any other cultured warm water marine teleost, and so it is unknown whether selection for faster growing fish would result in genetic improvement. In the present study, we estimated heritability for weight in the Eilat hatchery strain of S. aurata, using single-generation mass selection procedures. Down, control, up and extreme up (''jumper'') selected male groups were crossed with randomly chosen unselected females. Progeny groups were cultured in replicates under communal and separate rearing conditions. Heritability estimates for weight varied, but overall were positive and of a moderate magnitude.

AB  - Urban development requires the application of different kind of storage tanks for liquid and gaseous fluids, which can also be hazardous and detrimental. In order to prevent the leakage and, eventually, catastrophic failure odd storage tanks in urban environment, strict requirements for their safe service are necessary, they include the experiments and testing regarding strength, toughness and structural integrity. Typical examples are cylindrical and spherical storage tanks, tanks for road and rail road transportation and liquefied butane - propane tanks, with welded joints as critical region. Applied materials and manufacturing procedures are different, affecting the properties of welded joints. Although quality assurance for tanks manufacturing, nowadays required through codes and standards for welded joints, improved their in-service properties, problems with failures of this equipment can still be met. Anyhow, the old tanks, produced even before 30 or more years, are still in service, in many cases without necessary documentation, and they require special care. The results of selected testing and experiments with tanks, applied in urban environment, will be presented and discuss. The attention will be paid to experimental analysis of strength, toughness and structural integrity properties of welded joints, including mismatching effect, simulation of heat-affected zone, crack behavior in different environment condition. This will be supported by fitness-for-purpose analysis.

TI  - Temperature-sensitive mutations in Drosophila melanogaster. XI. Male sterile mutants of the Y chromosome
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
SP  - 239-257
AB  - Eight temperature-sensitive (ts) male sterile mutations have been induced by ethyl methanesulfonate treatment of Y chromosomes derived from a selected temperature-resistant Amherst wild-type stock of Drosophila melanogaster. Males carrying such mutated Y chromosomes (Yts) are sterile when raised at 29°C but fertile when reared at 22°C. Complementation tests of the mutants with Y chromosome fragments, deletions, and inter se localized all eight to the long arm of the chromosome in four different complementation groups. When Yts-bearing males, reared to adulthood at 22°C, were subjected to a 48-hr regimen at 29°C and mated to fresh virgin females daily, a significant reduction in fertility resulted 5 days after initiation of 29°C treatments. This period of sterility was transient (48-72-hr duration) and corresponded to a temperature-sensitive period (TSP) of spermatogenesis during the primary spermatocyte stage. A more precise definition of the TSP utilized exposure of subadult males to 29°C at selected developmental periods during which only certain germ cell stages are present. Upon eclosion adult males were subjected to a similar schedule of consecutive matings of 12-hr duration in order to detect any delay in the appearance of fertility. Different ts males could be distinguished by the resultant pattern of sterility, and the TSP of different mutations thus localized to either primary spermatocyte or immediately post-meiotic stage. Associated with Yts-mediated sterility, spermiogenesis is defective at restrictive temperature as evidenced by the production of nonmotile sperm and a failure to transfer such sperm to the female during copulation. In addition, electron microscopy detected a variety of ultrastructural abnormalities, including defects of axoneme formation, irregularities of Nebenkern derivative development, and failures of separation from the syncitial state or mature cyst with subsequent degeneration. © 1973.

VL  - 14

SP  - 57-67
AB  - With the aim of producing insect-resistant potato plants, internode explants of Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Désirée were transformed with an Agrobacterium strain C58pMP90 containing an insect (Phaedon cochleariae: Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) chitinase gene and the neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) gene as selectable marker, both under the control of the viral CaMV 35S promoter. Three transformed potato lines (CH3, CH5 and CH25) exhibiting the highest chitinolytic activities were selected for feeding experiments with the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer), under controlled photoperiod and temperature conditions. Aphids fed on transgenic potato plants showed a reduced pre-reproductive period and an enhanced daily fecundity. Transgenic potato lines did not affect nymphal mortality, but improved several biological parameters related to aphid population's growth. Artificial diets were used to provide active (1, 10, 100 and 500 μg ml-1) and inactive (500 μg ml-1) bacterial (Serratia marcescens) chitinase to M. persicae. These compounds increased nymph survival at all active chitinase doses when compared to the control diet, while inactive chitinase did not. Although the pre-reproductive period was slightly shortened and the daily fecundity slightly higher, active and inactive chitinase provided as food led a reduction from 1 to 1.5 day population's doubling time. Therefore chitinase activity was responsible for the probiotic effects on aphids. Our results question the relevance of a chitinase-based strategy in the context of potato culture protection. © Springer 2005.

TI  - Temporal analysis of archived samples indicates marked genetic changes in declining North Sea cod (Gadus morhua)
VL  - 270
IS  - 1529
SP  - 2125-2132
AB  - Despite increasing evidence that current exploitation rates can contribute to shifts in life-history traits and the collapse of marine fish stocks, few empirical studies have investigated the likely evolutionary impacts. Here, we used DNA recovered from a temporal series of archived North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, to investigate genetic diversity within the Flamborough Head population between 1954 and 1998, during which time the population underwent two successive declines. Microsatellite data indicated a significant reduction in genetic diversity between 1954 and 1970 (total number of alleles: 1954, 46; 1960, 42; 1970, 37), and a subsequent recovery between 1970 and 1998 (total number of alleles: 1970, 37; 1981, 42; 1998, 45). Furthermore, estimates of genetic differentiation (F-ST and R-ST) showed a significant divergence between 1998 and earlier samples. Data are consistent with a period of prolonged genetic drift, accompanied by a replacement of the Flamborough Head population through an increased effective migration rate that occurred during a period of high exploitation and appreciable demographic and phenotypic change. Other studies indicate that diversity at neutral microsatellite loci may be correlated with variability at selected genes, thus compromising a population's subsequent recovery and adaptive potential. Such effects are especially pertinent to North Sea cod, which are threatened by continuing exploitation and rising sea temperatures.

AB  - Phosphoglucose isomerase genotypes in the butterfly Colias differ dramatically in biochemical properties. These differences were evaluated earlier, using metabolic network theory, to predict, successfully, their effects on glycolytic metabolism and hence on Colias flight capacity and several consequent fitness components in the wild. Female egg-laying, not previously studied, also depends on flight, so female fecundity is now predicted to differ among these genotypes. An experimental design incorporating the thermal ecology of Colias confirms these predictions in a cool habitat. Thus female fecundity differences among animal enzyme polymorphs have now been found. Quantitative reconstruction of the selection regime for phosphoglucose isomerase genotypes in Colias can now begin. The most heat-stable genotypes are the least fecund, suggesting that global warming, if it occurs, may have severe impacts, through population genetics, on demography of thermally sensitive creatures.

VL  - 39

SP  - 422-433
AB  - SYNOPSIS. We offer the thesis that environmental physiologists and evolutionary biologists can find fertile common ground in the study of how individual variation in physiological phenotypes originates and develops. The sources of such individual variation are often complex; the consequences affect how natural selection will act on a suite of traits, of which some may seem, at first glance, far removed from the usual domain of environmental physiology. We illustrate our thesis in two ways. First, we offer two examples drawn from studies of thermal tolerance in the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa. We show how fitness variation can be a complex function of the gestational temperature and thermal tolerance and how these effects can produce environmentally induced variation among populations in thermal tolerance that mimics a pattern of adaptive variation. Second, we review two case studies that illuminate how environmental effects on a multivariate phenotype can channel the action of natural selection. The phenotypic plasticity of male life history in Poecilia latipinna in response to temperature embraces a spectrum of traits; the effects of each one upon fitness will influence the ability of selection to mold the response of any one of them to temperature. The phenotypic covariances in thermal tolerance and life-history traits in Heterandria formosa differ slightly between populations from different parts of the species range, apparently because of differences between them in thermal sensitivity; this difference insures that the multivariate nature of selection will be correspondingly different in those different populations.

AB  - When populations experience substantial variation in environmental conditions, they may evolve phenotypic plasticity in response to these varying selection pressures. Evolutionary theory predicts differentiation in the level of phenotypic plasticity among different habitats. We evaluated temperature-induced phenotypic responses in juvenile growth rate in natural populations of the springtail Orchesella cincta, inhabiting forest and heathland. These habitats typically co-occur but differ strongly with respect to, for example, thermal regime, relative humidity, and structure. Offspring of females from the two habitats were reared at different temperatures in climate rooms and the temperature response of juvenile growth rate and egg size was measured. We found a habitat-specific difference in plasticity of juvenile growth rate. The reaction norms of the forest populations were steeper than the reaction norms for heath populations at two replicated sampling sites. Egg weight itself was demonstrated to be a plastic trait with a higher egg weight at low temperatures, but the thermal response did not differ between habitats. We conclude that these populations have diverged due to strong local natural selection. Our results support the argument that the level of phenotypic plasticity itself can be under selection and that differentiation in reaction norms can occur even in neighbouring habitats with no barrier to gene flow.

TI  - Adsorption of virgin and thermal cracked asphaltenes for gasification
AB  - To date, the most common process for hydrogen generation used in upgrading of heavy hydrocarbons is Steam Reforming of natural gas and/or naphtha. Nevertheless, natural gas and naphtha have much better alternative uses. Moreover, bitumen upgrading using hydrogen generated from Steam Reforming of natural gas and/or naphtha increases upgrading cost significantly. An alternative and cost effective process for hydrogen production can be gasification of the heaviest hydrocarbon molecules, preferably the ones closest to instability, at low temperature after selectively removing them from the heavy oil stream. The objective of this work was to design inexpensive, thermally stable macro porous selective adsorbents with catalytic active phases capable of steam reforming adsorbed heavy hydrocarbons by attacking them from multiple surface sites with the oxygen coming from water splitting. Ideally, the oxidation product would preferably be CO2 in order to ensure maximum H2 production. The macroporous adsorbent should be prepared at low cost, tolerant to steam and to the severity of gasification conditions as well as capable of accumulating metals present in the feedstock with minor negative impact on the performance. Another objective of this work was to accelerate the development of the process by using commercially available model molecules with similar defining asphaltenes characteristics to test their adsorption on the designed solid. This work demonstrated, at a conceptual level and laboratory scale, the viability of the proposed upgrading scheme comprising the integrated converted asphaltenes retention and hydrogen production processes at temperatures as low as 600°C.

VL  - 56

SP  - 1086-1090
AB  - We studied the effects of exposure to seawater equilibrated with CO2-enriched air (CO2 2380 ppm) from eggs to maturity and over two subsequent generations on the copepod Acartia tsuensis. Compared to the control (CO2 380 ppm), high CO2 exposure through all life stages of the 1st generation copepods did not significantly affect survival, body size or developmental speed. Egg production and hatching rates were also not significantly different between the initial generation of females exposed to high CO2 and the 1st and 2nd generation females developed from eggs to maturity in high CO2. Thus, the copepods appear more tolerant to increased CO2 than other marine organisms previously investigated for CO2 tolerance (i.e., sea urchins and bivalves). However, the crucial importance of copepods in marine ecosystems requires thorough evaluation of the overall impacts of marine environmental changes predicted to occur with increased CO2 concentrations, i.e., increased temperature, enhanced UV irradiation, and changes in the community structure and nutritional value of phytoplankton.

VL  - 65

AB  - Hypotheses that attempt to explain latitudinal gradients in species diversity are reviewed. Some hypotheses are circular, i.e. they are based on the assumption that some taxa have greater diversity in the tropics. These include explanations assuming different degrees of competition, mutualism, predation, epiphyte load, epidemics, biotic spatial heterogeneity, host diversity, population size, niche width, population growth rate, environmental harshness, and patchiness at different latitudes. Other explanations are not supported by sufficient evidence, i.e. there is no consistent correlation between species diversity and environmental stability, environmental predictability, productivity, abiotic rarefaction, physical heterogeneity, latitudinal decrease in the angle of the sun above the horizon, area, aridity, seasonality, number of habitats, and latitudinal ranges. The ecological and evolutionary time hypotheses, as usually understood, also cannot explain the gradients, nor does the temperature dependence of chemical reactions permit predictions on species richness. Only differences in solar energy are consistently correlated with diversity gradients along latitude, altitude and perhaps depth. It is concluded that greater species diversity is due to greater "effective" evolutionary time (evolutionary speed) in the tropics, probably as the result of shorter generation times, faster mutation rates, and faster selection at greater temperatures. There is an urgent need for experimental studies of temperature effects on speed of selection.

AB  - This work focuses on the examination of the physicochemical interactions of magnetic nanoparticles with various cell lines. The applied field maintained a temperature range between 41 degrees C and 45 degrees C at a frequency of 237 kHz and a magnetic field of 2.8 kA/m. Two cell models (Caco-2 and MCF-7) were employed. Magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized by the coprecipitation and thermodescomposition method. They were decorated with carboxymethyl-dextran (CMDX-mag) and Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG-mag) polymers. Nanoparticle uptake was found to be affected by nanoparticles functionalization and cell type. CMDX-mag nanoparticles were selected to perform MFH experiments. Viability analysis when MFH was applied indicated a significant decrease in cell viability for a magnetic field exposure of 120 min and a resting time of 24 hours when compared to hypethermia caused by a hot water bath. MFH appears to have a higher effect than hyperthermia with hot water bath oil cell viability.

TI  - Variability of gamete thermoresistance and heat selection op gametes in frogs and molluscs
VL  - 40
IS  - 6
AB  - The variability of heat resistance of gametes in amphibians and molluscs has been analysed in terms of the problem of direct thermal selection at presygotic stages of ontogenesis. A high variability in gamete heat resistance was revealed both within the frame of a population of animals and in a particular individual. The variability in gamete resistance of an individual animal was as great as 6-8 fold, whereas that within a population reached 8-10 fold value. Because of this phenomenon, a similar heat damaging factor exerted on gametes of different individuals results in different effect towards developed offsprings. A high variability of gamete heat resistance makes possible an effective and widely modified heat selection of gametes both of various genotypes and of an individual genotype. Under certain conditions gametes may be subject to natural selection, eliminating some classes of gametes and gives preference to some others. Because of this process the ratio of various phenotypes in population of organisms developed from the selected gametes also changes. The selective elimination of gametes of poikilotherms is able to influence the genetical-physiological structure of population.

SP  - 37-48
AB  - We conducted laboratory experiments with kaluga, Huso dauricus, and Amur sturgeon, Acipenser schrenckii, to develop a conceptual model of early behavior. We daily observed embryos (first life phase after hatching) and larvae (period initiating exogenous feeding) to day-30 (late larvae) for preference of bright habitat and cover, swimming distance above the bottom, up- and downstream movement, and diel activity. Day-0 embryos of both species strongly preferred bright, open habitat and initiated a strong, downstream migration that lasted 4 days (3 day peak) for kaluga and 3 days (2 day peak) for Amur sturgeon. Kaluga migrants swam far above the bottom (150 cm) on only 1 day and moved day and night; Amur sturgeon migrants swam far above the bottom (median 130 cm) during 3 days and were more nocturnal than kaluga. Post-migrant embryos of both species moved day and night, but Amur sturgeon used dark, cover habitat and swam closer to the bottom than kaluga. The larva period of both species began on day 7 (cumulative temperature degree-days, 192.0 for kaluga and 171.5 for Amur sturgeon). Larvae of both species preferred open habitat. Kaluga larvae strongly preferred bright habitat, initially swam far above the bottom (median 50-105 cm), and migrated downstream at night during days 10-16 (7-day migration). Amur sturgeon larvae strongly avoided illumination, had a mixed response to white substrate, swam 20-30 cm above the bottom during most days, and during days 12-34 (most of the larva period) moved downstream mostly at night (23-day migration). The embryo-larva migration style of the two species likely shows convergence of non-related species for a common style in response to environmental selection in the Amur River. The embryo-larva migration style of Amur sturgeon is unique among Acipenser yet studied.

VL  - 58

SP  - 172-182
AB  - trade-off between growth rate in areas with different temperatures and predation rates was modelled for juvenile cod living in the Barents Sea by a dynamic optimisation model. The choice of optimal temperature area of a juvenile (1-group) cod growing from a start weight (50 g, 15 cm) to a size refuge (640 g, 40 cm) was modelled for two scenarios with distributions of predators (4+ groups cod) similar to those observed in the Barents Sea in February 1990 and 1994, respectively, and without food limitations, The model predicted that when there was an overlap in distribution between large cod and younger cud (0-3 group), the younger year classes would move to areas with lower temperature and less predators. offering higher survival rates. Fish predators forced the prey to inhabit less optimal areas, and both growth and survival rates fell in comparison a with a scenario with fewer fish predators (cannibals) and less overlap. Increased fish predator density increased these effects. and the juveniles would stay in colder water for a longer period and their growth rate would be further reduced. Higher mortality, independent of area and size, made it more profitable to stay in warmer water. leading to higher growth but increased mortality rates.

TI  - A novel, high-yield system for the oxidation of methane to methanol
VL  - 253
SP  - 61-78
AB  - A novel, homogeneous system for the selective, low-temperature, catalytic oxidation of methane to methanol is reported. The net reaction catalyzed by mercuric ions, Hg(H), is the oxidation of methane by concentrated sulfuric acid to produce methyl bisulfate, water, and sulfur dioxide. The reaction is efficient. At a methane conversion of 50%, 85% selectivity to methyl bisulfate (∼43% yield, the major side product is carbon dioxide) was achieved at a molar productivity of l&-7 mol/cm3 s and Hg(II) turnover frequency of 10s-1. Separate hydrolysis of methyl bisulfate and reoxidation of the sulfur dioxide with air provides a potentially practical scheme for the oxidation of methane to methanol with molecular oxygen. This yield is the highest single-pass yield of methanol so far reported for a catalytic methane oxidation. The primary steps of the Hg(II)-catalyzed reaction were individually examined, and the essential elements of the mechanism were identified. The Hg(II) ion reacts with methane by an electrophilic displacement mechanism to produce an observable species, CH3HgOSO3H. Under the reaction conditions, CH3HgOSO3H readily decomposes to CH3OSO3H and the reduced mercurous species, Hg£+. The catalytic cycle is completed by the reoxidation of Hg/+ with H2SO4 to regenerate Hg(II) and by-products SO2 and H2O. Thallium(III), palladium(II), and the cations of platinum and gold also oxidize methane to methyl bisulfate in sulfuric acid. © 1997 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Preimaginal development and reproductive responses to temperature in two populations of the Colorado potato beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)
VL  - 81
IS  - 5
SP  - 755-763
AB  - The pattern of geographical differences in 2 populations of Leptinotarsa decemlineata suggests that preimaginal development responses and imaginal reproductive responses to temperature are under different selective pressures. Immatures from the warm, coastal (Long Island) area developed slightly slower, had slightly higher thermal thresholds for development, and suffered more mortality at low temperature than immatures from cooler, upstate New York. However, more females from the Long Island population oviposited fertile eggs at lower temperatures than females from the upstate population. Early planting dates and/or bivoltinism in the warm coastal area cause significant selection pressure for fast reproductive development under low temperatures, but these factors do not seem to cause similar selection in the Long Island population for fast preimaginal development under low temperature. Immatures from a single egg mass show considerable variation in developmental rates, especially on Long Island. -from Authors

AB  - This article describes a method for manipulating the temperature inside aqueous droplets, utilizing a thermoelectric cooler to control the temperature of select portions of a microfluidic chip. To illustrate the adaptability of this approach, we have generated an "ice valve" to stop fluid flow in a microchannel. By taking advantage of the vastly different freezing points for aqueous solutions and immiscible oils, we froze a stream of aqueous droplets that were formed on-chip. By integrating this technique with cell encapsulation into aqueous droplets, we were also able to freeze single cells encased in flowing droplets. Using a live-dead stain, we confirmed the viability of cells was not adversely affected by the process of freezing in aqueous droplets provided cryoprotectants were utilized. When combined with current droplet methodologies, this technology has the potential to both selectively heat and cool portions of a chip for a variety of droplet-related applications, such as freezing, temperature cycling, sample archiving, and controlling reaction kinetics. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SP  - 149-158
AB  - 1. Alba, a white wing colour morph of butterflies of the genus Colias, makes fitness-related changes at several levels of phenotypic organization: physiology, development and behaviour. Two sympatric species of Colias are studied, which differ greatly in their frequency of alba vs its sister yellow/orange morph. How resource and time constraints on Colias interact with the morphs' different patterns of pupal resource allocation to alter the balance of the morphs' fitness components in the two species is discussed. 2. These species, C. alexandra and C. scudderi, differ in melanin-based solar energy absorption, in larval dietary richness and in local adult nectar resources. The two female morphs determine alternate thermal balance, internal resource allocation and behavioural effects in each species, thus changing the morphs' time budgets and fitness-component impacts between the species. In particular, female egg output differences between the morphs appears to reverse between species: alba fecundity is greater than yellow fecundity in C. scudderi, but alba is less than yellow in C. alexandra. 3. These differences are consistent with the large observed differences in alba frequency between the species. Some important questions about the selective regime maintaining a polymorphism here, rather than an alternation of monomorphisms, remain.

VL  - 58

SP  - 762-768
AB  - We used a horizontal temperature gradient to investigate the effect of alternate life history strategies and nutritional state on the preferred temperature of overwintering juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Contrary to our prediction, there was no significant difference in final preferred temperature between juvenile Atlantic salmon that will migrate to sea the following spring (early migrants) and those that show reduced growth and delay migration for at least another year (delayed migrants). Both migrant groups preferentially selected relatively low temperatures (< 10 degreesC), likely owing to their low appetite and growth rates. Food deprivation resulted in a significant increase, rather than our predicted decrease, in the final preferred temperature of the juvenile Atlantic salmon of approximately 2 degreesC. We suggest that this is due to the need for an increased foraging effort to offset the projected energy deficit later in the winter. The final preferred temperature of delayed migrants increased from winter to spring, as predicted, coincident with increases in natural food availability and endogenous seasonal increases in appetite and growth rates. We conclude that the preferred temperature of overwintering juvenile Atlantic salmon may be influenced by future energetic requirements rather than the current level of energy reserves.

VL  - 66
IS  - 4
SP  - 434-440
AB  - Larval and juvenile stages of many fishes require nursery habitats that provide optimal conditions for growth. Loss or degradation of these habitats limits recruitment, causing population and species declines. Least chub (Iotichthys phlegethontis), an endemic cyprinid in the Bonneville Basin, is currently restricted to a few spring complexes in Utah. This species utilizes the warm shallow spring margins as spawning and rearing habitat throughout the summer. This study was conducted to determine effects of temperature on survival and growth of age-0 least chub to understand the importance of temperature in selection of spring margins as rearing habitat. Age-0 least chub were exposed to 5 temperatures (14 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C, and 27 degrees C) for 112 days. Growth rates varied significantly with temperature except at 17 degrees C and 27 degrees C, and growth rates were highest at 21 degrees C (P < 0.001). Maximum growth rate for age-0 least chub, estimated from a 2nd-order polynomial regression, would occur at 22.3 degrees C. These thermal requirements indicate the importance of warm rearing habitats in producing strong year classes and viable populations. However, warm spring margins also enable western mosquitofish, a nonnative competitor and predator of least chub, to thrive in these spring habitats. Broad thermal limits of the least chub suggest that it could persist at cooler temperatures, which would reduce the viability of western mosquitofish populations.

VL  - 88

SP  - 859-864
AB  - A severe limitation to fully realize the dramatic potential for adaptation of RNA virus quasispecies may occur if mutations in vast regions of the sequence space of virus genomes lead to significant decreases in biological fitness. In this study the detection and selection by heat of thermostable variants from different foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) populations were attempted, in order to explore whether FMDV may generally accept a substantial increase in thermostability without compromising its infectivity. The results obtained with both uncloned and cloned populations of different serotypes, recovered from cytolytic or persistent infections and subjected to either very few passages or extensive passaging in cells, indicate that the presence of thermostable virus variants, even in small proportions, is not a general feature of FMDV quasispecies. This suggests that no substantial increase in the thermostability of FMDV may readily occur without a negative effect on viral function. © 2007 SGM.

AB  - Municipal wastewater has been applied as a fertilizer to coniferous forest in northern Sweden with the additional aims to purify the wastewater and reduce the treatment costs. This practice has the potential to introduce pathogenic microorganisms from the applied wastewater or sludge to the environment, with a subsequent risk of transmission to exposed humans or animals. Seasonality and climatological conditions, in particular low temperature, humidity and low sun intensity will furthermore affect the persistence of pathogens in the forest in northern Scandinavia and may therefore enhance the survival and thereby the exposure risk. The survival of two pathogens (Salmonella senftenberg and Campylobacter coli) and four fecal indicator organisms; bacteria strains (E. coli and E. fecalis) and bacteriophages (S. typhimurium phage 28 B and φx174), used here as viral models, was evaluated in microcosms (60 Litre terrariums) with two vegetation regimes (characterized as moss and lichen) at selected temperatures (+3°C to +27°C) and artificial light exposure (light and dark). Salmonella persisted in high numbers after 35 days in the vegetation, indicating a potential risk for further transmission. Neither the vegetation regime nor temperature or light exposure as independent factors governed the reduction of the indicator bacteria and the bacteriophages. The persistence of the indicator organisms was generally best supported in the moss vegetation at low temperature in the dark, where the time for a 90% reduction (T90) was in the range from 8 days (E. coli) to 31 days (Salmonella phage). The die-off characteristics found in this study provide baseline values for further validations in the field and verify that the purification and reuse of municipal wastewater in coniferous forest could potentially be responsible for transmission of fecal pathogens to humans and animals. © Springer 2006.

AB  - 1. 1. This paper describes the results of an investigation of the relationship between mortality from cerebrovascular disease (hereafter called stroke) and the indoor thermal environment in two selected towns with different socioeconomic compositions: Shiwahime, an agricultura town with relatively high stroke mortality, and Karakuwa, a fishing town with relatively low stroke mortality, using a case-control research design. 2. 2. The measurement of the indoor thermal environments were conducted and the surveyed with a questionnaire during the winter of 1986. 3. 3. The findings are summarized as detailed below. 4. 4. Room temperatures in the control households were generally higher than those in the case households by up to 1.3°C. 5. 5. The thermal conditions of the housing in the case households were a little inferior to those in the control households. 6. 6. Despite much lower room temperatures than the so-called comfort temperature, members of both the case and the control households did not express feelings of being cold in the rooms. 7. 7. It is concluded, including the survey results from other literature, that improvements in the indoor thermal environment should receive more attention with respect of the reduction in stroke mortality, particularly in areas of cold climates. © 1993.

AB  - Jotropha gossypifolio L. (Etphorbiaceae) and Cleome viscosa, L. (Capparidacae), Thai-plant species, have phytocidal chemical components and responsible for controlling and repelling insects from the host plants. To avoid potential toxic pollutant contaminating aquatic ecosystems, this present study was investigated for acute toxicity. Guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata) were selected for the bioassay experiments. The experiments were repeated 5 times and the 24-h LC50 was determined for the guppies. The acute toxicity experiments were carried out by static method and behavioral changes in guppies were determined for each Jatropha gossypifolia L. and Cleome viscosa, L. concentration extract which extracted by Soxhlet extraction method with ethanol as solvent. Water temperature was regulated at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Data obtained from the acute toxicity tests were evaluated using the probit analysis statistical method. The 24-h LC50 value for guppy was estimated as ca. 3100 ppm (r2=0.95) and 5300 ppm ((r2=0.96) for Jatropha gossypifolia L. and Cleome viscosa, L. extract, respectively. However, in this concentration, no mortality was observed at higher concentration for 30 second.

SP  - 108-111
AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare thermotolerance in whole plants vs. suspension cell cultures of winter wheat, and to evaluate the synthesis of heat shock proteins in relation to genotypic differences in thermotolerance in suspension cells. Whole plant genetic differences in the development of heat tolerance were identified for three wheat genotypes (ND 7532, KS 75210 and TAM 101). Suspension cell cultures of these genotypes were used to evaluate in vitro response to heat stress. Viability tests by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and by fluorescein diacetate (FD) were utilized to determine the relationship of cellular response to heat stress (37°C/24 h, 50°C/1h). KS 75210 and ND 7532 are relatively heat susceptible. TAM 101 is heat tolerant. Both tests at the cellular level were similar to the whole plant response. Thus, cellular selection for enhancing heat tolerance seems feasible. Heat shock protein (HSP) synthesis of two genotypes, ND 7532 and TAM 101 were determined for suspension cultured cells. In suspension cultures, HSPs of molecular weight 16 and 17 kD were found to be synthesized at higher levels in the heat tolerant genotype (TAM 101) than the susceptible genotype (ND 7532), both at 34° and 37°C treatments for 2 hours and 5 hours. HSP 22 kD was synthesized more at 34°C for TAM 101 than ND 7532, but not at 37°C; whereas, HSP 33 kD was synthesized at 37°C at similar abundance for both genotypes, but not at 34°C. These results indicated that there is a differential expression of HSP genes in wheat suspension cells at different temperature stress durations and between heat tolerant and heat susceptible genotypes. It appears that the levels of synthesis of HSPs 16 and 17 kD are correlated with genotypic differences in thermal tolerance at the cellular level in two genotypes of wheat. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 117
IS  - 4
SP  - 345-349
AB  - Five Lotus tenuis genotypes showing 2n pollen production greater than 5% and producing 4x progenies in 4x(male sterile Lotus corniculatus) x 2x crosses were found in different natural populations. Meiotic analyses of these plants showed some second metaphases with disoriented spindles, i.e. parallel and tripolar spindles which resulted in diads and triads, respectively. Because useful genes for winter growth and resistance to powdery mildew from L. tenuis can be introgressed into L. corniculatus via 2n gametes, a programme of selection was started to increase the occurrence of 2n gamete production in L. tenuis. Controlled crosses were performed between genotypes producing 2n gametes and the progenies were checked for 2n pollen production and meiotic aberration, following the same methodologies as used for the parental plants. Although in some progeny plants the frequency of 2n gamete production increased remarkably, the overall progeny level of 2n gamete production remained unchanged. This suggested that different genes for meiotic aberration exist in natural populations and/or differential seed-setting ability exists between genotypes. Diallel crosses between selected genotypes confirmed this hypothesis. Evaluation of 2n pollen production of clones grown under different temperature regimes (warm vs. temperate) showed that, in L. tenuis, the effects of genotype, temperature and genotype x temperature interaction are significant. In particular, high temperature increases the level of 2n gamete production in L. tenuis.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in various upland soils show a rather large diversity with respect to their amoA genes (coding for a subunit of the ammonium monooxygenase). It is known that the community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in upland soils is influenced by different selective factors, such as pH, gravimetric water content, fertilizer treatment, and temperature. The question, from an ecological point of view, is whether a particular ecophysiological factor, such as temperature, could select for a particular community structure of ammonia oxidizers in upland soils that would be represented by distinct clusters of the amoA gene (AmoA cluster). Studying the literature, including recent publications and our own unpublished results, we found that AmoA clusters 3a, 3b, and 9-12 apparently exhibited no preference for either subtropical/tropical soils (i.e., warm regions) or temperate cold soils. However, AmoA clusters 1 and 4 (and perhaps cluster 2) seem to occur predominantly in soils from cold-temperate regions. Here we review the evidence for a temperature effect on the global distribution of amoA genes in warm- and cold-temperate soils. © 2005 NRC Canada.

TI  - Comparative skill of two analog seasonal temperature prediction systems: objective selection of predictors
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SP  - 608-615
AB  - Analog prediction systems developed in the United States and the former Soviet Union are compared for U.S. seasonal temperature prediction. Of primary interest is the viability of the Russian ''optimization'' concept for a priori selection of U.S. seasonal analog forecast predictors. Optimization is a specific technique for choosing predictor variables for analog matching on a forecast-by-forecast basis. Validation of this procedure would lead to more efficient design of analog prediction models and the elimination of some subjectivity in the process that inevitably results in overstatements in realizable skill. The procedure's effectiveness was tested using predictor and predictand datasets from the U.S. system in a cross-validation framework. Skills of different models were assessed on the basis of 40 seasonal forecasts at 92 U.S. stations. The Russian system (called GRAN for ''Group Analog'') was first run without optimization using the a posteriori selected predictors used in the U.S. system. A version of the U.S. system (without use of antianalogs) that is conceptually very similar to GRAN without optimization was run for comparison in this calibration step. The results reveal that these systems perform in a nearly identical manner when predictor and predictand datasets are the same. Next GRAN forecasts were made using all available predictors and then using only predictors selected via optimization. The results not only show that objective a priori predictor selection by optimization is just as effective (in terms of skill) as subjective a posteriori selection but also suggest it may produce superior results in summer forecasts.

VL  - 91

AB  - The Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawns and rears in the cold, freshwater rivers and tributaries of California's Central Valley, with four separate seasonal runs including fall and late-fall runs, a winter run, and a spring run. Dams and reservoirs have blocked access to most of the Chinook's ancestral spawning areas in the upper reaches and tributaries. Consequently, the fish rely on the mainstem of the Sacramento River for spawning habitat. Future climatic warming could lead to alterations of the river's temperature regime, which could further reduce the already fragmented Chinook habitat. Specifically, increased water temperatures could result in spawning and rearing temperature exceedences, thereby jeopardizing productivity, particularly in drought years. Paradoxically, water management plays a key role in potential adaptation options by maintaining spawning and rearing habitat now and in the future, as reservoirs such as Shasta provide a cold water supply that will be increasingly needed to counter the effects of climate change. Results suggest that the available cold pool behind Shasta could be maintained throughout the summer assuming median projections of mid-21st century warming of 2°C, but the maintenance of the cold pool with warming on the order of 4°C could be very challenging. The winter and spring runs are shown to be most at risk because of the timing of their reproduction. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Antagonistic selection between adult thorax and wing size in field released Drosophila melanogaster independent of thermal conditions
VL  - 20

SP  - 2219-2227
AB  - Attempts to explain size variation in Drosophila and other small insects often focus on the larval stage and association between development time and size, but patterns are also influenced by direct selection on size-related traits in the adults. Here we use multiple field releases of Drosophila melanogaster to test the association between size and one component of field fitness, the ability of Drosophila to locate resources for feeding and breeding. We find antagonistic selection between wing length and thorax length in both males and females, such that capture at baits is higher for flies with relatively larger thorax lengths and smaller wings. However flies with large wings relative to thoraces disperse further as reflected in the longer distances moved to baits. These patterns did not depend strongly on weather conditions, suggesting that selection on adult size is at least partly independent of temperature. Antagonistic selection between size traits can generate changes in size along gradients if the distribution of resources in the environment varies and selects for different dispersal patterns, particularly as dispersal is relatively higher under warmer conditions. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 102
IS  - 1
SP  - 153-160
AB  - Aims: To determine the effect of reduced water activity (aw) on thermal inactivation of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium at different temperatures and its mechanism. Methods and Results: D-value determinations at a range of different temperatures showed that heating at reduced aw (0.94, produced by addition of glucose or sodium chloride to nutrient broth) was protective at temperatures above 53-55°C but sensitizing below this temperature. Using selective enumeration media to determine injury, it was shown that at lower heating temperatures cells survived at high aw with cytoplasmic injury whereas at low aw these cells were killed. At higher temperatures ribosome degradation was a more important cause of death and was inhibited by low aw heating media thereby providing greater heat resistance. Conclusions: The observed change in behaviour reflects the different reactions responsible for thermal death at different temperatures and their different response to reduced aw. Significance and Impact of the Study: This work qualifies the previous assumption that reduced a w is protective and suggests that the efficacy of low temperature pasteurization regimes may be increased by reduced aw. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Cis-trans energetics in urea and acetamide studied by deuterium NMR
VL  - 97
IS  - 47
SP  - 12393-12398
AB  - Deuterium broad-line NMR experiments performed on crystalline tetragonal urea over a temperature range of 30-120°C allowed us to measure the rate of cis-trans isomerization as well as a previously described "whole body" two-site flip about the carbonyl. To follow the cis-trans rate, we found it useful to employ a selective inversion-recovery experiment using a DANTE sequence applied at parallel edge of the powder pattern followed by a variable mixing time and quadrupolar echo detection. T1 anisotropy and line shape experiments were also used to measure the whole body flip and the cis-trans isomerization. The barriers of 15.5 ± 1.2 and 18.5 ± 1.6 kcal/mol for the whole body motion and the cis-trans isomerization, respectively, are of the same order as previously suggested values and much higher than the corresponding solution values measured in protic and aprotic media. Both motions display modest or undetectable isotope effects when deuterons are replaced with protons and the residual deuterons are probed. We also estimate a barrier of 21.7 ± 2 kcal/mol for the cis-trans isomerization in rhombohedral acetamide, which is a much higher than the value in solution. Thus, we demonstrate the viability of this approach in addressing very slow motions even for samples characterized by long spin-lattice relaxation times and poor signal to noise. The significant difference in the barrier heights between acetamide and urea in the solid state as compared with previous solution measurements is also discussed in relation to hydrogen bonding. © 1993 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Heritable variation for sex ratio under environmental sex determination in the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina)
VL  - 131
IS  - 1
SP  - 155-161
AB  - The magnitude of quantitative genetic variation for primary sex ratio was measured in families extracted from a natural population of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), which possesses temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Eggs were incubated at three temperatures that produced mixed sex ratios. This experimental design provided estimates of the heritability of sex ratio in multiple environments and a test of the hypothesis that genotype X environment (G X E) interactions may be maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this population of C. serpentina. Substantial quantitative genetic variation for primary sex ratio was detected in all experimental treatments. These results in conjunction with the occurrence of TSD in this species provide support for three critical assumptions of Fisher's theory for the microevolution of sex ratio. There were statistically significant effects of family and incubation temperature on sex ratio, but no significant interaction was observed. Estimates of the genetic correlations of sex ratio across environments were highly positive and essentially indistinguishable from + 1. These latter two findings suggest that G X E interaction is not the mechanism maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this system. Finally, although substantial heritable variation exists for primary sex ratio of C. serpentina under constant temperatures, estimates of the effective heritability of primary sex ratio in nature are approximately an order of magnitude smaller. Small effective heritability and a long generation time in C. serpentina imply that evolution of sex ratios would be slow even in response to strong selection by, among other potential agents, any rapid and/or substantial shifts in local temperatures, including those produced by changes in the global climate.

VL  - 127

SP  - 332-339
AB  - The development of the solitary endoparasitoid Meteorus gyrator was compared in the six larval stages of its host, the tomato moth Lacanobia oleracea , and at five constant temperatures. The host instar at the time of parasitism had a marked effect on the larval developmental period of the parasitoid, such that larvae derived from eggs oviposited in first instar hosts took approximately 18 days to egress, whilst those derived from eggs oviposited in sixth instar hosts took <10 days. The weight of cocoons was greatest when oviposition was into final instar hosts, where female cocoons averaged 12.8 mg, and lowest in those derived from eggs oviposited into first instars (9.2 mg). The parasitoid's larval development rate in third instar hosts increased with temperature increments in a linear fashion up to 25 degrees C, after which development times were only marginally increased. At 10 degrees C, the mean larval development time was approximately 90 days and pupal development 35-40 days, whilst at 25 degrees C development times were 10-11 days for larvae and 6-7 days for the pupae. In the majority of cases, overall development times were marginally longer (<1 day) in females than in males.

TI  - Temperature-dependent competition hierarchy: A mechanism stabilizing the phenological strategy in the scorpionfly Panorpa communis L
VL  - 41
IS  - 2
SP  - 109-117
AB  - Previous studies of the phenologies and the different microclimatic patterns of the distribution of the scorpionflies Panorpa communis L. and Panorpa vulgaris Imhoff and Labram 1836 showed different phenological strategies. In P. communis, a species foraging at shadowy and cool places only, a majority of 90% of the individuals are univoltine; however, approximately 10% of the offspring of the first annual generation are bivoltine. This proportion remained unchanged in the Freiburg population over 8 years. Differently, all individuals of P. vulgaris foraging equally frequent at sunny and warm as at shadowy and cool places are bivoltine. The proximate cause of bivoltinism in both species is a heritable variation of different 'day length thresholds' triggering diapause-free development if natural day length exceeds these thresholds. As selection favours maximal temporal exploitation of food availability it remains obscure why in P. communis the number of diapause-free developing individuals does not increase continuously from year to year although this phenotype reproduces twice a year. Therefore, in the present paper, we focus on the following main questions. Does the competitive inferiority of P. communis in the presence of P. vulgaris at the temperature regime of the late summer function as a mechanism maintaining the majority of individuals of P. communis univoltine, by dramatically reducing the fitness of the bivoltine ones? As a long-term evolutionary change in the frequency of bivoltine individuals in P. communis solely depends on the lifetime reproductive success of the females, we here consider the influence of interspecific competition and temperature conditions on the reproductive success of the females of P. communis only. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of maintaining univoltinism in P. communis is primarily because of differences in the ability of each species to exploit dead arthropod resources: (1) these species show complete diet overlap; (2) dead arthropods are limiting resources for both species of scorpionflies as indicated by positive demographic effects with increased food availability; (3) in competition with P. vulgaris at high temperatures, P. communis is competitively inferior in the ability to detect and exploit dead arthropods; (4) this reduced resource acquisition of female P. communis translates into significant reductions in the survivorship, body condition, fecundity and lifetime reproductive success; (5) exploitation competition does account for these negative demographic effects on second-generation females of P. communis more than interference competition.

AB  - At two experiments, infective stage juveniles of three heterorhabditid nematode isolates and Steinernema riobravis were placed in sterilized sandy soil in sealed containers buried in corn field during summer. Containers were removed daily for 10 consequent days and surviving juveniles were recovered from the soil by Baermann funnel method, then the remainder of soil was subjected to Spodoptera littoralis-baiting technique. Apparently, the low level of soil moisture (3%) and ceiling temperature levels (up to 42°C) as well as faint electric conductivity (0.48 mmhos/cm) of the soil containing the nematodes resulted in a rapid decline in the number of nematodes recoverable from the soil over time by Baermann method. The percentage of recovery for the nematode isolates EAM8, EIS7 and EAS59 by the Baermann funnel was 35.6%, 43.9% and 20.5% for the total nematodes recovered in the first trial, respectively. The nematode numbers increased when the recovery time extended from 24 to 48 h at 23°C. Insignificant differences were found between nematode numbers recovered daily in both trials. The average number of the recovered S. riobravis was more (P≤0.05) than that of any other nematode isolate. Nematodes which were not recoverable by Baermann technique were infective when bioassayed over the period of the two experiments. The infective juveniles which survivied the stressed conditions are recommended to be subcultured through selection regime in order to obtain an improved nematode strain. © 1995 Blackwell Wissenschafts-Verlag.

VL  - 8

SP  - 510-515
AB  - Estimation of crop production in advance of the harvest has been an intensively researched field in agriculture. The aim of present study was to predict wheat yield using different agrometeorological indices, spectral index (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Trend Estimated Yield (TEY) in Hoshiarpur district of Punjab for the years 2001-02 and 2002-03. On the basis of examination of Correlation Coefficients (R), Standard Error of Estimate (SEOE) and Relative Deviation (RD) values resulted from different agromet models, the best agromet subset were selected as Minimum Temperature (Tmin), Maximum Temperature (Tmax) and Accumulated Heliothermal Units (HTU) for Hoshiarpur district. In order to improve model accuracy the above mentioned agrometeorological indices together with NDVI and TEY were used as independent variables for yield prediction at reproductive stage (2nd week of March) of wheat. It was found that Agromet-Spectral-Trend-Yield model could explain 96% (SEOE = 87 kg ha-1) of wheat yield variations for Hoshiarpur district. ©2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

VL  - 17
IS  - 3
SP  - 731-739
AB  - The timing of migration from feeding to breeding areas is a critical link between the growth and survival of adult animals, their reproduction, and the fitness of their progeny. Commercial fisheries often catch a large fraction of the migrants (e.g., salmon), and exploitation rates can vary systematically over the fishing season. We examined daily records of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the Egegik and Ugashik management districts in Bristol Bay, Alaska (USA), for evidence of such temporally selective fishing. In recent years, the early migrants have experienced lower fishing rates than later migrants, especially in the Egegik district, and the median migration date of the fish escaping the fisheries has been getting progressively earlier in both districts. Moreover, the overall runs (catch and escapement) in the Egegik district and, to a lesser extent the Ugashik district, have been getting earlier, as predicted in response to the selection on timing. The trends in timing were not correlated with sea surface temperature in the region of the North Pacific Ocean where the salmon tend to concentrate, but the trends in the two districts were correlated with each other, indicating that there may be some common environmental influence in addition to the effect of selection. Despite the selection, both groups of salmon have remained productive. We hypothesize that this resilience may result from representation of all component populations among the early and late migrants, so that the fisheries have not eliminated entire populations, and from density-dependent processes that may have helped maintain the productivity of these salmon populations. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Two modes of balancing selection in Drosophila melanogaster: Overcompensation and overdominance
VL  - 128
IS  - 2
SP  - 381-391
AB  - Overdominance is often invoked to account for the extensive polymorphisms found in natural populations of organisms; overcompensation, however, may be equally or more important. Overcompensation occurs when limiting resources are better exploited by a genetically mixed than by a uniform population, and is often causally related to frequency-dependent selection. We have designed experiments to test whether overcompensation occurs in Drosophila melanogaster, using the Sod locus as a marker. Tests are made at each of two densities and two temperatures for cultures with desired genetic compositions. Both temperature and density have statistically significant effects on the per-female productivity of the cultures. More important, there are strong effects due to overcompensation. Cultures that are more polymorphic are also more productive than less polymorphic ones even when the level of individual heterozygosity is the same in all. There is also overdominance for the Sod locus: the heterozygotes are more productive than either homozygote at every temperature and density, and the differences are statistically significant in several cases. These results corroborate previous studies showing that overdominance may contribute to the maintenance of the Sod polymorphisms. Moreover, our results indicate that the significance of overcompensation as a mechanism to account for polymorphism in natural populations deserves further investigation.

VL  - 66
IS  - 1
SP  - 46-53
AB  - Exposure of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to low autumn temperatures allows it to cold acclimate and withstand sub-zero winter temperatures. Winter damage/kill can however occur. Studies on low temperature (LT)-induced genes have focused on growth chamber-grown plants at constant LT. Ideally a field experiment would be more representative and provide a better understanding of the role of LT-induced genes during cold acclimation. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the expression patterns of selected LT-induced genes, TaCBF20, Wcs120, Wcor410 and Wcor14, in field-grown wheat (winter-hardy Norstar, tender spring Manitou and the near-isogenic lines, spring Norstar and winter Manitou) over 3 years at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Leaf samples were collected at different intervals during the autumn. Generally, cold acclimation of the four genotypes over the 3 years was in agreement with growth chamber studies. However, variability in LT-induced transcript accumulation in the field-grown plants was observed over the 3 years and it could be attributed to the soil temperature fluctuations. Trends in accumulation in early sampling dates indicated that differences among the genotypes could be delineated, depending on the year and LT-induced genes. This study highlights the importance of integrating field and growth chamber studies to obtain a more complete understanding of the critical roles of LT-induced genes in conferring LT tolerance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 15
IS  - 6
SP  - 26-32
AB  - Fish in streams of the southern Great Plains and southwestern North America may be particularly vulnerable to extirpation or extinction due to global warming. Streams of this region already have some of the hottest free-flowing water on earth (summer maxima of 38–40°C), and even now fish live at times very near their lethal thermal limits. Unlike many terrestrial and marine organisms or fishes of some rivers, fishes in these prairie stream systems cannot migrate northward to cooler temperatures in the event of global warming. If warming of 3–4°C occurs, a substantial number of species endemic to this region could face extinction unless they adapt behaviorally or genetically for thermal increases. Existing evidence suggests little likelihood of successful behavioral adjustments. Data on thermal tolerance of local populations provide conflicting evidence: one widespread species of the Great Plains shows no difference in thermal tolerance across its range, whereas another shows adaptation to environmental temperatures at the local level. Because of the evolutionarily brief time predicted for global warming, it is unlikely that genetic options can arise rapidly enough through mutation to allow species to cope with hotter environments. Species that survive major increases in environmental temperature will likely be ones with adequate existing genetic variation to allow survival and selection of at least some individuals. Overall, the outlook for native fishes of the Great Plains and southwest is bleak, if predicted temperature increases occur. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 12

AB  - The theory of convergence predicts that, given similar selective regimes, both present and past, unrelated ecological communities will show similar attributes. Mild Pleistocene climate, highly infertile soils, and similar fire regimes explain the remarkable convergence between mediterranean-type vegetation from South Africa (fynbos) and Australia (kwongan). Heathlands in the Aljibe Mountains, at the western end of the Mediterranean basin, constitute a single vegetation type within the Mediterranean region. We studied the association between endemism and plant life form in a flora from environmentally similar areas of the South African Cape region (fynbos) and the Aljibe Mountains by contingency table analysis. We included two non-acid, neighbouring areas to the latter region in the analysis as contrasts. We also compared the patterns of variation in three components of biodiversity (species richness, endemism level and taxonomic singularity) of fynbos and Aljibe heathland woody plant communities along similar soil fertility gradients by means of two-way ANOVAs. At the regional (flora) level, our results show two common features in the biological aspects of endemism between the two regions: (1) edaphic endemism and (2) association of endemism with the shrub growth form. At the community level, we detected strong similarities in the patterns of variation of endemism and taxonomic singularity of woody communities from both regions along an ecological gradient related to soil fertility. We interpret these similarities, both at the regional and community levels, as suggestive of convergence between fynbos and Aljibe heathland.

VL  - 36

SP  - 253-263
AB  - The predatory mite Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) is an important biological control agent for thrips in commercial greenhouses, but its effectiveness in fall and winter is limited by reproductive diapause induced under short day conditions. Influence of photoperiod and temperature on diapause induction was investigated to provide information for successful management of the predator. Under 8:16 (L:D) photoperiods and 22°C photophase temperatures, diapause incidence was inversely related to scotophase temperature, decreasing from 100% diapause at 15°C to no diapause at 21°C. In continuous darkness, diapause was induced by thermoperiods of 20:10 and 22:17 and 22:17 but not 25:15°C (T:C) (8h thermophase). Critical daylength for inducing diapause under 22:17°C (T:C) was 12.45 h, which was consistent with the trend in diapause incidence in mites collected from an established greenhouse population September to November. Most A. cucumeris diapaused only when exposed to diapause inducing conditions throughout their juvenile development and none stopped laying eggs when transferred from nondiapause to diapause inducing conditions as adults. After 14 generations of genetic selection for a nondiapause strain, diapause incidence was 33.3%. © 1991 Lavoisier Abonnements.

TI  - On evolutive systems and the initial evolution of structure and function
VL  - 178
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-88
AB  - As an instrument for the study of the early stages of evolution, we introduce evolutive systems, defined as systems that have the capacity to evolve given appropriate conditions in their environment. They consist of building blocks (e.g, monomers) that are either stable or in steady supply, and of transient assemblies (e.g, polymers) that are entities of great variety, some of which are capable of function. Evolution leads to the accumulation of structure within the transient assemblies during repeated cycles of disintegration (partial or total) and reassembly, on account of the selective advantages associated with transient assembly functions. Transient assemblies must be either inherently unstable or subject to disintegration by agents in their environment. Evolutive systems must have access to a negentropy input in the form of energy in packets larger than typical thermal energies. Reproduction, although not a prerequisite, greatly affects the capacity of evolutive systems to evolve, and thus can be expected to appear in an evolutive system if at all possible. Similarly, functions that require the expenditure of negentropy (for example mobility, breathing, circulation, sensing, communicating, etc.) are not prerequisites for evolution, but can be expected to become established in evolutive systems during evolution through the selective advantages that they confer. A computer-based evolutive automaton is used to explore possible evolutionary scenarios. In the presence of spatial and temporal inhomogeneities, one can construct a multitude of evolutionary scenarios through which various functions, such as the operation of a genetic code, can become established within the evolutive automaton. This variety of possible evolutionary scenarios is all the more remarkable because the automaton does not include many important physical processes that would be present in a real system and would greatly multiply the number of possible evolutionary mechanisms and scenarios. Some evolutionary mechanisms are based on survival related selection, while others are based on generation related selection. Previously explored scenarios for the initiation of life have been based mostly on generation related selection. In this paper, we give particular emphasis to survival related selection which is more general in that it does apply to structures and functions related to reproduction but, unlike generation related selection, it is not limited to them. Some of the most basic features of terrestrial living systems can be seen either as prerequisite features of an evolutive system (such as the mortality of living organisms, instability of biological polymers, imperfect reproduction caused by mutations, and the need for a negentropy input) or as features that one can reasonably expect to become established in an evolutive system (such as reproduction and the multitude of living functions that require expenditure of negentropy). This suggests the possibility that an independent definition of living systems may not be necessary if features of living systems substantially overlap with features that one may expect to find in evolutive systems.

VL  - 296

SP  - 853-855
AB  - The alcohol dehydrogenase locus (adh) is polymorphic in most natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster1-11. Eight alleles have been identified on the basis of allozyme elec-trophoretic mobility and thermostability; two of these, adhFm and adhSm, generally have combined frequencies of ≥90%. In four widely separate locations these major alleles display a clinal change in frequency, that of adh Fm increasing with latitude and altitude3-6,11. Biochemical studies have shown that the Fm allozyme (ADHFm) is more active, but less heat-resistant, than ADHSm(refs 12-14). The fact that these differences are associated with the geographical distribution of the alleles suggests that environmental temperature may be a selective factor in maintaining this polymorphism. We have investigated the effect of high temperature on flies having ADH allozymes with a range of thermostabilities and report here that flies which have relatively labile enzymes show reduced survival on alcohol-supplemented food compared with flies possessing more heat-resistant allozymes. © 1982 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - The effects of water flow and water temperature on the growth of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and largemouth bass M. salmoides were examined during 14-day replicate trials in artificial ponds between July and September 2001. No significant difference was observed in the specific growth rate in body weight of both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing when prey fish were given. The ratio of growth rate of smallmouth bass to largemouth bass was significantly larger in the experimental periods when the water temperature in the ponds was relatively low (21.5-24.0degreesC). When no prey fish was given, largemouth bass showed a significantly larger reduction in the growth rate in ponds with water flowing, although no significant difference was observed in the growth rate of smallmouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing. The results show that smallmouth bass has a relatively higher adaptability to water flow and low water temperature than largemouth bass.

TI  - Polyaniline nanotubes prepared using fiber mats membrane as the template and their gas-response behavior
VL  - 112
IS  - 22
SP  - 8215-8222
AB  - A route for producing polyaniline nanotubes using the inner eggshell membrane as a template is demonstrated. Because the template substitutes the inner eggshell membrane with the outer eggshell membrane in the same reaction process, the resulting morphology of polyaniline correspondingly changes. A series of experimental results indicate that the pore size of the template plays a key role in the formation of the polyaniline nanotubes. By imaging the template before, during, and after the polymerization, a possible formation condition and process of polyaniline nanotubes is proposed. Meanwhile, fiber mats imitating an eggshell membrane-electrospun polyvinyl alcohol) (PVA) fiber mats-are successfully used as a template for synthesizing polyaniline nanotubes in the same polymerization process. Using the PVA fiber mats as the template for different pore size and using an electrospinning method for different hours, respectively, the resulting morphology of the polyaniline correspondingly changes. When the pore size of PVA fiber mats is similar to that of the inner eggshell membrane, polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes can be obtained. The high surface areas, small diameter, and porous nature of the PANI nanotubes give significantly better performance in both gas sensitivity and time response. The gas-responses to trimethylamine, ammonia, and hydrazine are examined at room temperature. Compared with polyaniline prepared without a template, the polyaniline nanotubes prepared using the imitating template show higher selectivity and quicker response to trimethylamine gas. Meanwhile, the reversible circulation response change of polyaniline nanotubes has a reasonable reproducibility and has more potential applications in the area of sensor development. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

AB  - 1. Our investigation of the effect of the parameters of induction heating at phase transformation temperatures on the structure, impact strength, and hardness of the weld seams allowed us to construct a diagram of the optimum conditions. This diagram makes it possible to select the normalization temperature for different rates of induction heating according to the wall thickness of the pipe. 2. High frequency induction heating under optimum conditions results in complete phase transformations and diffusion processes, and this improves the structure and properties of the seam metal. 3. The application of optimum normalization conditions decreases the hardness and increases the impact strength of drilling pipes used in geological survey work by 100% and that of oil drilling pipes by 25-30%, the ultimate strength remaining the same. 4. The new technique of heat treating the weld seam-normalization with high frequency induction heating-is more effective than normalization by the old technique: intermediate frequency induction heating (50 Hz) while clamped in the butt welding machine. The new technique improves the quality of the pipes, increases the productivity 30%, and decreases the manufacturing cost by 25%. © 1965 Consultants Bureau.

It uses a mathematical model developed to simulate the thermal transient exchanged during the entire moulding cycle. the model is based on a 2D Fourier equation, uses an adaptive grid and describes the thermal contact resistance at mould/polymer interface. The cooling time and the interface temperature distribution are calculated from the computed temperature field in the domain under study. Experimental data, obtained with an instrumented tool during typical production conditions, is used to validate the developed model. the evaluation analysis is based on the Taguchi methodology used to rank the relative effective of the parameters on the selected variables (cooling time, temperature distribution and number of cycles to reach the thermal steady state).

AB  - Early‐life‐stage (ELS) toxicity tests were conducted to determine the effect of selected water temperatures on the toxicity of 4‐nitrophenol and 2,4‐dinitrophenol to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). NOECs were determined for growth and mortality at selected time intervals and water temperatures of 7, 12, and 17°C. As tests progressed, NOECs leveled to constant time‐independent values that were similar for tests at each temperature. In 4‐nitrophenol tests, the time‐independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17°C, respectively, were 1.16, 1.20, and 1.16 mg/L for growth and 3.40, 3.38, and 2.20 mg/L for mortality. For 2,4‐dinitrophenol, time‐independent NOEC values at 7, 12, and 17°C, respectively, were 1.07, 0.50, and 0.80 mg/L for growth and 1.30, 1.89, and 1.60 mg/L for mortality. Temperature did, however, affect the rate at which time‐independent NOECs were reached. More time was required to reach time‐independent NOECs as temperature decreased. For example, the time‐independent NOEC in 4‐nitrophenol tests at 17°C was reached in 14 d, whereas it required 42 d at 7°C. The effect of temperature on toxicity must be considered in hazard assessment protocols to assess risk accurately and protect aquatic organisms adequately. Chronic toxicity tests are necessary to assess risk because acute toxicity tests cannot provide the information necessary to predict the long‐term effects of factors such as temperature in natural environments.

AB  - Background: Bactericidal application of photosensitizers (PS) is a new and promising area. Up to now the action of PS against bacteria was studied without regard to immunocompetent cells, doses of drugs and radiation being used usually are not safe for such cells and therefore there is still no efficient model for PS application. Methods: Action of chlorin, a plant derived photosensitizer, on a system of interacting cells and microbes was studied. Cell monitoring was done with a photothermal microscopy method. The two bacteria used were gram-positive (S. aureus) and gram-negative (E. coli) in a mixture of basic blood cells and neutrophils. The latter were used to model phagocytosis as fast cell response reaction. Results: The strongest bactericidal effect was found when the cells and photoactivated chlorin act together. Selective bactericidal regime of PS application which does not affect cell viability was demonstrated. Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that this photosensitizer may enhance cell natural defense capabilities.

AB  - The capelin is a small pelagic fish that performs long distance migrations. It is a key species in the Barents Sea ecosystem and its distribution is highly climate dependent. Here we use an individual based model to investigate consequences of global warming on capelin distribution and population dynamics. The model relies on input on physics and plankton from a biophysical ocean model, and the entire life cycle of capelin including spawning of eggs, larval drift and adult movement is simulated. Spawning day and adult movement strategies are adapted by a genetic algorithm. Spawning has to take place in designated near-shore spawning areas. The output generated by the model is capelin migration/distribution and population dynamics. We present simulations with present day climate and a future climate scenario. For the present climate the model evolves a spatial distribution resembling typical spatial dynamics of capelin with the coasts of Northern Norway and Murman as the main spawning areas. For the climate change simulation, the capelin is predicted to shift spawning eastwards and also utilize new spawning areas along Novaya Zemlya. There is also a shift in the adult distribution towards the north eastern part of the Barents Sea and earlier spawning associated with the warming. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Live tissue surrogate is proposed, consisting of a filler, egg albumen, donor blood, and glycerol. When exposed to an Nd-YAG laser operating at a wavelength of 1064 nm in pulsed or permanent modes, the surrogate changes color, which allows one to determine the borderline parameters of radiation causing thermal necrosis and to select the optimal conditions of laser surgery. The sensitivity of the live tissue surrogate to the working power range is close to that of live tissue containing blood. ©1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - High-temperature liquid chromatography (termed pressurized hot water liquid chromatography, PHW-LC) is a form of high-performance LC (HPLC) that uses pure water as the eluent. It is distinguished from conventional HPLC in that solvent strength is increased by temperature rather than by organic solvents. The absence of organic solvents makes PHW-LC an environmentally benign technique, and high-temperature elution improves separation selectivity, efficiency and speed. Detector selection is also widened. We examine current instrumentation (including columns and detectors), chromatographic performance and various applications. Developments in this field have occurred mainly in column technology (hot water durable phases) and in detection (flame ionization detector and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of aging: Theoretical and practical implications from rattlesnakes
VL  - 15

AB  - Many reptiles live relatively long lives wherein senescence is postponed to an advanced age. Altering nutrition, reproduction, temperature, and other physiological parameters may favorably contribute to increased life spans. But life spans are also evolved characteristics of populations, and the distinctive longevities also result from selective regimes arising within particular environments. Aging is not favored directly by evolution as a way to clear a population of senescent individuals. Instead, aging is probably an indirect byproduct of selection for early physical vitality. Senescence may result from delayed appearance of deleterious genes later in life (mutation accumulation) or from multiple effects of single genes with overriding favorable effects early but coupled deleterious effects later in life (antagonistic pleiotropy) Both physiological and evolutionary causes contribute to species or even population-specific aging characteristics. Separating environmentally imposed mortality from that attributable to senescence has been aided by compiling maximum life spans of captive reptiles. Further understanding the underlying aging biology of reptiles would be aided by following mortalities of age cohorts, identifying differences in aging between populations, documenting the effects, favorable or not, of husbandry practices, and by characterizing senescence not just by mortality, but also by changes in age-related performance. Theoretical issues, inspired by experimental results in rattlesnakes, suggest conditions under which the chance mortalities of young rattlesnakes together with continued growth of adults might favor late appearance of beneficial genes and thereby account for postponed senescence in some reptiles. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Incompatible insect technique: Incompatible males from a Ceratitis capitata genetic sexing strain
VL  - 132

SP  - 232-240
AB  - Wolbachia are obligatory intracellular and maternally inherited bacteria that infect and spread through natural arthropod populations by inducing male-killing, feminization, parthenogenesis, and, most commonly, unidirectional and bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Cytoplasmic incompatibility can be used to control natural populations of insect pests, in a way analogous to the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), namely through the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT). For the successful application of the IIT (based on a unidirectional CI approach) against a target species, it is essential that only males are released, as the release of females would lead to fertile matings between the released males and the released females and the establishment of a Wolbachia-carrying field population. In the present study, we describe a Wolbachia-infected line of the VIENNA 8 genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), that carries the selectable marker temperature sensitive lethal (tsl). We show that (1) transferred Wolbachia induce high levels of CI even after the temperature treatment required for the male-only production, and (2) the Wolbachia-infected genetic sexing C. capitata line can be used in cage population suppression experiments analogous to the SIT. We also discuss our results in a comparison between IIT and SIT, investigating whether irradiation and cytoplasmic factors can be combined toward the development of novel strategies for insect pest control. © 2009 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

SP  - 769-773
AB  - With the aim to produce ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AsA-2-P) from L-ascorbic acid (AsA, Vitamin C), nine bacteria conferring the ability to transform AsA to AsA-2-P were isolated from soil samples alongside known strains from culture collections. Most isolates were classified to the genus Brevundimonas by 16S phylogenetic analysis. Among them, Brevundimonas diminuta KACC 10306 was selected as the experimental strain because of its the highest productivity of AsA-2-P. The optimum set of conditions for the AsA-2-P production from AsA using resting cells as the source of the enzyme was also investigated. The optimum cultivation time was 16 h and the cell concentration was 120 g/l (wet weight). The optimum concentrations of AsA and pyrophosphate were 550 mM and 450 mM, respectively. The most effective buffer was 50 mM sodium formate. The optimum pH was 4.5 and temperature was 40°C. Under the above conditions, 27.5 g/l of AsA-2-P was produced from AsA after 36 h of incubation, which corresponded to a 19.7% conversion efficiency based on the initial concentration of AsA. © The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

AB  - Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and depth preferences of Jocassee Reservoir rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta implanted with temperature-sensing radio transmitters were determined during July, August, and September 1994-1998. Specific knowledge of these preferences was needed to verify habitat criteria designed to assist in the management of water quality in this reservoir for trout survival in late summer and early fall. Rainbow trout exhibited temperature, dissolved oxygen, and depth preferences in the ranges 8.3-13.4 degreesC, 2.9-8.7 mg/L, and 30.0-52.0 m, respectively, while brown trout exhibited preferences in the ranges 7.5-21.9 degreesC, 4.2-10.0 mg/L, and 14.0-54.0 m, respectively. Even though rainbow trout selected cooler water temperatures and greater depths than brown trout. both species generally exhibited preferences for water 20 degreesC or cooler and containing 5.0 mg/L or more of dissolved oxygen. Maintenance of these criteria in Jocassee Reservoir should ensure adequate habitat for the summer and early fall survival of rainbow and brown trout.

TI  - Drug Insight: Role of the androgen receptor in the development and progression of prostate cancer
VL  - 4

SP  - 236-244
AB  - Functional androgen receptor (AR) signaling is necessary for the development of prostate cancer. The therapeutic effect of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer was described over 60 years ago and this treatment remains the mainstay of systemic therapy despite its transient response duration. It has become clear that AR expression and signaling remains intact as the disease evolves from androgen-sensitive cancer to classically (but perhaps inaccurately) termed hormone refractory prostate cancer. Through several genetic and epigenetic adaptations, prostate tumors continue to rely on AR growth signaling and they thus remain targets of 'hormonal' therapy. The development of new strategies and drugs that can abrogate AR signaling will probably result in important clinical benefits. The biology of androgen independence and the development of new approaches targeting AR signaling are reviewed herein.

TI  - Thermal activation of escape swimming in post-hatching Xenopus laevis frog larvae
VL  - 212
IS  - 15
SP  - 2356-2364
AB  - Survival requires the selection of appropriate behavioural responses in the face of danger. With respect to the threat of predation, both the decision to escape and the underlying neuronal mechanisms have been extensively studied, but processes that trigger evasion of abiotic stressors, which are potentially hazardous to survival, are less well understood. Here, we document the interplay between rhythmic locomotory and 'C-start' escape swimming in Xenopus frog larvae when exposed to hyperthermic conditions. As temperature rises, swim cycle frequency increases while swim bout duration decreases, until swimming can no longer be initiated by sensory stimuli. Above a critical higher temperature, more intense sequences of spontaneous high amplitude C-start escape activity occur. Each C-start is followed by a few cycles of fast rhythmic swimming in which activity alternates between the two sides. The initial, high amplitude ventral root burst of an escape sequence propagates rostrocaudally approximately threefold faster than subsequent cycles. The high conduction velocity of this initial burst is consistent with the activation of a Mauthner neuron, one of a pair of giant reticulospinal neurons in fish and amphibians. In support of the involvement of a Mauthner neuron, unilateral lesions of the caudal hindbrain eliminated escape activity on the operated side, but activity remained on the un-operated side. Behaviourally, tadpoles responded to temperature ramps with a sequence of C-start responses in which the body arced through similar to 130 degrees in 22 ms, followed by high frequency swimming. These results suggest that high temperature activates the Mauthner neurons to trigger C-start escape behaviour.

VL  - 129

SP  - 133-147
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster invaded Australia around 100 years ago, most likely through a northern invasion. The wide range of climatic conditions in eastern Australia across which D. melanogaster is now found provides an opportunity for researchers to identify traits and genes that are associated with climatic adaptation. Allozyme studies indicate clinal patterns for at least four loci including a strong linear cline in Adh and a non-linear cline in α-Gpdh. Inversion clines were initially established from cytological studies but have now been validated with larger sample sizes using molecular markers for breakpoints. Recent collections indicate that some genetic markers (Adh and In(3R)Payne) have changed over the last 20 years reflecting continuing evolution. Heritable clines have been established for quantitative traits including wing length/area, thorax length and cold and heat resistance. A cline in egg size independent of body size and a weak cline in competitive ability have also been established. Postulated clinal patterns for resistance to desiccation and starvation have not been supported by extensive sampling. Experiments under laboratory and semi-natural conditions have suggested selective factors generating clinal patterns, particularly for reproductive patterns over winter. Attempts are being made to link clinal variation in traits to specific genes using QTL analysis and the candidate locus approach, and to identify the genetic architecture of trait variation along the cline. This is proving difficult because of inversion polymorphisms that generate disequilibrium among genes. Substantial gaps still remain in linking clines to field selection and understanding the genetic and physiological basis of the adaptive shifts. However D. melanogaster populations in eastern Australia remain an excellent resource for understanding past and future evolutionary responses to climate change. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Snails from a heated zone of Par Pond of the U.S. Savannah River Plant were compared with conspecifies from an unheated area of the same reservoir. The heated area averaged 5°C warmer and was thermally more variabic than the control area. This situation has existed for about twenty years. Variation in metabolic response to temperature was observed according to season and heated vs unheated area. A laboratory rearing experiment indicated that part of the observed variation was environmetally induced. Life cycle and growth rates were similar in the two collection areas. Three generations were produced annually in both areas and spawning was synchronous except that the summer spawning period was shorter in the heated area. Live weights expressed relative to shell size were also similar, and decreased in both areas during summer. It appears from these results that metabolic compensation for temperature can serve as an indicator of general thermal adaptability, but only if the degree of environmental plasticity is known for the species. © 1978.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of a strain of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli var. fuscans (Xap), resistant to streptomycin sulphate, in common bean leaflets placed on the soil surface and buried at a depth of 10 and 15 cm. Four assays were carried out from November 1998 to December 2000 in Bandeirantes (Paraná, Brazil). The leaflets were collected every 15 days, crushed and the dilution-plated on a semi-selective medium. Under mild temperatures and low rainfall, Xap survived for 65 to 180 days in the leaflets on the soil surface, and for 30 to 120 days in those incorporated in the soil, regardless of the depth. When higher rainfall and temperatures occurred, the survival was from 45 to 60 days in the leaflets on the soil surface and from 30 to 45 days in those buried 10 or 15 cm deep.

AB  - Habitat use affects food intake, reproductive fitness and body temperature control in reptiles. Habitat use depends on both the characteristics of the animal and the environmental heterogeneity. In this study we investigated habitat use in a population of the South-American rattlesnake, Crotalus durissus, in a cerrado (the Brazilian savanna) remnant, in south-eastern Brazil. In general, snakes appeared to be thermal generalists. However, they showed substrate temperature preferences in the rainy season, when they selected colder substrates during the day and warmer substrates at night. Individuals were predominantly active on the surface and more frequently found under bushes. Furthermore, in general, the principal component analysis results indicate that rattlesnakes are generalists regarding the microhabitat variables examined in this study. These habitat characteristics, associated with a low thermal selectivity, indicate that rattlesnakes are able to colonize deforested areas where shade occurrence and vegetation cover are similar to those in the cerrado. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Clinal and seasonal variations in initial retention capacity of virgin Drosophila melanogaster females as a strategy for fitness
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
SP  - 223-242
AB  - The study of the first laboratory generation of isofemale lines of Drosophila melanogaster, founded by wild flies collected in populations of various geographical origins, has shown that virgin females differ in their capacity to control egg deposition. This capacity to delay the ovulation process when no sexual partner is available is genetically determined. The present study shows that the frequency distribution of the various phenotypes varies progressively along a latitudinal cline from Afrotropical to European regions, or from neotropical to nearctic areas, while a few oriental populations appear off the cline. This variation in initial retention capacity, added to a similar variation in number of ovarioles conditioning a potential increase in fecundity for mated flies, induces variation in reactivity to insemination which may be an adaptation to a variable environment. Moreover, similar study of F1 virgin females from isofemale lines founded by wild flies collected in Spring, Summer and Autumn in two French populations over ten successive years revealed that seasonal genetic variations occur in this capacity to postpone egg-laying in case of non-insemination. The frequency of the different phenotypes follows cyclical seasonal variations. Long retention phenotypes are more frequent in Spring and Autumn samples, whereas short retention phenotypes, closer to the ancestral African type, are more common in Summer generations. This balancing selection temporarily modifies the genetic equilibrium of the population, enhancing its competitive ability. Temperature appears to be the primordial selective factor both in geographical and in seasonal variations. © 1992 Chapman & Hall.

VL  - 83

SP  - 171-184
AB  - A new culture, Leuconostoc carnosum 4010, for biopreservation of vacuum-packed meats is described. The culture originated from bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) naturally present in vacuum-packed meat products. Approximately, 72,000 colonies were isolated from 48 different vacuum-packed meat products and examined for antibacterial activity. Bacteriocin-producing colonies were isolated from 46% of the packages examined. Leuc. carnosum was the predominant bacteriocin-producing strain and Leuc. carnosum 4010 was selected for further experiments because it showed strong antilisterial activity without producing any undesirable flavour components in meat products. For identification of the bacteriocins produced, partial purification was carried out by ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialysis, and cation exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two bands with inhibitory activity corresponding to molecular sizes of 4.6 and 5.3 kDa. N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that Leuc. carnosum 4010 produced two bacteriocins highly similar or identical to leucocin A and leucocin C. Application experiments showed that the addition of 107 cfu/g Leuc. carnosum 4010 to a vacuum-packaged meat sausage immediately reduced the number of viable Listeria monocytogenes cells to a level below the detection limit and no increase of L. monocytogenes was observed during storage at 5°C for 21 days. The results presented demonstrate that Leuc. carnosum 4010 is suitable as a new protective culture for cold-stored, cooked, sliced, and vacuum-packed meat products. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

VL  - 90

SP  - 1709
AB  - The role of early life stages (eggs, neonates, and juveniles) for population persistence in long-lived organisms is thought to be minor. However, few long-term data sets are available to test this assumption. Variation in vital rates over space and time and the potential for the success of early life stages to shape adult reproductive behavior evolutionarily suggest that more thorough consideration of these life stages is necessary. In particular, the impact of climatic variation on early life-stage recruitment is not well understood. Furthermore, predation occupies a significant role in theoretical models of population dynamics, but its impact on populations through variable vital rates of early life stages is unknown. Maternal nest-site choice, an important component of nesting ecology, may influence many offspring traits and respond to selection to optimize offspring success. Overall, we have limited information regarding the long-term patterns of natural fluctuations in the nesting ecology and hatchling recruitment of populations of long-lived organisms. The research site for this ongoing long-term project is on an island in the Mississippi River near Thomson, Illinois, USA. Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) have been studied extensively at this location since 1989 to examine the ecology and potential demographic consequences of nest-site choice and depredation, with the aim of understanding the evolution of maternal nesting behavior and its effects on offspring phenotype. We monitored the site every day of the nesting season each year to record nesting and depredation events. The data presented here include nesting phenology, nest vegetation cover, total number of nesting events, clutch size, depredation, and hatchling survival. Portions of this data set have been used to address related questions in ecology and evolutionary biology. In particular, climatic variation influences the probability of nest depredation events. Such events are typically nonrandom, primarily occurring adjacent to habitat edges. Because habitat edges may have atypical vegetation composition and vegetation influences nest temperature, such nonrandom depredation could influence offspring recruitment and, hence, population structure. Given the unique scope and accessibility of this data set, researchers and teachers should find it to be a valuable empirical resource for exploring important facets of nesting ecology and hatchling recruitment in a wild population of a long-lived species. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.

SP  - 187-196
AB  - The cellar population of Drosophila melanogaster at the Chateau Tahbilk Winery (Victoria, Australia) was perturbed for alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene frequencies. Phenol oxidase (Phox) frequencies were also perturbed and monitored as a control. Subsequent gene frequency changes, together with information on population structure, indicated that selection acted on the chromosome regions of both loci. Adh gene frequencies returned to preperturbation levels in a predictable manner. A model in which the relative fitness of Adh phenotypes was determined by temperature-dependent specific activities of enzymes of Adh genotypes adequately accounts for the rate of gene frequency change at this locus. Thus temperature behaves as a selective agent in modulating Adh gene frequencies in this cellar environment. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

VL  - 11

SP  - 2009-2015
AB  - Global warming increasingly pressures species to show adaptive migratory responses. We hypothesized that warming increases invasion of alpine lakes by low-elevation montane zooplankton by suppressing native competitors and predators. This hypothesis was tested by conducting a two-factor experiment, consisting of a warming treatment (13 vs. 20°C) crossed with three invasion levels (alpine only, alpine + montane, montane only), in growth chambers over a 28-day period. Warming significantly reduced total consumer biomass owing to the decline of large alpine species, resulting in greater autotrophic abundance. Significant temperature-invasion interactions occurred as warming suppressed alpine zooplankton, while stimulating certain imported species. Herbivorous invaders suppressed functionally similar alpine species while larger native omnivores reduced invasion by smaller taxa. Warming did not affect total invader biomass because imported species thrived under ambient and warmed alpine conditions. Our findings suggest that the adaptability of remote alpine lake communities to global warming is limited by species dispersal from lower valleys, or possibly nearby warmer alpine ponds. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 66
IS  - 1
SP  - 101-122
AB  - When the eggs of the skin parasitic monogenean Entobdella soleae are subjected in the laboratory to alternating periods of light and darkness (LD 12:12, LD 6:18 or LD 18:6) at constant temperature (selected from the range 12–16 °C), hatching is rhythmical, most of the oncomiracidia emerging during the first 4 h of the period of illumination on each successive day. 2. Rhythmicity in response to alternating 12 h periods of light and darkness persists in a wide range of lighting conditions including natural daylight and in dim blue light, the latter being similar in intensity (65 nW/cm2) and in spectral quality to light at the depths where the host Solea solea lives. 3. The hatching rhythm persists with a periodicity of about 24 h in constant darkness and in constant light, provided that the eggs have been exposed previously to LD 12:12 until hatching begins. This indicates that there is a strong endogenous component to the rhythm. 4. Eggs laid and maintained in total darkness develop and hatch, but the oncomiracidia may emerge at any time during each 24 h period and there is little evidence of rhythmicity. 5. When alternate 12 h periods of light and (darkness are reversed after the commencement of hatching, the hatching pattern also reverses after 24 h, so that emergence of larvae occurs at the beginning of the new illumination period. 6. Mechanical disturbance plays little or no part as a hatching stimulus. 7. Larvae, which had emerged from their eggs at some time between 20 and 80 min previously, responded to host skin, suggesting that an initial uninfective period is of short duration or absent. 8. Hatching soon after dawn may have high survival value for E. soleae in view of the host's activity pattern; soles are active at night and partly bury themselves in the sediment (where the eggs of the parasite lie) at dawn, and the fish is inactive and a stationary target during the day. © 1973, Cambridge University Press.

VL  - 150
IS  - 1

AB  - Adaptation potential of forests to rapid climatic changes can be assessed from vegetation dynamics during past climatic changes as preserved in fossil pollen data. However, pollen data reflect the integrated effects of climate and biotic processes, such as establishment, survival, competition, and migration. To disentangle these processes, we compared an annually laminated late Würm and Holocene pollen record from the Central Swiss Plateau with simulations of a dynamic forest patch model. All input data used in the simulations were largely independent from pollen data; i.e. the presented analysis is non-circular. Temperature and precipitation scenarios were based on reconstructions from pollen-independent sources. The earliest arrival times of the species at the study site after the last glacial were inferred from pollen maps. We ran a series of simulations under different combinations of climate and immigration scenarios. In addition, the sensitivity of the simulated presence/absence of four major species to changes in the climate scenario was examined. The pattern of the pollen record could partly be explained by the used climate scenario, mostly by temperature. However, some features, in particular the absence of most species during the late Würm could only be simulated if the winter temperature anomalies of the used scenario were decreased considerably. Consequently, we had to assume in the simulations, that most species immigrated during or after the Younger Dryas (12 000 years BP), Abies and Fagus even later. Given the timing of tree species immigration, the vegetation was in equilibrium with climate during long periods, but responded with lags at the time-scale of centuries to millennia caused by a secondary succession after rapid climatic changes such as at the end of Younger Dryas, or immigration of dominant taxa. Climate influenced the tree taxa both directly and indirectly by changing inter-specific competition. We concluded, that also during the present fast climatic change, species migration might be an important process, particularly if geographic barriers, such as the Alps are in the migrational path. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

VL  - 23

AB  - A one-dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir model is coupled with a stochastic fish population model to examine the impacts of cold water pollution (CWP) on the Australian freshwater fish, Murray cod, downstream of Hume Dam, Australia. Mitigation of CWP through the introduction of selective withdrawal capabilities to access near-surface water is predicted to increase discharge temperatures during the crucial spring-early summer post-spawning period by 4-6°C for normal operating conditions, that is, a full reservoir in early spring. No improvement in discharge temperature was predicted for drought conditions characterized by relatively low storage levels in early spring. The predicted temperature increase using selective withdrawal increased the predicted average minimum female population abundance by 30-300% depending on the assumed spawning behaviour. Increased discharge temperatures appear to be achievable and are expected to reduce the stress currently impacting Murray cod populations due to CWP during crucial post-spawning periods. This provides evidence that mitigation of this problem may assist in rehabilitating Murray cod populations in the Murray River downstream of Hume Dam. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Application of genetic algorithm to determination of intrinsic parameters and optimization of a batch chromatographic process for 1,3-propanediol purification
VL  - 31
IS  - 14
SP  - 2053-2076
AB  - A recent adaptation of genetic algorithm, NSGA-II-JG, was applied systematically to each key task to be completed for developing an optimal batch chromatographic process for 1,3-propanediol purification. The genetic algorithm was used first in the task of determining intrinsic parameters such as adsorption isotherms and mass transfer coefficient. For such parameters determination, we adopted an inverse method, which is to acquire intrinsic parameters by a least square fitting of the proposed column model to the experimentally measured elution profile. At this stage, the genetic algorithm plays a part in searching the values of intrinsic parameters that lead to the minimum difference between the experimental and the model predicted elution profiles. In the next stage, the genetic algorithm was applied to optimize a series of operating parameters, which include flow rate, feed loading volume, starting and ending times of product collection, and the time of gap between adjacent two feed injections. Such optimization, which aims for the highest productivity under the constraints of product purity and pressure drop, was repeated by varying adsorbent particle size. The optimization results confirmed that the productivity for small particles was limited by the pressure drop, whereas the productivity for large particles was limited by the mass transfer efficiency (or column efficiency). In consequence, the optimal particle size for the maximum productivity falls on the boundary between the two limiting regions. The results of this study indicate that the application of genetic algorithm is effective in each stage of a batch chromatographic process development, which covers from parameter estimation to process optimization.

AB  - The natural population of Drosophila subobscura of Mt. Parnes has been followed for two successive years and the frequency of the gene arrangements determined. Some changes occured in the first year but do not explain the existence of the geographical clines for these frequencies. Within the second year no changes were observed. For chromosomes J and U there is evidence for a greater fitness of the heterozygotes. Experiments on temperature effect on viability of adult male flies, on their temporal sterility, on the viability of flies during all their biological cycle and experiments on the effect of dryness on the viability of adult male flies did not show an important change of gene arrangement frequencies in the resistant individuals. Nor did diapausing females have very different gene arrangements, except for chromosome O. Cage experiments with temperature as a selective agent did not elucidate the action of this factor. It is concluded that temperature or dryness do not affect very much the polymorphic system, nor explain the existence of these clines. This polymorphic system is much more stable in D. subobscura than in D. pseudoobscura, its nearctic relative. It is also richer. It is concluded that it is historically older and helps the populations to cope with many environmental changes. © 1967 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde is highly exothermic and reactors are operated with a hot spot in the range of 100 {ring operator} C above the desired operating temperature, which can affect selectivity considerably and can also reduce the catalyst life. Nitrogen-diluted air is a common feed gas but by replacing the nitrogen for a gas with a substantially higher heat capacity, the heat evolution may be more efficiently controlled. In this work, we have studied the potential of propane as a substitute for nitrogen. According to a simple reactor model using current commercial conditions as a "base" case, substituting propane for nitrogen could increase productivity by as much as 50%. Furthermore, propane would be safer to use because the gas mixture would be further away from the flammable region versus current operation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the northern acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, polymorphism at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) locus appears to be maintained by distinct selection regimes that vary between intertidal microhabitats. The goal of the present experiment was to elucidate the mechanism of selection at the Mpi locus by examining the relationship between genotype and fitness-related life-history traits in laboratory manipulations. When barnacles were cultured on a mannose-supplemented diet and exposed to thermal stress, different Mpi genotypes exhibited differences in the rate of growth that predicted survivorship. In contrast, no such relationship was observed in control or fructose-supplemented dietary treatments either in the presence or in the absence of stress. Similarly, the phenotype and survivorship of genotypes at another allozyme locus and a presumably neutral mitochondrial DNA marker were homogeneous across all treatments and unaffected by experimental manipulations. These results suggest that the differential survivorship of Mpi genotypes in the field and laboratory results from a differential ability to process mannose-6-phosphate through glycolysis. The widespread polymorphism at Mpi observed in marine taxa may reflect the interaction between dietary composition and environmental heterogeneity in intertidal habitats.

VL  - 131

SP  - 591-598
AB  - Spawning date is a crucial life history trait in fishes, linking parents to their offspring, and it is highly heritable in salmonid fishes. We examined the spawning dates of coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and chinook salmon O. tshawytscha at the University of Washington (UW) Hatchery for trends over time. We then compared the spawning date patterns with the changing thermal regime of the Lake Washington basin and the spawning patterns of conspecifics at two nearby hatcheries. The mean spawning dates of both species have become earlier over the period of record at the UW Hatchery (since the 1950s for chinook salmon and the 1960s for coho salmon), apparently because of selection in the hatchery. Countering hatchery selection for earlier spawning are the increasingly warmer temperatures experienced by salmon migrating in freshwater to, and holding at, the hatchery. Spawning takes place even earlier at the Soos Creek Hatchery, the primary ancestral source of the UW populations, and at the Issaquah Creek Hatchery. Both species of salmon have experienced marked shifts towards earlier spawning at Soos Creek and Issaquah Creek hatcheries despite the expectation that warmer water would lead to later spawning. Thus, inadvertent selection at all three hatcheries appears to have resulted in progressively earlier spawning, overcoming selection from countervailing temperature trends. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Delayed response to irreversible non-genetic adaptation to salinity in early development of the brachyuran crab rhithropanopeus harrisii and some notes on adaptation to temperature
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 97-112
AB  - In the first series of experiments the embryos of the estuarine crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii (Gould) were acclimated to either a low (10 ‰) or a high (30 ‰) salinity at the cyclic temperature 25 to 30 °C. After hatch each of the four zoeal stages and the megalopa stage was subjected to either an increase in salinity from 10 to 35 ‰ or a decrease from 30 to 5 ‰ and reared to the first crab stage. Increase of salinity at each of the zoeal stages did not seem to have any effect on mortality or time of development during those stages. There was, however, a significant increase of mortality in subsequent pre-metamorphic and metamorphic moults and the developmental time significantly increased between these two moults. Similar effects occurred when 20 ‰ S was used instead of 10 ‰ S. The greatest effects were observed when the salinity was increased in the third or fourth zoeal stages. The increase of salinity at the zoeal stages also caused the megalopa to develop abnormally. If the increase of salinity occurred at the megalopa stage it had no obvious effect on the mortality of that stage. A decrease in salinity from 30 to 5 ‰ did not have any obvious effect on survival of the larvae during any of the stages. The delayed response to increased salinity is suggested to be caused by a disturbance induced at intermoult stages at the time for salinity change. The first development of systems that should be functional at the megalopa stage occurs during the zoeal stages. The ‘delayed response effect’ suggests that oceanic water (i.e., high salinity) is a deterrent to successful larval dispersal of R. harrisii between estuaries. In a second series of experiments the crab embryos were acclimated to various salinity and temperature combinations, which in some cases were changed immediately after hatch and then kept constant up to the first crab stage. A cyclic temperature of 30 to 35 °C was lethal to almost all larvae at 5 or 35 ‰ S, irrespective of whether they were acclimated to a high or low salinity before hatching. In a cyclic temperature of 25 to 30 °C, 60 percent or more of the larvae metamorphosed at those same salinities, except those embryos acclimated to a high salinity (30 ‰) and transferred to 5 ‰ through hourly changes of 5 ‰-steps, all of which died in the first zoeal stage. Resistance adaptation of the crab embryos to high temperatures prolonged the survival in high temperatures through later larval stages compared to when the embryos were acclimated in lower temperatures. In high temperatures, as in high salinities, the pre-metamorphic and metamorphic moults were the most critical. © 1979 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of activation gas type (CO, syngas and H-2), activation temperature and pressure on FTS activity and selectivity. A series of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reactions in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for 400-1000 h were carried using a Fe/K/Si = 100/1.25/5.1 (atomic ratio) catalyst. The highest CO conversion was obtained for a CO activated catalyst while hydrogen activation yielded the lowest, regardless of the activation temperature. A higher activation temperature yielded a higher peak CO conversion during the induction period. FTS activity for syngas pretreatment showed a dependency on the activation pressure. In addition to the FTS activity, CO activation showed the best overall hydrocarbon productivity. The lowest hydrocarbon production rate was obtained with the H activated catalyst. Carbon monoxide activation also yielded the lowest methane selectivity and activation temperature did not affect the CH4 selectivity in the range of 230-270 degreesC. Activation temperature had little effect on the formation of olefin (C-2-C-20) and the olefin fraction decreased in the order of H-2>syngas>CO activation. The induction period was present following each of the three pretreatments: CO, H-2, or syngas with the same H-2/CO ratio as used during the synthesis period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

VL  - 82
IS  - 3
SP  - 203-217
AB  - Metabolic functions are generally optimized within a narrow range of body temperatures (Tb's), conferring thermoregulation great importance to the survival and fitness of an animal. In lizards, Tb regulation is mainly behavioral, and the metabolic costs associated with behavioral thermoregulation are primarily locomotory. In reptiles, however, it has been proposed that they thermoregulate less precisely when the associated costs, metabolic or otherwise, are high. Such a strategy enhances fitness by allowing lizards to be more flexible to changing environmental conditions while maximizing the benefits of maintaining a high Tb and minimizing energy expenditure. We evaluated the behavioral thermoregulation of inland bearded dragons Po- gona vitticeps under various thermal quality conditions requiring different locomotory investment for thermoregulation. The selected ambient temperature and preferred Tb ranges increased at lower environmental thermal qualities, indicating a decrease in thermoregulatory precision in environments where the costs associated with thermoregulation were high. The level of ther- moregulation was also affected, exhibiting a decrease in preferred Tb of ∼2°C at the lowest-thermal-quality treatment. These data provide important implications for the procedural assessment of preferred Tb and a better understanding of thermal set points in reptiles in general. Our results emphasize that the precise maintenance and assessment of preferred Tb is contingent on the quality of the environment, laboratory or natural, that the animal inhabits. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 256
IS  - 1
AB  - Goldfish were either subjected to anoxia for 5 h at 10°C, normoxia for 5 h at 10°C, or were implanted with an intracranial microinjection cannula. All groups were subsequently tested in a temperature gradient. The previously anoxic goldfish selected cooler temperatures (12.8 ± 1.0°C; mean ± SE) than the corresponding normoxic control group (17.5 ± 0.7°C) for the first 20 min in the gradient. Intracranial microinjections of 0.0475 ng ethanol in 0.2 μl 0.7% NaCl led to the immediate selection of water 8.7 ± 1.5°C below that of base-line levels, whereas control animals injected with 0.7% NaCl selected water 0.9 ± 1.0°C cooler. Increased effects were obtained with higher concentrations of ethanol. The effective site was limited to the anterior aspect of the nucleus preopticus periventricularis; injections into 54 other loci were without effect. Goldfish tolerate anoxia by the conversion of lactate to ethanol, which diffuses across the gills. As the lost ethanol cannot be oxidatively metabolized, this process is energetically inefficient. Because the concentration of the ethanol injections was considerably lower than reported ethanol concentrations in the tissue of anoxic goldfish, endogenously produced ethanol may have induced the selection of cooler water by the anoxic goldfish. This alteration in thermoregulatory behavior would lead to a lower metabolic rate, significantly increasing survival time during anoxia.

SP  - 473-482
AB  - Altitudinal changes in traits and genetic markers can complement the studies on latitudinal patterns and provide evidence of natural selection because of climatic factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation is well known but altitudinal patterns have rarely been investigated. Here, we examine five traits and five genetic markers on chromosome 3R in D. melanogaster collected at high and low altitudes from five latitudes along the eastern coast of Australia. Significant altitudinal differentiation was observed for cold tolerance, development time, ovariole number in unmated females, and the microsatellite marker DMU25686. Differences tended to match latitudinal patterns, in that trait values at high altitudes were also found at high latitudes, suggesting that factors linked to temperature are likely selective agents. Cold tolerance was closely associated with average temperature and other climatic factors, but no significant associations were detected for the other traits. Genes around DMU25686 represent good candidates for climatic adaptation. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Permittivity was studied as a function of temperature and concentration for selected phospholipids in chloroform. Reduced lecithin, egg lecithin, and plant lecithin were used in this study to provide a range of properties in fatty-acid chain composition. In the concentration studies, the nonlinear dependence of permittivity on concentration (in certain concentration limits) was noted and discussed as to the possibility of changes in state of aggregation with dilution. Permittivity was studied as a function of temperature for solutions of reduced lecithin in chloroform. Concentrations of reduced lecithin in chloroform were chosen in such a way that temperature studies were carried out in both linear and nonlinear regions of dependence of permittivity on concentration. In the temperature studies, permittivity was studied as a function of inverse absolute temperature. The slopes of these linear plots were calculated and changes in the slopes with changing concentration were discussed as to the possibility of a change in aggregation with dilution in chloroform. © 1971.

VL  - 59
IS  - 2
SP  - 372-382
AB  - The relative importance of size-selective mortality, density-dependent growth, and temperature on growth of a commercial fish population was investigated using an integrated statistical analysis. Two indices of size-selective mortality were determined using otolith backcalculations. One index measured the direct effect on population mean growth increments in the year of the growth increment. The second index measured the cumulative effect on the growth potential of a cohort. Indices of population density, occupied temperature, and bottom temperature were developed from annual synoptic research vessel surveys of the population. We simultaneously tested effects of these factors using a modified von Bertalanffy growth model. The strongest effect was variation in size-selective mortality, followed by a negative effect of population density and a weak positive effect of occupied temperature. Effects of bottom temperature conditions were not significant. Failure to simultaneously consider alternative mechanisms, especially size-selective mortality, can lead to incorrect conclusions about the role of environmental factors in determining growth of fishes.

VL  - 274
IS  - 1619
SP  - 1693-1699
AB  - Neither the scale of adaptive variation nor the genetic basis for differential population responses to the environment is known for broadcast-spawning marine fishes. Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we document how larval growth, survival and their norms of reaction differ genetically among four populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). These traits, and their plastic responses to food and temperature, differed across spatial scales at which microsatellite DNA failed to detect population structure. Divergent survival reaction norms indicate that warm-water populations are more sensitive to changes in food, whereas cold-water populations are more sensitive to changes in temperature. Our results suggest that neither the direction nor the magnitude of demographic responses to environmental change need be the same among populations. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity, previously undocumented in marine fishes, can significantly influence the probability of recovery and persistence of collapsed populations by affecting their ability to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. © 2007 The Royal Society.

TI  - Environmental adaptation of probiotic lactobacilli towards improvement of performance during spray drying
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SP  - 183-190
AB  - The potential of environmental adaptation as a survival mechanism enabling a human-derived probiotic Lactobacillus strain to withstand heat stress and spray drying was investigated. Heat-adapted (52 degreesC for 15 min) L. paracasei NFBC 338 exhibited 300- and 700-fold greater thermotolerance (survival at a lethal temperature of 60 degreesC) compared with controls, in. MRS and reconstituted skim milk (RSM), respectively. The level of thermal protection in RSM by pre-adaptation in hydrogen peroxide (0.003 M), salt (0.3 M NaCl) and bile salts (0.1% w/v) was also examined. Although not as efficient as the homologous stress, the levels of cross protection were in the order heat > salt > hydrogen peroxide > bile. Viability of the heat-adapted L. paracasei NFBC 338 in RSM was enhanced 18-fold during spray drying at outlet temperatures of 95-105 degreesC, while salt-adapted cultures exhibited 16-fold greater viability than controls. These results highlight the potential of preconditioning treatments for maximizing survival of probiotic bacteria during development of probiotic functional foods. The cross protection afforded by salt against thermal stress may indicate that certain common protective mechanisms are induced by both heat and salt stress. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Complementary uses of ecological and biochemical genetic data in identifying and conserving salmon populations
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 59-76
AB  - This paper addresses the need to define distinct population segments within species of salmonid fishes. The paper focuses on identifying the smallest detectable population with unique sets of characters (i.e. a 'species' under the phylogenetic species concept); such units require identification before any subsequent groupings under which individual populations may ultimately be managed. Stream distance measurements between populations fail to identify ancestral discontinuities and are therefore excluded as a basis for estimating relationships. The requirement for genetic information in distinguishing populations has been met through characters reflecting ancestral lineages (including adequate biochemical genetic surveys and congruent meristic information), and those reflecting local adaptations (such as timings of migration and spawning, and distinct temperature tolerances). These different types of genetic information form complementary data sets for distinguishing populations because they reflect different evolutionary processes and time scales. Within distinct ancestral groupings defined by biochemical genetic data may exist adaptively distinct populations that cannot be distinguished in the absence of life history and ecological information. Examples are summarized in which a logical process has been applied for distinguishing populations; this includes an initial survey that focuses on identifying ancestral groupings followed by a systematic search for adaptive distinctions within these groupings. © 1993.

VL  - 14

SP  - 104-110
AB  - Juvenile blue crabs, Callinectes sapidusRathbun, were grown in the laboratory at different temperatures, and metabolic-rate determinations were made. Growth is shown to be dependent upon temperature. Crabs kept at high temperatures (34° and 27°C) grow faster than those kept at lower temperatures (13°, 15°, and 20°C). Increase in size per molt is less at higher temperatures than at lower ones. Mortality is directly proportional to temperature between 13° and 34°C and is very high during ecdysis at elevated temperatures. Metabolic rate increases with temperature, but various degrees of acclimation are seen after 4 weeks exposure. No acclimation of general activity to temperature was found. The findings are applied theoretically to crabs living in the region of heated discharge canals of electrical generators: the motile blue crab could extend its growing season without decreasing size at maturity by active selection of thermal surroundings. © 1972 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Sex determination and temperature-induced sex differentiation in three natural populations of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) adapted to extreme temperature conditions
VL  - 272
SP  - S3-S16
AB  - As a species of major interest for aquaculture, the sex determination system (SDS) of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, has been widely investigated. In this species, sex determination is considered to be governed by the interactions between a complex system of genetic sex determination factors (GSD) and the influence of temperature (TSD) during a critical period. Previous studies were exclusively carried out on domestic stocks with the genetic and maintenance limitations associated. Given the wide distribution and adaptation potential of the Nile tilapia, we investigated under controlled conditions the sex determination system of natural populations adapted to three extreme thermal regimes: stable extreme environments in Ethiopia, either cold temperatures in a highland lake (Lake Koka), or warm temperatures in hydrothermal springs (Lake Metahara), and an environment with large seasonal variations in Ghana (Kpandu, Lake Volta). The sex ratio analysis was conducted on progenies reared under constant basal (27 degrees C) or high (36 degrees C) temperatures during the 30 days following yolk-sac resorption. Sex ratios of the progenies reared at standard temperature suggest that the three populations share a similar complex GSD system based on a predominant male heterogametic factor with additional influences of polymorphism at this locus and/or action of minor factors. The three populations presented a clear thermosensitivity of sex differentiation, with large variations in the intensity of response depending on the parents. This confirms the presence of genotype-environment interactions in TSD of Nile tilapia. Furthermore the existence of naturally sex-reversed individuals is strongly suggested in two populations (Kpandu and Koka). However, it was not possible here to infer if the sex-inversion resulted from minor genetic factors and/or environmental influences. The present study demonstrated for the first time the conservation of a complex SDS combining polymorphic GSD and TSD components in natural populations of Nile tilapia. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our findings and highlight the importance of field investigations of sex determination. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Daily temperatures and snowfall were related to coronary and stroke deaths in selected standard metropolitan statistical areas for the 5-year period 1962-1966. Typically an inverse approximately linear pattern of coronary heart disease (CHD) and of stroke mortality with temperature was seen over the greater part of the temperature range, with mortality reaching a low for days with average Fahrenheit temperatures in the 60's and 70's (15.6-26.6 C). and then rising sharply at higher temperatures. Snowfall was found to be associated with higher CHD and stroke mortality for a 5- or 6-day period. Temperatures 1 and 2 days prior to death were also found to be associated with deaths from CHD and stroke. Very hot days appeared to exert a cumulative effect upon mortality in many of the areas. © 1976 by The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health.

AB  - The capacity to delay egg deposition in D. melanogaster females in the absence of a sexual partner is genetically determined and opposite types can be artificially selected. In natural populations, the relative frequency of these genotypes varies geographically and seasonally, with temperature as a selective factor. However, the retention duration of these genotypes can be modified by developmental temperature change. To study the genetic control of this response, chromosome substitution between opposite types of line was carried out in order to produce every possible homozygous chromosomsal combination of the three major chromosomes (X,2,3). Eggs of these eight constructed lines were developed at two different temperatures (25 degrees C and 14 degrees C). Low temperature development directly affected the number of ovarioles but also modified the subsequent expression of adult characteristics such as retention duration and fecundity. The comparison of the eight lines revealed that, although the 3 chromosomes were involved in the genetic determinism of each trait, only one or two of them were sensitive to temperature change, and these differed according to the trait. For retention duration and fecundity, the effect of chromosome 3 from the long retention strain was particularly affected by low temperature, showing antagonism between the selective effect detected in natural populations and the effect on phenotypic plasticity studied here.

TI  - Physiological community ecology: Variation in metabolic activity of ecologically important rocky intertidal invertebrates along environmental gradients
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
SP  - 862-871
AB  - Rocky intertidal invertebrates live in heterogeneous habitats characterized by steel) gradients in wave activity, tidal flux, temperature, food quality and food availability. These environmental factors impact metabolic activity via changes in energy input and stress-induced Iteration of energetic demands. For keystone species, small environmentally induced shifts in metabolic activity may lead to disproportionately large impacts on community structure via changes in growth or survival of these key species. Here we use biochemical indicators to assess how natural differences in wave exposure, temperature and food availability may affect metabolic activity of mussels, barnacles, whelks and sea stars living at rocky intertidal sites with different physical and oceanographic characteristics. We show that oxygen consumption rate is correlated with the activity of key metabolic enzymes (e.g., citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) for some intertidal species, and concentrations of these enzymes in certain tissues are lower for starved individvials than for those that are well fed. We also show that the ratio of RNA to DNA (an index of protein synthetic capacity) is highly variable in nature and correlates with short-term changes in food availability. We also observed striking patterns in enzyme activity and RNA/DNA in nature, which are related to differences in rocky intertidal community structure. Differences among species and habitats are most pronounced in summer and are linked to high nearshore productivity at sites favored by suspension feeders and to exposure to stressful low-tide air temperatures in areas of low wave splash. These studies illustrate the great promise of using biochemical indicators to test ecological models, which predict changes in community structure along environmental gradients. Our results also suggest that biochemical indices must be carefully validated with laboratory studies, so that the indicator selected is likely to respond to the environmental variables of interest.

TI  - Electronic Raman spectroscopy of the vanadium(III) hexaaqua cation in guanidinium vanadium sulphate: Quintessential manifestation of the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect
VL  - 122
IS  - 12
AB  - Single-crystal Raman spectra are presented for the salt [C (N H2) 3] [V (O H2) 6] (S O4) 2, displaying electronic transitions between the trigonal components of the vanadium(III) T 1g 3 (Oh) ground term. The A3 → E3 (C3) electronic Raman band is centered at ~2720 cm-1, and exhibits extensive structure, revealing the energies of the spinor components of the E3 (C3) term for the two crystallographically distinct [V (O H2) 6] 3+ cations. The data are interpreted in conjunction with parameters previously reported from an electron paramagnetic resonance study of the salt. A satisfactory reproduction of the electronic Raman profile and ground-state spin-Hamiltonian parameters is achieved by employing a (A3 ⊗ E3) ⊗e vibronic coupling model, in which the spin-orbit splitting of the E3 (C3) is quenched significantly by the Ham effect, and the intensity of harmonics of the Jahn-Teller active vibration enhanced by their proximity to the electronic Raman bands. The model gives an excellent account of the intensities of the electronic Raman bands, which are shown to depend profoundly on both temperature and the selected component of the polarizability tensor. The electronic Raman profile changes notably upon deuteriation, a result that exposes deficiencies in the single-mode coupling model. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

VL  - 1

SP  - 135-148
AB  - Few ecosystems provide better opportunities for the study of evolution and speciation than those inhabiting the uppermost parts of the high east African mountains. These mountains are mainly of volcanic origin and lie widely scattered across the wide plateaux of east Africa, several of them reaching altitudes between 3500 and 6000 m. Their vegetation deviates very much from that of the intervening lower country, displaying a marked zonation with a montane forest belt, a (subalpine) ericaceous belt, and an afroalpine belt. The flora of the latter, the afroalpine flora, is of exceptional interest in this connection. The afroalpine flora is famous for its large numbers of geographically vicarious taxa–its Giant Senecios and Giant Lobelias are as renowned as the finches of the Galapagos Islands. Ecologically, the afroalpine biota is indeed also an island biota–the high mountain summits protrude as isolated temperate islands above the warm surrounding plains. These mountains have evidently stood isolated from each other since their origin. Pleistocene climatic changes have certainly modified their vegetation zonation to a considerable extent, but direct contacts between their afroalpine enclaves during the Pleistocene or earlier seem most improbable. These enclaves must therefore have been isolated from each other and from other high mountain areas for a very long time, and dispersal of plants between them must presumably have occurred mainly by long distance transport, possibly facilitated by cyclones. Some 80% of the afroalpine species of vascular plants are endemic to the high mountains of tropical east Africa and Ethiopia. Vicarious taxa occur of different status. In some cases one species occurs on all or most of the east African mountains with a vicariad in other parts of the world, as exemplified by Subulariamonticola (afroalpine) and S. aquatica (circumboreal). In other cases each of two species is confined to one group of mountains, as in the species pair Lobelia wollastonii (Virunga Volcanoes and Ruwenzori) and L. telekii (Elgon, Aberdare, Mt Kenya). Finally, there are several groups of vicarious taxa where each taxon is confined as a rule to a single mountain, as in the Lobelia deckenii group with six cognate species. Numerous similar cases occur among spiders and insects. The differentiation of these vicarious species is assumed to have occurred through natural selection in connection with genetic drift, acting upon geographically isolated and originally very small random samples of the gene pools concerned. The amount of differentiation between different mountain populations differs considerably between different groups–numerous intermediate stages exist between morphologically indistinguishable populations and full‐fledged vicarious species. The rate of evolutionary change seems to differ considerably between different genera and families. Whether internal barriers to interbreeding exist between these vicarious taxa is in most cases unknown. No less interesting than the geographically vicarious taxa mentioned above are some cases of altitudinal vicariism. Some afroalpine species appear to have evolved from afromontane forest species through progressive adaptations favouring survival in the inhospitable afroalpine climate. The most remarkable examples are provided by the strangely specialized Giant Senecios and Giant Lobelias. Copyright © 1969, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - By sequential selection for a resistance to a short-term heating at 45 degrees C, two independent clones, CHSR5 and CHSR6, have been isolated from ovarian cells of the Chinese hamster (CHO-K1). A subline CHO-A40, capable of proliferation at 40 degrees C, has been obtained as mass culture by culturing CHO-K1 cells for 2 months at 40 degrees C. The lines obtained have no cross-resistance to the temperature used in their selection: the CHSR5 and CHSR6 cells are not capable of reproduction at 40 degrees C, while the CHO cells do not survive over a 60 min heating at 45 degrees C. This bears evidence that mechanisms, underlying the cell resistance under different thermal regimens used, may be different. The heat resistant sublines maintain their heat resistance for 6 months of cultivation at 37 degrees C. The acquisition of heat resistance by cells correlates with their high primary resistance, and with their resistance to colchicine and actinomycin D.

AB  - The genetic and environmental basis of brown and green pupal colour dimorphism in the butterfly Papilio zelicaon was studied using univoltine, multivoltine, and selected low-diapause populations. The propensity for formation of brown pupae and the positive correlation between brown pupae and diapause show both inter- and intrapopulation variability. Reciprocal hybrids had colour frequencies and magnitude of the pupal colour-diapause correlation intermediate between parental population values with evidence for maternal effects in the latter. Colour frequencies among individual broods were normally distributed. One generation of selection increased incidence of green pupae and was most effective at a high selection differential. Selection results plus a heritability determination indicated that pupal colour dimorphism in P. zelicaon is a threshold trait with quantitative genetic variation. Short days and cool temperatures induced mostly diapause brown pupae irrespective of pupation substrate whereas long days and warm temperatures facilitated continuous development and cryptic colour matching of pupae to their substrate. © 1983, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 32-40
AB  - Seasonal variation in activity patterns of reptiles is accompanied by physiological and behavioral adjustments that influence their ecology and life history, and overwinter survival may be an important factor limiting a species' northern range extension. A northern population of Wood Turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) in Ontario, Canada was surveyed in fall 2004, and a subset of adults was radio-tracked every 7-12 days during the winter of 2004-2005 to examine thermal aspects of overwintering. We predicted that Wood Turtles would use hibernacula that protect them from freezing and predation. Temperature data loggers indicated that turtle body temperatures and hibernacula temperatures remained near 0°C from 2 December 2004 until 3 April 2005. During the same period, air temperatures fluctuated substantially and reached a maximum of 10.5°C (on 30 March 2005) and a minimum of less than -40°C (on 21 January 2005) with a mean of -8.3°C. Turtles did not select specific water temperatures nor did they use distinct structures (e.g., root hollows, logjams, and holes in the riverbank) for overwintering but instead rested relatively exposed on the riverbed at a depth of approximately 1 m and at a mean distance of 1.0 m from the riverbank. Surprisingly, turtles made small movements during winter (0.1-10.0 m between radiolocations), typically against the river current and in a direction parallel to the riverbank. Average winter home-range size was 7.1 m2. Our findings raise questions about why turtles move during winter; we suggest possible answers and future lines of investigation to address these questions.

VL  - 9

SP  - 851-860
AB  - Human erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum have markedly increased permeability to diverse solutes, many of which may be mediated by an unusual small conductance ion channel, the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC). Because these increases may be essential for parasite survival in the bloodstream, an important question is whether other intraerythrocytic parasites induce similar ion channels. Here, we examined this question using human erythrocytes infected with Babesia divergens, a distantly related apicomplexan parasite that can cause severe disease in immunocompromised humans. Osmotic lysis experiments after enrichment of infected erythrocytes with a new method revealed that these parasites also increase host permeability to various organic solutes. These permeability changes differed significantly from those induced by P.falciparum in transport rates, selectivity profiles and temperature dependence. Cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments confirmed and extended these differences because neither PSAC-like channels nor significant increases in whole-cell anion conductance were seen after B.divergens infection. While both babesia and plasmodia increase host erythrocyte permeability to a diverse collection of organic solutes, they utilize fundamentally different mechanisms. © Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd; No claim to original US government works.

VL  - 24

SP  - 373-380
AB  - A simple model is used to estimate the potential costs of production of four cultivation regimes that can be used to produce biomass for energy in central Chile. The selected cultivation regimes represent different silvicultural intensities and use Populus, Salix, Pinus and Eucalyptus genders. The model considers that the potential cost of production is explained by a cost of cultivation, a cost of harvest and a cost of soil use. It accounts for the different yields expected in each site and the energetic value of the biomass obtained. Sites of minimum potential costs for each cultivation regime are identified. The results obtained show that non-intensive silvicultural regimes using Eucalyptus and Pinus are associated to considerably lower minimum potential costs of production (0.04-0.06 UF GJ(-1) HHV)(1) than intensive silvicultural regimes that use Salix and Populus (0.12-0.14 UF GJ(-1) HHV). It was also found that to obtain the lowest production cost in non-intensive silviculture, it is preferable to use sites of high productivity although their cost of use is higher.

TI  - PRODUCTION AND DISSOLUTION OF BIOGENIC SILICA IN THE OCEAN - REVISED GLOBAL ESTIMATES, COMPARISON WITH REGIONAL DATA AND RELATIONSHIP TO BIOGENIC SEDIMENTATION
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SP  - 359-372
AB  - We estimate the global rate of biogenic silica production in the ocean to be between 200 and 280 × 1012 mol Si yr−1. The upper limit is derived from information on the primary productivity of the oceans, the relative contribution of diatoms to primary production and diatom Si/C ratios. The lower limit is derived independently using a multi‐compartment model of nutrient transport and biogenic particle flux, and field data on the balance between silica production and dissolution in the upper ocean. Our upper limit is 30–50% lower than several previous estimates, due to new data indicating lower values for both the relative contribution of diatoms to primary productivity and their Si/C ratios. Globally, at least 50% of the silica produced by diatoms in the euphotic zone dissolves in the upper 100 m, resulting in an estimated export of 100–140 × 1012 mol Si yr−l to the deep ocean. Our estimates correspond to a global mean rate of biogenic silica production between 0.6 and 0.8 mol Si m−2 yr−1. Incubation experiments indicate that silica production rates exceed that mean by a factor of 3–12 in coastal areas and are 2–4 times less than the global average in the oligotrophic mid‐ocean gyres. The mean silica production rate in waters overlying diatomaceous sediments (approximately 10–12% of the surface area of the oceans) is 0.7–1.2 mol Si m−2 yr−1. That rate is only slightly higher than the global average, indicating that the silica produced in those regions is only 10–25% of the global total. The estimated production of biogenic silica in surface waters of the mid‐ocean gyres is approximately equal to that for all major areas of opal sediment accumulation combined. Regional comparison of silica production and accumulation rates suggests a strongly bimodal character in the efficiency of opal preservation in the sea. In waters overlying diatom‐rich sediments 15–25% of the silica produced in the surface layer accumulates in the seabed, while virtually none of the silica produced in other areas is preserved. The global burial/production ratio of ˜ 3% is a composite of those two very different systems. The mechanisms leading to more efficient opal preservation in regions of silica accumulation are presently unknown, but they have no simple relationship to primary productivity. Regional differences in opal preservation appear to be controlled by factors such as low surface temperature, selective grazing and aggregate formation, which diminish the rate of silica dissolution in surface waters and/or accelerate its transport to the seafloor.

VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 661-668
AB  - The behavior and physiology of two parapatric sibling species, Heliconius erato cyrbia Godt. and H. himera Hew., were investigated to assess if environmental adaptation enabled stable morphological, genetic, and ecological differences to exist in the face of hybridization. Morning and evening activity, egg production, and larval development time of H. himera and H. erato in insectaries were recorded; individuals were collected in allopatry and in sympatry from a hybrid zone in which the species overlapped. Studies were performed at ambient conditions within the natural range of H. himera. H. himera was considerably more active than H. erato, flying earlier in the morning and later in the evening, even when both species were collected in sympatry. Similarly, H. himera laid more eggs, and the hatched larvae developed more rapidly. The results suggest that physiological constraints are an important selective force that may have been important in speciation and counteracts hybridization in the maintenance of the H. himera/H. erato contact zone. Ecological selection, arising from adaptation to low temperatures, may help explain the competitive exclusion of H. erato by H. himera in the drier, cooler montane habitat favored by the latter species.

VL  - 37

SP  - 499-504
AB  - Objectives: Different thermotherapeutic modalities such as transurethral microwave therapy or transurethral needle ablation have been developed to provide effective alternatives to surgical management of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The mechanisms of thermotherapy, however, are not completely understood. We developed a model to investigate the effects of heat application on stromal cell viability and contractility. Methods: Cells isolated from prostatectomy and cystoprostatectomy specimens were cultured in a selective medium. Temperatures ranging from 37 to 50 degrees C were applied for 1 h. Cell contraction was visualized by means of a cell culture microscope equipped with a time-lapse video system. For quantitative analysis, the percentage of contracting cells was evaluated; 10 mu M of phenylepherine were applied for adrenergic stimulation of the eel Is. Results: On immunohistochemistry and phase-contrast microscopy, these cells were identified as prostatic myofibroblasts. Incubation at 50 degrees C for 1 h in vitro induced immediate death of all cells, whereas at 45 degrees C a II cells survived. At 37 degrees C 55% of the cells were seen to contract after addition of phenylephrine. Immediately after incubation at 45 degrees C contraction rate decreased to 29%, but returned to 46% 1 day later. Conclusions: With this model, it is possible to study the mechanisms of thermotherapy in vitro. The results suggest that the effects of thermotherapy are due to the induction of cell death rather than to reduced stromal cell contractility. Furthermore, the data show that treatment is probably only successful if temperatures in excess of 50 degrees C are maintained. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The survival of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) with different developmental rates and genotypes at eight polymorphic loci was compared in two experiments. The embryos were reared at temperatures colder (5 and 8°C) and warmer (12°C) than normally experienced by the strain (9.5°C). Embryo survival in five different hatching groups (representing the sequential order of hatching) was compared at 8 and 12°C. Embryos in the center of the hatching distribution (groups 2, 3, and 4) showed a greater survival to yolk sac resorption than those in the extremes (groups 1 and 5). These differences are significant in the embryos reared at 12°C in both experiments. Embryo survival from hatching to yolk sac resorption was poorer at 12 compared to 8°C. In the one experiment where it was examined, significantly fewer embryos hatched at 5 and 12 than at 8°C. Significant deviations from genotypic expectations (based upon parental allele frequencies) were detected in the progeny (23 of 34 cases). In contrast, few deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations were detected (5 of 34 cases) when progeny allele frequencies are used. Few significant differences in genotype frequencies were detected among the progeny reared at the different temperatures. This suggests that nonequal contributions of parental gametes rather than differential selection of genotypes account for the deviations from expectations in the progeny. © 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 76-86
AB  - Chilled storage of spermatozoa in fish has been extensively investigated for many years, but limited research was focused on crustacean species. Chilled storage of spermatophores of black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon is needed to generate consistent and reliable supply of spermatozoa for subsequent use. The objective of this study was to develop a protocol for the chilled storage of black tiger shrimp spermatophores and to evaluate bacterial propagation during chilled storage of spermatophores. In the first experiment, spermatophores were selected and preserved using four different extenders, namely mineral oil, Ringer's solution, phosphate buffer and 0.85% sodium chloride, and stored at low temperature (2-4 C) for 42 d without antibiotic supplementation. Results showed that mineral oil was the best extender for chilled storage of spermatophores, since the highest percentage of viable sperm (58.3 ± 2.9%) was observed with this extender at the end of experiment (day 42). Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the predominant bacteria occurring during chilled storage, and the total bacteria count gradually increased during the experiment. In the second experiment, spermatophores were preserved in the mineral oil with four concentrations of the antibiotic, penicillin-streptomycin (0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 3%). There was no significant difference (P>0.05) in the percentage of viable sperm among treatments with 0.1%, 1%, 2%, and 3% antibiotics. The total count of Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and P. aeruginosa in the antibiotic treated groups significantly decreased (P < 0.05) to undetectable levels by day 14 of the experiment. Fertility studies from artificial insemination indicated that P. monodon spermatophores preserved with mineral oil for 7-8 d at 2-4 C were capable of fertilizing eggs with hatching rates similar to the controls. This study suggests that chilled storage of spermatophores is a feasible approach for the management and spawning of black tiger prawn broodstock or other invertebrate species that produce spermatophores. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2005.

AB  - The effect of temperature increase from 15°C to 28°C on population dynamics pertaining to analysis on life table and survival analysis of Carmine spider mite (Tetranychus cinnabarinus) fed with White mulberry (Morus alba) was investigated under laboratory condition. Analysis using both linear and 'Wang-Lan-Ding' models based on population parameters was performed. Results revealed the increment of net reproductive rate (R0), finite rate of increase (λ), intrinsic rate of natural increase(rm), eggs laid per female per day, the reciprocal of doubling time for population (Dt.) and mean generation time (T) were all represented linear relation with temperature increasing, whereas the average life and the maximum mortality age were both decreased with temperature increasing. Ratio of male/female and practical oviposition duration were basically unchanged within the temperature range. The population selected 'trade-off' strategy among reproduction, development and survival. Threshold temperature of development (female), threshold temperature of reproduction and population growth, optimal temperature of reproduction and population growth, optimal temperature of development were approximately 8, 13, 22°C, and 30°C, respectively.

TI  - Sexual differences in life-history traits in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus: A comparison between direct and diapause development
VL  - 100
IS  - 3
SP  - 325-330
AB  - During direct development the butterfly Lycaena tityrus was previously found to display sex-related reaction norms in response to temperature. Based on selection for protandry in males and fecundity selection for larger females, males favoured early emergence over large size, leading to a dramatic weight loss at higher temperatures, whereas females maintained similar weights throughout, Because males were able to avoid a weight reduction relative to females in spite of their shorter development at lower temperatures, sexual size dimorphism existed at higher temperatures only. In the present paper we compare sexual differences in life-history traits in L. tityrus between direct and diapause development at 25 degreesC. We demonstrate that, regardless of developmental pathway, protandry persisted and relative sexual size dimorphism, with females being larger, remained unchanged. Although diapausing individuals were less time-constrained, allowing them to grow to considerably higher final weights in both sexes, males were not able to reduce their weight loss relative to females. This is explained by the pressure to gain a developmental advantage solely during post-diapause development, whereas direct developing males may spread the burden over the whole larval period. Our results highlight the importance of considering sexual differences in selective pressures. which may influence central life-history traits in manifold ways.

TI  - Exercise-induced stress response as an adaptive tolerance strategy
VL  - 106
SP  - 325-330
AB  - Interaction between the quality of the environment and the health of the exposed population determines the survival response of living organisms. The phenomenon of induced tolerance by exposure to threshold levels of stressors to stimulate natural defense mechanisms has potential therapeutic value. The paucity of information on predictability of individual response and information on the operative fundamental mechanisms limit applicability of the adaptive tolerance strategy. A potential biomarker of the stress response includes members of the stress-inducible ubiquitin gene family. Transcript sizes detected with Northern blot analysis identify different classes of ubiquitin gene family members and the intensity of the radioactive signal allows abundance determinations. Using moderate exercise as the stressor, significant increase (p < 0.028) in abundance of inducible polyubiquitin genes was found in human blood. Both the potential of exercise as a model system of a natural stress inducer and polyubiquitin as a biomarker of stress were established in these studies.

AB  - Evapotranspiration, an important component in terrestrial water balance and net primary productivity models, is difficult to measure and estimate. In this Study, the potential of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is investigated in modelling of daily grass crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo) obtained using the Penman-Monteith equation. Various combinations of daily climatic data, namely solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, are used as inputs to the ANFIS so as to evaluate the degree of effect of each of these variables on daily Penman-Monteith estimated ETo. The results of the ANFIS model are compared with a multiple linear regression model. Mean square error, average absolute relative error and determination coefficient statistics are used as comparison criteria for evaluation of the model performance. The ANFIS technique whose inputs are solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, gave mean square errors of 0.016, average absolute relative errors of 6.4%, and determination coefficients of 0.996 for Morgan Hill 139 station (San Francisco Bay, USA). Based on the comparisons, it was found that the ANFIS model could be successfully employed in estimating the daily ETo. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Spatial and temporal use of floodplain habitats by lentic and lotic species of aquatic turtles
VL  - 122
IS  - 1
SP  - 138-146
AB  - We investigated the use of aquatic and terrestrial floodplain habitats by lentic and lotic turtles inhabiting the Missouri River, a contemporary, regulated large river. Specifically, we tested whether habitats were used differentially by turtle species, sexes, and life stages over biologically determined spatial and temporal scales. We monitored female and male false map turtles (Graptemys pseudogeographica) and slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) for 14 months, using radiotelemetry. In addition, over a 3-year period we trapped G. pseudogeographica (n=591) and T. scripta (n=129) to supplement data on habitat use. Movements based on radiotelemetry and recaptures were summarized for each individual. Both species of turtles displayed dynamic annual activity patterns and used diverse habitats including those typically considered terrestrial. Although G. pseudogeographica and T.: scripta spent a substantial portion of the year in the Missouri River (primarily in the cool months), newly created scour habitats also appeared to attract turtles during the cool season. However, in the warm months, habitat use became much more diverse, with turtles occupying all identified habitats including flooded agriculture and forest. Relative to their proportions, slough and scour habitats appeared to be highly favored while forests older than 4 years and agricultural habitats were proportionally less favored. We found few differences between species. However, males of both species were consistently more sedentary, used half as many habitats, and moved half as far from the river as did females, especially during May through July. Juveniles of both species were captured on average farther from the river than were adults, perhaps reflecting the close proximity of both nesting areas and shallow, productive habitats free of aquatic predators. We estimate a riparian zone of 449 m that encompasses 95% of the population movements away from the river and discuss the quality of habitats important to reproduction and survival of lentic and lotic floodplain turtles. These spatial and temporal movement patterns, in light of their potential adaptive costs and benefits to G. pseudogeographica and T. scripta, are critical to understanding the ecology of long-lived vertebrates that depend on contemporary large rivers.

TI  - Intracellular proteinases of invertebrates: Calcium-dependent and proteasome/ ubiquitin-dependent systems
VL  - 184
SP  - 157
AB  - Cytosolic proteinases carry out a variety of regulatory functions by controlling protein levels and/or activities within cells. Calcium-dependent and ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent pathways are common to all eukaryotes. The former pathway consists of a diverse group of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteinases (CDPs; calpains in vertebrate tissues). The latter pathway is highly conserved and consists of ubiquitin, ubiquitinconjugating enzymes, deubiquitinases, and the proteasome. This review summarizes the biochemical properties and genetics of invertebrate CDPs and proteasomes and their roles in programmed cell death, stress responses (heat shock and anoxia), skeletal muscle atrophy, gametogenesis and fertilization, development and pattern formation, cell-cell recognition, signal transduction and learning, and photoreceptor light adaptation. These pathways carry out bulk protein degradation in the programmed death of the intersegmental and flight muscles of insects and of individuals in a colonial ascidian; molt-induced atrophy of crustacean claw muscle; and responses of brine shrimp, mussels, and insects to environmental stress. Selective proteolysis occurs in response to specific signals, such as in modulating protein kinase A activity in sea hare and fruit fly associated with learning; gametogenesis, differentiation, and development in sponge, echinoderms, nematode, ascidian, and insects; and in light adaptation of photoreceptors in the eyes of squid, insects, and crustaceans. Proteoiytic activities and specificities are regulated through proteinase gene expression (CDP isozymes and proteasomal subunits), allosteric regulators, and posttranslational modifications, as well as through specific targeting of protein substrates by a diverse assemblage of ubiquitin-conjugases and deubiquitinases. Thus, the regulation of intracellular proteolysis approaches the complexity and versatility of transcriptional and translational mechanisms. Copyright © 1998 by Academic Press.

VL  - 30

AB  - This experiment concerns with the selection of a silkworm resistant to virus induction. Larvae of a silkworm strain were reared as usual, except for treatment by refrigeration at 5°C for first 24 hours after the ecdysis of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th instar, respectively, and eggs were obtained from the survived moths. The diseases appearing by this treatment were nuclear and cytoplasmic polyhedroses and flacherie. This treatment was performed through 13 generations, and in the 11th to 13th generation one batch rearing was made. Survival rate of a selected strain from these generations was always higher than that of the original (non-selected) strain and the resistance to virus induction by means of cold treatment was recognized. Subsequently, the effect of malnutrition was compared with selected and non-selected strains. The larvae were reared on harder mulberry leaves during the 1st and 3rd instars and on rotten leaves during the 4th and 5th instars. In the common strain C 115 × J 122 all larvae died by the 5th instar and in the non-selected strain 4 out of 413 larvae pupated, but eventually died, while in the selected strain 130 out of 325 larvae became adult. From this result, it was considered that the selected strain by means of cold treatment was resistant to virus induction by malnutrition. Since the selection has been performed under condition of mass-rearing, a question arises whether the larvae of selected strain will be reinfected with the infectious virus from outside, by which a lysogenization-like phenomenon will be caused. For this purpose, the nuclear polyhedrosis virus was injected into the silkworm pupae and the eggs laid by the heavily infected moths were obtained. Even with such eggs, it was not possible to find out distinct difference in the induction rate by the exposure to cold treatment or at normal rearing between virus-injected and non-injected batches, and it was considered that a lysogenization-like phenomenon would not appear. The resistance to virus infection was examined employing the selected strain by means of cold treatment, non-selected strain and other silkworm strains. The difference in the susceptibility (log LD50) for the nuclear polyhedrosis virus was not remarkable among them, and thus the resistance to virus induction seems to be independent from that to virus infection. © 1961, The Japanese Society of Sericultural Science.

VL  - 89

SP  - 1113-1123
AB  - New nano stationary phase (NSP) capillary columns were evaluated for the analysis of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). To meet the regulatory requirements, the analytical procedures must provide adequate separation and identification of the 16 individual priority PAH. A 12m conventional diameter NSP column provides fast separation of 16 priority PAH, meeting the USEPA regulatory requirements specified in method 610. The new NSP columns are selective and highly stable with a maximum operating temperature limit of 370°C. The columns have extremely low bleed at the standard working temperature of 325°C normally used for PAH analyses. Due to low bleed, these columns provide higher sensitivity for PAH in GC/FID and GC/MS analysis. Microbore columns with the NSP provide even faster analysis and ultra low bleed. In addition to the 16 priority PAH, the separation of benzo(e)pyrene and perylene from benzo(a)pyrene, and complete separation of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, dibenzo[a,i]- pyrene, and dibenzo[a,h]pyrene, which are mandated for monitoring and analysis in food products by the European Food Safety Authority, is achieved on NSP columns. The fast analysis of 16 PAH in less than 6 minutes, repeatability over 200 runs, high temperature stability, and extremely low bleed illustrates the robust performance of NSP columns. Due to high selectivity, complete separation of 16 priority PAH was achieved on a very short (<5m) microbore NSP GC column. Fast analysis of 16 priority PAH on short NSP GC columns increases laboratory productivity and decreases laboratory operational costs. This is the first report on the application of selective, high temperature, extremely low bleed, NSP GC columns for PAH analysis. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

VL  - 192

SP  - 195-210
AB  - Marine intertidal organisms inhabiting different wave exposure regimes can face different abiotic conditions and selection regimes. In this paper, salinity and temperature conditions for the tidepool habitat of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker) are described across a wave exposure gradient, and the selective impact of salinity on life-history traits is inferred from laboratory and field studies. I found that desiccation and osmotic stress in the tidepool habitat of T. californicus were higher at an outer coast compared to a protected site in California. In the outer coast area with high wave action, tidepool salinity varied spatially, fluctuated temporally, and was at least two times greater than seawater salinity on average; tidepools frequently dried completely. Conversely, tidepool salinity in the protected area with low wave action was moderate and did not vary spatially or temporally. Culturing females at different salinities and temperatures suggested that there is a trade-off between osmoregulatory maintenance and growth or reproduction. At high salinity age of first reproduction and interclutch interval increased, and reproductive rate decreased. Extreme salinity produced age-specific mortality in the laboratory, where juveniles suffered significantly greater mortality than adults in salinity stress experiments. Hypersaline conditions in seven natural tidepool populations were associated with a decrease in the proportion of the population composed of juveniles, and an increase in the proportion of adult females, suggesting that juveniles experienced higher mortality. Unlike previous studies of benthic organisms outside tidepools, I found that higher osmotic and desiccation stress occurred in T. californicus tidepool habitats in areas exposed to high wave energy, not in protected areas. The effects of abiotic conditions on life history traits and age-specific mortality suggest the selection exists for local adaptation to different wave exposure regimes. © 1995.

TI  - Thermal biology and activity patterns of the eastern brownsnake (Pseudonaja textilis): A radiotelemetric study
VL  - 58
IS  - 4
SP  - 436-452
AB  - Eastern brownsnakes (Pseudonaja textilis) from south-eastern Australia are alert, well camouflaged, secretive, fast moving, and dangerously venomous, and they spend much of the time hidden in burrows. Thus, direct observation of this species is difficult. However, distinctive patterns in environmental thermal heterogeneity, coupled with knowledge of the thermal preferenda of the snakes, enabled us to infer their location and activity based on remotely monitored body temperatures (obtained from surgically implanted radio transmitters). We used data on 40 radio-tracked snakes to evaluate patterns of thermoregulation, activity, and habitat use. Captive snakes actively selected body temperatures around 31 C, and free-ranging snakes displayed similar body temperature levels while active. Front data on temperatures of the soil, operative models, and shaded air, we could identify activity, schedules of the snakes (especially, times of emergence from and retreat into burrows). Snake activity was bimodal over the year, with the highest incidence of above-ground activity in late spring and late summer. Thermal profiles suggest that inactive snakes in burrows spent most of their time at approximately 20 cm depth, but they moved to shallower depths at some times (e.g., during summer, when they sometimes spent entire nights above ground) and deeper at other times (e.g., greater than or equal to40 cm in winter). Reproductive females remained with their eggs after oviposition in mid-summer, about 30 cm under the soil surface. Burrow temperatures were frequently high, so that the snakes did not need to emerge in order to elevate body temperature. Overall, the telemetered snakes spent an average of 56% of active-season days, 64% of all days, and 93% of all hours below ground. Hence, this species largely depends on in-ground temperature for thermal energy exchange.

AB  - Seventeen females of the mud crab Scylla serrata, from the State of Kosrae, Micronesia, were transported to the Fisheries Resources Research Institute, Gyeongsangnamdo, in oxygen-filled plastic bags. After acclimatization to a 30oC holding temperature, nine females were selected for seed production trials. Spawning was hastened using eyestalk ablations; however, this may not be required in commercial-scale mud crab seed production. Primary spawning produced an average of 2.4 million hatched larvae, whereas secondary spawning produced 0.4 million. About 10 days elapsed between spawning and hatching and 30 days between hatching and crablet. Mass mortalities up to 90% were observed between stages zoea 1 and zoea 2 in every trial. The highest survival rate from zoea 1 to crablet was estimated at 0.25%. Most commercial shrimp hatcheries in Korea are equipped with almost all necessary facilities and could be converted easily to mud crab hatcheries, able to run three to four times per year using hatchery technologies developed for blue crabs and Chinese mitten crabs.

TI  - Optimization of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation for better biodegradable plastic production and organic removal using single fed-batch mixed cultures and renewable resources
VL  - 53
IS  - 6
SP  - 15-20
AB  - The process for the production of biodegradable plastic material (polyhydroxyalkanoates, PHAs) from microbial cells by mixed-bacterial cultivation using readily available waste (renewable resources) is the main consideration nowadays. These observations have shown impressive results typically under high carbon fraction, COD/N and COD/P (usually described as nutrient-limiting conditions) and warmest temperature (moderate condition). Therefore, the aim of this work is predominantly to select mixed cultures under high storage responded by cultivation on a substrate - non limited in a single batch reactor with shortest period for feeding and to characterize their storage response by using specific and kinetics determination. In that case, the selected-fixed temperature is 30°C to establish tropical conditions. During the accumulated steady-state period, the cell growth was inhibited by high PHA content within the cells because of the carbon reserve consumption. From the experiments, there is no doubt about the PHA accumulation even at high carbon fraction ratio. Apparently, the best accumulation occurred at carbon fraction, 160 ± 7.97 g COD/g N (PHAmean = 44.54% of dried cells). Unfortunately, the highest PHA productivity was achieved at the high carbon fraction, 560 ± 1.62 g COD/g N (0.152 ± 0.17 g/l. min). Overall results showed that with high carbon fraction induced to the cultivation, the PO4 and NO3 can remove up to 20% in single cultivation. © IWA Publishing 2006.

VL  - 177
IS  - 2
SP  - 243-250
AB  - Rts1 is a kanamycin-resistance plasmid and multiphenotypically thermosensitive. The detrimental host cell growth at 42° C is expressed only when it exitst autonomously but not in an integrated state. However, a cholate-resistant (plt) mutant of the Hfr with an integrated Rts1 plasmid was found to be thermosensitive like a strain with the same plasmid autonomoulsy. This thermosensitivity depends on the existence of the integrated plasmid. Deletion derivatives of integrated plasmid genome from this Hfr strain were isolated with or without thermal selective growth at 42° C and mapping of the plasmid was attempted by analyzing them. A total of 141 kanamycin-sensitive derivatives were independently isolated and examined for their thermosensitivity (genetic locus: tsg), incompatibility (genetic locus: incT), conjugal fertility (genetic locus: tra), 'restriction' of T4 phase (two genetic loci: resA and resB) and for DNase activity (genetic locus: dns). On the basis of characterization of 141 deletion derivatives, they were divided into 15 patterns which would correspond to a linear map integrated into the chromosome: ... resA ... dns ... resB ... tra ... kan ... incT ... tsg ... It is noteworthy that 'restriction' of T4D phage is determined by two distinct genes, resA and resB, intervened by dns and that propagation of T4D phage on a strain with a resA+resB- genome failed to produce modified progeny phages. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Wheat yield prediction through agro meteorological indices for ardebil district
VL  - 37
SP  - 32-35
AB  - Wheat prediction was carried out using different meteorological variables together with agro meteorological indices in Ardebil district for the years 2004-2005 & 2005-2006. On the basis of correlation coefficients, standard error of estimate as well as relative deviation of predicted yield from actual yield using different statistical models, the best subset of agro meteorological indices were selected including daily minimum temperature (Tmin), accumulated difference of maximum & minimum temperatures (TD), growing degree days (GDD), accumulated water vapor pressure deficit (VPD), sunshine hours (SH) & potential evapotranspiration (PET). Yield prediction was done two months in advance before harvesting time which was coincide with commencement of reproductive stage of wheat (5th of June). It revealed that in the final statistical models, 83% of wheat yield variability was accounted for variation in above agro meteorological indices. © 2009 WASET.ORG.

AB  - Three strains of Vibrio vulnificus were evaluated for their potential to become acid adapted in tryptic soy broth with 2% NaCl acidified using hydrochloric (pH 5.0), citric or acetic acids (pH 5.5). Control and adapted cells were subsequently evaluated for acid tolerance (pH 3.5) in broths acidified with each acid, respectively. Other cross-protective effects: heat tolerance, cold storage survival, and freeze-thaw resistance were evaluated with cells exposed to broths acidified with hydrochloric acid. Acid adaptation was observed with hydrochloric and citric acids (P < 0.05) and was dependent on strain, duration of adaptation time, and acid type. The most pronounced acid adaptation response was with hydrochloric acid, regardless of strain (P < 0.05). Treatment with chloramphenicol eliminated the acid tolerance response. The three strains were inactivated within 12 min at 47degreesC with or without acid adaptation. Acid adaptation increased freeze-thaw resistance and cold storage survival for one strain following 10h acid adaptation (P < 0.05). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 73

SP  - 293-301
AB  - The viral and host factors involved in herpes simplex virus (HSV) recombination are little understood. To identify features of the process, recombination in HSV-1 and HSV-2 has been studied by analysing the segregation of unselected markers in the form of restriction endonuclease (RE) sites. By confining parental interactions to only one strain of virus of each serotype, restrictions imposed by non-homology are overcome and differential growth phenotypes can be discounted. The analysis of unselected and selected recombinants using RE sites in conjunction with temperature-sensitive mutations is consistent with (i) HSV being highly recombinogenic, (ii) parental and progeny molecules taking part in the process, (iii) the four genomic isomers participating in recombination, (iv) genome alignment being part of the recombination process and (v) cellular factors in conjunction with genome homology influencing the efficiency of recombination.

VL  - 129

SP  - 519-525
AB  - We have studied seasonal and diurnal fluctuations of water temperature in bamboo stumps and the effect of temperature on the energy metabolism of arboreal, oophagous tadpoles of Chirixalus eiffingeri. We collected tadpoles (Gosner stage 28-29) in February and August from Chitou, Taiwan and acclimated them to 12 and 22 degreesC. Using a closed system, we measured tadpole oxygen consumption ((V)over dot O-2) at 12, 17 and 22 degreesC. The water temperature was lowest in February (11-13 degreesC), increased rapidly during March and April and was highest from May to August (20-24 degreesC). Diel fluctuations in the temperature of the pools of water in bamboo stumps mirrored fluctuations in air temperature. Tadpoles collected in February and August exhibited metabolic compensation in that tadpoles acclimated at 12 degreesC had significantly higher lie, than those acclimated at 22 degreesC. There are at least two possible explanations for the presence of metabolic compensation in C. eiffingeri tadpoles. Firstly, the larval period of C. eiffingeri ranges from 40 to 78 days, a tadpole could experience relatively large fluctuations in body temperature (up to 10 degreesC) during the development. As a result, C. eiffingeri tadpoles most likely evolved metabolic compensation to maintain activity levels under different thermal environments. Secondly, because arboreal pools are small, thermally unstratified, aquatic microhabitats, tadpoles are unable to behaviorally select preferred temperatures. As a result, metabolic compensation allows tadpoles to regulate their physiological functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature-sensitive (ts)mutant cells for cell reproduction were isolated from the Syrian hamster cell line BHK21/13 by multiple culturing in the presence of 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FdU) at 37.5° after N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. A simple method for cell fusion was devised, which enabled us to perform complementation studies with a large number of ts mutants. By using the method we have analyzed 219 ts mutants and classified them into 18 complementation groups. Mutants that belonged to the same complementation groups tended to exhibit similar patterns of inhibition of DNA synthesis at 39.5° however, some mutants belonging to the same group showed somewhat different patterns, probably due to occurrence of different mutations in the same gene. Distribution of the ts mutants among the 18 complementation groups was uneven; more than 50% of the mutants examined were assigned to complementation group B and G. The mutations belonging to complementation group B and G were found to be linked to the X chromosome. © 1982 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

VL  - 212
IS  - 23
SP  - 3771-3780
AB  - Animal distributions are shaped by the environment and antecedents. Here I show how the temperature dependence of aerobic scope (the difference between maximum and minimum rates of oxygen uptake) is a useful tool to examine the fundamental temperature niches of salmonids and perhaps other fishes. Although the concept of aerobic scope has been recognized for over half a century, only recently has sufficient evidence accumulated to provide a mechanistic explanation for the optimal temperature of salmonids. Evidence suggests that heart rate is the primary driver in supplying more oxygen to tissues as demand increases exponentially with temperature. By contrast, capacity functions (i.e. cardiac stroke volume, tissue oxygen extraction and haemoglobin concentration) are exploited only secondarily if at all, with increasing temperature, and then perhaps only at a temperature nearing that which is lethal to resting fish. Ultimately, however, heart rate apparently becomes a weak partner for the cardiorespiratory oxygen cascade when temperature increases above the optimum for aerobic scope. Thus, the upper limit for heart rate may emerge as a valuable, but simple predictor of optimal temperature in active animals, opening the possibility of using biotelemetry of heart rate in field situations to explore properly the full interplay of environmental factors on aerobic scope. An example of an ecological application of these physiological discoveries is provided using the upriver migration of adult sockeye salmon, which have a remarkable fidelity to their spawning areas and appear to have an optimum temperature for aerobic scope that corresponds to the river temperatures experienced by their antecedents. Unfortunately, there is evidence that this potential adaptation is incompatible with the rapid increase in river temperature presently experienced by salmon as a result of climate change. By limiting aerobic scope, river temperatures in excess of the optimum for aerobic scope directly impact upriver spawning migration and hence lifetime fecundity. Thus, use of aerobic scope holds promise for scientists who wish to make predictions on how climate change may influence animal distributions.

TI  - Methods for evaluating genotype‐environment interactions illustrated by laying hens
VL  - 111
IS  - 1
SP  - 265-288
AB  - The relative efficiency of several methods of studying genotype‐environment interactions has been illustrated, considering some performance traits in laying hens as a model. The comparison involved methods of classifying, detecting the existence, and estimating the magnitude of genotype‐environment interactions. The environments consisted of warm (32 °C) and temperate (20 °C) climatic conditions. Classification and qualitative description of interactions is useful when very few genotypes and environments are involved. The illustration with an example suggested that a classification based on comparison of relative magnitudes of average genotypic, environmental and interaction effects would be most meaningful. The interactions carry greater significance if they exceed the average genotypic effects. A factorial analysis of variance followed by an F‐test can be useful in detecting the existence of interactions, but statistical significance should not be overemphasized for biological relevance. Invariably, the magnitude of interactions must be estimated to derive useful conclusions. The seven methods of estimating this correlation mainly involved principles of intraclass correlation, rank correlation and product–moment correlation. An analysis of data revealed that the intraclass correlation methods, in general, yielded higher estimates compared to the rest of the methods. Among them, the formula given by was found more appropriate in mixed‐model analysis with unbalanced data, while the method given by resulted in negative estimates when the interaction variance was large. The least reliable among the methods were estimations directly utilizing the mean squares from factorial analysis of variance as suggested by . Rank correlations were similar for phenotypic as well as genetic rankings and also coincided to some extent with the correlation among the breeding values, revealing distinct changes in ranks of genotypes in those traits where the interactions were larger. Product–moment correlations between the breeding values of sires in the two environments should be the most reliable and suitable for predicting selection response when the sires are selected in one environment and their progeny is required to perform under different conditions. However, their expectations were lower than 1, depending upon the genetic foundation of the traits and effective progeny size. Verschiedene Methoden der Untersuchung von Genotyp‐Umwelt‐Interaktionen hinsichtlich ihrer relativen Effizienz wurden verglichen. Dieser Vergleich erfolgte modellhaft an Leistungsmerkmalen von Legehennen. Die angewandten Methoden beinhalten solche des Nachweises, der Klassifizierung und der Schätzung des Ausmaßes von Genotyp‐Umwelt‐Interaktionen. An Umweltbedingungen wurden warme (32°) und gemäßigte (20°C) Stalltemperaturen einbezogen. Die Klassifizierung und qualitative Beschreibung von Interaktionen ist immer dann besonders geeignet, wenn nur sehr wenige Genotypen und Umwelten berücksichtigt werden müssen. Die Beispielsberechnungen ergaben, daß eine Klassifizierung aufgrund eines Vergleiches des relativen Ausmaßes der Durchschnittseffekte von Genotypen, Umwelten und der Interaktionseffekte am sinnvollsten ist. Die Interaktionen zeigten immer dann stärkere Ausprägung, wenn sie die Durchschnittseffekte der Genotypen übertrafen. Eine faktorielle Varianzanalyse ist in Verbindung mit einem F‐Test geeignet, das Auftreten von Interaktionen nachzuweisen. Von der statistischen Signifikanz kann jedoch nicht direkt auf biologische Relevanz geschlossen werden. Um züchterische Konsequenzen ziehen zu können, muß das Ausmaß von Interaktionen geschätzt werden. Es wurden sieben Schätzmethoden auf der Basis der Berechnung von Intraklasskorrelationen, Rangkorrelationen und Produkt‐Moment‐Korrelationen angewandt. Mit den Intraklasskorrelationsmethoden wurden allgemein die höchsten Schätzwerte ermittelt. Dabei erwies sich die Formel von als geeigneter für Analysen im gemischten Modell mit unbalanzierten Daten, während die Methode von immer dann zu negativen Schätzwerten führte, wenn die Interaktionsvarianz hoch war. Am wenigsten zuverlässig waren die Schätzwerte nach , die direkt aus den Durchschnittsquadraten der faktoriellen Varianzanalyse ermittelt wurden. Bezüglich der Rangkorrelationen ergaben sich ähnliche Ergebnisse nach phänotypischer und genetischer Rangierung und eine annähernde Übereinstimmung mit den Korrelationen zwischen den Zuchtwerten. Es traten in all jenen Merkmalen deutliche Rangverschiebungen auf, für die höhere Interaktionen erwartet wurden. Produkt‐Moment‐Korrelationen zwischen den Zuchtwerten der Väter in den beiden Umwelten ergaben die zuverlässigsten Schätzwerte und ermöglichten die besten Voraussagen des Selektionserfolges für den Fall, daß die Väter in einer Umwelt selektiert werden, während ihre Nachkommen unter anderen Bedingungen produzieren müssen. Die Erwartungswerte dieser Korrelationen können jedoch kleiner als 1 sein und hängen sowohl von der genetischen Fundierung der Merkmale als auch von der Anzahl geprüfter Nachkommen ab. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - An assessment method of power plants using Genetic Algorithms
VL  - 2
AB  - The performance assessment of power plants is a complex task, which involves many calculations. Increasing the number of plant components with the introduction of new technologies available in the international market, it increases the complexity of performance analysis of power cycles. The present paper describes a process for optimising a conventional gas turbine combined cycle power plant. In this paper the method of assessing thermal power plants takes into account the exergy method and carries out along with optimisation of the whole plant based on maximising overall plant exergetic efficiency and minimising energy loss rejected to the atmosphere. The performance assessment of power plants using the exergy method considers the overall plant exergetic efficiency and the exergy destruction in the various components of the plant. The exergy method highlights irreversibility within the plant components, and it is of particular interest in this investigation. Due to the large number of equations with many variables taking part in the whole calculation and also considering constraints imposed to some variables, a genetic algorithm is recommended as the optimisation tool for the assessment method. Genetic Algorithms are adaptive methods which may be used to solve search and optimisation problems. They are based on the genetic processes of biological organisms. Over many generations, natural populations evolve according to the principles of natural selection and .survival of the fittest., first clearly stated by Charles Darwin in his book .The Origin of Species. Genetic algorithms do not require complicate mathematical calculations like the evaluation of derivatives necessary to be considered in conventional optimisation techniques. Copyright © 2001 by ASME.

TI  - Control of oxygen transport in the microcrustacean Daphnia: Regulation of haemoglobin expression as central mechanism of adaptation to different oxygen and temperature conditions
VL  - 182
IS  - 3
SP  - 259-275
AB  - The pathway for oxygen, the control of oxygen transport and the role of haemoglobin expression for the physiological adaptation to different oxygen and temperature conditions were studied in the ecological model organism Daphnia magna. Ventilation of the inner walls of the carapace as the main gas exchange area as well as of the embryos in the brood pouch are controlled, oxygen-dependent processes. The P-O2-dependent increase of heart rate as well as perfusion rate during short-term, progressive hypoxia improves the circulatory oxygen transport within the body. The regulation of haemoglobin (Hb) expression is the central mechanism for a medium-term adaptation to hypoxia. Genetic control elements and oxygen conditions near the two Hb synthesis sites (fat cells, epipodite epithelial cells) determine, which types of Hb subunits and, accordingly, hetero-multimeric Hb macromolecules are produced. One synthesis site may respond mainly to internal, the other one to external oxygen conditions. Depending on environmental condition, either higher quantities of macromolecules of unchanged functionality (P-50) or increasing amounts of macromolecules with higher oxygen affinity are synthesized. The Hb subunit DmHbA is probably of considerable importance for this functional change. The physiological benefits of haemoglobin in Daphnia are discussed. Physiological adaptation of Daphnia to different temperatures is also related to the control of oxygen transport processes with the regulation of haemoglobin expression again as a central mechanism.

AB  - The separation of quaternary mixtures of lactobionic acid, lactose, sorbitol and fructose using a gel-type ion-exchange resin loaded with H+, K+ and Ca2+ ions has been investigated. This separation is relevant in order to improve the productivity of lactobionic acid obtained from the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by Glucose-fructose oxidoreductase and glucono-delta-lactonase enzymes. Measurement of the single-component equilibrium isotherms for all four species was carried out in a preparative column packed with the selected resin at temperatures of 293, 313 and 333 K using the frontal analysis and column adsorption-desorption method. Mass transfer coefficients for all species at different temperatures have been estimated by solving the dynamic model of the chromatographic column. From pulse tests of single-component and mixture solutions, the K+ loaded resin was found to be suitable for this quaternary separation. The unfavourable adsorption isotherm for the lactobionic acid is described by the anti-Langmuir model. Other compounds have shown linear equilibrium in the concentration range up to 130 g L-1. Binary and quaternary fixed-bed experiments were well described by the dynamic model using the parameters obtained from the single-component adsorption data. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 39

AB  - The ideal water conditions for maximizing the performance of the nursery culture of glass eels harvested from the wild for aquaculture need to be determined for the New Zealand shortfin (Anguilla australis) and longfin (Anguilla dieffenbachii) eels. This study determined the survival and growth of glass eels reared under different temperature and salinity conditions in the laboratory. The growth and survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels reared in salt water (35 parts per thousand) maintained at 25 degrees C was examined over 84 days from capture. The mean specific growth rate (SGR) was higher in shortfin [2.30 +/- 0.29% body weight (b.w.) day(-1)] than longfin glass eels (1.52 +/- 0.06% b.w. day(-1)), and survival was also higher in shortfin (76.0 +/- 4.16%) than for longfin glass eels (28.7 +/- 6.36%). A second experiment identified the effect of salinity (0, 17.5 parts per thousand and 35 parts per thousand) and temperature (17.5 and 26.5 degrees C) on the acclimation, growth performance and survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels over a period of 84 days from capture. There was no incidence of mortality for either shortfin or longfin glass eels reared across all salinity treatments (0 parts per thousand, 17.5 parts per thousand and 35 parts per thousand) at 26.5 degrees C, while survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels reared at 17.5 degrees C was the highest in 17.5 parts per thousand, followed by 35 parts per thousand and 0 parts per thousand treatments. Both temperature and salinity affected the SGR of shortfin glass eels, with the highest SGR observed for shortfin glass eels reared in 0 parts per thousand water maintained at 26.5 degrees C. In longfin glass eels, salinity alone had an effect on the SGR, with the highest SGR observed in glass eels reared in 0 parts per thousand water regardless of the water temperature (17.5 and 26.5 degrees C). In addition, the adaptability of glass eels to salinity was evaluated from the development and the physiological responses of gill chloride cell (CC) morphology. The number and size of CCs increased significantly with increasing salinity in both shortfin and longfin eels.

TI  - Assortative fertilization in Chlamys farreri and Patinopecten yessoensis and its implication in scallop hybridization
VL  - 25
IS  - 2
SP  - 509-514
AB  - Assortative mating and reduced hybrid fitness are typically invoked to explain the stability of hybrid zones and the specification of two closely related taxa. Such examples of mate preferences in nature, especially for broadcast free-spawning marine invertebrates, and the understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this positive selection are still lacking. This study documents another example of assortative fertilization by genome in situ hybridization in reciprocal crosses of scallops Chlanlysfarreri and Patinopecten yessoensis. Females produced eggs selected sperm nonrandomly but showed significant gamete preference of conspecifics over heterospecifics, with Chlamys farrei females using average 89.1% of conspecific sperms and the Patinopecten yessoensis using average 94.3% in natural spawning conditions (temperature 17 degrees C, salinity 31.5 parts per thousand). This conspecific gamete advantage may be related to the coordinated communication between interacting gametes, and the conspecific bindin genotype selection during the communicational process may also be involved. Two environmental factors, temperature and salinity were also tested to determinate to what extent they affect the patterns of assortative fertilization between these two species. The result showed that temperature seemed to have more influence on assortative fertilization than salinity did. At the temperatures of 11 degrees C, 17 degrees C, 22 degrees C and 26 degrees C, the average conspecific sperms preference of Chlamys farreri eggs was 80.0%, 89.1%, 95.1% and 95.5% respectively, whereas at the salinity of 24 parts per thousand, 28 parts per thousand, 31.5 parts per thousand and 35.5 parts per thousand, the average mating preference was 97.2%, 91.2%, 89.1% and 99.5% respectively. These results may have some bearings on the condition dependent alteration in the inter gamete recognition system. Alternatively, it may be simply the byproduct of different sperm tolerance ability under different conditions. The implication it may provide to hybrid production was also discussed.

VL  - 34
IS  - 2
SP  - 591-598
AB  - For the recovery of high purity CO2, two adsorbents, zeolite 13X and activated carbon, are examined. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycle simulations are performed to compare the performance of different adsorbents in separation from two feed mixtures: 16/84 (v/v) CO2/N2 and 26/74 CO2/N2. Despite high-temperature excursions in the adsorption step, zeolite 13X is a better adsorbent than activated carbon in nonisothermal, adiabatic PSA process due to favorable isotherm shape and equilibrium selectivity. Moreover, a higher temperature excursion for 13X during the product (CO2) purge step reduces the purge gas amount and this actually helps PSA performance. High purity of CO2 (over 99%) can be produced by zeolite 13X at higher recoveries (53% from low-CO2-concentration flue gas and 70% from high-CO2-concentration flue gas) and higher productivities than carbon. In selecting an appropriate adsorbent, high working adsorption capacity, high equilibrium selectivity, and low purge gas requirement dominate the separation by PSA process whereas the heat effects play a secondary role. A simple criterion is proposed for a priori adsorbent selection. © 1995, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

SP  - 127-140
AB  - This study evaluated the growth and control of Salmonella serotypes in a soft Hispanic type cheese (Queso Fresco). Cheese was made in the laboratory using a commercial procedure and after inoculation it was stored under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 6 to 30-degrees-C. The minimum temperature that allowed growth of Salmonella was 8-degrees-C. Accumulated data from the growth studies were used for the development of models relating the square root of 1/LT (LT = lag time) and specific growth rate to temperature. The effect of selected antimicrobials (potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and sodium lactate) on the growth and survival of Salmonella in milk and in cheese at various storage temperatures was also examined. Addition of sodium benzoate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.6) or addition of potassium sorbate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.0) made from milk, which was acidified to pH 5.9 with propionic acid, had a significant impact on delaying or preventing growth of the pathogen.

VL  - 85
IS  - 6
SP  - 1635-1641
AB  - Although animals are widely assumed to select habitats in ways that enhance organismal fitness, there are few empirical data to demonstrate this link. We studied flat rock spiders (Hemicloea major, Gnaphosidae) from eastern Australia, where these highly modified (dorsoventrally flattened) spiders live under loose surface rocks on sandstone outcrops. Field surveys showed that the rocks used as diurnal retreat sites by spiders were relatively thin with low canopy cover and a rocky substrate and therefore were likely to experience high temperatures and large thermal fluctuations. Laboratory trials suggest that this nonrandom rock use is a direct response to thermal cues; juvenile spiders selected warmer over cooler retreat sites. To investigate consequences of habitat selection on fitness-related traits, we maintained cohorts of juvenile spiders at cycling-temperature regimes corresponding to those measured in the field under rocks that were fully, partially, or never exposed to direct sunlight (diel thermal ranges of 16.2degrees-37.8degreesC, 15.5degrees-31.2degreesC, and 15.2degrees-24.3degreesC). Survival rates were high for all groups over the eight-week study, but hotter conditions accelerated growth and development. Our data thus confirm that thermal cues are used in retreat-site selection and that selection of warmer retreat sites will confer fitness benefits to flat rock spiders.

VL  - 28

SP  - 613-616
AB  - The potential advantages of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) over other extraction technologies stem from the properties of supercritical fluids. Specifically, the gas-like viscosities of supercritical fluids permit the rapid penetration of pores in a solid matrix (e.g. soils and sediments). Moreover, the high diffusion coefficients of solutes in the supercritical fluid media permit rapid mass transfers out of complex matrices. Typical SFE times range from a few minutes to less than one hour depending on the complexity of the sample matrix and the relative solubilities of the respective solutes of interest. The use of SFE can improve productivity with regards to both time and extraction efficiencies. Supercritical CO2 allows the extracting solvent to be vaporized while transferring the extraction effluent directly to a gas chromatograph. Since typically low temperatures (ambient to 100°C) are used in SFE, thermally labile components can be safely extracted. By changing solvent strengths, namely, using different supercritical fluids, modifiers, or densities (i.e., presures and temperature) different extraction selectivities are possible for specific solutes or classes of compounds. This paper will focus on and demonstrate the applicability of the direct coupling of SFE to a capillary gas chromatograph, and the use of SFE/GC for quantitative analysis. This will be demonstrated in terms of percent recoveries and transfer reproducibilities. Highlighted applications will include the determination of purgeable halocarbons in sediment, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in carbon black, and hydrocarbons in crude oil source rocks. © 1989 Friedr.

VL  - 258

SP  - 322-326
AB  - Two experiments were performed. The first tested the hypothesis that the toad, Bufo marinus, will select a lower ambient temperature under dry environmental conditions. This behavioral response would reduce evaporative water loss and facilitate survival on land. The second experiment measured the effects of temperature on evaporative water loss. In the first experiment, toads were placed in a thermal gradient (11–40°C) for 3 days. On days 1 and 3, water‐filled dishes were placed along the temperature gradient and humid air was circulated through the chamber. On day 2, water dishes were removed, and dry air was circulated through the chamber. Body temperature (Tb) was recorded with a cloacal thermistor. Selected Tb was approximately 8.6°C lower during the dry conditions than during the humid conditions. The behavioral hypothermia took about 6 h to develop. In the second experiment, a reduction in Tb from 17.7 to 12.°C reduced evaporative water loss by 42%. Consequently, behavioral hypothermia of the toad is an important adaptation to dry environmental conditions. Copyright © 1991 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

VL  - 10

SP  - 675-689
AB  - We examine the ability of neural networks to estimate the tissue perfusion values present and the minimum temperature in numerically calculated (Pennes, Bioheat Transfer Equation) steady-state hyperthermia temperature fields based on a limited number of measured temperatures within this field A hierarchical system of neural networks consisting of a first layer of pattern recognizing neural networks and a second layer of hypersurface reconstructing neural networks is shown to be capable of estimating these variables within a selected error tolerance. The results indicate that estimating the minimum tumour temperature directly with the system of neural networks may be more effective than using the indirect method of numerically recreating a temperature field with perfusion estimates and then obtaining the minimum tumour temperature from the estimated temperature field. Additional results indicate that if the locations of the measured temperatures within the temperature field are selected appropriately, the hierarchical system of neural networks can tolerate a moderate level of model mismatch. This model mismatch can come from errors in modelling the tumour boundaries, the sensor locations, or the magnitude of the power deposition. This paper is not intended to assess or demonstrate clinical applicability but to be a first step in investigating the feasibility of neural networks for parameter estimation related to hyperthermia studies. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - Genetic and fitness changes accompanying adaptation of an arbovirus to vertebrate and invertebrate cells
VL  - 73

AB  - The alternating host cycle and persistent vector infection may constrain the evolution of arboviruses. To test this hypothesis, eastern equine encephalitis virus was passaged in BHK or mosquito cells, as well as in alternating (both) host cell passages. High and low multiplicities were used to examine the effect of defective interfering particles. Clonal BHK and persistent mosquito cell infections were also evaluated. Fitness was measured with one-step growth curves and competition assays, and mutations were evaluated by nucleotide sequencing and RNA fingerprinting. All passages and assays were done at 32°C to eliminate temperature as a selection factor. Viruses passaged in either cell type alone exhibited fitness declines in the bypassed cells, while high-multiplicity and clonal passages caused fitness declines in both types of cells. Bypassed cell fitness losses were mosquito and vertebrate specific and were not restricted to individual cell lines. Fitness increases occurred in the cell line used for single-host-adaptation passages and in both cells for alternately passaged viruses. Surprisingly, single-host-cell passage increased fitness in that cell type no more than alternating passages. However, single-host-cell adaptation resulted in more mutations than alternating cell passages. Mosquito cell adaptation invariably resulted in replacement of the stop codon in nsP3 with arginine or cysteine. In one case, BHK cell adaptation resulted in a 238-nucleotide deletion in the 3' untranslated region. Many nonsynonymous substitutions were shared among more than one BHK or mosquito cell passage series, suggesting positive Darwinian selection. Our results suggest that alternating host transmission cycles constrain the evolutionary rates of arboviruses but not their fitness for either host alone.

TI  - Congruent climate-related genecological responses from molecular markers and quantitative traits for western white pine (Pinus monticola)
VL  - 170

SP  - 1120-1131
AB  - Analyses of molecular and quantitative genetic data demonstrate the existence of congruent climate-related patterns in western white pine (Pinus monticola). Two independent studies allowed comparisons of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers with quantitative variationinadaptive traits. Principal component analyses were conductedonseedling traitsincommon gardenscollected from58sites; principal coordinateanalyses were conducted on AFLP data from 15 sites. Collection site eigenvector means were regressed on 35 climate variables to produce a genecological prediction for each data set. Both predictions explained a large percentage (>70%) of the genetic variation from the first eigenvector from similar predictors involving the interaction growing season precipitation and temperature. Both predictions were significant (P < 0:01), and projected genecological maps were largely congruent. The predominant pattern from thefirst eigenvector was two major groups, anorthern and asouthern, connected by a steep cline across the crest of the southern Cascade Range of Oregon. This cline was associated with growth potential in the adaptive traits. These results suggest that divergent climatic selection has influenced phenotypic traits associated with growth. Furthermore, the congruence of AFLPs suggests a linkage between some loci and genomic regions under selection and/or climatic influences on postmating reproductive success.

VL  - 41
IS  - 8
SP  - 659-669
AB  - Thermal sensitivity during brood care was analysed in two Neotropical Camponotus ant species, related phylogenetically but disparate in ecology, Camponotus mus is dominant in temperate climates, whereas C. rufipes is dominant in subtropical climates, Sensitivity was assessed by first allowing workers to manifest their preference along a thermal gradient, and thereafter increasing the temperature of the nest floor continuously at a rate of 0.2 degrees C/min, The removal of brood by workers was recorded as an indicative response of upper thermal tolerance, Along a thermal gradient, while C. mus nurse workers exhibited a bimodal circadian rhythm of temperature preference to locate the brood, C, rufipes nurses selected an invariant temperature throughout the day, Irrespective of their thermal preferences, sensitivity to temperature changes in both species showed a conspicuous circadian rhythm. Its endogenous nature was supported by a free-run under constant darkness, In C, mus, instantaneous resetting by the light:dark cycle could also be demonstrated, and experiments suggest the involvement of one oscillator controlling thermal responses, At the middle of the light period when extreme environmental temperatures are expected, C, mas nurses exhibited the highest sensitivity (brood removal after an increase of 0.2 degrees C), while C, rufipes showed the lowest (removal after an increase of 6.7 degrees C), For both species, the time-course of thermal sensitivity during brood care suggests an adaptation to the wide and slight daily fluctuations undergone by temperature in temperate and tropical climates, respectively.

VL  - 3
IS  - 2
SP  - 97-108
AB  - The cold-adapted B/Ann Arbor/1/66 influenza virus (ca B/AA/1/66) expresses temperature-sensitive (ts), cold-adapted (ca) and attenuation phenotypes. Reassortants which inherit one or more genes from ca B/AA/1/66 and all other genes from a virulent, wild-type influenza virus, B/Houston/1732/76, were produced and evaluated in order to identify the gene(s) responsible for the ts, ca and attenuation phenotypes. Only reassortants which inherited the PA gene from ca B/AA/1/66 expressed the ts phenotype in MDCK cells at 39 °C. None of the reassortants tested expressed the ca phenotype in embryonated eggs at 25 °C. The virulence of several reassortants was evaluated in ferrets. Inheritance of the PA gene from ca B/AA/1/66 was correlated with significant febrile attentuation and the apparent restriction of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract. Isolation of a virulent, non-ts revertant virus inheriting only the PA gene from ca B/AA/1/66 established a direct relationship between expression of the ts phenotype and attenuated virulence. Evidence for the contribution of at least one other gene from ca B/AA/1/66 to attenuation was observed. Thus, based on the methods used to determine reassortant gene compositions, these results indicate that the PA gene is primarily responsible for attenuation of ca B/AA/1/66 and its reassortants. © 1987.

VL  - 112

SP  - 200-207
AB  - Although Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacteria] diarrhoeal disease in humans worldwide, its potential to adapt to the stressful conditions and survive in extra-intestinal environment is still poorly understood. We tested the effect of heat shock (55 degrees C, 3 min) and oxidative stress (3 mM H2O2 for 10 min or prolonged incubation at atmosphere oxygen concentration) on non-starved and starved cells of Campylobacter jejuni from different growth phases. Viability as assessed with the Bacteria] Viability Kit LIVE/DEAD (R) BacLight (TM) dying before fluorescent microscopy and culturability of the cells (CFU ml(-1)) from both growth phases showed that starvation increased heat but not oxidative resistance. High temperature and oxidative stress invoked quick transformation from culturable spiral shaped to nonculturable spiral and coccoid cells. Despite physiological changes of the cells we were not able to document clear differences in the expression of heat shock and starvation genes (dnaK, htpG, groEL), oxidative (ahpC, sodB), virulence (flaA) and housekeeping genes (16S rRNA, rpoD) after heat treatment (55 degrees C, 3 min) or oxidative stresses applied. When starving, no induction of expression of any of these genes was noticed, chloramphenicol had no influence on their gene expression. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that at least 10-20 min of heat shock was necessary to evidently increase the amount of groEL and rpoD transcripts. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The selective basis for increased egg retention: Early incubation temperature determines hatchling phenotype in wall lizards (Podarcis muralis)
VL  - 92
IS  - 3
SP  - 441-447
AB  - The thermal environment during development influences many aspects of the phenotype of hatchling reptiles. We hypothesized that temperature should differentially affect early incubation stages, in which differentiation dominates over growth, and late incubation stages, characterized by high growth rates. To test this idea, we incubated eggs of wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) under three regimes with the same mean temperature (29°C), one constant and two variable with opposite sequences: first cold (25°C) and then hot (32°C), and vice versa. Hatchlings incubated at high temperature during the initial period had shorter hindlimbs and tails than those incubated under the other two temperature regimes and shorter heads than those incubated initially at low temperature. Thus, temperature experienced by embryos during the early external incubation period produced similar phenotypic responses compared to those reported in previous studies for the same constant temperature applied over the whole incubation period. Because female wall lizards select lower body temperatures during pregnancy, an increase of intrauterine retention would extend the time of exposure of developing embryos to suitable temperatures. Diminution of body temperature during pregnancy is contrary to the expected pattern under the hypothesis that egg retention has evolved to accelerate development, as proposed by the cold-climate model for evolution of viviparity in squamates, and the results of the present study support the alternative hypothesis of developmental optimization as a special case of the broader maternal manipulation view. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Hybrid zones are natural laboratories offering insights into speciation processes. Narrow hybrid zones are less common in the sea than on land consistent with higher dispersal among marine populations. Acanthochromis polyacanthus is an unusual bony marine fish with philopatric dispersal that exists as allopatric stocks of white, bicoloured and black fish on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). At two latitudes, different morphs coexist and hybridize at narrow contact zones. Sequence data from mitochondrial Hypervariable Region 1 revealed contrasting patterns of introgression across these zones. At the northern hybrid zone, a single clade of mitochondrial haplotypes was found in all white fish, hybrids and tens of kilometres into pure bicoloured stock. At the southern hybrid zone, there was no introgression of mitochondrial genes into black fish and hybrids shared the bicoloured haplotypes. Based on this asymmetry, we postulate that black fish from the southern GBR have experienced a selective sweep of their mitochondrial genome, which has resulted in almost total reproductive isolation. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 9

SP  - 261-285
AB  - Climate change will impact coral-reef fishes through effects on individual performance, trophic linkages, recruitment dynamics, population connectivity and other ecosystem processes. The most immediate impacts will be a loss of diversity and changes to fish community composition as a result of coral bleaching. Coral-dependent fishes suffer the most rapid population declines as coral is lost; however, many other species will exhibit long-term declines due to loss of settlement habitat and erosion of habitat structural complexity. Increased ocean temperature will affect the physiological performance and behaviour of coral reef fishes, especially during their early life history. Small temperature increases might favour larval development, but this could be counteracted by negative effects on adult reproduction. Already variable recruitment will become even more unpredictable. This will make optimal harvest strategies for coral reef fisheries more difficult to determine and populations more susceptible to overfishing. A substantial number of species could exhibit range shifts, with implications for extinction risk of small-range species near the margins of reef development. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of how climate change will affect tropical marine fishes. Predictions are often based on temperate examples, which may be inappropriate for tropical species. Improved projections of how ocean currents and primary productivity will change are needed to better predict how reef fish population dynamics and connectivity patterns will change. Finally, the potential for adaptation to climate change needs more attention. Many coral reef fishes have geographical ranges spanning a wide temperature gradient and some have short generation times. These characteristics are conducive to acclimation or local adaptation to climate change and provide hope that the more resilient species will persist if immediate action is taken to stabilize Earth's climate. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 42

SP  - 2081-2092
AB  - A kinetic investigation of the vapor-phase hydrogenation and hydroisomerization of 1-butene and cis- and trans-2-butene is presented. This investigation is aimed at validating a practical set of rate equations. The experiments were performed at approximately atmospheric pressure using a commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalyst of the eggshell type in an integral fixed-bed isothermal reactor. The outlet composition was measured under 120 sets of operating conditions at six levels of temperature between -8 and 30 degreesC. The mole fractions of 1-butene and hydrogen in the feed were varied between 0.5 and 3% and between 0.5 and 50%, respectively. Space-time covered the range of (5-55) x 10(-3) S. Internal diffusion limitations affected the effective reaction rates and product distribution. Hence, the mass conservation equations inside the catalyst had to be solved to estimate the intrinsic values of the kinetic parameters. Two rival kinetic models of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type were proposed, one of which could be confidently discriminated as the better of the two models considered. An essential feature of the chosen model is that hydrogen concentration exhibits distinct effects on the hydrogenation and hydroisomerization reactions of n-butenes. The selected model predicts the experimental results with an average deviation of 8.8%. The estimates of the kinetic parameters show inference intervals in the range of +/-10-30%.

AB  - We provide further insight into the reproductive ecology and spawning requirements of lake trout. New comparative information about substrate characteristics, sediment transport, quality of interstitial water at spawning substrates, and the role of temperature in site selection and time of spawning is given for lakes Simcoe and Manitou (Ontario) and Seneca Lake (New York). Spawning lake trout commonly use stable lag deposits derived from glacial sediments, or relict features such as fans, bars or submerged talus slopes. Artificial breakwaters of broken material may also provide suitable substrates. Optimal particle sizes range from 4 to 10 cm diameter but larger materials to 30 cm are also successfully utilized for spawning. The transport of finer particulates by wind generated water movements may limit the suitability of some substrates and successful spawning sites are usually remote from depositional effects. Successful embryo development is associated with low nutrient conditions, with high dissolved oxygen (&gt;7 mg L-1) and with low un-ionized ammonia (&gt;12.5 μg L-1) in the interstitial water of spawning substrates. Shallow-water spawning appears to be the common strategy of colonizing lake trout. Some deepwater spawning in the Great Lakes may reflect initial colonization in shallow-water and adaptation to later increases in water level, but some may also reflect unique behavioural and physiological adaptations. Temperature is an important cue, and many wild and hatchery stocks spawn at 8 to 13°C with latitudinal shifts in the actual time of spawning. These requirements are summarized as a dichotomous key for evaluation of approaches to restoration of lost or damaged lake trout stocks. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The setting expansion is an important property for a phosphate-bonded investment material. This research was undertaken to investigate a test that might be suitable for its measurement when used in a Standard. In the 'Casting-Ring Test', the investment sample is contained in a steel ring and expands to displace a precisely positioned pin. Variables with the potential to alter routine reproduction of the value were investigated. The vacuum-mixer model is a production laboratory variable that must not be ignored and for this reason, experiments were repeated using a different vacuum-mixer located at a second test site. Restraint by the rigid ring material increased expansion, while force on the pin reduced it. Expansion was specific to the lining selected. Increased environmental temperature decreased the final value. Expansion was still taking place at a time at which its value might be measured. However, when these factors are set, the reproducibility of values for setting expansion was good at both test sites (coefficient of variation 14%, at most). The results revealed that with the control that is available reliable routine measurement is possible in a Standard test. The inter-laboratory variable, vacuum-mixer model, produced significant differences and it should be the subject of further investigation.

TI  - A review of the likely effects of climate change on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta, with particular reference to water temperature and flow
VL  - 75

SP  - 2381-2447
AB  - The present paper reviews the effects of water temperature and flow on migrations, embryonic development, hatching, emergence, growth and life-history traits in light of the ongoing climate change with emphasis on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. The expected climate change in the Atlantic is for milder and wetter winters, with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, decrease in ice-covered periods and frequent periods with extreme weather. Overall, thermal limits for salmonids are species specific. Scope for activity and growth and optimal temperature for growth increase with temperature to an optimal point before constrain by the oxygen content of the water. The optimal temperature for growth decreases with increasing fish size and varies little among populations within species, whereas the growth efficiency may be locally adapted to the temperature conditions of the home stream during the growth season. Indirectly, temperature influences age and size at smolting through its effect on growth. Time of spawning, egg hatching and emergence of the larvae vary with temperature and selective effects on time of first feeding. Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality. Future research challenges are summarized at the end of the paper. (C) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

TI  - The potential future impact of climate warming and other human activities on the productive capacity of Canada's lake fisheries: A meta-model
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SP  - 152-167
AB  - A simple meta-model was used to examine how climate warming and stresses due to other human activities might affect the productive capacity of fisheries in all of Canada's lakes. Recent estimates of lake resource characteristics by secondary watershed and area size-class provided the basis for the model. Potential fishery productivity was estimated using a variant of the Schlesinger and Regier (1982) model which had lake mean depth, total dissolved solids concentration, and mean annual air temperature as inputs. A business-as-usual climate change scenario (SRES A2) was used to estimate worst case future temperature increases (4.5-8.3°C by the 2080s). The stress index from Chu et al. (2003) was used as a proxy for the impact on fisheries of other human activities. Projected populations for the SRES A2 scenario were used to scale future stress index levels. Potential biotic responses to warming were represented in two ways; the first as potential biotic displacement of currently dominant species when temperature rose beyond their preferred range and the second as potential biotic adaptation of other species, particularly in species rich areas, replacing displaced species. Potential productive capacity of fisheries in all Canadian lakes was 361,000 tonnes for the baseline climate norms period of 1961-1990. Climate warming increased productivity by 80.7% in the 2080s but stress reduced levels by 19.4% in the norms period and held the increase to 10.3% in the 2080s. Biotic displacement alone resulted in large decreases in productivity, by 65.2% in the 2080s and, when stress was added, by 79.5%. Biotic adaptation largely offset displacement. Applying stress and both biotic responses productivity was reduced by 31.4% in the 2080s from the unstressed norms baseline or 12% with stress added. Further investigations are needed to better establish the likely extent of stress impacts and potential biotic responses to climate warming in Canada's lakes. © 2009 AEHMS.

It is shown that the system takes into account the dynamics of clutch development in time and serves for selection of the characteristic regimes of friction pair operation, service life calculations and tests, and also for correction of these regimes.

AB  - A 2D G-S pseudo-homogeneous steady-state plug flow, non-isobaric and non-isothermal model is used to investigate the effects of operating conditions and catalyst thermal properties on the behaviour of a multi-tubular fixed bed for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. This simulator allows observing, quantifying and discussing the influences of the gas velocity, the tube diameter, the type of catalyst used (monolithic foam or extrudates) and the heat conductivity of the support (alumina or silicon carbide). The observed responses are the effective thermal parameters of the catalytic bed, the radial and axial temperature profiles and the global performances of the reactor (yield, productivity and selectivity). Thermal properties of the support exhibit a strong influence when low fluid velocities and/or large tube diameters are employed. Because of the high void fraction of a foam structure these effects are less pronounced than with packed beds. This structural difference allows a wider range of operating conditions in terms of fluid velocity and tube diameter but underlines the necessity to tune the void fraction of a foam bed to obtain the best compromise between its volumetric catalytic activity and a good thermal behaviour.

TI  - Chapter 5 All-Atom Protein Folding with Free-Energy Forcefields
VL  - 83
SP  - 181
AB  - Using the free-energy approach, we have folded more than 13 proteins to near-native conformations in simulations that started from extended conformations. We started with three helical proteins using the optimized BHT that were earlier folded in PFF01. The forcefield correctly predicts the native-like states at lowest energies for these proteins. We then studied folding of larger helical proteins (50-60 amino acids) using evolutionary algorithm. In certain cases, we observe many metastable conformations which have same secondary structures with different arrangement. Mirror Abhinav/images also seem to have competing energies and make selection difficult. Next, we studied six hairpins in PFF02 to study to folding of proteins β-sheet secondary structure. All of the six hairpins fold into native-like conformations with correct pattern of backbone hydrogen bonds. The correct hydrogen bond pattern ensures that the hairpin has the correct bend and the side chains are also projected in the same directions. There are not many helical metastable conformations for these hairpins except the C-terminal domain of protein G. This hairpin did not fold predictively and most simulations were stuck in higher energy helical like conformations. We finally studied a three-stranded β-sheet and a mixed protein which constitutes both helix and β-sheets with optimized BHT. Both these proteins were reproducibly and predictively folded in PFF02. The overview of these folding simulations is given in Table IX. We have, therefore, studied proteins spanning both helix and sheet secondary structural elements. Five helical, six hairpins, one three-stranded β-sheet and one mixed protein were folded in PFF02 using stochastic optimization methods. The average RMSD for the lowest energy structures to their respective native conformation for these 13 proteins is only 2.87 Å. The study included both helical and sheet like proteins along with a mixed system varying from 12 to 56 amino acids. PFF02 is thus able to predict the native state of a wide range of proteins at the global minimum of their free-energy surface and the basin hopping technique and evolutionary algorithm were able to locate this free-energy surface. Protein folding with free-energy methods is much faster than the direct simulation of the folding pathway by kinetic methods such as MD. Using just standard PCs we can fold a simple hairpin with fifteen to 20 amino acids in a matter of hours, at most in a day. Unfortunately even for free-energy methods the computational cost rises steeply with the system size and for this reason it is impossible to test the full range of applicability of PFF02 for large family of proteins in a direct folding study. There is, however, an indirect way to test the viability of the free-energy forcefield using a large database (decoy set) of possible conformations for a given protein, including some near-native conformations. The second ingredient in protein-folding studies, aside from the forcefield, is the simulation protocols, which ultimately determine whether the global optimum of the forcefield is determined accurately and reliably. We have therefore attempted to develop and adopt such methods, for example, the stochastic tunneling or the basin hopping technique, which had proven successful in early folding studies for small proteins, in order to find a particularly efficient algorithm. We experimented with all parameters of these methods that included the number of steps and starting and final temperatures. BHT was modified by increasing the number of steps with every basin hopping cycle and the starting temperatures for annealing were taken from an exponential distribution. This protocol increased the convergence of the basin hopping simulations. This protocol was further modified to a "greedy" version, which always retains the best energy conformation found so far. These improvements together increased the speed and reliability of the simulations and resulted in lower final energies, which is the goal for these optimization problems. One of the key limitations of these methods is that they map the global optimization problem onto a single fictitious dynamical process. In this type of simulation protocol, the molecule constructs one trajectory starting somewhere in the unfolded ensemble, which hopefully converges toward the native conformation. Even with standard basin hopping simulations, several simulations are necessary to obtain a predictive and reproducible result. In the standard protocol the simulations are completely independent of one another. This raises the obvious question, whether an improved convergence can be obtained by coupling a number of concurrent dynamical processes. The second, related question concerns the largest number of concurrent processes that can be coupled together to speed the overall search. In this respect, optimization-based methods have a significant advantage over traditional kinetic methods, because the latter must ultimately strive to construct one single consecutive trajectory. The only option to speed the simulation for a single trajectory is the parallelization of the energy and force evaluation, which requires a large amount of data transfer. The optimization methods using a large number of concurrent dynamical processes, on the other hand, are able to use coarse-grained strategies in which a single processor performs one of many largely independent simulations. We have implemented an evolutionary algorithm on massively parallel architectures such as the BlueGene computer. The algorithm is implemented in a master-client model which keeps a diverse population on the master and the clients sample the protein landscape simultaneously and return to the master. The algorithm scales very well with the number of processors used (up to 4096 tested on the IBM BlueGene). Using this algorithm, we folded various proteins such as 40 amino acid HIV accessory protein (1F4I) and 54 amino acid engrailed homeodomain protein (1ENH) in a single day. The folding of the engrailed homeodomain protein was carried out in a single day using 512 processors on the Barcelona Mare Nostrum Supercomputer, the current largest supercomputer in Europe. This is a great achievement as the folding of a protein of comparable size required about 4 months using 50 processors in earlier studies. The folding of the tryptophan zipper proteins (1LE0) was possible in only 14 min using 128 processors. Using PFF02 along with modified versions of the BHT, we could fold several protein structures starting from completely extended conformations. These include various helical proteins, the tryptophan cage protein (1L2Y), the HIV accessory protein (1F4I), and a potassium channel blocker protein (1WQC) which were earlier folded in PFF01. The tryptophan cage protein is a widely studied model for protein folding both theoretically and experimentally. The HIV accessory protein and potassium channel blockers are biologically important proteins. The HIV accessory protein destroys the host cell's ability to survive by binding to a host receptor and restricting an important enzyme to activate the cell's immune system. Potassium channel blockers are toxic venom peptides involved in blocking of potassium channel in cells. We also folded much larger and widely studied model proteins (both experimentally and theoretically) like the engrailed homeodomain protein (1ENH) and E-domain of the staphylococcal protein A (1EDK), which were folded with the evolutionary algorithm. We then investigated the folding of various β-hairpins in PFF02. These hairpins included tryptophan zipper protein (1LE0), HIV-1 V3 loops (1NIZ, 1U6U), designed stable β-proteins (2EDK, 1J4M), and the C-terminal hairpin of G protein to experimental resolution. The tryptophan zipper protein and C-terminal hairpin of protein G have been subjected to many theoretical and experimental studies. The HIV-1 V3 loops are highly homologous loops which have a different hydrogen bonding pattern responsible for coreceptor selectivity by the virus. The loop conformation is responsible for selecting infection of T cells or macrophages. The folding of these loops (1NIZ and 1U6U) is particularly encouraging because PFF02 can distinguish these very similar sequences and correctly predicts a one residue shift in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern resulting in different side chains orientation responsible for coreceptor selectivity of the virus protein. The experimentally stable hairpins serve as good model systems for studies on β-sheet formation and folding. Apart from two-stranded β-hairpins, we also studied the folding of the three-stranded GSGS peptide. The GSGS peptide is a designed stable three-stranded β-sheet with glycine-serine (GS) bends and has been a model system for three-stranded β-sheet formation. We finally studied the folding of αββ-zinc finger domain protein 1BHI. Zinc fingers are among the most abundant proteins in eukaryotic genomes and occur in many DNA-binding domains and transcription factors. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 638
SP  - 249-254
AB  - A field site in the Coachella Valley of California was selected as an ideal experimental location to study the effect of organic amendments on soil ecology and crop productivity. The high temperatures, low rainfall, and frequent irrigation of low desert agriculture leads to rapid breakdown of organic residue and soils naturally low in organic matter. Because organic carbon is relatively scarce in desert soils, amending with compost or cover crops may have a more dramatic and easily detectable effect than in temperate regions. Our experimental treatments included all possible combinations of summer cover crops and vegetable crop management systems. Summer cover crops were dry fallow or sudangrass or cowpea. Fall lettuce was followed by spring cantaloupe. Both crops were continuously managed as either conventional, organic, or an integrated system that reduced insecticide applications. The experimental design allowed direct comparisons of many combinations of organic or conventional fertility and pest management regimes. Yields in the first year of study were lower in the organic plots. However, yields for the following year for conventional and organic systems were equal despite less effective insect control in the organic system. Soil organic matter content was correlated with soil structure and lettuce yield. However, the range of organic carbon was very narrow (0.5-1%) and it was correlated with the clay percentage of the soils. The negative charges of the surface of the clays act as an absorbent interface where the organic molecules attach. Attachment to the clay surfaces protected organic matter from microbial degradation so that it could accumulate in the soil, but the amount of organic carbon accumulated was restricted to the limited amount of colloidal or clay particles present in these sandy desert soils. Soil microbial respiration was related to the amount of organic carbon added as either cover crop or compost, indicating that microbes were degrading and using the organic residues as an energy source.

SP  - 449-464
AB  - The principal female reproductive variates were studied in the cold-water loliginid squid Loligo gahi d'Orbigny, 1835 from Falkland Islands' waters. Ripe egg size ranged from 1.4 x 1.9 to 1.8 x 2.8 mm with average diameters on random axes of 1.66-2.39 mm. The egg size of autumn-winter spawners was larger than that of spring-summer spawners. Ripe egg size increases with female size in individuals from the same cohort. During maturation the initially unimodal size distribution of oocytes in the ovary becomes bimodal due to the formation of a batch of ripe eggs (540-13,820 oocytes). The total yolk oocyte stock ranges from 1100 to 21,000, and potential fecundity varies from 1800 to 35,200 oocytes. Larger females have higher potential fecundity. The actual fecundity was estimated to be about 50% of the potential fecundity. The main adaptations to cold water maturation and spawning in L. gahi females are the high proportion of yolk oocytes in the ovary and a shift of the main spawning peak to spring.

VL  - 57
IS  - 3
SP  - 531-537
AB  - 4′, 5′‐Diiodofluorescein dextran has been synthesized by iodination of fluorescein dextran and it was used as a sensitizer in photodynamic killing of amoebae of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. Amoebae from axenic strain AX2 incubated in the presence of 4′,5′‐diiodofluorescein dextran efficiently internalized the molecule by fluid‐phase pinocytosis. Subsequently, illumination of cells showed dose‐ and time‐dependent loss of viability. The tertiary amine, 2,4‐ diaza[2,2,2]bicyclooctane, significantly decreased phototoxicity, whereas the presence of D2O increased phototoxicity. These effects were fully consistent with a role for excited‐state singlet oxygen generated inside the endosomal compartments in the mechanism of photoinjury. A strategy was developed to enrich for temperature‐sensitive Dictyostelium endocytosis mutants in a nitrosoguanidine mutagenized population. Incubation with 4′,5′‐diiodofluorescein dextran at 27°C to load endosomal compartments was followed by light treatment to kill parent‐type cells selectively. In contrast, mutants unable to internalize the fluid‐phase marker would survive the treatment. Six temperature‐sensitive clones were selected that grew normally at 21°C but did not grow at 27°C. They all showed markedly decreased fluid‐phase pinocytosis capacity at nonpermissive temperature as compared to their activity at 21 °C. These mutant strains should be useful in studies designed to characterize endocytosis mechanisms in Dictyostelium. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

TI  - Methodological and Statistical Considerations for Exercise-Related Hormone Evaluations
VL  - 20
IS  - 2
SP  - 90-108
AB  - Improvements in laboratory techniques have allowed research related to exercise endocrinology to flourish. The emerging literature, however, is often inconsistent and contradictory. The discrepancies in research findings are possibly the result of poor control of confounding variables and/or inappropriate methodologies or analyses. Environmental and pretesting behavioural conditions must be standardised to minimise the influence of variables not directly related to the investigation. Environmental temperature and relative humidity, alcohol, caffeine and nicotine intake, prandial state, sleep deprivation and previous exercise can each alter hormonal responses to exercise. Both prescription and over-the-counter medications can also modify normal hormonal secretions thereby confusing exercise-induced findings. Specimen collection and analysis procedures must be controlled carefully. Changes in plasma volume related to postural changes or tourniquet-induced stasis can confound attempts to isolate exercise-related endocrine responses. The established circadian and rhythmical variations characteristic of many hormones need to be controlled. The specimen selection (plasma, serum, urine, etc), collection, storage and analysis procedures should be carefully planned and evaluated. The magnitude of haemolysis, analytical and biological variation must also be monitored. Isolating the hormonal perturbations resulting from a particular exercise variable can be very difficult. Exercise intensity, duration, mode, frequency and volume may each have specific effects on the endocrine changes seen with exercise and training. Furthermore, hormonal responses to exercise are dependent upon initial training status and fitness level. The statistical procedures and data presentation options selected to convey experimental findings can bias experimental results. The descriptive and inferential statistics to be used for data analysis should be preplanned and consistent with the underlying assumptions of the analytical procedure. Careful consideration should be given to the biological relevance of statistically significant findings. In some cases, data transformations (e.g. absolute vs relative changes, logarithmic) should be considered for analysis or presentation. Given the individual nature of hormonal responses to exercise, emphasis should be placed presenting individual data. Other considerations, including age, sex, racial origin and disease conditions need to be controlled for when trying to examine exercise-induced hormone changes. © 1995, Adis International Limited.

TI  - How to detect polymorphisms undergoing selection in marine fishes? A review of methods and case studies, including flatfishes
VL  - 51
IS  - 3
SP  - 167-182
AB  - Populations of marine organisms are potentially affected by numerous selective pressures such as temperature and salinity, or anthropogenic pressures such as xenobiotics that may preclude adaptation to particular habitats. Such selective pressures may also affect their demography. Examples include modifications of the population dynamics through shifts in growth rate, and in life history traits affecting fitness such as size or age of first reproduction. However, the documentation of variation in phenotypically plastic traits specific to distinct environments cannot be taken as the ultimate proof that natural selection has occurred. Measurement of the impact of selection and subsequent local adaptation of fish populations based exclusively on morphological or physiological characters is one of the most difficult things to achieve because it depends on the use of phenotypic characters that closely match the genotype. Molecular markers can help to overcome this problem and, under some circumstances, can record the footprints of selection. A combination of polymorphisms that are under selection and those that are not can provide complementary information. In this paper, we review how and why selection can be detected at the molecular level, using genetic markers analysed in a population genetic framework. We then report and discuss case studies in fish. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 48

AB  - A silicalite-1/α-Al2O3 zeolite membrane with high para-xylene (PX) selectivity was tested for isomerization of meta-xylene (MX) to PX. Two HZSM-5 catalyst packing methods were compared in the membrane reactor: (1) catalyst in contact with the Al2O3 substrate and (2) catalyst in contact with the membrane layer. The second packing method exhibited higher efficiency for MX isomerization. Compared with a conventional reactor, the membrane reactor with the second catalyst packing method had increased rates of 26.0% and 31.2% for the PX yield and selectivity, respectively, at a temperature of 270 °C. PX selectivity and yield increased as the flow rate of the sweep gas increased because of the enhanced PX flux through the zeolite membrane. Increasing the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) could reduce the contribution of membrane permeation to PX productivity. It was also revealed that MFI zeolite membranes exhibit a high stability for xylene isomerization. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - The adaptive nature of non-food collection for the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius
VL  - 32
IS  - 1
SP  - 105-112
AB  - 1. Many animals forage for non-food objects, such as nesting materials. In many organisms, the depots of such objects can be expansive, and are not intuitively adaptive. This study empirically explores varying theories for why these depots exist in the Florida harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex badius. 2. The Florida harvester ant, like its western congeners, collects and deposits large quantities of non-food objects around its nest entrance. The vast majority of objects sampled from colonies in this study population were charcoal pieces whereas most western species collect pebbles. 3. Objects in these depots can number in the millions, suggesting a large cost to this behaviour and strengthening an adaptationist argument. 4. Many hypotheses have been suggested for these depots, including temperature and water modification and territoriality. No evidence was found to support the results of a previous study which found that charcoal depots deter other ant species. 5. The depots do not appear to affect soil hydrology, but do slightly increase soil temperature at the very top of the nest. In an attempt to estimate the seasonal fitness of colonies with and without charcoal depots, no statistical difference was detected in sexual investment between treatment groups. 6. These results suggest that the charcoal depots may be selectively advantageous through temperature modification, but may serve alternate functions that are species and habitat specific. © 2007 The Royal Entomological Society.

VL  - 92
IS  - 2
SP  - 320-331
AB  - Chinese hamster ovary cells were heated in the G1 phase of the cell cycle following synchronization by mitotic selection. The following temperatures and durations were used: 41.5°C for 200 min, 43.5°C for 50 min, and 45.5°C for 12.5, 17.5, and 20.0 min. Individual cells and their progeny were photographed by time-lapse cinemicrography and followed by single-frame analysis of the films. The ability of the heated cells to successfully complete division at the end of each posthyperthermia generation was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. For 41.5°C, the division probabilities were decreased only slightly with each generation. For 45.5°C for 12.5 min, the division probabilities were 60 to 70% for the first four divisions following hyperthermia. For the more severe treatments, the reduction in division probability was greatest at the first division following heating, where the values ranged from 21 to 27%. The generation times for these treatments were also prolonged in a dose-dependent manner which was greatest for the heated generation. The Generation 0 times ranged from 20 hr for treatments of 41.5°C for 200 min to durations of 50 to 60 hr for the more severe treatments. The generation times for the posttreatment generations did not exceed 25 hr compared to 11 to 13 hr in controls. The duration of mitosis of dividing cells was not prolonged proportionally to any greater extent than were generation times. Also there was no increase in prolongation of the generation before the one in which death occurred.

AB  - We might think of them as living on the very edge of existence. Referred to as extremophiles, these microorganisms exhibit the most radical capacity for adaptation in those harsh environments that are just barely conducive to the existence of cellular life. Unlocking the mechanisms and understanding the evolutionary development that allows these simple organisms to thrive can teach us much about microbiology in extremis. Highly diverse, these microorganisms are found nearly everywhere. One example, thermophiles are microorganisms that thrive at temperatures above the mesophilic range of 25-40 degrees C. Until recently, due to their extreme environment, the study of thermophiles was limited. However with the advent of new tools, particularly genetic analysis, remarkable strides have been made. Thermophiles: Biology and Technology at High Temperatures presents a cogent summary of the progress made in studying these extremophiles. Discover how thermophiles demonstrate extremes that indicate a lack of evolutionary constraints Much is being learned from the study of thermophiles, especially our understanding of biology at the molecular level and the genetic mechanisms that permit adaptation. Included in this volume is a discussion of protective strategies of thermophiles, including their thermostability, which allow them to maintain functional proteins. It also investigates whether hyperthermophiles employ protein phosphorylation-dephosphryation as a molecular regulatory mechanism, and provides significant clues regarding the synthesis of protein. By studying this extreme example, its subtle, yet exaggerated response mechanisms, and its development over the course of many short-lived generations, we may begin to understand the mechanisms in diseases linked to improper protein folding, and also begin to more fully understand the ingenious design of DNA, and all that such an understanding implies regarding the survival of human life in a rapidly changing environment. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - MALE INCUBATION IN BARN SWALLOWS - THE INFLUENCE OF NEST TEMPERATURE AND SEXUAL SELECTION
VL  - 94
IS  - 3
SP  - 750-759
AB  - Male Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) help their mates to incubate in North America but not in Europe. In this study, conducted at four colonies in southeastern Canada, males contributed an average of 9% of the total amount of incubation during daylight hours. The total percent of time that eggs were incubated (nest attentiveness) by both sexes declined through the day, largely due to a response to increasing temperature. The nest attentiveness of both males and females was negatively correlated with nest temperature (i.e., air temperature near the nest) but not consistently with weather. In general a male seemed to incubate more when his help was needed - early in the day when the female had to recover energy lost during nighttime incubation and late in the incubation period when females should have been most stressed energetically. We found no evidence that male nest attentiveness was affected by their expected opportunity to obtain extra-pair copulations - neither differences in male attractiveness due to tail-length manipulation (shortening or elongation) nor changes in the operational sex ratio affected the male's relative share of incubation duties. Using DNA fingerprinting, we also found that the male contribution was not affected by his paternity in the brood. Since colony size and the mating system of this species appear to be similar in both North America and Europe, the intensity of sexual selection should not differ substantially between these populations. Instead we suggest that nest temperature or feeding conditions are the most likely factors influencing the differences in male incubation behavior between European and North American populations. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 1992.

AB  - This study examined growth and control of two enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 strains in a soft Hispanic type cheese (Queso Fresco). Cheese was made in the laboratory using a commercial procedure and after inoculation it was stored under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 8 to 30 °C. The minimum temperature that allowed growth of E. coli in the unmodified normal cheese (pH 6.6) was 10 °C. No growth of either strains was observed during a 2 month storage period at 8 °C. Accumulated data from the growth studies were used for development of models relating square root of 1 LT (LT = lag time) and specific growth rate, to temperature. The effect of selected antimicrobials (potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, and sodium lactate) added to milk or cheese on the growth arid survival of these pathogens at various storage temperatures was also evaluated. Addition of sodium benzoate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6.6) or addition of potassium sorbate (0.3%) to cheese (pH 6) made from milk acidified to pH 5.9 with propionic acid, had a significant impact on delaying or preventing growth of the pathogens. © 1995.

VL  - 19

SP  - 249-262
AB  - The expansion and contraction of forest tree populations during the climatic oscillations of the Pleistocene implies changes in rates of mortalitity and survival in different parts of a species’ range at different times, Different genotypes are favoured in expanding versus contracting populations. Hybridisation is common among many tree and shrub genera in New Zealand. A group of related, more or less frequently hybridising, species forms a common gene-pool or “coenospecies”, whose constituent taxa vary, at anyone time, in their ecological isolation and taxonomic distinction. The evolutionary significance of this lies in the possibility that forms which are now rare or intermediate may have been more common at other times, as the altitudinal and geographical range of a coenospecies has fluctuated in response to climatic change.Glacial and interglacial climates select for different physiological tolerances, while the transition periods select for demographic characteristics favouring population expansion or contraction. I propose that, during the prolonged cooling phases of the Pleistocene, sub-alpine and montane species invaded more diverse forest at lower altitudes, while components of the latter became progressively restricted to the most favourable niches within their ranges. These processes imply a ‘K-selection ’ regime. The much shorter warming phases witnessed rapid population expansion in some taxa, implying ‘r-selection’. These ideas are discussed with reference to the ‘fusca’ beeches in New Zealand. © 1989 Journal of the Royal Society of New Zeland.

AB  - The effects of fluctuating diel temperature cycles on survival, growth, plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations, liver weight, and liver glycogen of juvenile coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch were determined. Temperature cycles (10-13°, 9-15°, 8-17°, and 6.5-20°C) were selected to simulate observed temperatures in clear-cuts of southeastern Alaska. Different levels of feeding, including starvation, were used in each of the tests. LT50s (peak temperature within a cycle producing 50% mortality) were 28°C for age-0 fish (3 50 mg) and 26°C for age-II fish (22-g presmolts). Cyclic temperatures for 40 d, averaging 11°C daily, did not influence growth of age-0 fish on any food ration as compared to controls held at a constant 11°C. Plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations were significantly greater in fish maintained for 20 d in the 6.5-20°C cycle but not different in fish in 10-13° and 9-15°C cycles or a constant 11°C. These elevated concentrations may be indicators of long-term stress. Plasma cortisol concentrations were lower in starved fish than in fed fish at all temperature regimes; however, fluctuating temperature did not enhance starvation effects on cortisol levels. Diel temperature cycles did not affect liver weights or liver glycogen concentrations. © by the American Fisheries Society 1986.

TI  - Effects of climate change and commercial fishing on Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua
VL  - 56
SP  - 213-273
AB  - During the course of the last century, populations of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua L. have undergone dramatic declines in abundance across their biogeographic range, leading to debate about the relative roles of climatic warming and overfishing in driving these changes. In this chapter, we describe the geographic distributions of this important predator of North Atlantic ecosystems and document extensive evidence for limitations of spatial movement and local adaptation from population genetic markers and electronic tagging. Taken together, this evidence demonstrates that knowledge of spatial population ecology is critical for evaluating the effects of climate change and commercial harvesting. To explore the possible effects of climate change on cod, we first describe thermal influences on individual physiology, growth, activity and maturation. We then evaluate evidence that temperature has influenced population-level processes including direct effects on recruitment through enhanced growth and activity, and indirect effects through changes to larval food resources. Although thermal regimes clearly define the biogeographic range of the species, and strongly influence many aspects of cod biology, the evidence that population declines across the North Atlantic are strongly linked to fishing activity is now overwhelming. Although there is considerable concern about low spawning stock biomasses, high levels of fishing activity continues in many areas. Even with reduced fishing effort, the potential for recovery from low abundance may be compromised by unfavourable climate and Allee effects. Current stock assessment and management approaches are reviewed, alongside newly advocated methods for monitoring stock status and recovery. However, it remains uncertain whether the rebuilding of cod to historic population sizes and demographic structures will be possible in a warmer North Atlantic. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solar thermal collectors represent a widespread type of system to convert solar energy. The economic viability of applications of solar energy may be improved by increasing the quantity of usable energy delivered per unit area of collector. This is achieved by the use of selective black coatings which have a high degree of solar absorption, maintaining high energy input to the solar system, while simultaneously suppressing the emission of thermal infrared radiation. A new electrolyte has been developed for the deposition of black nickel-cobalt selective absorber coatings useful in solar collectors for photothermal conversion of solar energy. The influence of electrolyte composition and operating parameters on the properties of black nickel-cobalt coatings are reported.

TI  - Cold shock injury and ecological costs of rapid cold hardening in the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera : Aphididae)
VL  - 50
IS  - 4
SP  - 277-284
AB  - The ability of first instar nymphs and newly moulted pre-reproductive adults of the grain aphid S. avenae to rapidly cold harden was investigated. When nymphs reared at 20 degreesC were transferred directly to -8 degreesC for 3 h, there was 18% survival. This exposure was selected as the discriminating temperature. Maximum increases in survival were achieved by acclimating nymphs for 2 h at 0 degreesC and adults for 3 h at 0 degreesC, resulting in survival of 83% and 68%, respectively. Cooling nymphs from 10 to 0 degreesC at different rates (1, 0.1 and 0.05 degreesC min(-1)) also increased cold hardiness, with the slowest rate of 0.05 degreesC min(-1) conferring the highest survival following exposure to the discriminating temperature. Adult aphids also expressed a rapid cold hardening response but to a lesser extent, with survival increasing from 16% to 68% following 3 h at 0 degreesC. There were no 'ecological costs' associated with rapid cold hardening in terms of development, longevity or fecundity. The data support the hypothesis that rapid cold hardening can be induced during the cooling phase of natural thermal temperature cycles, allowing insects to track daily changes in environmental temperatures.

SP  - 225-230
AB  - The root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, was cultured monoxenically on oriental-melon (Cucumis melo L.) roots transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes at various temperatures. The developmental zero degree of the nematode was 10.9°C. The day-degrees for the onset of oviposition were 293, and 473 for completing one generation after inoculation with 2nd-stage juveniles. There were no significant differences in the dimensions of eggs and pre-parasitic 2nd-stage juveniles between transformed roots and intact plant roots, although a slight temperature-dependency was seen in body length, tail length, and the a-avalue of juveniles. Regarding the infectivity on six differential host plants, juveniles produced on transformed roots were the same as those produced on intact host plant roots. These results suggest that the transformed root system is appropriate for culture of root-knot nematodes under sterile conditions. © 1992, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity in reproductive traits: importance in the life history of Helix aspersa (Mollusca : Helicidae) in a recently colonized habitat
VL  - 69
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-39
AB  - Reproductive traits of the land snail Helix aspersa Muller were investigated under artificial conditions from two samples, one collected from a population exposed to unpredictable human pressures in its natural environment, i.e. a recently created polder area with intensive agriculture, and the other from a snail farm in which animals were reared under constant conditions defined as 'optimal' for growth and reproduction. Results were compared with data collected from natural populations of the same region (Brittany) and from habitats spanning the environmental heterogeneity of the range of the species. A large part of the variation among populations could be explained by different phenotypic covariances between shell size, clutch size and egg size, but not by the number of clutches per snail. Thus, the higher egg production of snails from the polders was related to (i) a strong correlation between clutch size and shell size, shell size being in the upper limit of the overall range for the region concerned; (ii) an uncommonly low egg weight in comparison with the 'norm' of Helix aspersa, this trait seeming to be involved in a trade-off with clutch size. Second clutches were smaller than the first ones, but their eggs were significantly heavier. This difference may be linked to a size-dependent mortality of juveniles during winter which arises in all populations in which hibernation occurs as an adaptation to low temperatures. In addition to the selective regime usually involved for populations of helicid snails from Western Europe, several unpredictable mortality factors occurred in the polders area: herbicide and pesticide treatments (lethal for young snails), human predation (lethal for adults) and burning (lethal for all snails). Life-history patterns of Helix aspersa are discussed in relation to its ability to successfully colonize a large range of habitats modified by humans, to such an extent that it can become a pest.

TI  - Lipid remodeling in wild and selectively bred hard clams at low temperatures in relation to genetic and physiological parameters
VL  - 209
IS  - 23
SP  - 4663-4675
AB  - A temperature decrease usually induces an ordering effect in membrane phospholipids, which can lead to membrane dysfunction. Poikilotherms inhabiting eurythermal environments typically counteract this temperature effect by remodeling membrane lipids as stipulated in the homeoviscous adaptation theory (HVA). Hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria, can suffer high overwintering mortalities in the Gulf of St Lawrence, Canada. The selectively bred M. mercenaria var. notata can have higher overwintering mortalities than the wild species, thus suggesting that the two varieties have different degrees of adaptation to low temperatures. The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in lipid composition of soft tissues in wild and selected hard clams in relation to their metabolic and genetic characteristics. Clams were placed at the northern limit of their distribution from August 2003 to May 2004; they were exposed to a gradual temperature decrease and then maintained at < 0 degrees C for 3.5 months. This study is the first to report a major remodeling of lipids in this species as predicted by HVA; this remodeling involved a sequential response of the phospholipid to sterol ratio as well as in levels of 22:6n-3 and non-methylene interrupted dienoic fatty acids. Hard clams showed an increase in 20:5n-3 as temperature decreased, but this was not maintained during overwintering, which suggests that 20:5n-3 may have been used for eicosanoid biosynthesis as a stress response to environmental conditions. Selectively bred hard clams were characterized by a higher metabolic demand and a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at several genetic loci due to a deficit in heterozygote frequency compared with wild clams, which is believed to impose additional stress and render these animals more vulnerable to overwintering mortality. Finally, an intriguing finding is that the lower metabolic requirements of wild animals coincide with a lower unsaturation index of their lipids, as predicted by Hulbert's theory of membranes as pacemakers of metabolism.

VL  - 75

SP  - 371-384
AB  - The mollusc Patella ferruginea, endemic to the Mediterranean, is the most endangered marine species of the list of the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC and it is presently under serious risk of extinction. Survival, growth rates and life-history of this species were studied for the first time in this species. A total of 570 specimens (420 introduced in a new habitat and 150 as control) were marked and monitored over a three-year period. Growth rates observed were mainly related to the availability of microalgal food. The mortality rate of transplanted specimens was high (50% mortality immediately after transplant). Seasonality in growth rates was observed in both control and transplanted specimens, with greater growth rates detected in spring-summer (warm season) than in autumn-winter (cold season). Smaller specimens of P. ferruginea had the greatest growth rates in comparison with the bigger specimens, therefore the potential ability to adapt in a new habitat was higher for small specimens immediately after removal. An elevated growth rate (appearing as a light-ring in the border of the shell) was detected immediately after translocation, following which growth rate progressively stabilized over time. Using differential equations and the von Bertalanffy model, the longevity of P. ferruginea was estimated to range between 8.89 and 35.72 years depending on the environment. Transplantation should not be considered as a conservation measure given the elevated mortality rate.

VL  - 31

SP  - 900-906
AB  - Objective: To determine the optimum rate of low-flow hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (LF), following circulatory arrest (DHCA) on brain oxygenation (bO2), extracellular dopamine (DA), phosphorylation of select neuroregulatory proteins responsible for neuronal injury, and survival following ischemic brain injury: CREB, Erk1/2, Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax. Methods: The piglets were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cooled to 18 °C. They were then subjected to 30 min of DHCA followed by 1 h of LF at 20, 50, or 80 ml/(kg/min), rewarmed, separated from CPB, and maintained for 2 h. The bO2 was measured by quenching of phosphorescence; DA by microdialysis; phosphorylation of CREB, ERK1/2, Akt, Bcl-2, and Bax by Western blots. The results are means ± SD for seven experiments. Results: Pre-bypass bO2 was 47.4 ± 4.2 mmHg and decreased to 1.9 ± 0.8 mmHg during DHCA. At the end of LF at 20, 50, and 80 ml/(kg/min), bO2 was 11.8 ± 1.6, 26 ± 1.8, and 33.9 ± 2.6 mmHg, respectively. The DA increased 510-fold relative to control (p &lt; 0.001) by 15 min of LF-20 with maximum increase occurring at 45 min. With LF-50, increase in DA was not statistically significant and no increase was observed when LF-80 was used. Bcl-2 immunoreactivity increased after LF-50 and LF-80 (140 ± 14.5%, p &lt; 0.05 and 202 ± 34%, p &lt; 0.05, respectively). Neither flow increased Bax immunoreactivity. The ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, pCREB, pAkt, pErk increased significantly with increasing the flow rate of LF. Conclusions: The protective effect of LF following DHCA on brain metabolism is dependent on the flow rate. Flow-dependent increase in pCREB, pErk1/2, pAkt, increase in Bcl-2/Bax, and decrease in DA indicated that to minimize DHCA-dependent neuronal injury, LF flow should be above 50 ml/(kg/min). © 2007 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.

VL  - 32

SP  - 37-43
AB  - Four clones of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) were used to assess the magnitude of their responses to seven different temperatures (15.0, 17.5, 20.0, 22.5, 25.0, 27.5 and 30.0°C). A multivariate index of size was obtained using five morphological characteristics simplified by PCA. Among these characteristics, four were measured bilaterally both sides in order to evaluate the fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Fertility was estimated according to the number of nymphs in the reproductive female apparatus. The variability attributed to the environmental and genetic components was estimated using a genetic quantitative model. A large part of the total variability found for size distribution was attributed to differences in temperature (environmental component), but genetic components of variation were also detected. The plastic potential was considered adaptive, since it increases clone survival in unstable environments and allows new habitat exploitation. However, 30°C temperature did not permit clone development and survival. Lower variability in one morphological character, the rostrum, in comparison with the other traits may be the result of a stabilizing selection, in relation to its adaptive value to obtain food. The aphids presented FA in some of the measured characteristics. However, no linear relation was detected for the levels of FA and temperature values and no general pattern of variability was found. The data corroborate the hypothesis that size is more effectively affected than FA by external influences, and consequently, is a much more efficient indicator of environmental stress.

TI  - Spectrophotometric determination of ultra-micro quantity of iron in water by solvent extraction of ferroin
VL  - 14
IS  - 3
SP  - 213-218
AB  - Extractive spectrophotometric determination of trace amounts of iron in water for high pressure boilers, brewing industry etc. has been investigated. To extract ferroin, the complex of 1, 10-phenanthroline and iron (II), from water to chloroform, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate was selected by a preliminary experiment from a number of anionic surface active agents. Ferroin becomes soluble in chloroform when its cationic charge is discountered with dioctyl sulfosuccinate ion. The analytical procedure is as follows. Four ml of purified 7M hydrochloric acid is added to 200 ml of sample solution, which is heated in a water bath of above 80°C for 30 min. After it is cooled to the room temperature, 4 ml of 10% hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and 10 ml of 0.12% 1, 10-phenanthroline solution are added into it. After the solution is neutralized with purified 7M ammonium hydroxide to pH 5.2∼5.8, 10 ml of buffer solution containing sodium acetate and hydrochloric acid is added to adjust the pH to 4.6. The solution is allowed to stand for 30 min. and its pH is lowered to 2.4 with purified 1M hydrochloric acid. The solution is transferred into a separatory funnel, to which are added 3 ml of 1% aqueous sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate solution and 10 ml of chloroform. Then the solution is shaken for 2 min. and the extraction is repeated with two 7 ml portions of choloroform. The extract is collected into a 25 ml volumetric flask containing 3 ml ethanol and diluted to the mark with pure chloroform. The absorbance is measured at 515 mμ in a 50 mm cell, using a reagent blank as a reference. Three ppb of iron can be determined, whereby 90% confidence interval extends from 2.23 ppb to 3.67 ppb. The regression line is given by x=164.112y+0.219, where y is the absorbance for the iron concentration x. © 1965, The Japanese Society of Physical Fitness and Sports Medicine. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trade-offs in thermal adaptation: The need for a molecular to ecological integration
VL  - 79
IS  - 2
SP  - 295-313
AB  - Through functional analyses, integrative physiology is able to link molecular biology with ecology as well as evolutionary biology and is thereby expected to provide access to the evolution of molecular, cellular, and organismic functions; the genetic basis of adaptability; and the shaping of ecological patterns. This paper compiles several exemplary studies of thermal physiology and ecology, carried out at various levels of biological organization from single genes (proteins) to ecosystems. In each of those examples, trade-offs and constraints in thermal adaptation are addressed; these trade-offs and constraints may limit species' distribution and define their level of fitness. For a more comprehensive understanding, the paper sets out to elaborate the functional and conceptual connections among these independent studies and the various organizational levels addressed. This effort illustrates the need for an overarching concept of thermal adaptation that encompasses molecular, organellar, cellular, and whole-organism information as well as the mechanistic links between fitness, ecological success, and organismal physiology. For this data, the hypothesis of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance in animals provides such a conceptual framework and allows interpreting the mechanisms of thermal limitation of animals as relevant at the ecological level. While, ideally, evolutionary studies over multiple generations, illustrated by an example study in bacteria, are necessary to test the validity of such complex concepts and underlying hypotheses, animal physiology frequently is constrained to functional studies within one generation. Comparisons of populations in a latitudinal cline, closely related species from different climates, and ontogenetic stages from riverine clines illustrate how evolutionary information can still be gained. An understanding of temperature-dependent shifts in energy turnover, associated with adjustments in aerobic scope and performance, will result. This understanding builds on a mechanistic analysis of the width and location of thermal windows on the temperature scale and also on study of the functional properties of relevant proteins and associated gene expression mechanisms. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 22

SP  - 124-133
AB  - Population persistence has been studied in a conservation context to predict the fate of small or declining populations. Persistence models have explored effects on extinction of random demographic and environmental fluctuations, but in the face of directional environmental change they should also integrate factors affecting whether a population can adapt. Here, we examine the population-size dependence of demographic and genetic factors and their likely contributions to extinction time under scenarios of environmental change. Parameter estimates were derived from experimental populations of the rainforest species, Drosophila birchii, held in the lab for 10 generations at census sizes of 20, 100 and 1000, and later exposed to five generations of heat-knockdown selection. Under a model of directional change in the thermal environment, rapid extinction of populations of size 20 was caused by a combination of low growth rate (r) and high stochasticity in r. Populations of 100 had significantly higher reproductive output, lower stochasticity in r and more additive genetic variance (VA) than populations of 20, but they were predicted to persist less well than the largest size class. Even populations of 1000 persisted only a few hundred generations under realistic estimates of environmental change because of low VA for heat-knockdown resistance. The experimental results document population-size dependence of demographic and adaptability factors. The simulations illustrate a threshold influence of demographic factors on population persistence, while genetic variance has a more elastic impact on persistence under environmental change. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Grasshopper populations across 2000 m of altitude: Is there life history adaptation?
VL  - 27
IS  - 6
SP  - 733-740
AB  - Life history differentiation along climatic gradients may have allowed a species to extend its geographic range. To explore this hypothesis, we compared eleven Omocestus viridulus (Orthoptera: Acrididae) populations along an altitudinal gradient from 410 to 2440 m in Switzerland, both in the field and laboratory. In situ temperature records indicated a striking decline in available heat sums along the gradient, and field populations at high altitudes reached egg hatching and adulthood much later in the year than at low elevation. The reproductive period at high altitude is thus severely limited by season length, especially during a cool year. However, controlled environment experiments revealed that intrinsic rates of embryonic and juvenile development increased with the populations' altitude of origin. This countergradient variation is largely genetic and conforms to predictions of life history theory. No corresponding differentiation in the overwintering egg stage, a pivotal determinant of phenology, was found. This trait seems conserved within the gomphocerine grasshopper subfamily. Although we found evidence for altitudinal adaptation in development, the potential of O. viridulus to adapt to cool alpine climates appears restricted by a phylogenetic constraint.

TI  - Characterization of sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from skeletal muscle of the freeze tolerant wood frog, Rana sylvatica: the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor and calcium transport systems in control, frozen and thawed states
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 143-152
AB  - In freeze tolerant wood frog Rana sylvatica, the freeze-induced liberation of glucose plays a critical role in survival in response to sub-zero temperature exposure. We have shown that the glycaemic response is linked to selective changes in the expression of hepatic adrenergic receptors through which catecholamines act to produce their hepatic glycogenolytic effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine if skeletal muscle, another catecholamine-sensitive tissue with glycogenolytic potential, displayed similar or different changes. In order to achieve these objectives, skeletal muscle derived from Rana sylvatica was studied in control, frozen and thawed states. In isolated sarcolemmal fractions, freezing effected an 88% decrease in beta (2)-adrenergic receptor expression but was without effect on the calcium pump; while thawing resulted in a recovery of the beta (2)-adrenergic receptor to 60% of control levels and a 2.4-fold increase in calcium transport. In isolated sarcoplasmic reticular fractions, freezing effected a 52% decrease in calcium binding and a 92% decrease in oxalate-stimulated calcium uptake: while thawing elicited partial normalization to control levels to 70% with respect to calcium binding and to 47% with respect to calcium uptake. Freezing and thawing were associated with increases and decreases, receptively, in blued glucose levels but were without effect on skeletal muscle glycogen content. Thus these muscle changes in Rana sylvatica in freezing and thawing are not linked to glycogen breakdown, are different from those previously seen in liver, and may provide a role in recovery of muscle function during thawing by protecting glycogen stores for contraction and maximizing extracellular calcium for excitation-contraction coupling in the frozen state. The involvement of thyroid hormone in triggering these muscle changes is discussed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The temperature dependence of selection efficiency and the expression of the genes controlling the rate of embryonic development in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 27
IS  - 6
SP  - 457-464
AB  - We have already shown that selection of heterogeneous D. melanogaster populations for the rate of embryogenesis at 32 degrees C may produce populations, in which 50% of the larvae are hatched 20-40 min earlier, i.e., 2-4% more rapidly than, in the control. Highly inbred strains were obtained from the selected populations and develop 5-7% more rapidly than the control populations. Here we studied separately the effects of temperature on the efficiency of selection and expression of the selected genotype. With this in view, multiple (9-15 rounds) selection of the first 10% of the larvae was performed at 17, 25, and 32 degrees C and the mean duration of embryogenesis (hatching of 50% larvae) at these three temperatures was determined in the entire selected population. Selection proved to be almost equally efficient at all temperatures. On the contrary, expression of the selected genotypes markedly depended on temperature: the rate of embryogenesis of the selected populations exceeded that in the control at 17 degrees C by 1.1%, at 25 degrees C by 2.5%, and at 32 degrees C by 3.5%. In the inbred strains this dependence was even more pronounced: 1.2%, 2.7%, and 5.7%, respectively. The temperature dependence of expression of the genes collected by selection and coding for accelerated development means that these genes affect the rate of development as the function of temperature by changing the angle of the curve inclination. Possible mechanisms of this phenomenon are discussed.

VL  - 60
IS  - 5
SP  - 1585-1592
AB  - Survival and growth of Legionella pneumophila in both biofilm and planktonic phases were determined with a two-stage model system. The model used filter-sterilized tap water as the sole source of nutrient to culture a naturally occurring mixed population of microorganisms including virulent L. pneumophila. At 20 degrees C, L. pneumophila accounted for a low proportion of biofilm flora on polybutylene and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, but was absent from copper surfaces. The pathogen was most abundant on biofilms on plastics at 40 degrees C, where it accounted for up to 50% of the total biofilm Bora. Copper surfaces were inhibitory to total biofouling and included only low numbers of L. pneumophila organisms. The pathogen was able to survive in biofilms on the surface of the plastic materials at 50 degrees C, but was absent from the copper surfaces at the same temperature. L. pneumophila could not be detected in the model system at 60 degrees C. In the presence of copper surfaces, biofilms forming on adjacent control glass surfaces were found to incorporate copper ions which subsequently inhibited colonization of their surfaces. This work suggests that the use of copper tubing in water systems may help to limit the colonization of water systems by L. pneumophila.

TI  - An intracellular interaction between a temperature-sensitive mutant and the original wild-type HVJ (Sendai virus) is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of HVJ persistent infection
VL  - 55
IS  - 2
SP  - 459-468
AB  - In order to understand the selective survival of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants in persistent infection by HVJ (Sendai virus), an intracellular interaction between a ts clone (HVJ cl. 14) isolated from HVJ carrier G2 cells and the original wild-type virus (HVJo) was studied. HVJ cl.14 differed from HVJo mainly in its ts property at 39°C, weak cytopathogenicity and faster electrophoretic mobility of P protein (P(77K)), but showed similar trypsin-activated growth to that of HVJo. When LLCMK2 cells were simultaneously infected with HVJo and HVJ cl.14 at 32°C, synthesis of HVJo-derived P protein (P(79K)) was inhibited with concomitant reduction of cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) and more dominant growth of HVJ cl.14 was observed. For the analysis of progeny viruses in these mixed infections, another mutant of HVJo designated HVJe which formed plaques activated only by elastase was isolated and employed instead of HVJo. At 39°C, HVJ cl.14 was rescued by coinfected HVJe at about 900- to 13000-fold over single infection. This recovery was also shown by sequential synthesis of HVJ cl. 14-derived P protein (P(77K)) following the earlier synthesis of HVJo-derived P polypeptide (P(79K)) in the mixed infection at 39°C. However, the u.v. inactivation of HVJe or HVJ cl. 14 resulted in a loss of their activity on rescue or on c.p.e., reduction, suggesting the necessity of protein synthesis by opposite viruses for these interactions. The mechanisms involved in the predominant growth of the ts mutant and concomitant reduction of c.p.e. seemed to provide a general explanation for the preferable persistence of the ts mutant in the HVJ carrier cells.

TI  - Gly311 residue triggers the enantioselectivity of Staphylococcus xylosus lipase: A monolayer study
VL  - 310
IS  - 1
SP  - 196-204
AB  - Using emulsified triacylglycerols, we have shown recently [Mosbah et al., 2007, submitted for publication] that amino acid residue G311 of Staphylococcus xylosus lipase (SXL) is critically involved in substrate selectivity, pH and temperature dependency. Using the monomolecular film technique, we show in the present study that the four single mutants of this residue (G311L, G311W, G311D, and G311K), interact efficiently with egg-phosphatidyl choline (egg-PC) monomolecular films, comparably to the wild-type (G311). A critical surface pressure (pi(c)) of about 25 mN/m was obtained with the SXL wild-type (SXL-WT) and its mutants. These results support our conclusion that the G311 residue is not involved in the interfacial adsorption step of SXL. A kinetic study on the Surface pressure dependency, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity of SXL-WT and its G311 mutants was also performed using optically pure enantiomers of diacylglycerols (1,2-sn-dicaprin and 2,3-sn-dicaprin) and a prochiral isomer (1,3-sn-dicaprin) spread as monomolecular films at the air-water interface. Our results indicated that the mutation of one single residue at position 311 affects critically the catalytic activity, the stereo- and the regioselectivity of SXL. As previously observed with emulsified substrates [Mosbah et al., 2007, submitted for publication] we observed that an increase in the size of the 311 amino acid side chain residue was accompanied by a decrease of lipase activity measured on dicaprin monolayer. We also noticed that the substitution of G311 by a basic or acidic residue (G311K and G311D), induces a significant shift of the pH optimum from 8 to 9.5 or from 8 to 6.5, respectively.

TI  - Ancient and recent lakes on mars
VL  - 4
SP  - 235
AB  - The search for life on Mars is guided by our knowledge of the environments occupied by terrestrial biota. Geology and atmospheric models converge to show that Mars habitability potential was higher during the first 500 Ma of its history. Rivers and lakes, possibly an ocean, started to decline around 3.5 Ga. There is evidence that they may have occurred again in later geological periods but episodically and as lower magnitude events, their formation possibly driven by magmatic pulses and/or obliquity changes. This chapter focuses on Martian lakes and their environmental conditions through time. Paleolakes on Mars were identified first at Viking resolution in basins, impact craters, and volcanic regions. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) and Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) provided additional geological evidence to support the existence of past lakes and showed that the magnitude of the Martian lacustrine activity was much greater than unraveled by Viking. These new data allow the precise definition of watersheds, paleochannel courses and basins and show that lakes abounded on early Mars. Later in the planet’s history, environmental conditions likely included: episodic water supply; increasing evaporation due to the thinning of the atmosphere leading to chemical, pH, and salinity changes in the lakes; high-UV radiation; cool temperatures with seasonal, then perennial icecover; and short to long-term hydrothermal activity for impact and volcanic crater lakes. Evidence for recent water activity through gullies and glaciers opens the possibility for modern short-term ponds as well. Understanding how these conditions could have affected putative life is of paramount importance to assess adaptation and survival potential on a changing Mars. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

TI  - Evolution of Antarctic biodiversity in the context of the past: The importance of the Southern Ocean deep sea
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 509-521
AB  - Present day Southern Ocean benthic biodiversity is the result of climatic changes based on the break-up of Gondwana in the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic and the physiological potential of the fauna to cope with the climatic deterioration. Though many taxa survived the thermal drop in ocean bottom temperatures, zoogeographic ranges changed and some faunal elements even became extinct, e.g. benthic decapods and teleost fish, opening up new ecological niches and the potential for enormous adaptive radiations within some taxa, like the amphipods and isopods (peracarid crustaceans) and notothenioid fish. Ice-sheet extensions and retreats might have enhanced speciation processes as well as eurybathy. Biodiversity on the Antarctic shelf is high within the polychaetes, molluscs, and echinoderms, and within the amphipods and isopods possibly due to the Cenozoic extinction of the benthic decapods. Moreover, some shelf areas are characterized by accumulations of large suspension feeders like poriferans, bryozoans, ascidians, gorgonians, and hydroids. Palaeoclimatic changes also caused that many taxa of the modern, present day Southern Ocean benthic organisms are characterized by gigantism, slow metabolism, longevity, and a reduced number of offspring combined with late maturation. However, our biological knowledge is mainly confined to Southern Ocean shelf organism; we do not know much about the composition, biodiversity and zoogeography of the Southern Ocean deep sea animals. On this background the deep sea expeditions ANDEEP were born and the background and first results of these are presented herein. © Antarctic Science Ltd.

VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 259-271
AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is essentially a closed complex basin with maximum depths of about 4,600 m and a sill depth at Gibraltar of about 320 m. At similar depths, values for temperature, salinity, and oxygen content are significantly higher in the Mediterranean than in the sea off California. Prominent deeper bathyal foraminiferal zonation off southern California is not duplicated in the Mediterranean, probably because of the control of sill depth in the latter. Foraminifera common to the two areas may be categorized into isobathyal and heterobathyal groups. Isobathyal species, those with the same upper depth limits in various oceanic areas, provide some evidence of depth zonation in the Mediterrenean Sea which is common to California. It is postulated as follows:. 100 m ± 50 m Hoeglundina elegans (d'Orbigny) Uvigerina peregrina Cushman. 200 m ± 50 m Gyroidina soldanii altiformis Stewart et Stewart. 700 m ± 100 m Globobulimina pyrula spinescens (Brady). Cibicides wuellerstorfi (Schwager) occurs in the two areas with an upper depth limit of about 1,200 m; elsewhere it occurs as a rare species between depths of 500 and about 2,400 m, it is more characteristic of depths below 2,400 m. Additional sample control is needed in the Mediterranean and California regions to establish the precise zonation for this species. Heterobathyal species are those with different upper bathymetric limits in contrasting oceanic bodies; those common to the Mediterranean and the sea off southern California include some spinose buliminids, Stainforthia complanata (Egger), and Sigmoilina tenuis (Czjzek). Isobathyal species exhibit depth control rather than dependence upon temperature. Some heterobathyal species occur in shallow warm waters in one case and in deep colder waters in other cases, others occur in shallow cooler waters in one area and in deeper and warmer waters in other areas. Thus, both groups show little correlation with temperature. © 1966.

TI  - Gear-based fisheries management as a potential adaptive response to climate change and coral mortality
VL  - 46
IS  - 3
SP  - 724-732
AB  - 1. Climate change is emerging as one of the greatest threats to coral reef ecosystems. Climate-induced warming events trigger coral bleaching and mortality, which can indirectly affect coral reef fishes. Managing fisheries across coral mortality events is expected to influence the persistence of species and reef recovery potential. The most common management recommendation has been to prohibit fishing using fisheries closures, but this response often has limited support from resource users. 2. Here, we explore an alternative of managing fishing gear commonly used in artisanal coral reef fisheries. We examined fisheries landing data from 15 sites in Papua New Guinea and Kenya to explore whether or how specific gears select for: (i) species that depend on coral reefs for feeding or habitat and are likely to be susceptible to the loss of coral, and (ii) different functional groups of fishes. 3. Only 6% of the fishes targeted by fishers were susceptible to the immediate effects of coral mortality; however, loss of habitat structure following coral mortality is expected to affect 56% of targeted species. 4. Importantly, 25% of target species had feeding characteristics (i.e. reef scrapers/excavators and grazers) that contribute to the recovery of coral reef ecosystems, and gears differed considerably in catches of these species. 5. Spear guns and traps target a high proportion of species likely to be affected by bleaching and key for the recovery of corals. These gears are strong candidates for management restrictions in reefs with high coral mortality. In contrast, line fishing catches the lowest proportion of susceptible and recovery-enabling species and is preferential for increasing recovery rates on coral reefs. 6. Synthesis and applications. Fisheries managers will require a range of tools to meet the novel challenges posed by climate change. This study presents a way to help reduce the negative impacts of climate change and potentially increase resilience of marine ecosystems by managing fishing gear. Specific gears used by artisanal fishers differentially target fish functional groups. In the coral reefs that we studied, traps and spear guns targeted a high proportion of species highly susceptible to coral mortality and critical to coral reef resilience through their top-down control. Given that full fisheries closures are not always practical, selectively banning or restricting fishing gears is a potentially powerful tool for reducing the detrimental ecosystem effects of climate change disturbances. © 2008 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Thermal oxidation behavior of polyolefins as related to their composition
VL  - 64
SP  - 148
AB  - The thermal oxidation behavior of polyolefins has been well studied over the past thirty years. The influence of polymer composition in terms of tertiary hydrogen content - and to a lesser extent that of unsaturation - is well documented. However, the interactive effects of tertiary hydrogen content and unsaturation with catalyst residue impurities are not as well understood. Here we show the importance of polymer composition - polymer microstructure versus catalyst residue - under oxidizing condition at elevated temperatures, and the net effects of chain breakage and chain enlargement reactions below the crystalline melting point of selected polyethylenes. Thermal oxidation in the solid state is compared to that from oxidation in the molten state at temperatures up to 300°C. High-yield, transition metal catalyst currently used in the fluid bed polymerization of polyolefins makes total residue products commercially viable without the need for a separate catalyst removal step. The above studies show that transition-metal catalyzed polyethylenes polymerized under such high-catalyst productivity conditions have acceptable stability to thermal oxidation. Such polyethylenes can quite adequately be formulated to provide excellent melt processing stability, heat aging protection and discoloration resistance.

AB  - Enteric pathogens are constantly exposed to stressful conditions in their natural habitat in the host and even more in the extra-host environment, including food processing. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of selected environmental stress factors: temperature shift, starvation and atmospheric oxygen concentration on culturability/viability of two Campylobacter jejuni isolates. Additionally, after stress exposure, in an in vitro cell culture model using Caco-2 cells, the adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival of C. jejuni were studied. Nutrient insufficiency was the most powerful stress factor which significantly affected C. jejuni culturability and viability, as well as, adhesion and invasion properties. Temperature elevation induced a transient growth arrest, and temporary loss of pathogenic potential as indicated by impaired adhesion and invasion efficiency of C. jejuni. However, bacteria recovered within 24-48 h inside the Caco-2 cells. Oxidative stress neither affected C. jejuni growth nor reduced the binding and invasion into Caco-2 cells. Only 5 h oxygen exposure increased the invasion capability and intraepithelial survival of the clinical isolate. Modulation of C. jejuni virulence in response to environmental stress factors may have further implications in the pathogenesis of campylobacteriosis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cohort dynamics of summer-spawned bluefish as determined by length-frequency and otolith microstructure analyses
VL  - 135
IS  - 4
SP  - 955-969
AB  - Elucidating recruitment processes in marine fish is difficult when species occupy distinct habitats at different ontogenetic stages and when multiple cohorts determine year-class strength. Currently, there is insufficient information on the cohort dynamics of the early life history stages of summer-spawned bluefish Pomatomus saltatrix to critically evaluate each cohort's role in regulating population dynamics. The objective of this study was to provide greater insight into the cohort dynamics of summer-spawned bluefish during the summer and fall on the inner continental shelf off southern New Jersey. Length-frequency and otolith microstructure analyses were used to estimate the age, hatch date, and growth of neustonic individuals collected from shelf surface waters during August-October 1998. Bluefish ranged between 9 and 46 d in age, corresponding to back-calculated hatch dates between 27 June and 13 September. Hatch date frequencies were decomposed into a series of normal curves and identified three cohorts with mean hatch dates occurring in early July (cohort 1), late July to early August (cohort 2), and late August to early September (cohort 3). Cohort-specific growth rates ranged between 0.28 and 0.81 mm standard length/d. Otolith microstructure analysis revealed that growth was significantly faster for cohort 1 than for the other cohorts, most likely because of spatial and temporal variability in the environment (e.g., temperature) and size-selective processes (e.g., mortality). Back-calculated spawning dates indicated that the functional spawning output of bluefish was significantly greater during the first-quarter phase of the lunar cycle. Collectively, these observations suggest that the cohort structure of bluefish is more complex than previously recognized. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2006.

TI  - Listeria monocytogenes σB regulates stress response and virulence functions
VL  - 185
IS  - 19
SP  - 5722-5734
AB  - While the stress-responsive alternative sigma factor σB has been identified in different species of Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus, the σB regulon has been extensively characterized only in B. subtilis. We combined biocomputing and microarray-based strategies to identify σB-dependent genes in the facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Hidden Markov model (HMM)-based searches identified 170 candidate σ B-dependent promoter sequences in the strain EGD-e genome sequence. These data were used to develop a specialized, 208-gene microarray, which included 166 genes downstream of HMM-predicted σB-dependent promoters as well as selected virulence and stress response genes. RNA for the microarray experiments was isolated from both wild-type and ΔsigB null mutant L. monocytogenes cells grown to stationary phase or exposed to osmotic stress (0.5 M KCl). Microarray analyses identified a total of 55 genes with statistically significant σB-dependent expression under the conditions used in these experiments, with at least 1.5-fold-higher expression in the wild type over the sigB mutant under either stress condition (51 genes showed at least 2.0-fold-higher expression in the wild type). Of the 55 genes exhibiting σB-dependent expression, 54 were preceded by a sequence resembling the σB promoter consensus sequence. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR was used to confirm the σ B-dependent nature of a subset of eight selected promoter regions. Notably, the σB-dependent L. monocytogenes genes identified through this HMM/microarray strategy included both stress response genes (e.g., gadB, ctc, and the glutathione reductase gene lmo1433) and virulence genes (e.g., inlA, inlB, and bsh). Our data demonstrate that, in addition to regulating expression of genes important for survival under environmental stress conditions, σB also contributes to regulation of virulence gene expression in L. monocytogenes. These findings strongly suggest that σB contributes to L. monocytogenes gene expression during infection.

VL  - 86
IS  - 8
SP  - 2737-2741
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that kinetic differences among allelic variants of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI; D-glucose-6-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.9) from the sea anemone Metridium senile differentially modulate glucose metabolism at the glycolysis-pentose-shunt branch point. Fractional contribution of pentose shunt and absolute flux of glucose in glycolysis were measured in fasted or fed anemones acclimated to 5 degrees C or 15 degrees C. When fed, anemones of genotype Gpiss routed a greater fraction of glucose through the shunt than did Gpiff anemones; the effect was more pronounced at 5 degrees C than at 15 degrees C. This confirms predictions from kinetic and population data and is consistent with thermal selection maintaining the variation. Relative levels of shunt metabolism increased at 5 degrees C, compared with 15 degrees C, in fed anemones regardless of genotype, but the proportion of glucose metabolized by the pentose shunt was unchanged by temperature in fasted anemones. Glucose flux through the shunt was constant at approximately 5 pmol.mg-1.hr-1 in fed anemones at 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C and in fasted anemones at 15 degrees C, indicating apparently near-perfect thermal acclimation of the absolute flux of glucose through the shunt in fed, but not in fasted, anemones. Rates of glucose oxidation and flux through the shunt in freshly collected anemones were similar to those of anemones fed and acclimated at 15 degrees C in the laboratory. If these differences affect organismal-level processes, Gpi variation could contribute to Darwinian fitness in thermally varying environments.

TI  - Combined effects of climate and biotic interactions on the elevational range of a phytophagous insect
VL  - 77
IS  - 1
SP  - 145-155
AB  - 1. The ranges of many species have expanded in cool regions but contracted at warm margins in response to recent climate warming, but the mechanisms behind such changes remain unclear. Particular debate concerns the roles of direct climatic limitation vs. the effects of interacting species in explaining the location of low latitude or low elevation range margins. 2. The mountains of the Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain) include both cool and warm range margins for the black-veined white butterfly, Aporia crataegi, which has disappeared from low elevations since the 1970s without colonizing the highest elevations. 3. We found that the current upper elevation limit to A. crataegi's distribution coincided closely with that of its host plants, but that the species was absent from elevations below 900 m, even where host plants were present. The density of A. crataegi per host plant increased with elevation, but overall abundance of the species declined at high elevations where host plants were rare. 4. The flight period of A. crataegi was later at higher elevations, meaning that butterflies in higher populations flew at hotter times of year; nevertheless, daytime temperatures for the month of peak flight decreased by 6.2 °C per 1 km increase in elevation. 5. At higher elevations A. crataegi eggs were laid on the south side of host plants (expected to correspond to hotter microclimates), whereas at lower sites the (cooler) north side of plants was selected. Field transplant experiments showed that egg survival increased with elevation. 6. Climatic limitation is the most likely explanation for the low elevation range margin of A. crataegi, whereas the absence of host plants from high elevations sets the upper limit. This contrasts with the frequent assumption that biotic interactions typically determine warm range margins, and thermal limitation cool margins. 7. Studies that have modelled distribution changes in response to climate change may have underestimated declines for many specialist species, because range contractions will be exacerbated by mismatch between the future distribution of suitable climate space and the availability of resources such as host plants. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 44
IS  - 10
SP  - 4836s-4841s
AB  - Values for thermal enhancement and therapeutic gain are useful for deciding future directions of hyperthermia combined with other cancer therapy modalities. Evidence of thermal enhancement of effects on normal tissues is important as it indicates the need for dose modification. Specific values cannot be used generally to determine the degree of dose modification for clinical applications. A range of values accounting for many variables, including method of dose delivery for heat and the other modalities and knowledge of the normal tissues at risk, would be required for such specific application. There is frequently hyperthermic enhancement of radiation damage to acutely responding tissues. That may be avoided if tumors can be selectively heated, but extensive temperature monitoring is necessary to avoid hot spots. Irradiation and heating of spontaneous canine tumors resulted in an increased probability for tumor control with no apparent increase in late complications. Human clinical studies have shown that, with care, tumor response can be enhanced without significantly increasing normal tissue damage and that a therapeutic gain can be achieved. Caution must be exercised because, with few exceptions, follow-up was not long, and the tissues at risk were limited. Most human studies have been of relatively superficial tumors of small volume. Little information is available on whole-body or regional hyperthermia for assessment of thermal enhancement or therapeutic gain. Also, there is little information about chemotherapy combined with heat, although studies of heat with perfusion chemotherapy for malignant melanomas of the extremity have shown significantly increased survival rates.

VL  - 76
IS  - 2
SP  - 253-259
AB  - In this study, a Hertwig effect with a non-typical biphasic curve was obtained using sperm irradiated with increasing intensities of UV. The first phase of the UV curve appeared to be quite different from that normally demonstrated using γ or x-ray irradiation. This difference is characterised throughout the length of the first phase by (1) low and stable embryo hatching rates of about 3.5%, and (2) exclusive formation of haploid embryos at any irradiation intensity. Additionally, at both phases, the ability of the sperm to induce morula formation was not affected at all, and no aneuploidy nor chromosomal fragments could be seen. Therefore, it was suggested that in this fish the lethal effect of UV irradition on sperm is mainly expressed on early differentiative events during embryogenesis, which lead to a degeneration of the embryos during early stages of their development. The possible mechanism by which haploidy is achieved during the first phase is discussed. Two generations of diploid gynogenetic tilapias were induced by activating Oreochromis aureus eggs with UV-irradiated O. niloticus sperm and by using the heat-shock technique, at optimized conditions, for the prevention of the second polar body extrusion. Species specific dominant genetic markers (serum esterases and tail striation) were used to confirm the exclusive content of the maternal genome in gynogenetic offspring. Very low survival rates (0.36%) were shown in F1 gynogenetic fish as well as a high incidence of malformations among survivors. In the second gynogenetic generation, both significantly higher survival rates (3.6%) and a considerably reduced incidence of malformations were obtained. We suggest that low frequencies of recombination occur in this species and cause a rapid increase in the inbreeding level. This is followed by the expression of lethal and defective genes that are considerably reduced after second generation selection. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Introduced bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) in western Canada: Has their ecology diverged?
VL  - 40
IS  - 2
SP  - 249-260
AB  - Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20°C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20°C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 ± 7,296 eggs (mean ± standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.

TI  - Linking traits to energetics and population dynamics to predict lizard ranges in changing environments
VL  - 171
IS  - 1
SP  - E1-E19
AB  - I present a dynamic bioenergetic model that couples individual energetics and population dynamics to predict current lizard ranges and those following climate warming. The model predictions are uniquely based on first principles of morphology, life history, and thermal physiology. I apply the model to five populations of a widespread North American lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, to examine how geographic variation in traits and life histories influences ranges. This geographic variation reflects the potential for species to adapt to environmental change. I then consider the range dynamics of the closely related Sceloporus graciosus. Comparing predicted ranges and actual current ranges reveals how dispersal limitations, species interactions, and habitat requirements influence the occupied portions of thermally suitable ranges. The dynamic model predicts individualistic responses to a uniform 3°C warming but a northward shift in the northern range boundary for all populations and species. In contrast to standard correlative climate envelopemodels, the extent of the predicted northward shift depends on organism traits and life histories. The results highlight the limitations of correlative models and the need for more dynamic models of species' ranges. © 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation on the adaptability of an industrial fixed-bed Fe-Cu-K catalyst to slurry reactor
VL  - 33
IS  - 2
SP  - 211-217
AB  - The reaction performance and stability of an industrial fixed-bed Fe-Cu-K catalyst was carried out using a CSTR equipped with a wax removal system under industrial relevant conditions: 255°∼290°C, 1.5∼3.1 MPa total pressure, H2/CO (mole ratio) = 0.50:1∼1.52:1, and a space velocity of 1∼2.5 L/gcat/hr (unreduced catalyst base). The effects of reaction conditions on the catalyst activity, product selectivity, and stability were studied. A 2500 hr slurry phase reaction result indicated that the changes of the process conditions (temperature, pressure, H2/CO feed ratio, and space velocity) had strong effects on the productivity and product selectivity. The effects of the adjustment of reaction pressure on the catalyst stability were particularly obvious. The deactivation rates of the catalyst decreased with the changes of conditions in the order: reaction pressure &gt; space velocity &gt; H2/CO feed ratios. The catalyst activity could be enhanced with the reaction temperature increasing, but the selectivity to heavy hydrocarbons was decreased. The increase of the reaction pressure could promote the conversion, and improved the heavy hydrocarbons selectivity and the hydrocarbon productivity. Increasing space velocity in feed gas could increase hydrocarbon productivity, and evidently declined the CO conversion and the selectivity of the heavy hydrocarbons. The increase of the H2/CO feed ratio could raise CO conversion and improved the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbon. The appropriate choice of the Fischer-Tropsch reaction parameters in slurry phase could obtain the balance among catalyst activity, hydrocarbon distribution and productivity. The catalyst exhibited robust attrition resistance.

VL  - 37

AB  - Two extreme dikaryotic isolates chosen from a large sample of a localised population of Sehizsphyllum commune exhibited a considerable amount of genetical variation for growth rate at the near ambient temperature of 20°C and at the higher temperature of 30°C. The potential variation within these extreme isolates was greater than the variation observed in the whole sample. Regression analysis of the variation in growth rate of the dikaryotic progeny of the extreme isolates on that of their component monokaryons showed that the nature of gene action was not the same in these two stages of the life cycle. The simple additive-dominance model of gene action was adequate to explain the variation in growth rate in both of the extreme isolates at both of the temperatures. The small deviations from this model could be accounted for by unequal gene frequencies due to small sample size although a low incidence of non-allelic interactions could not be ruled out. Directional dominance for growth rate was detected in both isolates at the more normal temperature and it was opposing in direction in the two isolates. In the slow growing isolate the dominance was for faster growth and in the fast growing isolate it was for slower growth. This is expected for a character which displays overall ambi-directional dominance if isolates with more extreme growth rates than those recovered in the population sample are eliminated by stabilising selection. The dominance is temperature dependent being ambi-directional in both isolates at the higher temperature. Environmental heterogeneity, the buffering effects of directional dominance and genotype-environment interactions and opposing selective forces operating on the monokaryotic and dikaryotic stages of the life cycle are possible contributory factors to the considerable free and potential variability displayed in this small, localised population. © 1976 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

TI  - A class of gyrase mutants of Salmonella typhimurium show quinolone-like lethality and require Rec functions for viability
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
SP  - 111-122
AB  - We have identified a new class of DNA gyrase mutants of Salmonella typhimurium that show chronic derepression of the SOS regulon. Thus, these mutants mimic the response of wild-type cells to gyrase inhibitors of the quinolone family. SOS induction by conditional lethal mutations gyrA208 or gyrB652, like that mediated by quinolones, is completely dependent on the function of the recB gene product. Introduction of recA or recB null mutations into these strains exacerbates their temperature-sensitive phenotype and prevents growth at the otherwise permissive temperature of 37°C. Selection of suppressors that concomitantly restore growth at 37°C and SOS induction in a recB- background yielded mutations that relieve the RecB requirement for homologous recombination; namely, sbcB mutations as well as mutations at a new locus that was named sbcE. Such mutations also restore SOS induction in quinolone-treated gyr+ recB- strains. These findings indicate that Rec functions are needed for growth of the gyrase mutants at 37°C and suggest that recombinational repair intermediates constitute the SOS-inducing signal in the mutants as well as in quinolone-treated wild-type bacteria. Unlike quinolones, however, the gyr mutations described in this study do not cause detectable accumulation of 'cleavable' gyrase-DNA complexes in plasmid or chromosomal DNA. Yet gyrA208 (the only allele tested) was found to trigger RecB-mediated reckless degradation of chromosomal DNA in recA- cells at restrictive temperatures. Indirect evidence suggests that double-stranded DNA ends, entry sites for the RecBCD enzyme, are generated in the gyr mutants by the breakage of DNA-replication forks. We discuss how this could occur and how recombinational rescue of collapsed replication forks could account for cell survival (and SOS induction) in the gyr mutants as well as in quinolone-treated bacteria.

TI  - Effects of cryo-cooling in grinding steels
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 791-800
AB  - The grinding process is inherently characterised by high specific energy and high temperature, which are responsible for high wheel loading, increased grinding forces, reduced metal-removal rate, rapid wheel wear and deterioration in the quality of the ground surface through oxidation, the induction of tensile residual stress and micro-cracks. These problems become more acute when the product is of HSHR material and subjected to dynamic loading while functioning. Therefore, in industry the user should pay special attention to control and optimise all the significant parameters for minimising the afore-said problems, aiming at higher grindability, productivity and overall economy in grinding. The basic principles of controlling such high temperature are: (i) proper selection and optimisation of wheel and process parameters; (ii) the removal of heat from the grinding zone by the application of proper grinding fluid. Profuse cooling with conventional grinding fluids, even in the form of mist or jet, is virtually unable to solve the problem. However, cryogenic cooling by agents such as liquid nitrogen is expected to meet this challenge. In the present work, specimens of different steels, namely MS, HCS, cold- and hot-die steel and HSS, have been surface ground at different infeeds under dry conditions and with soluble oil and liquid nitrogen. The effects of such cryo-cooling relative to soluble oil and dry grinding have been investigated in respect of chip formation, grinding forces, specific energy, burning and surface characterisation. The experimental results indicate that the grinding temperature and burning decreased remarkably under cryo-cooling. Thermal damage of the ground surface has been reduced substantially by cryo-cooling, but to different degree in different steels. Cryo-cooling also enables retention of the wheel sharpness for a longer period and results in less force and specific energy being required. © 1993.

TI  - Selective synthesis of isobutanol by means of the Guerbet reaction part 2. Reaction of methanol/ethanol and methanol/ethanol/n-propanol mixtures over copper based/MeOna catalytic systems
VL  - 200
IS  - 1
SP  - 137-146
AB  - The synthesis of isobutanol via the Guerbet condensation between methanol and ethanol was studied by using sodium methoxide (MeONa) as soluble basic component and copper-based catalysts as heterogeneous dehydrogenating/hydrogenating metal species. The effect of the nature of the catalyst and the relative amount of its individual components with respect to the reacting alcohols as well as of temperature on productivity and selectivity of the process was investigated. The collected data indicated that the copper chromite/MeONa was more active than Cu-Raney/MeONa system. The reaction was shown to proceed with the formation only of n-propanol and isobutanol. Ethanol conversion up to 61% with selectivity to isobutanol up to 98.4% was obtained. The same catalytic systems were also employed in the reaction of the methanol/ethanol/n-propanol ternary mixture. Again copper chromite/MeONa resulted more active than the Cu-Raney/MeONa system. Finally, experiments were carried out on methanol/n-propanol mixtures in the presence of the copper chromite/MeONa catalytic system by recycling both the recovered solid copper component and the liquid reaction mixture for evidencing eventual copper leaching by MeONa. On the basis of the obtained results it was concluded that in the Guerbet reaction copper chromite works as heterogeneous catalyst. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Volumetric ion interaction parameters for single-solute aqueous electrolyte solutions at various temperatures
VL  - 29
IS  - 5
SP  - 1123-1140
AB  - The ion interaction approach developed by Pitzer allows the prediction of thermodynamic characteristics of mixed electrolyte solutions at various temperatures, if the respective parameters for each type of single electrolyte solution are known. Among such thermodynamic characteristics are the volumetric ones (density and apparent molal volumes). A database for the densities and the apparent molal volumes versus concentrations was developed at a temperature interval of 288.15-368.15 K using all available literature sources for each single electrolyte solution formed by various electrically neutral combinations of the following ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Cl-, Br-, HCO-3, CO2-3, and SO2-4). These are the most important ions for industrial solutions as well as for natural waters. Statistical treatment was applied to this database in order to discard poor data. The proper treatment of all sound quality apparent molal volumes, in a wide range of concentrations from infinite dilution through saturation, allowed us to compute sets of volumetric ion interaction parameters (V̄0MX, β(0)VMX, β(1)VMX, β(2)VMX, and CVMX) at various temperatures in a 288.15-368.15 K temperature interval. The validity of the selected sets at various temperatures was demonstrated by a comparison of the experimental and calculated densities for multiple-solute electrolyte solutions containing NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2 with an ionic strength reaching 9.23 that resembled Dead Sea water. © 2001 American Institute of Physics.

TI  - GOCE thermal balance/vacuum test
AB  - GOCE (the Gravity Field and Steady State Ocean Circulation Explorer) is the first Earth Explorer Core Mission of the Earth Observation Envelope Program of the European Space Agency (ESA). The Satellite is planned to be launched in June 2008 on a Rockot launcher into a near-circular sun-synchronous orbit for Earth's gravity field measurements. The objective of the mission is to produce high-accuracy, high-resolution, global measurements of the Earth's gravity by satellite, leading to improved gravity field and geoid models for use in a wide range of applications (geodesy, solid-Earth physics, oceanography, climate, ice topography). In particular, the goal is to produce a map of the gravity anomaly field with an accuracy better than 1mGal (1 mGal=10-5 m s -2), and of the geoid height with accuracy better than 1 cm, all over the Earth's surface with a resolution at sea level of at least 100 km. Thales Alenia Space Italy (Turin) is the system level responsible of the Satellite that is made mainly by the Platform under the responsibility of EADS Astrium Germany and by the Electrostatic Gravity Gradiometer (EGG) payload under the responsibility of Thales Alenia Space France (Cannes). The S/C is equipped also with the Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument (SSTI) developed by Thales Alenia Space Italy (Milan) and Laser Retro Reflector (LRR) Instrument provided by the Agency. GOCE Proto-Flight Model (PFM) was tested in the Large Space Simulator of ESTEC facilities (Noordwijk, Netherlands) from October 27 th to November 12th of 2007. The purpose of the paper is to: describe the selected thermal control design present the TB/TV Test approach and the selected test configurations give an overview of the Test and the achieved correlation results address performance of the GOCE thermal control subsystem under the various operating, non-operating conditions during the mission phases present the thermal test correlation findings and mathematical model updates summarize the thermal test lessons learnt Copyright © 2008 SAE International.

TI  - Partial oxidation in microreactors: Formaldehyde synthesis from methanol
AB  - Microreactors are known to enhance the productivity and efficiency of existing chemical processes owing to their high heat and mass transfer rates. In this work, we successfully demonstrate the use of microscale catalytic reactors for formaldehyde synthesis via methanol partial oxidation over a V-Mo/TiO2 catalyst. It is shown that structured wall microreactor, with higher effective thermal conductivity, improves the selectivity and yield of formaldehyde compared to packed bed microreactor by alleviating the formation of hot-spots. Experimental data from the structured wall reactor over a wide range of process conditions (i.e., temperature, methanol and oxygen concentrations and contact times) is used to evaluate the kinetic information for the formaldehyde synthesis reaction network (including byproducts such as carbon monoxide, and dimethyl ether). Optimal process conditions to maximize the formaldehyde yield are then sought using these reaction kinetics in a set of hierarchical models ranging from simple 1D to 3D CFD.

Here we describe the active excavation of oviposition sites by H. platirhinos; mating behavior, including multiple copulations of a single female with five males; and philopatry to specific nest sites by multiple individuals in successive years. As our study site is close to the northern limit of this species' range, nest sites may need to be carefully selected to provide a thermal regime warm enough to incubate the eggs. Mean nest temperatures in the field ranged from 23.4 to 26.1 C, while incubation periods ranged from 49 to 63 d.

TI  - Calcareous nannofossils from late Jurassic sediments of the Volga Basin (Russian Platform): Evidence for productivity-controlled black shale deposition
VL  - 92
IS  - 5
SP  - 743-757
AB  - The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary interval in the northern hemisphere is characterized by the widespread occurrence of black shales. About 60% of all petroleum source rocks comprise sediments of late Jurassic and early Cretaceous age with the origin of such black shales still under discussion. In order to better understand the factors that controlled black shale sedimentation, 78 samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils from two sections (Gorodische, Kashpir) of the Volga Basin (NE Russia). Calcareous nannofossils are ideal proxies for deciphering nutrient, temperature and salinity fluctuations. Additionally 58 samples from both sections were also analyzed for clay mineralogy, δ13Corg, TOC and CaCO3 composition. Both sections contain calcareous claystones and intercalated organic rich shales overlain by phosphorite beds. The presence of the calcareous nannofossil species Stephanolithion atmetros throughout both successions allows a biostratigraphic assignment to the S. atmetros Nannofossil Biozone (NJ 17), which corresponds to the Dorsoplanites panderi Ammonite Biozone of the Middle Volgian. The marlstones of the Kashpir section yield a well-preserved rich and diverse nannoflora, whereas all black shale beds are essentially barren of calcareous nannofossils. Only the uppermost black shale layers yield an impoverished assemblage of low diversity and abundance. Geochemical data suggest an early diagenetic nannofossil dissolution in the black shales of the Kashpir section. This is supported by the occurrence of coccoliths in black shale horizons of the Gorodische section. The assemblages in both sections are dominated by coccoliths of the Watznaueriaceae group (Watznaueria barnesae, Watznaueria fossacincta, Watznaueria britannica, Watznaueria communis), Biscutum constans and Zeugrhabdotus erectus. In Kashpir rare specimens of Crucibiscutum salebrosum occur in the higher part of the section. These taxa indicate boreal affinities. B. constans and Z. erectus are considered to be taxa indicative of a higher productive environment, while C. salebrosum is a cool-water species. From base to top of the Kashpir section, consecutive mass occurrences of different taxa/groups were observed: W. barnesae-W. fossacincta acme, W. britannica-W. communis acme, Z. erectus acme, B. constans acme (including sparse occurrences of C. salebrosum). The observed distribution patterns have been interpreted as characterizing a transition from a low productive, oligotrophic setting with high abundances of K-selected cosmopolitan species (Watznauriaceae) and predominating marlstone sedimentation to a higher productive, mesotrophic setting. Cooler water temperatures marked by r-selection and acmes of opportunistic species (Z. erectus, B. constans) are coincident with the deposition of black shales and phosphorites in the higher part of the section. Interpretation of clay mineral distribution indicates that black shale deposition occurred under semi-arid hinterland climatic conditions concomitant with a sea level rise. This induced dysoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the Volga Basin, favoring the preservation of organic matter. The cause of the nutrient enrichment in the surface water is still unclear, but possible river water input from the continents does not seem to have been the controlling factor under a semi-arid climate. The occurrence of phosphorites in the upper part of both sections presumably indicates that enhanced productivity may be better explained by the upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water and thereby causing the recycling of nutrients from oxidized phytoplankton back into the photic zone. This recycling effect finally may have led to an intensified phytoplankton growth which seemed to be a sufficient source for the enrichment of organic matter. This is well correlated with the increase in black shale horizons in the upper part of the Kashpir section. © Springer-Verlag 2003.

VL  - 16

SP  - 110-147
AB  - (i) This study was undertaken to determine the causal factors and selective mechanisms responsible for the development of the group-feeding behaviour displayed by Neodiprion pratti banksianae Roh. when feeding on the needles of its host, Pinus banksiana Lamb. (ii) Preliminary studies revealed that hatching orientation is constant, all larvae being directed towards the needle tip. Newly-hatched larvae have creamy white head capsules, and are unable to orient to light until an hour after hatching, by which time head capsule pigmentation is well advanced. Egg-bearing needles receive no preferential selection in the establishment of the first feeding sites. (iii) Larval aggregations were found to be consistently too large and too frequent to be accountable by chance, and were seen to be the product of a strong aggregative stimulus. Aggregations formed at wide extremes of light, temperature, and humidity conditions, and were evidently independent of these physical factors. The stimulus to aggregate appeared to remain equally strong throughout larval life, for although the size of the feeding groups diminished, this appeared to be entirely attributable to increasing head capsule size. Larvae displayed no interest in each other when removed from their pine foliage, dispersing in a direct manner on the surface of a grid until their distribution satisfied the Poisson calculations for a randomly dispersed population. Larvae were found to be markedly responsive to the odour of pine foliage, and to the odour of the saliva of feeding insects, and it was postulated that established feeding sites attract additional larvae through an olfactory response. (iv) A small experiment failed to reveal a difference between the rate of development of larvae reared in groups and the rate of development of those larvae that managed to survive in solitary rearings. This same experiment suggested that, although the first instar mortality rate was high in both group and solitary rearings, it might be substantially higher in solitary rearings. Additional studies showed the strong statistical significance of this difference. Mortality was negligible after the moult from first to second instar in both group and solitary rearings. (v) Feeding aggregations were found invariably to form around a feeding site established by an individual larva. So long as this first larva remains alone, the feeding site is restricted to a small portion of the needle periphery along the needle edge. As additional larvae join the site they are at first in close contact with each other, and it can be seen that they are taking advantage of the existing incision to gain purchase in biting into the remaining uncut needle periphery. Once the feeding site is extended beyond the minimum limits imposed by the head capsules the larvae become freely distributed at the feeding site, and no longer maintain close contact. The provision of artificially cut feeding sites significantly increases the establishment of solitary larvae. (vi) It is postulated that the survival advantage gained in the first instar by exploitation of the feeding incisions made by the few larvae that manage to cut into the tough needle cuticle and epidermis is the selective mechanism that has brought about the evolution of group-feeding. (vii) The concept of division of labour is analysed. By "division of labour" we mean, generally, a specialization in various components of a task. Below this is a level where labour is divided as it is within a caste in a complex insect society: by the additive effect of equipotential contributions. Neodiprion larvae are at the threshold of this lower level of division of labour. Their most difficult task in first instar is to establish openings in the pine needles where they may feed, and each larva attempts to do this alone. As soon as individual larvae succeed in establishing feeding sites, individual ef fort by unsuccessful larvae is abandoned in favour of group exploitation. This primitive level of integration foreshadows the continuum of sociality leading to those levels where we may speak of the "survival of the most cooperative".

AB  - The infective juvenile is a free-living stage of entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) that serves three main functions: dispersal, host finding, and survival under environmental conditions detrimental to other life stages. Here, we summarize the research on the physiology, genetics, and molecular biology of chemoreception, thermobiosis, and anhydrobiosis in the infective juveniles. Chemoreception studies in Heterorhabditis bacteriophora indicate that the adoption of the parasitic mode of life is associated with a reduced sensitivity to volatile by-products of bacterial metabolism and an increased sensitivity towards long-chain alcohols and other insect-specific volatiles. Thermobiosis and anhydrobiosis studies reveal that entomopathogenic nematode infective juveniles use a global stress tolerance response that may be triggered during acclimation to a novel temperature or desiccation regime. Once this global stress response is induced, the nematodes acquire resistance to a multitude of factors including cold, heat, desiccation, ultraviolet radiation, and pH. Physiological mechanisms manifested by entomopathogenic nematode infective juveniles during survival under cold or warm conditions include the alteration in the proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, alterations in the activity of metabolic enzymes, synthesis of novel isozymes, sugars, and polyols including trehalose and glucose, and heat-shock proteins. It is apparent that thermal niche breadths of entomopathogenic nematodes are conserved, but they can be altered through genetic selection at constant temperatures. Infective juveniles can undergo anhydrobiosis within and outside the host cadaver. The physiological mechanisms to undergo anhydrobiosis include the synthesis of polyols, sugars such as trehalose, alterations in the fatty acid composition, and the synthesis of several low molecular weight proteins. With the significant progress made in unraveling the steps involved in olfactory signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans, homology-based approaches are now being used to isolate chemosensory genes in H. bacteriophora. Using a variety of cloning techniques and subtractive hybridization, several genes involved in chemoreception, heat tolerance, and anhydrobiosis of entomopathogenic nematodes have been isolated. These discoveries together with the availability of new molecular and genomic tools serve as a solid platform for the improvement of biological control potential of entomopathogenic nematodes.

AB  - Effects of temperature and 4 plant pollens on the development, survivorship, and reproduction of Amblyseius largoensis (Muma) were evaluated. The average egg incubation period at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C was 6.02, 3.26, 2.01, 1.45, and 1.95 d, respectively. The combined larval and nymphal developmental time (mean +/- SD) decreased from 11.18 +/- 0.55 to 3.21 +/- 0.41 d and adult longevity from 39.45 +/- 6.24 to 11.91 +/- 5.33 d as temperature was increased from 15 to 35 degrees C, respectively No significant difference in adult longevity was observed when pollens from live oak, Quercus virginiana Miller, castor bean, Ricinus communis L., cattail, Typha domingensis Persoon, and pygmy date palm, Phoenix roebelenii O'Brien, were provided as food at 25 degrees C. Survivorship was >90% when this predator was reared at 5 constant temperatures on 4 plant pollens as food, with the exception of egg hatch at 35 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m) = 0.265) and net reproductive rate (R(o) = 19.27) were obtained at 25 degrees C compared with the life table parameters derived from the other 4 constant temperatures. When pollens of live oak, castor bean, cattail, and pygmy data palm were provided as single food sources at 25 degrees C, life table parameters indicated that live oak pollen is the most suitable food source, followed by castor bean and cattail pollens.

TI  - Study of reaction intermediates of methanol decomposition and catalytic partial oxidation on Pt/Al2O3
VL  - 354

SP  - 26-32
AB  - Methanol is considered a promising liquid fuel for hydrogen fuel cell systems. Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of methanol offers the potential of producing hydrogen for these systems, and is capable of high hydrogen production rates with no heat addition. However, the mechanism of methanol CPO is not completely understood due to its complexity. In this work, methanol CPO on Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was studied using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and mass spectrometry. Methanol adsorption experiments were conducted on different catalyst states. Methoxy species, CH3Os, were formed during dissociative adsorption of methanol. As temperature was increased, formate adspecies, likely formed by reaction of methoxy species with surface hydroxyls, were increasingly formed. Ignition of CPO was also studied, and it was found to occur at room temperature on both reduced and oxidized powder catalysts. Formate disappeared during this process, while CO species and CO2 were detected in the products. CPO was studied at different temperatures from 723 K to 973 K, and for methanol to oxygen mole ratios from 2 to 4. It was found that CO2 productivity increased at lower temperatures and H2 and CO had a higher selectivity at higher temperatures. Fuel lean conditions favored H2 and HCOOH production. CO2 increased when O2 concentration increased in the reaction mixture. These results suggest that formate was one of the important intermediates in the methanol partial oxidation reaction pathway. Indirect formate decomposition is dominant for CO2 production in the reactions at higher temperatures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Foliage edibility of Scots pine clones for Diprion pini L. (Hym., Diprionidae). I. Influence of the consumption of needles of different pine clones on the development of D. pini Foliage edibility of Scots pine clones of French and Polish origin (woodlands near Haguenau in Alsace and near Taborz in Mazury) is tested on the pine sawfly Diprion pini L. Feeding bioassays were first performed with larvae of the first instar, larval mortality being appreciated after 10 or 12 days of foliage feeding. These tests were realized in standard laboratory conditions (20 °C, 16h30/7h30 photoperiod and 16 °C, 15h/9h photoperiod) with the foliage of 27 clones selected according to morphological characteristics. These experiments enabled us to select 4 clones showing well differentiated capacities of edibility, to feed more aged larvae, from the 4th instar to cocoon spinning. Several biological characteristics as development rate, size, fecundity and diapause rate were then observed in addition to mortality on diprions fed with the foliage of these clones. This later test was carried out in natural conditions of temperature and photoperiod. The whole of these experiments shows that some clones are favourable or unfavourable to the sawfly survival and development. Unfavourable clones are mainly found in clone population of Taborz origin. In addition to high mortality, consumption of the needles of these pines induces decrease in foliage eating and deterioration of the physiological state of the surviving insects: decrease in size and in fecundity, changes in development and diapause rate. These effects are compared, by bioassays on aged larvae, to consumption incidence of the young needles. La comestibilité du feuillage de différents clones de pins sylvestres provenant de peuplements naturels de la région de Haguenau en Alsace (France) et de Taborz en Mazurie (Pologne) est testée sur Diprion pini L. Des expériences d'Alimentation ont d'Abord été effectuées sur des larves du premier stade dont la mortalité est appréciée après dix à douze jours de consommation du feuillage. Ces tests ont été réalisés dans des conditions standard de laboratoire (20 °C, photopériode 16h30/7h30 et 16 °C, photopériode 15 h/9 h) avec le feuillage de 27 clones sélectionnés en fonction de caractères morphologiques. Ces expériences ont permis de choisir 4 clones présentant des caractères de comestibilité bien différenciés pour l'alimentation de larves plus âgées, du 4ème stade larvaire jusqu'à la formation du cocon. Des caractéristiques biologiques variées telles que la durée de développement, la taille, la fécondité et le taux de diapause ont alors été observées sur les diprions alimentés avec le feuillage de ces clones, en sus de la mortalité. Ce dernier test a été réalisé en conditions de températures et de photopériodes naturelles. L'ensemble de ces expérimentations a permis de mettre en évidence l'existence d'un certain nombre de clones favorables ou défavorables à la survie et au développement des diprions. Ces derniers sont surtout présents dans la population de clones originaires de Taborz. La consommation de leurs aiguilles se traduit non seulement par une très importante mortalité, mais par une réduction de la quantité de feuillage consommé et par une profonde altération de l'état physiologique des survivants: diminution de la taille et de la fécondité des insectes, modification de leur durée de développement et de leur taux de diapause. Ces effets sont comparés à ceux de l'ingestion du jeune feuillage de l'année, testée corrélativement sur les larves âgées. Zum Nahrungswert verschiedener Klone von Pinus sylvestris für Diprion pini L. (Hym., Diprionidae). I. Einfluß der Verzehrs von Nadeln unterschiedlicher Kiefernklone auf die Entwicklung von D. pini Versuche über den Einfluß der Aufzucht mit Nadeln verschiedener Kiefernklone bei Diprion pini wurden mit französischen und polnischen Kiefernherkünften aus Wäldern bei Haguenau, Elsaß sowie Taborz, Mazury (Polen) durchgeführt. Die Fütterung wurde mit den LI begonnen, deren Mortalität nach 10 oder 12 Tagen bestimmt wurde. Es herrschten standardisierte Laborverhältnisse (20 °C, 1,5/ 7,5 h sowie 16 °C, 15/9 h Photoperiode). Die Experimente führten zur Ausscheidung von 4 Klonen, die deutlich verschiedene Nahrungswerte für die älteren Larven (L4) bis zum Spinnen der Kokons aufwiesen. Neben der unterschiedlichen Mortalität drückten sich die Nahrungswertdifferenzen auch in Unterschieden biologischer Parameter aus wie Entwicklungsrate, Größe, Fruchtbarkeit und Diapauserate, wobei diese Tests unter natürlichen Bedingungen stattfanden. Insgesamt zeigten die Untersuchungen, daß einige Kiefernklone günstig und andere ungünstig auf das Überleben und die Entwicklung der Kiefernbuschhornblattwespe wirkten. Begünstigende Klone entstammten vor allem den Populationen von Taborz. Zusätzlich zu der höheren Sterblichkeit bewirkte die Ernährung mit Nadeln dieser Kiefern eine Veränderung der gefressenen Nadelmenge und eine Verschlechterung des physiologischen Status der Überlebenden: Abnahme der Größe und Fruchtbarkeit sowie Veränderungen der Entwicklungs‐ und Diapauserate. Diese Wirkungen werden mit den Ergebnissen früherer Arbeiten mit älteren Diprion‐Larven und jungen Kiefernnadeln verglichen. 1990 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - Influence of the previous stay of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. in waste waters on their survival in seawater

SP  - 1005-1011
AB  - Sewage treatment plants are designed to purify wastewaters for given parameters, but their microbiological effectiveness is often poor without addition of a specific treatment (disinfection, filtration, etc.). Large amounts of enteric bacteria are thus released into the environment, in rivers and seawater. Is their subsequent survival in these hostile environments influenced by their previous stay in wastewaters? In order to assess this potential adaptation, we studied the behavior of E. coli, S. typhimurium and S. manhattan in seawater microcosms, with and without a previous 24 to 72 h stay in raw and treated wastewaters. The seawater and wastewater media were 0.22 μm filtered and autoclaved. The protocol followed is outlined in Fig. 1. At each step, bacteria were harvested by filtration and re-suspended in the following medium. All microcosms were maintained at 20°C, in the dark. Seven experiments were carried out, testing seven different wastewaters. The survival of the inoculated bacteria in seawater during 6 days was monitored by plate counts on trypticsoy agar and by acridine orange epifluorescence counts (Hobbie et al., 1977). In two experiments, the bacterial enzymatic activity was assessed before and after the stay in seawater, using APIZYM kits. S. typhimurium's survival in seawater was increased when cells had previously spent 24 h in raw wastewaters, and 24 and 48 h in treated wastewaters (Fig. 3). The culturable count was about 2 log units higher after 6 days. The same phenomenon was observed for S. manhattan tested in two raw wastewaters (Fig. 4). For this strain, with a concentrated inoculum (7 × 106/ml), survival was quite the same, with or without a previous stay in raw sewage. An adaptation of E. coli while in wastewater to subsequent seawater stress seemed less obvious (Fig. 5). While monitoring the behavior of enteric bacteria in seawater with different previous conditions, we assessed the ratio of culturable cells in the total population. Thus, loss of culturability of tested strains was smaller when bacteria had been put in wastewaters before seawater (Table 1). This could show that the level of cellular metabolism maintained was higher in this case. This hypothesis was confirmed by studying the enzymatic activity of S. typhimurium before and after 6 days in seawater (Fig. 6). A previous stay in sewage could preserve or even induce some enzymatic activity which was then maintained during the entire exposition to seawater. This suggests an active metabolism enabling new protein synthesis. In this study, we showed that Enterobacteriaceae could adapt to seawater stress during their stay in sewage and sewage treatment plants. The actual mechanism is not yet clear. It could be osmoprotection, modification of cellular metabolism, or another. Very few studies have dealt with this topic. Munro et al. (1987, 1989) observed that a previous culture in a saline medium or on a mixed wastewater/seawater agar could allow better E. coli survival in seawater. The osmoregulation mechanisms induced by high osmolarity are probably set up during this phase. This hypothesis cannot explain our results, since the wastewaters we used had very low osmolarity. It seems that adaptation to drastic conditions occurs during the stay in wastewater (lower temperature, lack of easily assimilated substrates, etc.) allowing for better survival in more drastic seawater conditions. This conclusion may be of great importance in assessing the sanitary quality of coastal areas used for bathing and shellfishing activities. © 1995.

TI  - Optimization of operating temperature for an continuous immobilized glucose isomerase reactor with pseudo linear kinetics
VL  - 4
IS  - 5
SP  - 450-459
AB  - In this work, the optimal operating temperature for the enzymatic isomerization of glucose to fructose using a continuous immobilized glucose isomerase packed bed reactor is studied. This optimization problem describing the performance of such reactor is based on reversible pseudo linear kinetics and is expressed in terms of a recycle ratio. The thermal deactivation of the enzyme as well as the substrate protection during the reactor operation is considered. The formulation of the problem is expressed in terms of maximization of the productivity of fructose. This constrained nonlinear optimization problem is solved using the disjoint policy of the calculus of variations. Accordingly, this method of solution transforms the nonlinear optimization problem into a system of two coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the initial value type, one equation for the operating temperature profile and the other one for the enzyme activity. The ODE for the operating temperature profile is dependent on the recycle ratio, operating time period, and the reactor residence time as well as the kinetics of the reaction and enzyme deactivation. The optimal initial operating temperature is selected by solving the ODEs system by maximizing the fructose productivity. This results into an unconstrained one-dimensional optimization problem with simple bounds on the operating temperature. Depending on the limits of the recycle ratio, which represents either a plug flow or a mixed flow reactor, it is found that the optimal temperature of operation is characterized by an increasing temperature profile. For higher residence time and low operating periods the residual enzyme activity in the mixed flow reactor is higher than that for the plug flow reactor, which in turn allows the mixed flow reactor to operate at lower temperature than that of the plug flow reactor. At long operating times and short residence time, the operating temperature profiles are almost the same for both reactors. This could be attributed to the effect of substrate protection on the enzyme stability, which is almost the same for both reactors. Improvement in the fructose productivity for both types of reactors is achieved when compared to the constant optimum temperature of operation. The improvement in the fructose productivity for the plug flow reactor is significant in comparison with the mixed flow reactor. © 2004 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & CO. KGaA.

TI  - Environmental correlates of life‐history variation in juvenile chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum)
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-17
AB  - Throughout its native North Pacific, the chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum), exists as twolife‐history types that aredistinguished by the age at which juvenile salmon migrate to sea as smolts. ‘Stream‐type’ chinook migrate seaward after I or more years of feeding in fresh water, whereas ‘ocean‐type’ fish migrate to sea as newly emerged fry or after 2–3 months in fresh water. Stream‐type chinook predominate in populations distant from the sea south of 56° N, and in both inland and coastal populations north of this point. By contrast, ocean‐type chinook predominate in coastal populations south of 56° N, but are rare in populations in more northerly latitudes. Stream‐type populations are associated with areas of low ‘growth opportunity’ (as measured by temperature and photoperiod regimes) and/or areas distant from the sea compared to ocean‐type. Geographic variability in juvenile life history is suggested to result, in part, from environmental modulation of smolting timing via differences in growth opportunity among geo‐graphic areas. In addition, differences in migration distance and temperature regime may result in selection for different sizes at migration among populations which, through differences in growth opportunity, might promote geographic variability in age at seaward migration.

TI  - Temperature-specific outcomes of cytoplasmic-nuclear interactions on egg-to-adult development time in seed beetles
VL  - 61
IS  - 1
SP  - 194-201
AB  - The integration of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes coordinates cellular energy production and is fundamental to life among eukaryotes. Therefore, there is potential for strong selection to shape the interactions between the two genomes. Several studies have now demonstrated that epistatic interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes for fitness can occur both at a "within" and "across" population level. Genotype-by-environment interactions are common for traits that are encoded by nuclear genes, but the effects of environmental heterogeneity on traits that are partly encoded by cytoplasmic genes have received little attention despite the fact that there are reasons to believe that phenotypic effects of cytoplasmic genetic variation may often be environment specific. Consequently, the importance of environmental heterogeneity to the outcomes of cyto-nuclear fitness interactions and to the maintenance of mitochondrial polymorphism is unclear. Here, we assess the influence of temperature on cyto-nuclear effects on egg-to-adult development time in seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus). We employed an "across-population" design, sourcing beetles from five distinct populations and using backcrossing to create orthogonal combinations of distinct introgression lines, fixed for their cytoplasmic and nuclear lineages. We then assayed development times at two different temperatures and found sizeable cyto-nuclear effects in general, as well as temperature- and block-specific cyto-nuclear effects. These results demonstrate that environmental factors such as temperature do exert selection on cytoplasmic genes by favoring specific cyto-nuclear genetic combinations, and are consistent with the suggestion that complex genotype-by-environment interactions may promote the maintenance of polymorphism in mitochondrial genes. © 2007 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2007 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Esterase‐6 and the pheromonal effects of cis‐vaccenyl acetate in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 2
IS  - 6
SP  - 395-407
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster the polymorphic enzyme Est‐6 and a male specific lipid, cis‐vaccenyl acetate (cVA), are components of the seminal fluid. It has been suggested that cVA could be a physiological substrate for Est‐6, constituting, together with the hypothetical hydrolytic product, cis‐vaccenyl alcohol (cVOH), a pheromonal system active in the regulation of the sexual attractiveness of mated females. However, some doubt exists concerning the physiological conversion of cVA to cVOH in females. Est‐6 is also known to affect sperm motility, sperm use and female fecundity. The results of a study on qualitative and quantitative effects of topical treatment of females with cis‐vaccenyl acetate and cis‐vaccenyl alcohol on courtship behaviour are presented. The inhibition of courtship produced by cVOH was more persistent; this was possibly related to its lower volatility. The hypothesis was tested that different Est‐6 allozymes could produce different amounts of cis‐vaccenyl alcohol in vivo by differential hydrolysis of cis‐vaccenyl acetate, and thus affect the timing of remating. For this purpose highly homogeneous Est‐6S and Est‐6F homozygous lines, with almost certainly identical levels of Est‐6 and cVA, were used. They were obtained after 100 generations of inbreeding and selection of the heterozygotes at each generation. The Est‐6S and Est‐6F products of the Est‐6 structural gene did not differentially affect the timing of remating. This could imply that the two allozymes have similar catalytic properties. However, such results could be obtained even if cVA is not converted to cVOH in vivo by Est‐6. The effects of Est‐6 allozymes on sperm use after remating were also investigated. The general effect of second males was a very high elimination of first male fertilizations. No evidence for a different contribution of the two allozymes to the fitness through sperm predominance was obtained. Remating and sperm predominance experiments were performed at three temperatures: 18, 25 and 30° C. A more general—not species specific—role of cis‐vaccenyl esters is suggested by preliminary results on their presence in the ejaculate of other Drosophila species. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The reproductive biology, and larval and adult host rant e of Diabrotica speciosa (Germar), Diabrotica viridula (F.), Acalymma spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae), and other Diabroticina are described. These Diabroticina are pests of several crops in South and Central America. The adult feeding hosts are compared, among species, and within species in different seasons, Laboratory oviposition and larval development tests oil several hosts, provided the basis to construct a table of putative hosts, and general reproductive traits related to two species groups of Diabrotica (virgifera and fucata). Eggs of D. speciosa and D. viridula. were exposed to low temperatures to detect the ability to be dormant. Multivoltinism and lack of egg diapause was demonstrated for the three species, and field data suggest other South American species present the same traits. Diabrotica speciosa (fucata group) larvae developed well on maize (Zea mays I.). peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) roots, and not so well oil pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne and Cucurbita andreana Naudin), beaus (Phaseolus spp.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) roots. Oviposition preferences roughly paralleled larval suitability. but there was a clear preference for cucurbits as adult food, when a available pigweed (Amaranthus quitensis Knuth), sunflower (Ikhanthus annuus. L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were in second place. Diabrotica viridula (virgifera group), preferred maize as adult and larval food, and for oviposition. Acalymma spp.. were associated in every respect to cucurbits, Other species showed varying degrees of preference for oviposition and feeding, but in general. cucurbits were the preferred adult feeding hosts. Followed by several wild plants, and maize the preferred oviposition host. Whereas cucurbits A were consistently visited by the adults of every species, the virgifera group species ovipositioned and developed exclusively on Mono-cotyledonae, However, D, speciosa. as expected for a fucata group species ovipositcd and developed oil a wide range of hosts. This new knowledge oil South American Diabroticina is discussed in the context of the current knowledge oil North American Diabroticina, Differences and similarities are discussed in connection with their pestiferous status, and their potential for adaptation to new hosts.

TI  - Relationships between intertidal clam population and health status of the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Saguenay Fjord (Québec, Canada)
VL  - 34
IS  - 1
SP  - 30-43
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impacts of anthropogenic activity on the health status of intertidal clam populations of the Saguenay Fjord and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada). Clams were collected during low We at sites subject to direct contamination and at sites far from human activity. Clams were analyzed for tributyltin and dibutyltin total levels and toxic stress (glutathione S-transferase, gonadal lipid peroxidation and DNA strand breaks), immunocompetence (phagocytic activity, hemocyte count and viability), reproduction (gonado-somatic index, gamete maturation, and vitellogenin-like proteins), energy status (temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport, and gonad lipids), and individual status (age, condition factor, and growth index). These responses were compared against population characteristics such as live clam density, number of empty shells, and sex ratio. The results show that clam density decreased with distance from the estuary (high salinity level) to upstream of the fjord (low salinity). There was no clear relationship between the number of empty shells and distance or site quality. Clam density values corrected against distance were significantly correlated with hemocyte viability, phagocytic activity, mitochondrial electron transport (MET), DNA damage in gonad, and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. A canonical analysis of the various groups of biomarkers revealed that population metrics were more strongly related with immunocompetence, followed by energy status and temperature-dependent mitochondrial electron transport activity. However, toxic stress biomarkers were strongly associated with energy status and reproduction. This was further confirmed by non-linear modeling using adaptive artificial neural networks (genetic selection and back propagation learning paradigms), where the following parameters were able to predict population parameters with <20% error: gonad maturation and somatic index, MET (at 4 degrees C), gonad LPO, DNA damage, and phagocytic capacity. Intertidal clam populations were influenced by a distance gradient effect (salinity), where immunocompetence, in addition to energy status, was the strongest physiological parameter related to clam population metrics.

AB  - Populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura Frolowa initially polymorphic for the third chromosome gene arrangements Standard (ST) and Chiricahua (CH) were allowed to colonise systems of interconnected cages in which each section was subjected to a different regime of temperature and illumination. Estimates of gross productivity and migrational tendencies revealed major differences in favourability amongst the contrasting environments offered in the component units of the three multiple environment cage systems examined. Within each group of interconnected cages migration was permitted continuously throughout the experiments. The development of genetic divergence between the interconnected subpopulations was assessed by comparison of the relative frequencies of the ST and CH gene arrangements, sex-ratio, morphology, genetic variance, developmental stability and behaviour in relation to food preference shown by each subpopulation. In each of the three systems tested significant genetic differentiation between adjoining subpopulations resulted from natural selection within 25-30 generations, in spite of high migration rates and therefore potentially high gene flow. © 1964 Martinus Nijhoff.

SP  - 166-174
AB  - Pulsed laser deposited (PLD) Y-doped BaZrO3 thin films (BaZr1-xYxO3-y/2, x = 0.2, y > 0), were investigated as to their viability for reliable humidity microsensors with long-term stability at high operating temperatures (T > 500 degrees C) as required for in situ point of source emissions control as used in power plant combustion processes. Defect chemistry based models and initial experimental results in recent humidity sensor literature [1,2]. indicate that bulk Y-doped BaZrO3 could be suitable for use in highly selective, high temperature compatible humidity sensors. In order to accomplish faster response and leverage low cost batch microfabrication technologies we have developed thin film deposition processes, characterized layer properties, fabricated and tested high temperature humidity micro sensors using these thin films. Previously published results on sputtering Y-doped BaZrO3 thin films have confirmed the principle validity of our approach [3]. However, the difficulty in controlling the stoichiometry of the films and their electrical properties as well as mud flat cracking of the films occurring either at films thicker than 400 nm or at annealing temperature above 800 degrees C have rendered sputtering a difficult process for the fabrication of reproducible and reliable thin film high temperature humidity microsensors, leading to the evaluation of PLD as alternative deposition method for these films. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data was collected from as deposited samples at the sample surface as well as after 4 min of Ar+ etching. PLD samples were close to the desired stoichiometry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra from all as deposited BaZrO3:Y films show that the material is polycrystalline when deposited at substrate temperatures of 800 degrees C. AFM results revealed that PLD samples have a particle size between 32 nm and 72 nm and root mean square (RMS) roughness between 0.2 nm and 1.2 nm. The film conductivity increases as a function of temperature (from 200 degrees C to 650 degrees C) and upon exposure to a humid atmosphere, supporting our hypothesis of a proton conduction based conduction and sensing mechanism. Humidity measurements are presented for 200-500 nm thick films from 500 degrees C to 650 degrees C at vapor pressures of between 0.05 and 0.5 atm, with 0.03-2% error in repeatability and 1.2-15.7% error in hysteresis during cycling for over 2 h. Sensitivities of up to 7.5 atm(-1) for 200 nm thick PLD samples at 0.058 atm partial pressure of water were measured. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fish Management Problems of High Western Lakes with Returns from Marked Trout Planted in Upper Angora Lake California
VL  - 71

SP  - 249-269
AB  - Upper Angora Lake in the high Sierra Mountains was selected for an experimental study conducted from 1934 to 1936, inclusive. It is a small 5-acre lake lying at an elevation of 7,800 feet, 7 miles south of Lake Tahoe. General ecological conditions and management problems of such high lakes are discussed. Low water temperatures over most of the year limit both growth of fish and production of aquatic foods. The standing crop of bottom foods averaged 49 pounds (wet weight) per acre. Dominant aquatic foods were midge larvae, bristle worms (oligochaetes) and scuds (Hyalella). Stomach examinations of trout indicated that dominant foods eaten were midge larvae and pupae. Aquatic organisms formed over 66 per cent by number of foods eaten. Two lots of marked eastern brook trout were planted, one of 5,028 averaging about 2 inches in length, and another of 2,080 averaging 5 1/2 inches in length. The small fish were planted in September and the larger in June 1935. Both lots were marked by removal of fins. The lake outlet was screened to prevent fish from leaving the lake. A Creel census was taken throughout the angling seasons of 1934, 1935 and1936. Only weight, species, date of capture, and the presence or absence ofmarks were recorded. No record was kept of the length of time each anglerfished or of anglers who failed to catch fish. Catches of both marked and unmarked fish totaled 89 trout in 1934, 809 in1935, and 211 in 1936. Eastern brook trout were dominant in the catches. Afew rainbow and brown trout were taken each year. Over the 3-year period covered, only 4.3 per cent of the 5,080 2-inch easternbrook trout, and 25.6 per cent of the 5 1/2-inch fish, were reported caught.Judging from the results of work presented iu this paper and the results ofthe work of other iuvestigators cited, losses of trout planted are extremelyheavy regardless of the size of fish planted. Better survival of small 2-inch trout was obtained after three winters inthe lake than for 5 1/2-inch fish after only one winter in the lake. Markedfish of both plantings formed 77 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively, of fishcaptured and retained in 1935 and 1936. No marked fish were reported in1934. The planting of small eastern brook trout made in the fall of 1933contributed most fish to anglers the second year after stocking. The plantingof larger trout contributed most in the same season in which they werestocked. The small marked trout grew at a rate of over 2.5 inches per yearfor the 3-year period covered by the ereel census, and the larger grew at arate of 1.7 inches per year. Production in pounds per acre was 15.8 in 1934, 21.2 in 1935, and 17.0 in1936. Eastern brook trout formed 28 per cent by weight of all trout landedin 1934, 93 per cent in 1935, and 48 per cent in 1936. Age determigrations from scale studies indicated that the majority of east-ern brook trout caught were in their third year, and the presence of incomingyoung in their first and second years gave evidence of successful naturalpropagation in the lake. No rainbow trout less than 3 years old or browntrout less than 5 years of age, were present in the samples studied. Fifteen brown trout that averaged 2.18 pounds each and weighed up to 7pounds were reported caught in 1936. Predation by a few large brown troutis suggested as one cause of the low survival of planted trout and the removalof such fish by selective gill-netting operations is presented as a possiblemanagement measm'e in lakes where destruction of entire populations bypoisons or other means is not desired. © 1942 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 129

SP  - 1-7
AB  - The effect of acid decontamination on the growth/survival of Listeria monocytogenes on fresh lettuce (Lactusa sativa) during storage and subsequent exposure to a simulated gastric fluid was studied. Fresh lettuce, inoculated with L. monocytogenes (3 log cfu/cm2), was immersed (20 °C, 90 s) in water (W), lactic acid (LA), acetic acid (AA), propionic acid (PA) and citric acid (CA) at concentrations 0.5 and 1.0%, and then stored aerobically at 5 and 20 °C for 20 and 10 days, respectively. The immediate post-treatment reduction of L. monocytogenes was less than 1 log cfu/cm2 for all treatments tested. The level of L. monocytogenes on W treated lettuce did not change during storage at 5 °C but increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) and reached levels of 106-107 cfu/cm2 at 20 °C. The residual effect of acid decontamination treatments during storage was found to be strongly dependent on the type and concentration of the acid solution. Decontamination with 0.5% AA, PA and CA did not have any antimicrobial effect and in some cases stimulated growth of the pathogen. The latter could be attributed to suppression of lettuce natural microflora. In contrast, decontamination with 0.5% LA resulted in a decrease of the pathogen during storage at 5 °C and in an extended lag phase at 20 °C. Increasing the concentration of acid solutions to 1% resulted in a rapid decline of L. monocytogenes for all acids tested except for CA, in which the behaviour of the pathogen was similar to that observed in W treated lettuce. The results from the sensory analysis showed that decontamination of lettuce with AA and PA led to a significant (P &lt; 0.05) negative effect on the overall appearance of lettuce while the sensory score of samples treated with LA and CA during storage was very close to that of W treated lettuce (P &gt; 0.05). The above results from the sensory analysis were confirmed by color analysis of lettuce. In order to evaluate the potential acid adaptation phenomena induced by acid decontamination interventions, the survival of L. monocytogenes during exposure to a simulated gastric fluid after prior storage of decontaminated lettuce was studied. The results showed that the tested decontamination treatments did not increase the acid tolerance of L. monocytogenes. In contrast, LA treatments sensitized the pathogen to the acidic simulated stomach conditions indicating a decreased virulence potential. © 2008.

TI  - The marine temperature and depth preferences of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and sea trout (Salmo trutta), as recorded by data storage tags
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
SP  - 436-447
AB  - Eleven Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) (370-512 mm) and eight sea trout (Salmo trutta) (370-585 mm in length) were tagged externally or internally with depth- and temperature-measuring data-storage tags (DST) before they were released into the sea in the Alta Fjord in north Norway in June 2002. All sea trout were recaptured after they spent 1-40 days at sea, while all Arctic charr were recaptured after 0.5-33 days at sea. On average, trout preferred water about 0.6 m deeper and 1.3°C warmer than Arctic charr. Arctic charr spent >50% of their time between 0 and 1 m depth, while trout spent >50% of their time between 1 and 2 m depth. Both species spent >90% of their time in water no deeper than 3 m from the water surface. However, sea trout dove more frequently and to greater depths (max. 28 m) than Arctic charr (max. 16 m), and these deep dives were most frequently performed at the end of the sea migration. Arctic charr demonstrated a diel diving pattern, staying on average about 0.5 m deeper between 08:00 hours and about 15:00 hours than during the rest of the 24 h, even though there was continuous daylight during the experiments. When comparing data obtained from the DSTs with temperature measurements within the fjord system, the two species were observed to select different feeding areas during their sea migration, the sea trout choosing the inner and warmer parts of the fjord, in contrast to the Arctic charr that preferred the outer, colder parts of the fjord. The observed differences in migration behaviour between the two species are discussed in relation to species preferences for prey and habitat selection, and their optimal temperatures for growth. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Generation of Aeromonas hydrophila ghosts and their evaluation as oral vaccine candidates in Carassius auratus gibelio
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 202-206
AB  - The bacterial ghost (BG) system is a novel vaccine delivery system endowed with intrinsic adjuvant properties. Bacterial ghosts are nonliving Gram-negative bacterial cell envelopes devoid of cytoplasmic contents while maintaining their cellular morphology and native surface antigenic structures. They are produced by PhiX174 protein E-mediated lysis of Gram-negative bacteria, and can induce humoral and cellular immune response, including mucosal immune responses. Plasmid pElysis consisting E gene was transformed into AhJ-1. Through shifting the culture temperature from 28 degrees C to 42 degrees C, A. hydrophila J-1 (pElysis) was induced to lyse and the OD600 value of culture media was measured every 15 minutes during the induction. The lysed bacteria were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The A. hydrophila ghosts (AHG) used as oral vaccine were also investigated. The OD600 value of A. hydrophila J-1(pElysis) began to decline after 30 min of induction, and after 75 min of induction, the OD600 value decline speed become slowly. The efficiency of ghost induction in non-lyophilized A. hydrophila was 99.99%, 16 hours post induced, no live bacteria can be detected in culture. Scanning electron microscopy observation proved that most lysed bacteria were emptied. Fish vaccination experiments shows that the antibody evoked highest degree after 5 weeks by oral administration of bacterial ghost vaccine and the agglutination antibody titer reached 2(7) and continued two weeks, while the agglutination antibody titer of formalin killed vaccine only reached 26 and only maintained one week. After challenged with the parent strain J-1, the survival rate of bacterial ghost vaccinated fish was higher than the control group and formalin killed vaccine group, the relative percent survival (RPS) was 78.95% (16/20), but the RPS of formalin killed vaccine group was 57.9% (12/20). This suggests that the bacterial ghost vaccine has higher potential to induce protective adaptive immunity than normal vaccine.

VL  - 61

SP  - 323-327
AB  - Three options of water temperatures in a thermal gradient that changed from 22 to 35 degrees C were offered to Pantanal caiman (Caiman croocodilus yacare) hatchlings. Animals from two nests were submitted to temperatures during 19 days (Nest 1 -- 20 caimans caught in the nature hours after hatching), corresponding to 1 to 7 observations periods, and 13 days (Nest 2 -- 20 animals obtained by artificial incubation) relative to observation period 8. Caimans remain fasting during experimental period. Hatchlings were allocated in a enclosure containing three styrofoam boxes (120 L) disposed side by side enclosed by wire netting and filled with water to the top. Thus, the animals were free to access the boxes, which temperatures were changed at the end of each observation period to avoid position effects. Air temperature was keep close to 22 degrees C by air conditioning and water temperature was controlled by thermostats. The trial was divided in three phases determined by elimination of the less frequented temperature and its substitution by another temperature. In a first phase of the experiment that contained 1, 2 and 3 observation periods, the thermostats were regulated to 22 degrees C (BoxD), 26 degrees C (BxC) and 32 degrees C (BxA). In phase 2 to 26 degrees C, 29.5 degrees C (BxB) and 32 degrees C, including 4, 5 and 6 periods. In the third phase that included 7 and 8 periods, the thermostats were adjusted to 29.5 degrees C, 32 degrees C and 35 degrees C (BxE). The number of caimans in each box was recorded two to three times a day (8:00, 14:00 and 17:00h) before pointed water temperature. Mean water temperatures (+ standard deviation) and respective caiman frequency means by box/temperature were: Phase 1 (BxD/22.3 +/- 1.2 degrees C - 10.3%; BxC/27.0 +/- 2.4 degrees C - 32.0% and BxA/31.2 +/- 1.1 degrees C - 57.6%); Phase 2 (BxC/26.6 +/- 2.8 degrees C - 13.3%; BxB/29.3 +/- 2.2 degrees C - 27.7% and BxA/31.3 +/- 1.2 degrees C - 59.0%) and Phase 3 (BxB/29.5 +/- 3.6 degrees C - 23.7%; BxA/31.0 +/- 2.2 degrees C - 31.9 and BxE/34.0 +/- 2.2 degrees C - 44.4%). Observing that in the phases 1 and 2 the box with hottest water (CxA) was more frequented. In the phase 3, the difference between higher and smaller frequency straiten to 20.7%, in relation to almost 46.5% in phases 1 and 2, indicating that water temperatures between 29.5 and 35 degrees C resulted in body temperatures more next to the comfort zone, in the experimental conditions.

TI  - How temperature affects development and reproduction in spiders: A review
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SP  - 245-274
AB  - We review previously published studies on how temperature affects development and reproduction of spiders, with an emphasis on recent studies from China published in Chinese. We apply both linear and non-linear models to data from these papers to examine relationships between temperature and the spider's rate of development, and we estimate the thermal requirements of selected species. Intra-and interspecific variation in development time, survival, adult longevity, adult size, and reproduction are considered, and apparently, phenotypic plasticity in these above life history traits is induced by growth temperature. With respect to the life histories and life style of the spider species we argue that the thermal adaptations of spiders might have important roles in fine-tuning the species' life-history strategies: much of this variability is probably a consequence of adaptations to the different thermal conditions prevailing in the natural habitats of these species. Spiders living in warmer climates can withstand higher temperatures than species from colder climates, and species from colder climates can tolerate lower temperatures than species from warmer climates. Cold-habitat species develop more slowly at high temperatures, and warm-habitat species develop more slowly at low temperatures. Also, different species of spiders show different seasonal adaptations to the microenvironments in which they live: fast, low-temperature development is an indicator of adaptation to colder season(s) of the year, whereas slow, low-temperature development and fast, high-temperature development are indicators of adaptation to warm season(s) of the year.

TI  - Towards reliable Legionella pneumophila analysis in wastewater samples: Evaluating the impact of the sample preparation methods
VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-102
AB  - The detection and quantification of Legionella pneumophila in waste water samples according to the existing standard methods (NF T90-431 and XP T90-471, respectively based on the cultivation and quantitative PCR) is made difficult, partly as a result of the diversity and richness in inhibitors (microorganisms that can cause interfering flora and organic compounds inhibiting the PCR amplification). However, the contamination sources tracking during epidemic outbreaks of Legionella diseases requires the availability of reliable methods for the analysis of such samples (raw and treated wastewater and activated sludge samples). Based on the standard NF T90-431 (2003), the contact time and intensity of physical-chemical parameters (temperature, acid pH) introducing selective pressure for the Legionella growth on culture media were optimized. The major improvements concerned the activated sludge matrix. By settling the suspension obtained after mechanical dispersion (Ultraturrax mixing) and by increasing the duration of treatment with heat and acid, the recovery and the quantification reproducibility of L. pneumophila were enhanced by limiting the growth of abundant microflora from 35 ± 2,4 % when classical pre-treatments were applied to 48 (± 4) % with optimized conditions. At the opposite, no solution could be found with respect to a strong inhibition effect observed in some cases for raw wastewater samples, independently of the effect of interfering microflora growth. For the application of quantitative PCR, five different DNA extraction - purification protocols (commercial kits and published references) were evaluated and compared on these samples. QiaAmp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen) showed to be the most efficient for L. pneumophila PCR quantification (in terms of recovery and reproducibility as well as PCR inhibitors removing). Otherwise, a specific immunomagnetic separation (IMS), based on the antigen-antibody specific recognition represents an interesting alternative for the concentration of L. pneumophila. When applied upstream of PCR, IMS allows to simplify the analyse and to reduce the delay before getting results. However, IMS failed to enhance L. pneumophila quantification by culture. Thus, resulting developments will enable access to the occurrence of L. pneumophila in natural matrices whose complexity limiting the number of tests carried out so far prevented and to have reliable results.

TI  - Subcritical water extraction to evaluate desorption behavior of organic pesticides in soil
VL  - 50
IS  - 8
SP  - 2338-2343
AB  - We evaluated the feasibility of extracting organic pesticides in soil using a hot-water percolation apparatus at 105 °C and 120 kPa pressure. Efficiency of the method was assessed by extracting six selected pesticides (acetochlor, atrazine, diazinon, carbendazim, imidacloprid, and isoproturon) from previously equilibrated soil at 13.6-65.8 mg/kg concentration range. Studies were performed on brown forest soil with clay alluviation (Luvisol). The method developed was compared to the traditional batch equilibrium method in terms of desorbed amount of pesticides from soil and extraction time. Pesticides in the liquid phase from the batch sorption experiment and in the effluent from the hot-water percolation were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The results of the percolation experiment are in close correlation with those of the conventional soil testing method. Desorbed quantities by hot-water percolation were 85% acetochlor, 62% atrazine, 65% carbendazim, 44% diazinon, 95% imidacloprid, and 84% isoproturon, whereas using batch equilibrium method 101, 66, 64, 37, 81, and 90% were desorbed, expressed as the percentage of the adsorbed amount of pesticide on soil following equilibration. The average time for hot-water extraction was 3.45 min, in contrast to the 16 h time consumption of the traditional batch method. The effect of temperature on stability of selected compounds was also evaluated using pesticide-spiked sand without soil. Recoveries of analytes ranged between 84.6 and 91.1% with reproducibility of 7.9-10.2%, except for diazinon, for which recovery was 59.4% with 14.4% relative standard deviation since decomposition occurred at elevated temperature. The percolation process has been described by a first-order kinetic equation. The parameters calculated from the equation provide an opportunity to estimate the amount of compound available for desorption, the rate of desorption processes in the studied soil-pesticide-water system, and modeling the leaching process to obtain additional information on the environmental behavior of the examined pesticide.

TI  - Climate change and prolongation of growing season: Changes in regional potential for field crop production in Finland
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 171-190
AB  - Climate change offers new opportunities for Finnish field crop production, which is currently limited by the short growing season. A warmer climate will extend the thermal growing season and the physiologically effective part of it. Winters will also become milder, enabling introduction of winter-sown crops to a greater extent than is possible today. With this study we aim to characterise the likely regional differences in capacity to grow different seed producing crops. Prolongation of the Finnish growing season was estimated using a 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude gridded dataset from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The dataset comprised an average estimate from 19 global climate models of the response of Finnish climate to low (Bl) and high (A2) scenarios of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions for 30-year periods centred on 2025,2055 and 2085 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Growing season temperature sums that suit crop growth and are agronomically feasible in Finland are anticipated to increase by some 140 °Cd by 2025, 300 °Cd by 2055 and 470 °Cd by 2085 in scenario A2, when averaged over regions, and earlier sowing is expected to take place, but not later harvests. Accordingly, the extent of cultivable areas for the commonly grown major and minor crops will increase considerably. Due to the higher base temperature requirement for maize (Zea mays L.) growth than for temperate crops, we estimate that silage maize could become a Finnish field crop for the most favourable growing regions only at the end of this century. Winters are getting milder, but it will take almost the whole century until winters such as those that are typical for southern Sweden and Denmark are experienced on a wide scale in Finland. It is possible that introduction of winter-sown crops (cereals and rapeseed) will represent major risks due to fluctuating winter conditions, and this could delay their adaptation for many decades. Such risks need to be studied in more detail to estimate timing of introduction. Prolonged physiologically effective growing seasons would increase yielding capacities of major field crops. Of the current minor crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) are particularly strong candidates to become major crops. Moreover, they have good potential for industrial processing and are currently being bred. Realisation of increased yield potential requires adaptation to 1) elevated daily mean temperatures that interfere with development rate of seed crops under long days, 2) relative reductions in water availability at critical phases of yield determination, 3) greater pest and disease pressure, 4) other uncertainties caused by weather extremes and 5) generally greater need for inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers for non-nitrogen fixing crops. © Agricultural and Food Science.

AB  - A numerical model based on China's West Pipeline has been used to demonstrate the viability of pipeline collocation. The numerical calculation used the same pipe used for the West Pipeline and set the distance between them at 1.2m. Researchers set the buried depth of the crude oil pipeline at a constant of Hc = 1.6m. Assumptions made in the model include uniformity of temperature of crude oil and products, simplification of the soil anisotropy outside the pipelines as isotropy and selection of the thermal influence region of the crude oil pipeline as the computational domain. Simulations show that soil temperature fields on the right side of the crude oil pipeline are basically the same. Therefore, the effect of the products pipeline on the soil temperature field is minor as well as for different pipeline distances. The isothermals on the left side of the crude oil pipeline changed greatly with variation of the vertical relative position of the two pipelines. Also, when there are two pipelines in one ditch, the heat loss of the crude oil pipeline is greater than that of the crude oil pipeline is greater than of the crude oil pipeline laid a ditch on its won at distance less than that of the crude oil pipeline laid in a ditch on its own at distances less than 80-100km and is smaller than that of the single crude oil pipeline at distances greater than 80-100km.

TI  - Potentials for cost reduction in a new model of commercial micropropagation
VL  - 9781402031991
SP  - 403-414
AB  - A commercial micropropagation facility, using semi-solid medium in jam bottles as culture containers and a conventional growthroom (with filtration of the air condition system and artificial lighting), was adapted to a new system which uses proprietary liquid medium, improved handling methods to speed up inoculations in polybags and biologically clean stock cultures. Diffused sunlight in the greenhouse is used as light source for the multiplication and rooting of cultures. The temperature of the greenhouse was only controlled by fan- and pad cooling when exceeding 37°C in the afternoons of hot days, allowing ambient temperature of the greenhouse as sufficient control for the cultures. A representative comparison from the daily commercial production records of both the systems was conducted. In the new system, number of propagules produced per workstation per day increased 5 times, and rate of multiplication of propagules per culture in a multiplication cycle increased 3.5 times. Thus, net improvement of performance of the new system is product of these, i.e. 17 times. This is without infusion of automation and with simultaneous reduction in capital costs, running costs as well as interest cost. Further, losses from contamination and during hardening stage is also reduced in the new system. Cost data has been presented on a comparative basis to avoid disclosing commercially sensitive absolute figures. Use of natural light and ambient temperature for culture incubation achieved about a 75% reduction in capital cost as well as in the cost of electricity. Production of cultures per worker, on account of new proprietary handling methods, was 70% more in the new model, a factor relevant to developed economies as this feature can be utilized in their present systems too, whether rest of the features of new system are adapted or not. Potential reduction, extrapolated from actually achieved results, in cost of production is 92-98% in Indian context and is estimated to offer about 55-87% for developed countries, depending upon efficiency of hardening. Thus this model is relevant to developing as well as developed countries. Further scope exists in improvement in cost reduction in tropical and semi-tropical climate. In temperate climate, scope is lesser for cost reduction, but the same may yet be practically worthwhile when compared to costs in conventional model. Over and above the advantages mentioned above, sturdiness and survival of plants in hardening was better in plants coming from new system. © 2005 Springer. All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 185
IS  - 3
SP  - 327-340
AB  - A randomized complete block experiment was performed to measure the effect of prescribed, dormant-season bums of three different levels of severity (measured as fuel consumption and soil surface heating) on subsequent insect infestation and mortality of mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.). Multiple-funnel traps baited with a low release rate of turpentine and ethanol were used to monitor activity of certain coniferophagous beetles. Non-aggressive species, including the root beetles Hylastes salebrosus Eichhoff and H. tenuis Eichhoff, the ambrosia beetle Xyleborus pubescens Zimmermann, the reproduction weevil Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), and buprestid borers, were attracted to burned plots in numbers that correlated positively with burn severity. Beetle attraction to burned sites was greatest in the first weeks post-burn and disappeared by the second year. Two potential tree-killing bark beetles, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff), were trapped in significant numbers but exhibited no attraction to burned plots. Tree mortality correlated significantly with the severity of the burns and amounted to 5% of stems in the hottest burn treatment after 3 years. The majority of the mortality was observed in the second and third years post-burn. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus bark beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying trees, and evidence suggested that root pathogens may have contributed to tree susceptibility to beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that selection of burn regimes that reduce or eliminate consumption of duff (e.g., favoring heading fires over backing fires) could significantly reduce mortality of longleaf pine managed for long rotations.

TI  - Population ecology of an invasion: Effects of brook trout on native cutthroat trout
VL  - 14
IS  - 3
SP  - 754-772
AB  - Invasion by nonnative brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) often results in replacement of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) in the-inland western United States, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We conducted a four-year removal experiment to test for population-level mechanisms (i.e., changes in recruitment, survival, emigration, and immigration) promoting invasion success of brook trout and causing decline of native Colorado River cutthroat trout (O. c. pleuriticus). We chose 700-1200 in segments of four small mountain streams where brook trout had recently invaded cutthroat trout populations, two each at mid elevation (2500-2700 m) and high elevation (3150-3250 m), and annually removed brook trout from two streams (treatments), but not the other two (controls). We used depletion electrofishing, two-way fish weirs, and mark-recapture methods to estimate abundance, movement, and survival of trout. At mid elevation, age-0 and age-1 cutthroat trout survived at 13 times and two times higher rates on average, respectively, where brook trout were removed. At high-elevation sites, recruitment of cutthroat trout failed despite brook trout removals, apparently because of cold water temperatures. In contrast, age-2 and older cutthroat trout survived at similar rates, whether brook trout were removed or not and regardless of elevation. Summer movement by cutthroat trout was unaffected by removal of brook trout. We conclude that brook trout depress cutthroat trout populations at mid elevation through age-specific biotic interactions that reduce juvenile cutthroat trout survival, whereas populations restricted to high-elevation sites by invasion continue to decline because an abiotic factor (low temperature) causes recruitment failure. In comparison, brook trout survived at the same or higher rates than same-aged cutthroat trout. High immigration by brook trout recolonized depleted segments, and may help sustain invasions in sink habitats where environmental conditions limit recruitment. In streams similar to those we studied, eradication of brook trout is likely necessary to eliminate the threat to native cutthroat,trout, but selective removal regimes that capture a high percentage of the brook trout population for least three consecutive years, repeated periodically, may permit cutthroat trout populations to persist with brook trout. To identify underlying mechanisms responsible for successful invasion by mobile, age-structured vertebrates such as stream fishes, experiments conducted at realistic spatial and temporal scales and including multiple age classes will be required.

TI  - Nonlinear optimization in equipment size selection for distributed generation applications
AB  - Evaluation of potential distributed generation combined heat and power (CHP) applications requires an assessment of the operations and economics of a particular system in meeting the electrical and thermal demands of a specific end-use facility. Software is currently available that will simulate a given CHP system in a specific application. Operation simulation is performed on an hourly basis which reflects diurnal loads. CHP equipment capacity is sized in these programs heuristically on the basis of either annual peak electrical or thermal load. Each simulation run produces a single-point scenario for a CHP system. The weakness of this approach is that there are multiple technical and cost impacts related to the size of the CHP system that influence the overall project viability. Determination of the most optimal capacity for the CHP system requires an iterative process, as the number of influences and their timing produce a non-linear response to equipment size. This paper addresses research being conducted on selecting nonlinear optimization algorithms for optimizing the capacity of combined heat and power systems. Optimization is based on maximizing cost savings from the use of a CHP system relative to meeting the electrical and thermal demands from traditional utility grid and gas-fired boiler sources. After evaluating the behavior of the objective function under differing input scenarios, line search methods that do not rely on objective function derivatives appear to be most effective in finding a global optimum capacity size. The findings from this research have been incorporated into a PC-based computer program to perform such optimizations.

VL  - 104

SP  - 699-704
AB  - The diapause inducement condition, cold hardiness, and flight ability in Cry1Ac-resistant (BtR) and Cry1Ac-susceptible (96S) strains of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) were compared in the laboratory. The BtR strain was derived from the 96S strain and shows 1375-fold resistance to the Cry1Ac toxin after having been selected for 52 generations. Compared with the 96S strain, the Bt-resistant strain was more likely to go into diapause under a short-photoperiod environment. At 11L : 13D, 12L : 12D and 13L : 11D photoperiods, the percentages of BtR insects entering diapause were 72.7%, 82.9% and 68.7%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the 96S strain (58.6%, 67.4% and 46.3%, respectively) under the same. conditions. The supercooling points (SCP) and freezing points (FP) were not significantly different between the BtR and 96S strains. The LT50 (50% lethal time) and LT90 (90% lethal time) of BtR pupae were also not significantly different from those of the 96S strain at -15 degrees C. The moths from both strains had similar flight ability when their larvae were fed with nontoxic control diet. However, the total flight distance of these BtR moths was 56.2 km whose larvae fed on normal diet, which was more than twice as much as for those feeding on Bt diet (26.2 km). Flight duration for these BtR moths was longer after feeding on normal diet (11.6 h) than after feeding on Bt diet (7.3 h).

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 22-29
AB  - Objectives: To transcutaneously deliver intense ultrasound (IUS) energy to target the facial superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS), to produce discrete thermal injury zones (TIZs) in the SMAS, and to demonstrate the relative sparing of adjacent nontargeted layers superficial and deep to the SMAS layer. Methods: In 6 unfixed human cadaveric specimens, the SMAS layer was visualized and targeted using the ultrasound imaging component of the IUS device. Using 2 IUS handpieces, 202 exposure lines were delivered bilaterally in multiple facial regions by varying combinations of power and exposure time (0.5-8.0 J). Tissue was then excised and examined grossly and histologically for evidence of thermal injury using nitroblue tetrazolium chloride viability stain. Results: Reproducible TIZs were produced selectively in the SMAS at depths of up to 7.8 mm, and sparing of surrounding tissue including the epidermis. Higher energy settings and high-density exposure line pattern produced a greater degree of tissue shrinkage. Conclusions: In human cadaveric facial tissue, IUS can noninvasively target and selectively produce TIZs of reproducible location, size, and geometry in the SMAS layer. The ability to produce focused thermal collagen denaturation in the SMAS to induce shrinkage and tissue tightening has not been previously reported and has significant implications for aesthetic facial rejuvenation.

VL  - 5
IS  - 8
SP  - 691-705
AB  - We investigated the effect of temperature on the activity of soil ammonia oxidizers caused by changes in the availability of ammonium and in the microbial community structure. Both short (5 days) and long (6.5, 16 and 20 weeks) incubation of an agricultural soil resulted in a decrease in ammonium concentration that was more pronounced at temperatures between 10 and 25degreesC than at either 4degreesC or 30-37degreesC. Consistently, potential nitrification was higher between 10 and 25degreesC than at either 4degreesC or 37degreesC. However, as long as ammonium was not limiting, release rates of N-2 O increased monotonously between 4 and 37degreesC after short-term temperature adaptation, with nitrification accounting for about 35-50% of the N-2 O production between 4 and 25degreesC. In order to see whether temperature may also affect the community structure of ammonia oxidizers, we studied moist soil during long incubation at low and high concentrations of commercial fertilizer. The soil was also incubated in buffered (pH 7) slurry amended with urea. Communities of ammonia oxidizers were assayed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the amoA gene coding for the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase. We found that a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system using a non-degenerated reverse primer (amoAR1) gave the best results. Community shifts occurred in all soil treatments after 16 weeks of incubation. The community shifts were obviously influenced by the different fertilizer treatments, indicating that ammonium was a selective factor for different ammonia oxidizer populations. Temperature was also a selective factor, in particular as community shifts were also observed in the soil slurries, in which ammonium concentrations and pH were better controlled. Cloning and sequencing of selected DGGE bands indicated that amoA sequences belonging to Nitrosospira cluster 1 were dominant at low temperatures (4-10degreesC), but were absent after long incubation at low fertilizer treatment. Sequences of Nitrosospira cluster 9 could only be detected at low ammonium concentrations, whereas those of Nitrosospira cluster 3 were found at most ammonium concentrations and temperatures, although individual clones of this cluster exhibited trends with temperature. Obviously, ammonia oxidizers are able to adapt to soil conditions by changes in the community structure if sufficient time (several weeks) is available.

TI  - Adapting to climate change: Strategies from King County, Washington
AB  - Darwin's Theory of Evolution tells us species can change over time as certain genetic variations which increase an organism's chance of survival in an ever-changing environment are passed on to future generations. He called this adaptation. Adaptation is the transformation in living organisms that allows them to live successfully in a changing environment. Adaptations enable living organisms to cope with environmental stresses and pressures. Organisms that are not suitably adapted to their environment will either have to move out of the habitat or die out. We usually think about natural selection and adaption in the context of life forms evolving throughout our planet's history, or plant and animal populations changing in response to recent environmental pressures. However, we now face environmental pressures of our own making. Climate change presents human societies with a changing environment to which they must adapt or face potential property loss, displacement, or collapse. Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane resulting from human activities, have already begun altering the earth's atmosphere. While rising temperatures are a global phenomenon, the impacts will be felt on a very local level. Increasing temperatures may cause shifts in weather patterns, exacerbating drought in some areas while causing storms of higher intensity in others. Retreating glaciers and disappearing snowpack will cut into supplies of irrigation and drinking water in some communities. A rise in sea level will cause more frequent flooding and permanent inundation of low-lying coastal areas. Vegetation range shifts could result in greater human-wildlife conflict as animals move into new areas, and could lead to losses of iconic regional characteristics and economic drivers such as fall foliage and the maple sugar industry in New England. Rather than simply respond to these changes after they occur, planners are in a unique position to help their communities assess potential climate change impacts and develop adaptation strategies to counter the threat of devastating changes that may come in years ahead. This PAS Memo describes strategies developed in King County, Washington, to direct local government efforts to address climate change. These tools can be useful to all local communities that are faced with the challenges of inevitable alterations in the environment resulting from climate change. The steps planners take now to anticipate and prepare for climate change will have profound impacts on the future of our cities.

VL  - 11
SP  - 7062
AB  - The Vision for Space Exploration calls for an early return to the Moon, first with robotic systems (such as orbiting, remote sensing spacecraft) and later with humans on the surface. As with the original Apollo program, the costs for human activities on the Moon will be high, with only a few astronauts initially able to travel to and from the lunar surface; accordingly, inexpensive precursor exploration activities that enhance human productivity on the lunar surface and which engage the larger "Earth-bound community" are particularly valuable. This paper discusses an approach to lunar exploration that could provide broad public engagement while also providing information that enables the selection of high priority areas for eventual human exploration. The approach consists of four elements: 1) developing "thermal wadis" at selected locations on the lunar surface; 2) developing standardized rovers with plug-and-play sensor packages, which can be soft-landed on the lunar surface and teleoperated from multiple institutions on the Earth; 3) using the thermal wadis as staging points where the rovers (and potentially other exploration hardware) could be maintained, especially during periods of darkness; and 4) using the rovers during periods of daylight to provide groundtruthing and other preliminary explorations of the lunar surface. The paper will explain the concept of a thermal wadi and will detail how lunar resources might be used to create thermal wadis - therefore reducing the cost of material and hardware that would have to be transported to the Moon. It will also discuss initial concepts for the rovers and sensor packages. Finally, this paper will provide one example of the possible implementation and evolution of this proposed approach to participatory lunar exploration.

VL  - 80

SP  - 7-14
AB  - A study was made of the effects of constant temperatures on development, fecundity of Myzus persicae (Sulz.) fed on Brussels sprouts leaf‐discs. Nymphal development rate increased with temperature change from 10–29°C. Fecundity was highest at 25°C and decreased at 29°C and also progressively at lower temperatures. The intrinsic rate of increase was calculated for the different temperatures and was highest at 25°C. Aphids bred at 27.5°C became smaller and less fecund in five successive generations. At 10°C the mean numbers of progeny per parent decreased to 19.4 and 5.6 in the first and second generations respectively compared with 39 for individuals kept constantly at 20°C. However, when transferred from 10°C to 20°C for the adult stage, both F1 and F2 adults reproduced almost as well as when reared continuously at 20°C. Body length and width increased in two successive generations at 10°C; antenna, cornicle, cauda and hind tibia were also longer in the first generation but became shorter in the second. Aphids bred for five generations at 27.5°C and then returned to 20°C took two generations to regain the size of individuals in populations kept constantly at the suitable temperature. Recovery of fecundity was almost in the third generation after return to 20°C. Temperaturwirkungen auf die Blattlaus Myzus persicae (Sulz.) mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der kritischen Temperaturen Es wurde die Einwirkung konstanter Temperaturen (10–29°C) auf die Entwicklung und Vermehrung von an Rosenkohl lebenden M. persicae untersucht. Die Fruchtbarkeit der Blattlaus war bei 25°C am höchsten und nahm bei 29°C etwas, bei tiefen Temperaturen stärker ab. Auch die effektive Vermehrungsrate hatte bei 25°C ihr Maximum. Bei 27,5°C aufgezogenen Blattläusen nahmen im Verlauf von 5 Generationen die Körpergröße und Fruchtbarkeit ab. Bei 10°C betrug die Nachkommenzahl pro Muttertier nur noch 19,4 (1. Gen.) und 5,6 (2. Gen.) gegenüber 39 der bei 20°C gehaltenen Kontrolltieren. Wurden die bei 10°C entstandenen Muttertiere (P) in 20°C gebracht, war die Nachkommenschaft der F1 und F2‐Generation dieselbe, wie wenn die P‐Generation bei 20°C gehalten wurde. Die Körperlänge und ‐breite nahmen während 2 Generationen bei tiefer Temperatur (10°C) zu. Die Antennen‐, cauda‐ und Hinterschienenlänge nahmen bei der 1. Gen. zu, bei der 2. Gen. wieder ab. Blattläuse, die 5 Gen. lang bei 27,5°C gehalten und dann in 20°C gebracht wurden, benötigten 2 Gen., um ihre Größe jenen Tieren anzugleichen, die immer bei 20°C gehalten waren. Zur Rückkehr der Fruchtbarkeit auf den 20°C‐Stand brauchten sie 3 Gen. 1976 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - On wafer burn-in strategies for MCM die
SP  - 255-260
AB  - The high cost associated with replacing faulty die in many MCM technologies suggests that die used in their manufacture be known to be good with high confidence. This requires some burn-in of the die since significant "infant mortality" failures are observed for semiconductor parts. Burn-in generally involves mounting the die on temporary die carriers so that signals can be applied to activate the circuits. In this paper we present a more efficient strategy that allows the burn-in of the die on the wafer before they are diced. Our proposed approach requires that power, ground and clock connections to each die be fabricated on the wafer so that all the circuits can be powered up and clocked using only a few probe connects to the wafer. These extra connections use the space between die, and are lost once the wafer is diced into individual circuits. During burn-in, the circuits are activated in the built-in self test (BIST) mode. Here inputs to subcircuits within each die is provided by linear feedback shift registers. Power dissipation and thermal stress during burn-in is managed by controlling the air flow over the wafer surface and by appropriate selection of the thermal conduction properties of the temporary wafer carrier system employed. It is also possible to selectively power up subsets of the die to manage power dissipation. Wafer level burn-in promises to be a cost effective approach for delivering known good die.

AB  - Bacterial contamination of extended porcine semen has been associated with deleterious effects on both semen quality and sow fertility. Retrospective. prospective and in vitro studies were performed to delineate the prevalence and behavior of certain bacterial contaminants in extended semen. and antimicrobial pharmacodynamics in various semen diluents. Retrospective review of extended semen samples Submitted from North American boar studs for microbiological screening at the University of Pennsylvania Reference Andrology Laboratory in 2005 and 2006 yielded bacteriospermia prevalence rates of 17% (144/832) and 26% (256/984). respectively. In a prospective study of regional boar Studs, of 91 extended semen samples tested over I-y, 29% were positive for bacteriospermia. Retrospective and prospective studies both showed that the preponderance of contaminant positive samples occurred during the fall months (P < 0.05). To better Understand behavior of select contaminant bacteria, generation intervals were determined for Serratia marcescens (SM) and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (AX) at 16. 22 and 37 degrees C. Generation times were temperature-dependent, with intervals decreasing two- to four-fold as incubation temperature increased. Growth patterns for SM, AX and Burkholderia cepacia were evaluated in various semen diluents. The different diluents exhibited constant or episodic patterns of growth within and among bacteria throughout the 5-d test period. Kill-time kinetics at 37 degrees C of several genera of bacteria in four semen diluents containing amoxicillin, gentamicin, tylosin, and lincomycin/spectinomycin (single drug or combination) ranged from 75 to over 360 min, and was highly dependent (P < 0.05) upon both type of bacteria and semen diluent.

TI  - The photobehaviour of daphnia spp. As a model to explain diel vertical migration in zooplankton
VL  - 74
IS  - 4
SP  - 397-423
AB  - Many pelagic animal species in the marine environment and in lakes migrate to deeper water layers before sunrise and return around sunset. The amplitude of these diel vertical migrations (DVM) varies from several hundreds of metres in the oceans to approx. 5–20 m in lakes. DVM can be studied from a proximate and an ultimate point of view. A proximate analysis is intended to reveal the underlying behavioural mechanism and the factors that cause the daily displacements. The ultimate analysis deals with the adaptive significance of DVM and the driving forces that were responsible for the selection of the traits essential to the behavioural mechanism. The freshwater cladoceran Daphnia is the best studied species and results can be used to model migration behaviour in general. Phototaxis in Daphnia spp., which is defined as a light-oriented swimming towards (positive phototaxis) or away (negative phototaxis) from a light source, is considered the most important mechanism basic to DVM. A distinction has been made between primary phototaxis which occurs when light intensity is constant, and secondary phototaxis which is caused by changes in light intensity. Both types of reaction are superimposed on normal swimming. This swimming of Daphnia spp. consists of alternating upwards and downwards displacements over small distances. An internal oscillator seems to be at the base of these alternations. Primary phototaxis is the result of a dominance of either the upwards or the downwards oscillator phase, and the direction depends on internal and external factors: for example, fish-mediated chemicals or kairomones induce a downwards drift. Adverse environmental factors may produce a persistent primary phototaxis. Rare clones of D. magna have been found that show also persistent positive or negative primary phototaxis and interbreeding of the two types produces intermediate progeny: thus a genetic component seems to be involved. Also secondary phototaxis is superimposed on normal swimming: a continuous increase in light intensity amplifies the downwards oscillator phase and decreases the upwards phase. A threshold must be succeeded which depends on the rate and the duration of the relative change in light intensity. The relation between both is given by the stimulus strength versus stimulus duration curve. An absolute threshold or rheobase exists, defined as the minimum rate of change causing a response if continued for an infinitely long time. DVM in a lake takes place during a period of 1-5-2 h when light changes are higher than the rheobase threshold. Accelerations in the rate of relative increase in light intensity strongly enhance downwards swimming in Daphnia spp. and this enhancement increases with increasing fish kairomone and food concentration. This phenomenon may represent a ‘decision-making mechanism’ to realize the adaptive goal of DVM: at high fish predator densities, thus high kairomone concentrations, and sufficiently high food concentrations, DVM is profitable but not so at low concentrations. Body axis orientation in Daphnia spp. is controlled with regard to light-dark boundaries or contrasts. Under water, contrasts are present at the boundaries of the illuminated circular window which results from the maximum angle of refraction at 48–9° with the normal (Snell's window). Contrasts are fixed by the compound eye and appropriate turning of the body axis orients the daphnid in an upwards or an obliquely downwards direction. A predisposition for a positively or negatively phototactic orientation seems to be the result of a disturbed balance of the two oscillators governing normal swimming. Some investigators have tried to study DVM at a laboratory scale during a 24 h cycle. To imitate nature, properties of a natural water column, such as a large temperature gradient, were compressed into a few cm. With appropriate light intensity changes, vertical distributions looking like DVM were obtained. The results can be explained by phototactic reactions and the artificial nature of the compressed environmental factors but do not compare with DVM in the field. A mechanistic model of DVM based on phototaxis is presented. Both, primary and secondary phototaxis is considered an extension of normal swimming. Using the light intensity changes of dawn and the differential enhancement of kairomones and food concentrations, amplitudes of DVM could be simulated comparable to those in a lake. The most important adaptive significance of DVM is avoidance of visual predators such as juvenile fish. However, in the absence of fish kairomones, small-scale DVMs are often present, which were probably evolved for UV-protection, and are realized by not enhanced phototaxis. In addition, the ‘decision-making mechanism’ was probably evolved as based on the enhanced phototactic reaction to accelerations in the rate of relative changes in light intensity and the presence of fish kairomones. © 1999 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 33

SP  - 251-256
AB  - A proportion of Helicoverpa armigera collected from fields in Okayama Prefecture (Western Japan; 34.6 degrees N. 134.1 degrees E) does not enter diapause when reared under a short days at 20 degrees C during the larval stages. However, diapause in such photo-insensitive individuals call be induced when they are reared at moderately low temperatures, Such as 15 degrees C. regardless of photoperiod. To determine whether such photo-insensitive individuals can survive overwintering in fields, the present study compares the cold hardiness and sugar content between nondiapausing and diapausing pupae of photo-insensitive individuals selected over several generations at 20 degrees C under a short day photoperiod (LD 10 : 14 h). Diapausing and nondiapausing, pupae are obtained under the short days by rearing at 15 and 20 degrees C, respectively, during larval and pupal stages. These pupae are stepwise acclimated at a reduction of 5 degrees C every 5 days to 0 degrees C. Maximum survival periods, of nondiapausing and diapausing pupae at 0 degrees C are approximately 30 and 90 days, respectively. Trehalose content in diapausing pupae increases, reaches a maximum level (1.95 mg 100 mg(-1) in males and 2.1 mg 100mg(-1) in females) 28days after exposure to 0 degrees C and then decreases. On the other hand, glucose content in diapausing pupae increases (maximum level: 0.32 mg 100 mg(-1) in males and 0.21 mg 100 mg(-1) in females) with decreasing trehalose content 42 days after exposure to 0 degrees C. The decrease in trehalose content and the increase in glucose content may be linked to termination of diapause in H. armigera. These results suggest that, in Japan, the photo-insensitive individuals call only survive in the mild winters of southern regions. and not in the severe winters of northern regions.

VL  - 53
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-49
AB  - The influence of non-random mating on the melanic polymorphism in Adalia bipunctata was investigated in the Netherlands. Study sites were along dines in melanic frequency. The phenotype frequencies among mating pairs (total N = 3890) and non-mating insects were scored for each sample obtained during the spring mating period. The analysis of individual samples and of the data grouped into frequency classes provided no support for published findings from less homogeneous data of a frequency dependent mating system. Contingency table analyses for individual samples and data combined by site revealed that a mating advantage is gained by melanics. There was some evidence of heterogeneity between populations. No assortative mating was found for melanism or dry weight. An absence of any difference for mating insects in morph frequency between the sexes is not consistent with the operation of a female choice system as found by other workers for an English population. The analysis of frequency data for the offspring of mating populations collected as pupae provided strong evidence that the mating advantage gained by melanics is reflected in an increase in melanic frequency in the following adult generation. Mean estimates of selective advantage (non-melanics = 1) for the mating advantage and for the adult to pupal period are 1·16 and 1·10, respectively. It is argued that the data give strong support for Lusis’s (1961) suggestion that increases in melanic frequency observed during the summer in Berlin (and in the Netherlands) can be explained by more frequent mating of melanics as a result of the effects of thermal melanism. © 1984 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

AB  - At the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (US Department of Agriculture, Ag. Research Service) in Leetown, WV, we have a broodstock development program now entering the second generation of family-based selective breeding using expected breeding values (EBVs). Our major breeding objectives are faster growth and resistance to Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease. For these traits we have developed assays to evaluate phenotypic performance. In addition to our breeding program, we are participating in an international collaboration to develop a microsatellite marker linkage map for the rainbow trout with the intent of identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and using them in marker (MAS) or gene-assisted (GAS) selection. There are several possible approaches with regard to the types and numbers of markers to develop and the strategies and methods for implementing the markers in a selective breeding program. This paper describes the choices we made concerning QTL identification for traits of high, low, and unknown degrees of heritability. These traits are plasma cortisol response to a crowding stress (h(2) = 0.4), feed intake (h(2) = 0.1) and resistance to F. psychrophilum (0.3 < h(2)< 0.4). In order to identify QTL in a relevant commercially important rainbow trout line, we are making crosses from within our resource population. The development of research family crosses, choice of markers for genome scanning, and planned steps to implementation of these results are described.

VL  - 107
IS  - 1
SP  - 129-139
AB  - The multivoltine, estuarine amphipod Gammarus lawrencianus has four generations per year in an environment where temperatures range seasonally from -1° to 25°C. Temperature-response curves for rates of brood production and development were determined by laboratory experiments and field observation. The life history and population dynamics were observed over a full annual cycle (1981) for a field population located at Rocky Run, Porter's Lake, Nova Scotia, Canada. On a natural (i.e., sidereal) time scale, the generations appear to have very different life histories: the two summer generations have short lives, rapid development and mature at small size (classic r-selection), whereas the overwintering generations have relatively low rates of mortality, slow development and mature at large size (classic K-selection). This pattern (larger size at maturity at lower temperatures) is widespread in aquatic poikilotherms. Similar life-history differences are evident among cohorts of the summer generations that mature at different temperatures. When time is expressed on a physiological scale that removes the effect of temperature on embryonic development and reproductive rate, the variation within and among generations is greatly reduced. In particular, an apparent alternation between r- and K-selection largely disappears. Because the generations are temporally isolated, it might be surmised that natural selection acting on the summer generations might antagonize the effects of natural selection acting on the fall and winter generations. However, the scaling of the rates of development, maturation, growth, reproduction and mortality on the physiological time scale derived from the temperature dependence of development and reproductive rate gives a very different and more homogeneous pattern. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 58
IS  - 6
SP  - 511-516
AB  - Diapausing eggs of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, can be changed into non-diapausing ones by treating with hot hydrochloric acid about 20 hr after oviposition. By the acidtreatment for one min in each generation, two strains were selected from an Europian race (E. No. 16); one was the strain showing high hatchability (S strain), and the other showing low hatchability (R strain). The former showed 80% or more hatchability after the 3rd generation, while the latter did 20% or less from the 7th generation. At the 25th to 28th generation, characteristics of the two strains were examined in detail. It was shown that there was a big difference in the acid-sensitivity between the two strains; namely, 88% of the S strain hatched by the acid treatment for a brief time of 5 sec, while in the R strain no hatchings were observed in the 5 second-treatment and only 10% of eggs hatched out by one min-treatments. When the eggs were incubated at low temperature (15°C) under dark condition, the resultant female moths of both strains did not lay any non-pigmented non-diapause eggs. However, 6-41% of the eggs produced by S strain hatched unseasonally within two months when kept at 25°C, but none of them did in the R strain. Moreover, the diapause eggs of S strain seemed to be activated significantly earlier than those of R strain when chilled at 5°C. These results indicate that the selection for the acid-sensitivity of the silkworm eggs is effective, and that the selection also affects the diapause nature (probably diapause depth). © 1989, The Japanese Society of Sericultural Science.

TI  - Modelling impacts of climate variability on the commercial barramundi (Lates calcarifer) fishery of north-eastern Queensland
SP  - 475-481
AB  - Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is an important Queensland commercial fishery that exhibits dramatic inter-annual fluctuations in catch which, according to fishers, are explained in part by variations in the climate. Traditionally, modelling of fisheries harvest has focussed on the development of surplus production/yield models which use catch and effort data, and more complex age-structured models. More recently, however, the effect of climate variability has been shown to have a significant impact on the catch of fisheries such as anchovies, and so techniques to incorporate climate parameters into fisheries modelling and management are being developed. This paper explores, through correlation and cross validated regression modelling techniques, the possible impact of climate variability on the commercial barramundi fishery harvest in Princess Charlotte Bay (PCB) far north Queensland which varies on a year-to-year basis. Results suggest a strong relationship between tested climate variables two years prior and annual barramundi landings. A conceptual model explaining the life history of the barramundi was constructed to reduce the number of variables used in the analysis. Selected climate variables (air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), evaporation, fresh water flows), and climate forecasting indices (Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO)), were initially correlated against local commercial catch data for PCB. Forward stepwise ridge regression (FSRR) analysis was then used in constructing models to quantify the effects of climate on barramundi. Zero-lagged correlations support the well established theory that early wet season fresh water flow affects the catchability of barramundi in PCB. This is because fish in the fresh water reaches are flushed into the estuary (and fishing grounds) in these years. Next, a FSRR model was developed from climate variables and selected: rainfall July - September(-2) (lagged two years), annual evaporation(-2) and October - December SOI (no lag) and explained 67.6% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. A second model using climate forecasting indices explained only 53.1% of the variance in catch adjusted for effort. However, because each of these models required data collected in the year of fishing, they did not allow sufficient time for a response from fisheries managers or operators. A third FSRR model using climate variables known to impact on spawning and early juvenile development 2-3 years earlier, included rain July - September(-2), evaporation annual(-2) and average January - March SST-2 and explained 62.7% of the variance in catch. When the predictive capacity of the model was tested using a cross validated "leave-one-out" regression analysis, 48.1% of the variance in future catch was explained (Figure 1). [GRAPHICS] .

TI  - Thermal characterization and process modification of an RTM epoxy resin
VL  - 33
SP  - 1148-1157
AB  - The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Materials Division, has teamed with Navy and industry partners to demonstrate to a high level of confidence the viability of an automated resin transfer molding (RTM) process using automation together with a novel supervisory control and data acquisition system. One objective of the program for NAVAIR was to evaluate novel resin systems for use in RTM processes. This focus of this paper is the thermal characterization of the selected SI-ZG-5A epoxy resin, formulated by A.T.A.R.D. Laboratories. This analysis consists of a comprehensive program of resin characterization and cure modeling. Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), theology measurements and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the cure kinetics, glass transitions, processing temperature and volatility during cure. The manufacturer's recommended cure cycle was first evaluated to establish a baseline glass transition temperature (T-g), enthalpy of cure, and gel point for the SI-ZG-5A epoxy resin system. Once this analysis was complete, variations of the cure cycle were investigated in order to determine if the cure cycle could be modified. Cure kinetics were also determined using dynamic scanning calorimetry and the variable heating rate method. Finally, a study investigating the effect of mix ratio variations was begun, and preliminary results and cure models developed. In conclusion, the SI-ZG-5A resin system has been found to be a robust RTM resin, forgiving of a wide range of process variations.

TI  - The influence of reproductive status on thermal ecology and vegetation use of female Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) in southwestern Michigan
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 48-54
AB  - The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) is a viviparous rattlesnake that is a species of "special concern" in Michigan and listed as state-threatened or endangered throughout the rest of its range. Viviparous species typically have unique thermal needs associated with the internal development of young, and these needs can influence vegetation selection patterns. We investigated the thermal ecology and vegetation selection of female S. c. catenatus. We radio-tracked eight gravid and six non-gravid female S. c. catenatus implanted with temperature-sensitive transmitters in southwestern Michigan during May-August 2004 and 2005. Gravid S. c. catenatus generally maintained higher average body temperature (T-b; 29.1-34.1 degrees C) throughout the season than non-gravid females (22.2-30.8 degrees C), and also maintained plateau temperatures longer in the diel cycle. Gravid females maintained significantly higher (P < 0.01) mean temperatures above ambient compared with non-gravids early (i.e., May; gravid = 11.7 degrees C; non-gravid = 6.1 degrees C) and late (i.e., July and August; gravid = 7.1 degrees C; non-gravid = 4.9 degrees C) in the season. These results suggest gravid females were thermoregulating to facilitate embryogenesis. Gravid S. c. catenatus selected early/mid-successional deciduous upland vegetation, and these areas had significantly higher (P < 0.001) mean soil temperatures (19.9 degrees C) than early/mid-successional wetlands (17.4 degrees C). Therefore, we recommend that upland areas adjacent to wetlands supporting S. c. catenatus be maintained in early successional vegetation types with limited woody encroachment. This vegetation type provides gravid females with favorable thermal conditions to meet their reproductive requirements.

TI  - Influence of thermal fronts on habitat selection by four rorqual whale species in the Gulf of St. Lawrence
VL  - 335
SP  - 207-216
AB  - Understanding the factors influencing habitat selection is critical to improving management and conservation plans for large whales. Many studies have linked the distribution of cetaceans to basic environmental features such as underwater topography and sea surface temperature (SST), but the mechanisms underlying these relationships are poorly understood. Dynamic mesoscale processes like thermal fronts are prime candidates to link physiographic factors to whale distribution because they increase biological productivity and aggregate prey. However, previous studies of large whales have found little evidence of such associations, possibly because they were not at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We quantified the relationship between SST fronts and the distribution of blue Balaenoptera musculus, finback B. physalus, humpback Megaptera novaeangliae and minke B. acutorostrata whales in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. We compared the distribution of 1094 whale sightings collected from boat surveys conducted in 1996 to 2000 to the locations of frontal areas determined from 61 satellite maps. The distributions of whales and thermal fronts were highly correlated (random resampling and Mantel tests of matrix similarity). Spatial distributions differed among species, probably reflecting differences in feeding strategies. Identification of surface fronts from satellite imagery thus effectively complemented field observations of whales. These findings significantly increase our understanding of habitat quality in rorqual whales, and encourage a greater use of dynamic environmental variables in future studies of whale habitat use. © Inter-Research 2007.

TI  - Climate effects on offspring sex ratio in a viviparous lizard
VL  - 78
IS  - 1
SP  - 84-90
AB  - 1. Understanding individual and population responses to climate change is emerging as an important challenge. Because many phenotypic traits are sensitive to environmental conditions, directional climate change could significantly alter trait distribution within populations and may generate an evolutionary response. 2. In species with environment-dependent sex determination, climate change may lead to skewed sex ratios at hatching or birth. However, there are virtually no empirical data on the putative link between climatic parameters and sex ratios from natural populations. 3. We monitored a natural population of viviparous lizards with temperature-dependent sex determination (Niveoscincus ocellatus) over seven field seasons. Sex ratios at birth fluctuated significantly among years and closely tracked thermal conditions in the field, with the proportion of male offspring increasing in colder years. 4. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of local climatic conditions (e.g. temperature) on offspring sex ratio fluctuations in a free-living population of a viviparous ectotherm. A succession of warmer-than-usual years (as predicted under many climate-change scenarios) likely would generate female-biased sex ratios at birth, while an increase in interannual variation (as also predicted under climate change scenarios) could lead to significant fluctuations in cohort sex ratios. If cohort sex ratio bias at birth leads to adult sex ratio bias, long-term directional changes in thermal conditions may have important effects on population dynamics in this species. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 54
IS  - 1
SP  - 44-54
AB  - This report presents details of a vitrification methodology for the cryopreservation of embryos of the Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens. The overall summary of the data indicates that selecting the correct developmental stage for cryopreservation is the most important criterion. The key aspect in selection of the correct stage is to balance depletion of the gut yolk content against development of the embryonic cuticle. Embryogenesis was divided into four stages between 90 and 120 h after incubation at 21.7 °C. The classification was based on the intestinal yolk content and the initial development of mandibular-maxillary complex. Stages having low mid-gut yolk content and the appearance of mouth hooks were found to be the most suitable for cryopreservation. Embryos developing at 30 °C had premature cuticle formation relative to gut development and significantly lower hatching after cryopreservation. Vitrification of embryos by direct quenching in liquid nitrogen was less effective than quenching after annealing the samples in liquid nitrogen vapor. Quenched samples of vitrification solutions containing 1,2-ethanediol as the major component exhibited fractures. Fracturing occurred less frequently when the solutions were annealed and when containing polyethylene glycol. Hatching of vitrified embryos stored in liquid nitrogen for over 12 months was not statistically different from those held for only 15 min. Our protocol yielded normalized hatching rates that ranged as high as 61%. Selecting the exact stage for cryopreservation from a population of embryos obtained by collection from ovipositing females during a span of just 30 min resulted in nearly 80% of the embryos hatching into larvae.

TI  - Oviposition at low temperatures - late season negatively affects the leaf beetle Galeruca tanaceti (Coleoptera : Galerucinae) but not its specialised egg parasitoid Oomyzus galerucivorus (Hymenoptera : Eulophidae)
VL  - 103

AB  - Insects experience important selection pressures from their parasitoids, which affect both their population dynamics and their evolutionary responses. The interaction between the egg parasitoid Oomyzus galerucivorus Graham (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and its chrysomelid host Galeruca tanaceti L. (Coleoptera: Galerucinae) was investigated with the particular aim determining whether the chrysomelid host can escape its parasitoid by ovipositing late in the year as early as September. Although the leaf beetle and its parasitoid emerge in April, G. tanaceti starts to oviposit after spending the summer in reproductive diapause. The objective was to determine, whether the small parasitic wasp can parasitise its host's eggs even at the end of its host's reproductive season in December, when temperatures are low. Beetle oviposition, parasitism rates and temperatures were measured on three comparable mesoxerophytic grassland sites over the coarse of a season. Beetle oviposition, but not parasitism, was significantly positively dependent on temperature. Rate of oviposition decreased over the oviposition period with decrease in temperature. In contrast, after a lag phase of 1-2 weeks at the beginning of the oviposition period in September beetle egg clutches were parasitised at a constant rate until the end of the season in December. Host eggs were parasitised even at mean daily temperatures of 0-6 degrees C. Thus the tansy leaf beetle does not escape from egg parasitism by ovipositing late in the season in central Germany.

TI  - Winter warming facilitates range expansion: Cold tolerance of the butterfly Atalopedes campestris
VL  - 135
IS  - 4
SP  - 648-656
AB  - Our ability to predict ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change requires an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and range limits. The warming trend over the past half-century has generated numerous opportunities to develop much-needed case studies of these links. Species that are only limited by climatic factors are likely to shift range quickly during periods of warming. Such species directly impact recipient communities and indicate trends that will become more widespread. Because minimum temperature (T-min) is rising at twice the rate of maximum temperature, species with this range-limiting factor may be especially responsive to global warming. In this study, I test the hypothesis that rising T-min has directly affected the range of a skipper butterfly. Atalopedes campestris has moved northward rapidly this century, recently colonizing eastern Washington where January T-min has risen 3degreesC in 50 years. The results show that: 1. A. campestris' range lies completely within the -4degreesC January average minimum isotherm, and that recently colonized areas were below this threshold earlier this century. 2. In acute cold stress experiments, -4 to -7degreesC proved to be a critical thermal limit: median supercooling point was -6.3degreesC, and minimum lethal temperature (LT50 with 12-h exposure) was -5.7degreesC. 3. In chronic cold stress experiments, survivorship declined sharply in diurnally fluctuating thermal regimes typical of the current range edge. High mortality occurred under constant 0degreesC conditions as well as in fluctuating regimes, implying that thermal insulation from snow would not protect A. campestris. 4. There was no evidence of evolution in cold tolerance at the range margin, despite strong selection. Thus, winter warming was apparently a prerequisite for the range expansion. Characteristics of this species that seem to be associated with its rapid response are that it is an opportunistic species, it is not habitat or dispersal limited, and it is constrained by T-min.

TI  - A perspective on thermal energy storage systems for solar energy applications
VL  - 20
IS  - 6
SP  - 547-557
AB  - The use of thermal energy storage (TES) systems is essential for solar power systems because of fluctuations in the solar energy input. Several classes of storage may be required for a single installation, depending on the type and scale of the solar power plant itself, and the nature of its integration with conventional utility systems. For heating and hot water applications, water and phase change materials (PCMs) constitute the principle storage media. Soil, rock and other solids are used as well. Water has the advantage of approximately 80% less volume than that of water for a temperature variation of 10 degrees C, which is the difference between temperatures of a fully charged and a fully discharged storage tank. Some PCMs are viscous and corrosive, and must be segregated within the container in order to be used as a heat transfer medium. For heat storage, two PCMs must be available, unless heat pumping is employed. A variety of solids is also used; rock particles of 20 to 50 mn in size are most prevalent. Well-designed packed rock beds have several desirable characteristics for energy storage. The heat transfer coefficient between the air and the solid is high, the cost of the storage material is low, the conductivity of the bed is low when air flow is not present and a large heat transfer area can be achieved at low cost by reducing the size of particles. TES systems have also been suggested for storing thermal energy at medium (38-304 degrees C) and high temperatures (120-566 degrees C). For instance, systems in an oil-rock system for hot water and heat-recovery applications are examples of medium-temperature applications, while those in molten nitrate salt systems (an excellent storage medium) for steam production for process applications are for high temperatures. Oil-rock TES, in which the energy is stored in a mixture of oil and rock in a tank, is less expensive than molten nitrate salt TES, but is limited to low-temperature applications. However, this oil-rock TES has been proven successful for solar thermal applications. The selection of the type of TES depends on various factors such as the storage period (diurnal or seasonal), economic viability, operating conditions, etc. Zn this article, a study of TES systems (including materials) is presented particularly with solar thermal applications in mind. The evaluation of their performances, cost and economic viability, ease of installation, cleanliness, environmental impact, safety factors, technological usability and applicability are discussed.

We next carried out pre-hoc controlled laboratory experiments to test the effects of heavy metal pollution (Hg, Zn, Cd) on genotypic frequencies of 15 phosphoglucomutase (PGM) genotypes in thousands of individuals of the shrimp Palaemon elegans [Nevo et al, 1980, 1981a, and the present study]. Similarly, we tested the effects of Hg, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu pollutions on the genotypic and allelic frequencies of five phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) genotypes in the two close species of marine gastropods, Monodonta turbinata and M turbiformis [Lavie and Nevo, 1982, and the present study]. In both the thermal and chemical pollution studies, we established in repeated experiments statistically significant differences of allele frequencies at 8 out of 11 (73%) and 10 out of 15 (67%) gene loci, respectively, between the contrasting environments in each. While no specific function could be singled out in the post-hoc chemical study due to the complex nature of polluted marine water, temperature could be specified as the primary selective agent in the thermal study. The strongest direct and specific evidence for significant differential survivorship among allelic isozyme genotypes was obtained in the pre-hoc studies in Palaemon and Monodonta. Their differential viability was probably associated with the different degree of heavy metal inhibition uniquely related to each specific pollutant. Furthermore, we demonstrated in the two closely related Monodonta species parallel genotypic differentiation as a response to pollution. Our results are inconsistent with the neutral theory of allelic isozyme polymorphisms and appear to reflect the adaptive nature of the allelic isozyme polymorphisms studied. Allelic isozyme genotypes are sensitive to and vary with the quality and quantity of specific pollutants. Therefore, they can provide precise genetic indicators of the effects of pollution on the short- and long-term genetic changes of populations. Ideally, in different marine species specific genetic loci, either singly or in combination, may prove sensitive markers to different pollutants and could easily be assayed by quick electrophoretic tests and be used as genetic monitors. An extensive search for the appropriate enzymatic systems in various relatively sedentary marine species exposed to pollutants is therefore urgent.

AB  - Climate and weather strongly influence human health and wellbeing. Several acute effects involving the weather were reported. Much research draws attention to heat-waves capable of increasing mortality drastically. However, in middle and northern latitudes, cold-related health disturbances are noted. The majority of previous research has been based on relationships between mortality/morbidity rates and single meteorological elements or simple biometeorological indices. Recently, considerations of human heat balance have represented another approach to the assessment of true relationships between the outdoor climate and individuals. The aim of the present paper has been to report the principle results of research relating mortality rates and bio-thermal conditions in selected European cities, i.e. London (UK), Paris (France), Rome (Italy), Budapest (Hungary), Barcelona (Spain) and Cracow (Poland). The research were carried out within the framework of the PHEWE project on "Assessment and Prevention of Acute Health Effects of Weather Conditions in Europe". The relationships between weather and human health were studied on the basis of simultaneous meteorological and medical data. The medical dataset consisted of daily statistics regarded total mortality (TM, deaths per day), and the meteorological data daily values for air temperature and humidity, wind speed and cloudiness. The data concern midday (12:00 UTC). 3) For each day of the studied period bio-thermal indices derived from human heat balance considerations were calculated. Bio-thermal conditions are considered to be the thermal state of the atmosphere felt subjectively by individuals. The data used in the present studies show seasonality to mortality rates. Winter mortality rates are significantly higher than summer ones. The greatest seasonal differentiation to TM is observed in London and Paris and the smallest in Cracow. When considering relationships between mortality rates and bio-thermal conditions for the whole year, up to 30% of deaths are found to be explicable in terms of changes in particular indices. The best relations were found for London and Barcelona. A significant increase in mortality was observed at both low and high values for bio-thermal indices. These represent great and very great heat stress in summer, as well as cold stress in winter. The values of bio-thermal thresholds for a 25% increase in mortality rates were defined and are found to vary seasonally and spatially. Geographical gradients for biothermal thresholds were found, and are seen to depend on both latitude and distance from Atlantic Ocean.

SP  - 2278-2289
AB  - Rapid changes in climate may impose strong selective pressures on organisms. Evolutionary responses to climate change have been observed in natural populations, yet no example has been documented for a metabolic enzyme locus. Furthermore, few studies have linked physiological responses to stress with allozyme genotypic variation. We quantified changes in allele frequency between 1988 and 1996 at three allozyme loci (isocitrate dehydrogenase, Idh; phosphoglucose isomerase, Pgi; and phosphoglucomutase, Pgm) for the leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis in the Bishop Creek region of the Sierra Nevada of California (2900-3300 m). Beetles often experience high daytime (>32degreesC) and extremely low nighttime (<-5degreesC) temperatures during summer. Bishop Creek weather station data indicated that conditions were unusually dry before 1988, and that conditions were cool and wet during the years preceding the 1996 collection. We found directional change, in allele frequency at Pgi (11% increase in the Pgi-1 allele), but not at Idh or Pgm. We also found that physiological response to thermal extremes depended on Pgi genotype. Pgi 1-1 individuals induced expression of a 70-kD heat shock protein (FISP) at lower temperatures than 1-4 or 4-4 individuals, and 1-1 individuals expressed higher levels of HSP70 after laboratory exposure to temperatures routinely experienced in nature. Survival after nighttime laboratory exposure to subzero temperatures depended on gender, previous exposure to cold, and Pgi genotype. Females expressed higher levels of HSP70 than males after exposure to heat, and recovery by female Pgi 1-1 homozygotes after exposure to cold (-5degreesC) was significantly better than 1-4 or 4-4 genotypes. These data suggest that the cooler climate of the mid-1990s may have caused an increase in frequency of the Pgi-1 allele, due to a more robust physiological response to cold by Pgi 1-1 and 1-4 genotypes.

VL  - 96

SP  - 224-236
AB  - Given the political targets, it can be expected that in Europe, energy production from agricultural land will increase and that improved systems for its production are needed. Therefore, a four year field trial was conducted on one site in south-western Germany to compare and evaluate the biomass and energy yield performance of important energy crops. Six energy cropping systems with the potential to produce biomass for first and second-generation biofuels were selected. The systems were short rotation willow coppice, miscanthus, switchgrass, energy maize and two different crop rotation systems including winter oilseed rape, winter wheat and winter triticale. The two crop rotation systems were managed in either conventional tillage or no-till soil cultivation systems. The second test parameter was three different crop-specific nitrogen application levels. The performance of the energy cropping systems was evaluated by measuring the biomass yields and calculating the energy yields, as well as through an energy balance and nitrogen budget. Results show the superiority of the annual energy crop maize in dry matter yield (DMY) and primary net energy yield (PNEY = difference between the primary energy yield (DMY × lower heating value) and the energy consumption) performance with peak values at the highest N-application level of 19.1 t DM ha-1 a-1 and 350 GJ ha-1 a-1, respectively. The highest yielding perennial crop was miscanthus with 18.1 t ha-1 a-1 DMY and a PNEY of 277 GJ ha-1 a-1, followed by willow with 15.2 t ha-1 a-1 and 258 GJ ha-1 a-1, at the highest N-application level. Switchgrass showed the lowest yields of the perennial crops with 14.1 t ha-1 a-1 DMY at the highest N-application level. The yields of the two crop rotation systems did not differ significantly and amounted to 14.6 t ha-1 a-1 DMY of both grain and straw at the highest N-application level. Willow showed the significantly highest energy use efficiency (output (PNEY):input (energy consumption)-ratio) with 99 GJ energy output per GJ fossil energy input at the lowest N-application level (no fertilizer). The two crop rotation systems had the lowest energy use efficiency with 20 GJ GJ-1 for the production of total aboveground biomass. Energy maize gave the best energy yield performance but at a relatively high energy input, whereas willow and miscanthus as perennial energy crops combine high yields with low inputs. Results suggest that no-till systems had no negative impact on biomass and energy yields, but that there was also no positive impact on energy saving. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thermally induced chronic developmental stress in coho salmon: Integrating measures of mortality, early growth, and developmental instability
VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 398-410
AB  - Developmental stability, or homeostasis, facilitates the production of consistent phenotypes by buffering against stress. Fluctuating asymmetry is produced by developmental instability and is manifested as small random departures from bilateral symmetry. Increased fluctuating asymmetry is thought to parallel compromised fitness, in part, because stress promotes energy dissipation. Compensatory energy expenditures within the organism are required to complete development, thus promoting instability through reductions in homeostasis. Increased heterozygosity may enhance developmental stability by reducing energy dissipation from stress through increased metabolic efficiency, possibly by providing greater flexibility in metabolic pathways. Traditionally, fluctuating asymmetry has been used as a bioindicator of chronic stress, provided that selective mortality of less fit individuals did not reduce stress-mediated increases in fluctuating asymmetry to background levels produced by natural developmental error, or create data inconsistencies such as higher asymmetry in groups exposed to lower stress. Unfortunately, absence of selective mortality and its effects, while often assumed, can be difficult to substantiate. We integrated measures of early growth, mortality, fluctuating asymmetry (mandibular pores, pectoral finrays, pelvic finrays, and gillrakers on the upper and lower arms of the first branchial arch) and directional asymmetry (branchiostegal rays) to assess chronic thermal stress (fluctuating temperatures as opposed to ambient temperatures) in developing eggs from two different coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) stocks and their reciprocal hybrids. Hybridization provided insight on the capacity of heterozygosity to reduce stress during development. Although egg losses were consistently higher in crosses exposed to fluctuating temperatures, egg mortality was predominantly a function of maternal stock of origin. Post-hatch losses were higher in crosses exposed to ambient temperatures than in crosses exposed to fluctuating temperatures during embryogenesis. Observed patterns of early growth revealed no heterosis. but instead reflected maternal effects, with some crosses slowing growth and yolk utilization when exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Analyses of fluctuating asymmetry also showed no effects from heterosis. While analyses of composite asymmetry scores and branchiostegal rays were inconclusive, analyses of individual characters showed significantly higher fluctuating asymmetry in pelvic finray counts and a marginal change in the numbers of fish asymmetric for this character in crosses exposed to chronic thermal stress. In contrast, the fluctuating asymmetry. in lower gillraker counts was significantly higher in crosses exposed to ambient temperatures and there were significantly more fish asymmetric for this character. Data on mortalities and fluctuating asymmetry indicate pelvic finray development was thermally stressed, while the heightened fluctuating asymmetry in lower gillraker counts under ambient temperatures was due to a greater frequency of less fit fish that had not been culled by thermal stress. Changes in early growth patterns in response to developmental stress yielded no parallel responses in meristic characters. We conclude that chronic thermal stress produced both selectively lethal and sublethal effects that directly shaped fluctuating asymmetry and fitness profiles in these crosses. Implicit in this conclusion is that developmental instability analyses can detect more than just chronic sublethal stress, thus providing substantial credence for using instability studies as proactive bioassessment methodologies.

AB  - The influence of maternal and grandmaternal age on progeny egg-to-adult viability was assessed in Drosophila serrata. Viability in progeny decreased with increasing maternal age. The potential for cumulative age effects was investigated in two environments, one of which involved nutrient and cold stress. Environment influenced viability and female age influenced progeny egg-to-adult viability across one generation. The influence on viability was cumulative across two generations. Females from old mothers, who also had old grandmothers, had the lowest viability in both environments. Grandmaternal effects were associated with a decrease in egg hatch rate whereas maternal effects also involved larval-to-adult viability. The age of the mother and grandmother should be taken into account when evaluating life-history traits in Drosophila.

VL  - 88
IS  - 3
SP  - 351-357
AB  - Details of the life history, the effects of relative humidity and temperature on survival and reproduction, and the predatory ability of Aleurodothrips fasciapennis Franklin were examined under laboratory conditions. Stage-specific development and adult longevity were similar between sexes, and the adult sex ratio was 1:1. Females laid 23.3 +/- 18.0 eggs of which 83% hatched. The survival rate of first instars to adulthood was 82%. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was 0.04, assuming a zero or 5.4 day pre-oviposition interval. Temperature did not affect the proportion of eggs that hatched, the proportion of first instars surviving to adulthood or adult sex ratios. However, female fecundity was dependent on temperature being highest at 24-28 degrees C. Relative humidity did not affect adult sex ratio or female fecundity but the proportion of eggs hatched and the survival of first instars to adulthood increased as relative humidity increased. Few eggs hatched when relative humidity was <65%. Larval and adult female A. fasciapennis were voracious feeders but the number of prey killed per progeny was high, suggesting A. fasciapennis was inefficient at converting prey into progeny biomass. The potential value of A. fasciapennis as a biocontrol agent of Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) on Australian citrus is discussed in terms of its r(m), prey killing power and environmental adaptability. It is concluded that population growth of A. fasciapennis should exceed that of A. aurantii under field conditions but A. fasciapennis may be of little value against A. aurantii on citrus grown under conditions of high temperature and low humidity, or when prey densities are low.

AB  - To investigate the influence of life-history adaptations on the fidelity of laboratory bioassays, copepods Tisbe holothuriae were collected from tno areas (polluted and non-polluted) and maintained in the laboratory under temperatures similar to their wild habitat. The sensitivity of Tisbe increased with increasing temperature. The wild animals from the polluted area were more tolerant to Co2+ and Cr6+ than those from the non-polluted area. Laboratory animals (40 generations after sampling) from the polluted area, were still more tolerant than those from the non-polluted area. These animals also exhibited a similar or increased tolerance, whereas those of the first generation shelved a higher sensitivity, compared to the wild ones from the same area. Demography also varied in successive generations after sampling. Laboratory bioassays using T. holothuriae can predict most of its responses in the field, but attention should be paid to adaptations to temperature, pollution and the laboratory environment.

VL  - 30

SP  - 686-691
AB  - Life-history traits correlated to reproduction are important in deciding adaptability of insects. Lagria hirta L. has a short phytophagous adult phase in summer and a very long saprophagous larval phase extending from autumn until spring. This study revealed that its reproduction was modified by external factors and by complex interactions involving different life-history traits. Oviposition occurred only at 15-25 degreesC, LD (L16: D8) or SD (L8: D16). Within this temperature range, preoviposition time, fecundity and adult life span were affected (P less than or equal to 0.05). Photoperiod Was found significantly, to affect fecundity, viability of eggs and preoviposition time (P less than or equal to 0.04). Unmated females can lay eggs, but the eggs are sterile. The survival of eggs is also influenced by photoperiod (P < 0.001). In this study, the subtle variations were examined in the last instar's duration, pupal weight, fecundity and adult life span. In terms of reproduction, two correlations were apparent: larval short last instar durations result in heavier pupae and eclose to longer-lived adults; conversely, larvae with longer last instars produce lighter pupae which, if female, tend to lay fewer eggs. These correlations were statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). These trends represent a trade-off in resource allocation: long final instar duration may consume more energy that would be invested in reproduction. This is heterogeneous (phenotypically or genotypically) among the individuals of L. hirta.

TI  - Understanding epigenetic regulation: Tracking protein levels across multiple generations of cells
VL  - 178
IS  - 1
SP  - 71-80
AB  - Cells and organisms are remarkably robust: they alter the variety and levels of expressed genes and proteins in response to environmental stimuli, including temperature, chemicals, and the stiffness of their surroundings. Ultimately changes in gene and protein expression can result in a distinct phenotypic state, which in some cases is maintained over multiple generations; the ability to pass on a particular phenotypic state to progeny cells is critical for differentiation. Moreover, epigenetic regulation of phenotype is also thought to provide an evolutionary advantage for a population of cells adapting to a fluctuating environment on faster timescales than the occurrence of genetic mutations. However, simple methods to study patterns of gene and protein expression on multi-generational timescales are sparse. Here we describe a technique to study lineages of single cells over multiple generations using a microfluidic device; this reveals patterns of expression where protein levels are correlated across multiple generations. Such quantitative information of protein expression in the context of pedigree remains hidden when studying the population as an ensemble. © 2009 EDP Sciences and Springer.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), a serious pest of potato, is currently spreading north in Europe. We investigated the risk of CPB establishment in Finland and control methods for the case when beetle life history characters change due to global warming or as an adaptation to colder climate. Analysis with a spatially explicit simulation model supported the current management policy in Finland (efficient eradication and one year field quarantine) but changes in CPB viability, such as decreased winter mortality or increased number of offspring would render them inefficient. Longer quarantine times would be needed to effectively prevent the CPB establishment and spread. As an option we investigated Bt-potato cultivation integrated to other control methods and found that it was already efficient when used as a sole strategy but its benefits may be reduced by the adaptability of the Colorado potato beetle. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2008.

AB  - As a pest, in order to complete its life history and reproduces effectively, soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines Ichinche 1952) must adapt to various environments and conditions for long periods of evolution. The nematode is widely dispersed year after year. Controlling this pest requires understanding characters and adaptability of SCN. Effects of abiotic factors, such as temperature, soil humidity, agrotype, pH value, ions, plant exudates, agricultural chemical and cultivation systems on SCN, are reviewed in this paper. The results show that SCN is able to endure various environmental stresses, especially low temperature. Because of its special life history, cyst stage help SCN over winter, resistance of SCN to environmental stress is strong. A few studies have reported the mechanism of SCN environmental adaptability. We emphasized the importance of studying environmental adaptability of SCN, which would benefit the control of SCN by ecological means. © 2009 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

VL  - 16
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-87
AB  - The exotic egg parasitoid Edovum puttleri Grissell has shown promise for biological control of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). However, because the activity of currently available populations is decreased at low temperatures, the use of biotypes of E. puttleri adapted to low temperatures may provide more effective control. To determine if there are populations of E. puttleri adapted to low temperatures, the life history characteristics of three populations collected in Honduras were compared at three temperatures (15, 24, and 30 degrees C) over three generations. In general, life history characteristics differed between the first generation and subsequent generations. Among temperatures, parasitoids reared at 24 degrees C mere more reproductively active, lived longer, and survived better than those reared at other temperatures, At the lowest temperature, there was a significant difference in the frequency of total egg production, with females from the "River" collection site producing more eggs than females from the other two sites, Coincidentally, the River area is located at the highest elevation and experiences a cooler climate. Comparison off. puttleri collected in Honduras, Colombia, and Mexico showed differences in life history characteristics. The implications for this study for selection of biotypes of E. puttleri are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

VL  - 65
IS  - 1
SP  - 109-109
AB  - In forest trees, environmental conditions during reproduction can greatly influence progeny performance. This phenomenon probably results from adaptive phenotypic plasticity but also may be associated with genotypic selection. In order to determine whether selective effects during the reproduction are environment specific, single pair-crosses of Norway spruce were studied in two contrasted maternal environments (warm and cold conditions). One family expressed large and the other small phenotypic differences between these crossing environments. The inheritance of genetic polymorphism was analysed at the seed stage. Four parental genetic maps covering 66 to 78% of the genome were constructed using 190 to 200 loci. After correcting for multiple testing, there is no evidence of locus under strong and repeatable selection. The maternal environment could thus only induce limited genotypic-selection effects during reproductive steps, and performance of progenies may be mainly affected by a long-lasting epigenetic memory regulated by temperature and photoperiod prevailing during seed production. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.

TI  - Life‐history characteristics and sexual strategy of Mytilopsis sallei (Bivalvia: Dreissenacea), introduced into Hong Kong
VL  - 219
IS  - 3
SP  - 469-485
AB  - First recorded from Hong Kong in 1980, Mytilopsis sallei now dominates the intertidal pier community within the Government Dockyard, Victoria Harbour. Analysis of monthly samples of M. sallei has demonstrated aspects of the reproductive strategy and life‐history characteristics correlated with seasonal changes in local water quality. Mytilopsis sallei is dioecious, has a high fecundity, matures early (at 8–10 mm shell length), grows fast and the majority of the population is probably semelparous. These are characteristic traits of opportunistic r‐strategists. Comparable characteristics are typical of other introduced bivalves. Maximum life span of M. sallei in the Dockyard is probably less than 20 months with, however, most of the population dying before that. Heavy recruitment, particularly during spring‐summer, suffocates older individuals. The shells of dead animals similarly last for little more than one year, dissolution and crushing effecting this. A mat of byssal threads serves to bind the mass and anchor it to the substratum. Mytilopsis sallei exhibits two periods of reproductive activity and settlement per year. These are possibly two elements of a single recruitment divided into minor (autumn‐winter) and major (spring‐summer) components by either high summer temperatures or low salinities. Summer and winter recruits of M. sallei, respectively, mature to produce the summer and winter juveniles of the following year. Over‐stepping generations plus survival of a few individuals into their second year thus ensure continued success of M. sallei, and account for its spread and dominance in its introduced range. Such a bimodal pattern appears typical of many Hong Kong intertidal, estuarine and freshwater bivalves. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 93-100
AB  - Species of North American freshwater snails within the genus Physa are distinguished primarily on differences in shell shape. However, shell shape in this genus is ecophenotypically influenced by environmental factors. The present study examined the degree to which genes and environment influenced spire angle in specimens of Physa virgata collected from a single population in Arlington, Texas. Five separate genetic lines were inbred for five generations, after which progeny were reared under one of three temperature regimes (20, 25, or 30 degrees C) until reaching adult size (approximately 5 mm in shell length). The spire angle of each individual was then measured and comparisons made across thermal regimes and genetic lines. Genetic line and temperature both significantly influenced spire angle. In general, snails reared at warmer temperatures had wider spire angles than snails reared at cooler temperatures. Some genetic lines had wider mean spire angles than others, regardless of temperature. Individual spire angles differed by as much as 23.8 degrees under controlled conditions. These results suggest that shell shape is neither a consistent character nor taxonomically diagnostic. Thus, the number of currently recognized species of Physa is problematic.

VL  - 49

AB  - Populations of Dialeurodes citri (Ashmead) on oranges were studied in two orange orchards in southern California, USA, to quantify developmental times and mortalities affecting this species. Four populations were followed in detail for three generations over 2 years, by monitoring the development and survival of 200 individuals in each population. Overall, preimaginal mortality among the generation studied varied from 56 to 94%. No evidence of disease or parasitism was present in the populations, and mortality was likely due to generalist predators. Weather records for the period were typical for the region, and periods of rainfall or elevated temperatures did not show any correlation with periods of mortality in the populations. Overall, the populations have high survival rates for whitefly populations, and this high survival is likely a major contributing factor to their pest status in California orchards. Addition of natural enemies to reduce the survival rates of these populations is proposed as the next course of action in suppressing populations below damaging levels. © 2006 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.

AB  - SUMMARY. A population of the isopod Asellus aquaticus was studied for sixteen months in the organically polluted River Ely. South Wales. There were two complete generations each year. The overwintering population released young (the spring‐brood) over the period April‐June. These animals in turn produced their own offspring (summer‐brood) in late July‐October. Each generation died after breeding and the overwintering population was comprised entirely of animals from the summer‐brood. Seasonal patterns of mortality were related to water flow, temperature and life‐cycle stage. Individual growth rates were affected by both temperature and life‐cycle stage. Annual population production (P) was 195.68 g wet wt m‐2, mean annual biomass (B) was 32.98 g wet wt m‐2 and the annual P/B ratio was 5.93. Copyright © 1982, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The life history of the halobiont ostracod M. henricae was studied over a 2.5-year period in Lake Bathurst, a slightly saline lake in New South Wales. Samples were collected monthly or bimonthly between March 1981 and May 1982 and weekly between August 1982 and June 1983. Relative abundance of all nine life stages (eight larval stages and one adult stage) in the samples was determined. Furthermore, in 10 selected monthly samples, sex-ratio, relative abundance of three female maturity stages and number of eggs in uteri of ovigerous females were monitored. Nearly all life stages were present throughout the year and M. henricae is thus a perennial form in Lake Bathurst. Relative abundance of life stages suggests that M. henricae produces three successive generations per year. The spring generation, hatched from eggs laid during winter, matures around November-December. Its larval development takes between 4 and 5 months. The summer generation matures after a larval development of 2.5 months; this short period is ascribed to more favourable temperatures. The autumn generation takes about 4 months to mature. © CSIRO 1985.

VL  - 570

AB  - PCNA participates in multiple processes of DNA metabolism with an essential role in DNA replication and intervening in DNA repair. Temperature-sensitive PCNA mutants of Drosophila (mus209) are sensitive to mutagens, impair developmental processes and suppress positional-effect variegation. To investigate the role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in germline genomic stability, independent mus209-defective and mus209-normal lines were established and maintained over six generations. A time course study was carried out and general genomic alterations were analyzed in the progeny by using arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) and microsatellite analysis. The AP-PCR analysis has shown that a dysfunctional PCNA leads to germline genomic instability, being the amount of genomic alterations transmitted to the progeny directly related to the number of mus209(B1) mutant alleles. In addition, we have found that the frequency of genomic alterations tends to increase over successive generations. Surprisingly, the highest microsatellite instability was found in the heterozygous mus209-defective lines, suggesting a greater mutation rate in these individuals in comparison with the homozygous mus209-defective lines. In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that PCNA is an important factor to maintain genomic stability in germinal cells, both in the overall genome and in simple repeated sequences. The implication of PCNA mutations in transgenerational genomic instability and related to cancer susceptibility is also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 151
IS  - 3
SP  - 530-543
AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas, 1771) have had unprecedented success in colonizing European and North American waters under strongly differing temperature regimes. Thus, the mussel is an excellent model of a species which is able to cope with increasing water temperatures expected under global change. We study three principle scenarios for successful survival of the mussel under rising temperatures: (1) no adaptation to future thermal conditions is needed, existing performance is great enough; (2) a shift (adaptation) towards higher temperatures is required; or (3) a broadening of the range of tolerated temperatures (adaptation) is needed. We developed a stochastic individual-based model which describes the demographic growth of D. polymorpha to determine which of the alternative scenarios might enable future survival. It is a day-degree model which is determined by ambient water temperature. Daily temperatures are generated based on long-term data of the River Rhine. Predictions under temperature conditions as recently observed for this river that are made for the phenology of reproduction, the age distribution and the shell length distribution conform with field observations. Our simulations show that temporal patterns in the life cycle of the mussel will be altered under rising temperatures. In all scenarios spawning started earlier in the year and the total reproductive output of a population was dominated by the events later in the spawning period. For maximum temperatures between 20 and 26°C no thermal adaptation of the mussel is required. No extinctions and stable age distributions over generations were observed in scenario 2 for all maximum temperatures studied. In contrast, no population with a fixed range of tolerated temperatures survived in scenario 3 with high maximum temperatures (28, 30, 32°C). Age distributions showed an excess of 0+ individuals which resulted in an extinction of the population for several thermal ranges investigated. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Oedothorax insecticeps hibernates from mid- to late-November to the beginning of March as spiderlings and adults. It has 4 generations each year. Duration of the 4th generation is the longest, that of the 2nd generation, the shortest. After mating the female can lay fertilized eggs throughout her life. Highest amount of eggs laid by each female is 600, the hatching rate being >85%. Length of life is negatively related to temperature. In a range of 20-30oC there is a large number of cocoons, and also a large amount of eggs laid. It has a high starvation-resisting ability closely related with factors involving temperature, water, and the developmental stage. -from English summary

VL  - 36

SP  - 238-246
AB  - Cyphocleonus achates, the knapweed weevil, is an effective biological control agent of the invasive weed, Centaurea maculosa Lam. A meridic diet was developed and tested for the rearing of the larval stage of this insect. Using this diet, C achates was reared for over three generations, with the adults being offered knapweed plants for feeding and oviposition in greenhouse conditions. Slight or no differences were seen between insects reared on a standard meridic diet formulation and one containing knapweed tissues. The following life history parameters were monitored over the three generations: percent egg hatch (ranging from 42.9 to 59.1%), time to egg hatch (20.0-23.2 days), time to adult emergence (52.0-54.1 days), adult weights 3 days post-eclosion (101.9-117.0 mg), percent adult emergence (48.3-58.6%), and percent mortality/deformity in the different stages (with mortality occurring primarily in the early larval stages). Additionally, a study involving low temperature and short day conditions suggested that C achates could be maintained for longer periods of time in larval diet cells when placed in growth-retarding conditions., although percent adult emergence was lower. External morphology was also studied in order to distinguish between the sexes to ensure that each adult cage had a similar ratio of females to males. Abdominal features were found to be the most dependable characteristics for use when determining the sex of adult C achates. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The relationship between life-history characteristics and population dynamics were investigated in the onuphid polychaete Kinbergonuphis simoni (Santos, Day and Rice) between 1982 and 1987. The studied population is located in Upper Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. This worm attains sexual maturity at 5 to 10 mo of age, depending on temperature. Several consecutive broods are produced during a female's life time, with 7 to 26 young per brood. Adults die in June-July after the breeding season. Generations of breeding individuals do not overlap and the replacement of generations occurs in July-August. Only one extended breeding season is experienced per life time. Life span does not exceed 2 yr. Field population density in 1982 was high in fall and spring (2000 to 9000 individuals/m2), low in summer (1600 individuals/m2), and slightly depressed in winter (2500 to 4000 individuals/m2). Changes in population density may be explained by seasonal, temperature-controlled changes in instantaneous birth and death rates. Birth rates are high in fall and spring, while death rates are high in early summer. Death of juveniles contributes to the winter density decrease. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - To test whether stressful conditions altered levels of heritable variation in fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, parent-offspring comparisons were undertaken across three generations for flies reared in a combined stress (ethanol, cold shock, low nutrition) environment or a control environment. The stressful conditions did not directly influence fecundity but did lead to a reduced fecundity in the offspring generations, perhaps reflecting cross-generation maternal effects. Both the heritability and evolvability estimates were higher in the combined stress treatment, reflecting an apparent increase in the additive genetic variance under stress. In contrast, there were no consistent changes in the environmental variance across environments.

VL  - 72
IS  - 2
SP  - 193-206
AB  - First generation tetraploids were produced by hydrostatic pressure treatment before the first cleavage and raised until the adult stage. Their survival and growth were severely depressed when compared to the diploid control: after two years, no ovulated females were found although males produced sperm at 1 and 2 years of age and were mated individually with diploid females. The progenies were consistently normal with high survival rates. They were found to be almost all triploids by karyology, which failed to detect a significant rate of aneuploidies. However, the fertilizing ability of tetraploid males was always low (0 to 97% of the control; average 40%). Several arguments presented here support the hypothesis that diploid spermatozoas, which are wider than haploid ones, would be frequently blocked during their penetration through the micropyle canal. Second generation tetraploids were produced after such matings by heat shocks, causing the retention of the second polar body. Their survival and growth were much more satisfactory than in the first generation, although still lower than in diploid and triploid controls issuing from diploid parents. Performances of second generation triploids were comparable to those of diploids, and slightly better than those of conventional triploids issuing from diploid parents. 94.5% of the second generation tetraploids were male. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Eleven provenance/progeny tests of Pinus greggii Engelm. were assessed for survival and height at 3 years of age in Brazil, Colombia and South Africa. Trees of P. greggii from sources in northern Mexico (approximate to 25 degrees N latitude) were less than half as tall as trees from provenances in central Mexico (approximate to 21 degrees N latitude) when established in warm climates of Brazil and Colombia, (4.2 m vs. 1.6 m, respectively). The differences in height growth diminished between southern and northern sources in more temperate climates in South Africa (2.9 m vs. 2.1 m, respectively). External morphological differences in foliage were also pronounced between trees of the two regions when grown as an exotic. Trees from northern sources had shorter, stiffer, needles of darker green color than those from southern provenances. The most promising of the southern provenances across all sites were El Madrono (Queretaro) and Laguna Seca (Hidalgo). La Tapona (Nuevo Leon) and Los Lirios (Coahuila) performed well among the northern sources. Pinus greggii should be tested where low rainfall and cold are considered limiting factors for good growth of P. patula.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of refrigerated storage on the suitability of eggs of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), as hosts for propagation of the parasitoid Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). Development of the host eggs was terminated by chilling at 2 degrees C for 5 d before storage was initiated at 10 degrees C for up to 70 d. Parasitism, adult emergence rate, developmental time, and sex ratio were used to gauge the suitability of the eggs as hosts after storage. In addition to these measures, demographic growth parameters also were used to assess the quality of the wasp progeny through the F-2 generation. Host eggs stored 20 d remained fully acceptable to the wasps for attack. Although the parasitism rate decreased with storage time, > 80% adult parasitoid emergence was realized from eggs stored 30 d. After 70 d storage, adult emergence rate was decreased by 48%, fecundity decreased by 53%, female production by 19%, developmental time was extended 3 d, and female longevity was shortened 5 d. The emergence pattern of F-1 but not F-2 adults varied with storage time of the parental and grand-parental hosts, respectively. For the F-2 generation, emergence rate, development, and sex ratio did not vary with storage time when the F-1 parents parasitized fresh host eggs. Demographic parameters for the F, population showed that net reproductive rate was > 20 although it decreased significantly after their parental host eggs were stored for > 30 d. The intrinsic and finite rates of increase, population doubling time, and mean generation time decreased only after storage for 60 d. Our results show that short-term cold storage could be used for maintaining wasp populations in a mass-rearing program and that the detrimental effects of chilling host eggs in storage for over 30 d do not extend to F-2 generation.

VL  - 38
IS  - 5
SP  - 1365-1372
AB  - Endosymbiotic bacteria that potentially influence reproduction and other fitness-related traits of their hosts are widespread in arthropods, and their appeal to researchers' interest is growing. In this study, the influence of continuous high temperature conditions on Wolbachia infection frequency and the fitness of Liposcelis tricolor (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) was studied in a laboratory. The results showed that the Wolbachia infection frequency was gradually decreased when L. tricolor was reared at 33°C; after six generations of treatment, no Wolbachia wsp gene product was detected, suggesting that the Wolbachia infection was completely eliminated. The combined immature development periods and survival rates of L. tricolor did not vary significantly among six generations; however, the female longevities and fecundities dramatically declined from F1 through F6, resulting in decreasing values of population intrinsic rate of increase (rm). Using rm values, the fitness for F2, F3, F 4, F5, and F6 relative to F1 was calculated as 0.995, 0.953, 0.811, 0.700, and 0.552, respectively. We realize that it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of high temperature may have on the metabolic processes of the psocids and the effects of temperature-induced reduction in bacterial infection frequencies. Our study confirms that the combined use of antibiotics and heat treatment is a good control measure for psocids. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - In the experiments on the fitness, reproduction rate in dicofol resistant and susceptible strain of the citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McG.), of the same origin were compared at 25°C and 30°C. The reproduction rate in the resistant strain was lower than that in the susceptible one, especially, under higher temperature condition (30°C) or under a feeding condition on considerably damaged leaves of host trees. This was mainly caused by lower egg production in the resistant mites. The dicofol susceptibility of eggs in a mite population originally composed of a 1:1 mixture of resistant and susceptible strains of the same origin, was tested in 17 generations at 25°C. After 13 generations, the dicofol susceptibility of the mixed population increased remarkably. The result indicated that the resistant mites had lower values of fitness than the susceptible ones under either favorable (25°C) or unfavorable condition for reproduction of the spider mites in an acaricide-free environment. From the experimental data of the dicofol susceptibility of the mixed population, the relative value of fitness of the resistant mites was analyzed by a computer simulation. The experimental value best agreed with the calculated value, for which the relative value of fitness of the resistant mites was 0.75. © 1980, Pesticide Science Society of Japan. All rights reserved.

VL  - 30

SP  - 424-433
AB  - Egg to eclosion development time and survivorship were assayed on four laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been reared for over 600 generations in continuous light (LL) and constant temperature. The assays were performed in three environments: continuous light (LL), periodically varying light/dark cycles (LD 12:12 hr), and continuous darkness (DD). Development: time in LL was significantly less than that in LD, which, in turn, was significantly less than that in DD, whereas survivorship did not differ significantly among the three treatments. The results indicate that individuals from Drosophila populations routinely maintained in LL do not suffer any deleterious effects of LL treatment on pre-adult fitness. Other studies on these populations have shown that free-running period (tau) of the eclosion rhythm in DD is greater than that in LD. Our results are, thus, also consistent with the notion that development time may be a function of the free running period.

VL  - 40

SP  - 339-342
AB  - Clethra alnifolia L., a native deciduous shrub cultivated as an ornamental, was recently hybridized with C. pringlei S. Wats. The purpose of this hybridization was to combine the cold hardiness and adaptability of C. alnifolia with the ornamental foliage of C. pringlei. While most of the C. alnifolia x C. pringlei hybrids more closely resembled C. alnifolia than the paternal species, a 'Hokie Pink' x C. pringlei hybrid (NA71586) with foliage that flushes red like C. pringlei was recovered. The objectives of this study were to analyze cytologically the F-1 and produce a F-2 population from NA71586. Chromosome counts from root tips cells indicated that NA71586 has 32 chromosomes. Since the chromosome number of C. alnifolia is 2n = 32 and that of C. pringlei was found to be 2n = 169 NA71586 appears to have developed following fertilization of a C. alnifolia egg with an unreduced male gamete from C. pringlei. Both 'Hokie Pink' and C. pringlei exhibited primarily bivalent pairing in pollen mother cells (PMCs). Over half of the PMCs from NA71586 contained 16 bivalents, indicating substantial homology within the C. alnifolia genome. It was theorized that C. alnifolia is either an autotetraploid that exhibits bivalent pairing or a segmental allotetraploid produced from hybridization of species with similar genomes. More than 700 F-2 progeny were obtained from self-pollination of NA71586. Although many of the F-2 progeny resembled NA71586, variation in foliage color, size and shape was apparent in the population.

SP  - 110-118
AB  - This study documents divergence in egg size that has occurred over less than 25 generations among sympatric demes of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) from Lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Norway. A cluster analysis identified two clusters of tributaries: one of small, warm tributaries (SW) and the other of large, cold tributaries (LC). Spawning occurs more regularly and up to 4 weeks earlier in SW tributaries compared with that in LC ones. We explored numerous mixed models predicting egg size from year (random effect), basin and tributary (fixed effects), and female length. The most supported model estimated length-adjusted egg size to be larger in SW tributaries compared with that in LC tributaries. Combinations of density-dependent (competition for food/space) and density-independent (temperature) factors along with phenotypic plasticity and maternal effects are discussed as potential differentiation sources. We suggest high temperatures (increased metabolism) to reinforce the selective advantage of large eggs under conditions with highly density-dependent fry interactions. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.

TI  - Fitness consequences of body melanization in Drosophila immigrans from montane habitats: RESEARCH PAPER
VL  - 39
IS  - 3
SP  - 182-191
AB  - We investigated eight populations of Drosophila immigrans from low to high montane localities (600-2202 m) for altitudinal variations in abdominal melanization and fitness-related traits (desiccation resistance, copulation duration, and fecundity). On the basis of common garden experiments, persistence between-population differences at 21°C suggests that observed variations in fitness-related traits have a genetic basis. Parent-offspring regression analyses showed higher heritability (h2 = 0.77) for melanization patterns on all the abdominal tergites. All the traits showed significantly higher repeatability across generations. Under colder and drier environments in dispersed montane localities, abdominal melanization and desiccation resistance significantly increased (1.5-1.9 fold) along altitude. Thus, there are correlated effects of abdominal melanization on desiccation resistance. Genetic correlations, based on family means, were significantly high between abdominal melanization and other fitness traits. Furthermore, darker flies along increasing altitude resulted in a 35-40% increase in copulation duration as well as fecundity. There are significantly positive correlations of abdominal melanization with copulation duration as well as fecundity on the basis of within- as well as between-population variations. Such observations are in agreement with the thermal budget hypothesis. Present data suggest that changes in body melanization impact fitness-related traits in montane populations of Drosophila immigrans. © 2009 The Entomological Society of Korea and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Biological studies of three spider mite species, Oligonychus ununguis (JACOBI), Panonychus citri (MCGREGOR) and Telranychus urticae KOCH, were conducted under fairly constant temperature (25°G) and moisture (52% RH) conditions. The total developmental time was shorter in T. urticae than in the other two species, and the total fecundity and average egg production per day were significantly greater in T. urticae than in the others. The egg hatchability was generally high in all the three species, while among these it was slightly lower in 0. ununguis. Relatively high proportion of females, ca. 70 to 80 percent in P. citri and ca. 65 to 70 percent in T. urticae, was observed, but in 0. ununguis it was ca. 50 to 55 percent. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), the net reproductive rate (R0) and the mean generation time (T) were evaluated as follows: O. ununguis: rmO.178, R0 = 24.72 and T=18.02. P. citri: rm = 0.162, R0 = 24.36 and T= 19.71. T. urticae:rm = 0.259, Ro=65.00 and T=16.16. It was concluded that T. urticae had significantly high reproductive potential, and postulated that this fact caused its high adaptability to its herbaceous host plants. © 1979, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

AB  - The effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition were studied experimentally in Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) and Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch.) in order to predict the outcome of competition. The replacement series (substitutive) approach was used to qualitatively predict the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species bred at 25 and 30-degrees-C on loose maize. The reproduction curves of S. zeamais and P. truncatus were of the ''scramble'' type (humped), though different in form. Both species were adversely affected by competitive interactions. The intensity of competition was dependent on the density of parent populations and temperature. S. zeamais was the dominant competitor at 25-degrees-C and had a significant suppressant effect on P. truncatus at this temperature. This study predicts that S. zeamais would outcompete P. truncatus on loose maize at 25-degrees-C. However, the predictions on the outcome of competition after one generation were uncertain at 30-degrees-C.

VL  - 173

SP  - 235-246
AB  - Hirame (Paralichthys olivaceus) is an important cultured flatfish species in Japan, Korea and China. Because females grow faster, methods of feminized culture were developed. Sex ratios were examined in gynogenetic diploids and normal diploids and their progenies in order to clarify genetic sex-determination and enable its artificial manipulation. It was revealed that this species has male heterogametic sex-determination. However, sex-differentiation of genetic females (XX) seems to be so unstable that spontaneous sex-reversal to physiological males can be caused by exogenous factors, especially high water temperature. Manipulating techniques for physiological as well as genetic sex were established using sex-steroids and/or controlling rearing water temperature. Homozygous clones were produced by the combination of inducing mitotic gynogenetic diploids and meiotic gynogenetic diploids over two generations. More vigorous heterozygous clones were produced by hybridization between different clones. These appear to be good material for fish breeding and commercial fish culture.

Examples of the extent of this decline, together with records of stream temperatures and associated mortality are used to demonstrate the relationship among poor body condition, rising temperature, and breakdown of trout vitality during the critical late-winter period. Possible advantages of fall stocking and of breeding some hatchery trout for superior adaptability are discussed. © 1963 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A derivative of the Escherichia coli-Enterococcus faecalis shuttle vector pAM401 was isolated by mutagenesis in an E. coli mutator strain. This plasmid, designated pAM40lts, was more than an order of magnitude less stable at 38 degrees C than at 30 degrees C in the E. faecalis host strain JH2-2. The E. faecalis plasmid pAD1-encoded par stability locus was cloned onto pAM40lts, and its effects on plasmid stability and host cell viability were assessed. It was found that par stabilized pAM40lts at 38 degrees C but also caused a substantial drop in cell viability three to four generations after a temperature shift from 30 to 38 degrees C. After a maximum viability drop of 94%, culture growth recovered as plasmid-free cells began to accumulate. Provision of excess RNAII, the putative par antidote, in trans attenuated cell killing. These characteristics support a postsegregational killing mechanism for par-mediated plasmid stabilization. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB  - By transferring natural vegetation with soil from high elevation to low elevation, a 2°C warmer condition was created. In each site, 5 different precipitation treatments were applied to test if the temperature and precipitation changes under global warming will result in a lower soil moisture condition and, therefore, feedback negatively on vegetation productivity of the Taihang Mountain. Two years' field experiment suggested that, because of the low adaptability of Arundinelia hirta under a warmer condition, its productivity decreased significantly at the end of the experiment. Productivities of grass with better adaptability such as Themeda japonica and Artemisia sacrorum did not change significantly between the two sites. Tested vegetation demonstrated a significant increase in productivity under the higher precipitation condition by showing 22% increase in productivity under 20% higher precipitation treatment. Soil moisture condition under treatments with higher precipitation was generally higher than that under treatments with lower precipitation. In the warmer site, soil moisture became higher since the beginning of the second year.

VL  - 118

SP  - 378-391
AB  - After reviewing the literature special breeding experiments in temperature gradients were carried out with mated and virgin females of Schistocerca gregaria under various laboratory conditions. The reproduction activity was calculated from all laid egg‐pods and eggs; it was highest in normal mated females. In unmated females egg‐pod production increased in the presence of males by means of a male chemical factor. Mislaid egg‐pods were highest in females without antennae and in virgin females near to males. Mated females without antennae produced much fewer egg‐pods than normal ones; the mean number of eggs was also lower. Egg‐pods were deposited from the 3rd to the 20th week after emergence, with a mean of about 10–13 weeks in virgin females and 8–9 in mated ones. The weekly number of eggs per pod varied from 28–70; a high number of eggs per pod was correlated to a low production rate of egg‐pods. The egg‐laying interval was shorter in mated than in virgin females; in the latter it was shortened in the presence of males. The hatching rate of nymphs was higher from fertilized eggs (66.2%) than unfertilized ones (22.2%); from parthenogenetic eggs only females hatched. As adults they can again produce offspring over generations without mating. The nymphal development lasted about 1 month. In mated females the adult rate was 64.1% and in virgin ones only 20.8% related to the hopper number at the beginning. Generally the adult female rate of the progeny of virgin females was about 70% lower than that of the mated females, when the reduced rate of fecundity, fertility and emergence to adults were considered. The mean adult lifespan was calculated at about 5 months for virgin females (3 month egg‐laying period) and 1 month less for mated ones. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - A deterministic model was developed to simulate population growth of the agromyzid fly Liriomyza bryoniae and the parasitoid Diglyphus isaea. The model has two driving variables, ambient temperature and leaf nitrogen content of the tomato plant. Results of a glasshouse experiment were used to validate the model. The timing of successive generations of leafminers was simulated accurately over four generations. Population growth of leafminers was correctly simulated during the first two generations, but overestimated in the third generation. Mortality of leafminers due to parasitism was overestimated in the first generation after introduction of parasitoids: 73% instead of the observed 30%. A nearly 100% mortality of leafminers was correctly simulated in the second generation after introduction of parasitoids. Sensitivity analysis was performed for three types of variables: (1) driving variables, temperature and leaf nitrogen content; (2) parasitoid traits, searching efficiency and allocation of attacks to host feeding and oviposition, and (3) introduction strategies for biological control, timing, number of releases and number of parasitoids per release. Population growth was sensitive to temperature, leaf nitrogen content, searching efficiency of parasitoids and numbers of parasitoids released. © 1992 Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.

AB  - Comparisons between transgenic (T) and wild-type Metaseiulus occidentalis colonies (COS) were made under laboratory conditions as part of a risk assessment effort prior to proposed field releases. There were no differences between the transgenic T18 colony and the COS strain in the daily egg production, hatchability at three temperatures and four relative humidity (RH) conditions, diapause incidence, or proportion of female progeny produced. Metaseiulus occidentalis eggs do not hatch at 38 degrees C under any RH tested, nor at 33.5 degrees C under 100% RH, indicating that high temperature and extreme RH affect egg hatch negatively. At 28.5 and 33.5 degrees C, fewer eggs hatched at 32.5% than at 75.5 and 93% RH. Metaseiulus occidentalis cannot survive on any plant tested without prey nor on a diet of pollen alone; adult female mites cannot prey or survive on a diet of eggs and larvae of two lepidopteran species, indicating that the suitability of food sources has not been altered in the transgenic strain. Two subcolonies, derived from two transgenic strains using single females, differed in the rate of egg hatch at 28.5 degrees C under 32.5 and 100% RH, indicating that reduced genetic variation and/or random genetic drift in the two lines may have led to differences in some biological characters. Since we did not find any significant differences between the T18 and COS colonies in the traits tested, the T18 colony is not expected to exhibit any new biological attributes in a proposed short-term field release.

AB  - The environmental adaptability of human beings has progressed according to various environments experienced in the course of evolution. Therefore, various phenotypes for environmental adaptability exist and are considered to be physiological polymorphism. Physiological polymorphism in thermoregulation is influenced by genotype, individual characteristics, environmental factors, cultural factors, etc. Moreover, it is thought that physiological polymorphism is evidenced more clearly in physiological responses to extreme situations and/or changing conditions than in environments where homeostasis is easily maintained. In the field of physiological anthropology, I think that it is important not only to discover the physiological responses that demonstrate polymorphism, but also to hypothesize about the mechanisms and the processes by which such polymorphisms were formed, and their meaning for human beings. Such discussions may be supposed to lead to an evaluation of the environmental adaptability of humans from the viewpoint of physiological anthropology.

AB  - Petunia plants obtained by pollination with pollen pretreated with phage transducing the E. coli gene for hexose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (E.C. 2.7.7.12), showed, over all the six generations so far tested, a significant better growth and development on galactose media than controls. The controls were derived from pollen treated with phage transducing the mutant transferase gene and with homologous Petunia DNA, respectively. Petunia hybrida has its own transferase. E. coli and Petunia transferase, however, could be differentiated by their pH optima and temperature sensitivity. In F3-plants with better growth on galactose, under sterile culture conditions bacterial transferase activity could be detected, which was absent from the controls. E. coli transferase activity developed only on galactose media, not on sucrose. Therefore, an induction seems possible. The data presented allow understanding of the better growth and development on galactose on the basis of bacterial transferase activity within the respective plants. © 1984, Gustav Fisher Verlag, Stuttgart.

VL  - 52

SP  - 1033-1042
AB  - 1. In the life cycle of monogonont rotifers it is generally assumed that diapausing eggs invariably hatch into amictic stem females which produce female offspring parthenogenetically. Diapausing eggs are only produced by later generations after sexual reproduction has been induced by environmental cues. 2. We show that populations of an undescribed Hexarthra species inhabiting small temporary ponds in the Chihuahuan Desert deviate from this life cycle pattern. These ponds may dry within days and up to 85% of females were mictic. Females producing male offspring and diapausing eggs were observed 1 or 2 days, respectively, after ponds had filled with water. 3. Under laboratory conditions, 7-46% of females hatching from re-hydrated sediments were sexual. Male offspring of these females can fertilise other mictic stem females leading to diapausing egg formation. In laboratory experiments, females produced fully developed diapausing eggs within 1.9 days at 20 °C and 1.2 days at 30 °C. 4. In addition, embryonic development time (1.1-0.3 days at temperatures between 12 and 30 °C) and juvenile period (2.1-0.5 days for the same temperature range) are shorter than those of other rotifer species. In short-lived habitats, the potential for rapid population development and production of new diapausing eggs may be crucial in the long-term survival of populations. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - We have generated a life-extending mutation, yw23, tl Caenorhabditis elegans The mutation is in what appears to be a new aging gene, which we have designated age-2. When homozygous, yw23 produces an increase of mean and maximum life span of about 20% over that of the wild-type strain, N2. Strain HG23 [age-2(yw23)] was obtained by screening for longer life spans among 430 lines of nematodes two generations after exposure to the mutagen ethylmethanesulfonate. Strain HG231 [age-2(yw23)] was obtained after a single oat-crossing of HG23 to NZ. When compared with N2, HG231 exhibits normal motility, slightly higher swimming rates, reduced fertility (especially at higher temperatures), somewhat longer development times, and a slightly larger size at the time of first egg laying. A Gompertz analysis suggests that HG231 extends life span by reducing the initial mortality rate. In generic crosses, yw23 complements other known aging mutants in C. elegans genes-age-1, daf-2, spe-26, clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1. A double-mutant strain, HG284, combining mutations in age-1 and age-2, fires longer than animals with individual mutations in either age-1 or age-2, and exhibits a longer life span at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C.

AB  - In order to understand the status of heteroplasmy and its evolution within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, cytoplasm microinjections between eggs were performed involving three lineages of Drosophila simulans, carrying the siI, siII or siIII mtDNA type, respectively, and two strains of Drosophila mauritiana carrying the maI or maII mtDNA type. Progeny of eggs from all combinations of injection were analysed. The maII or siI molecules, when provided by the donor, were never detected in the offspring of the hosts, whatever the host's mitochondrial type. Heteroplasmic flies were detected when siII, siIII or maI mitochondria were injected into any of the other cytoplasms. In the majority of cases the percentage of foreign mtDNA increased over generations, leading to a complete replacement of the endogenous mtDNA. In most cases, siII was prevalent. The stochastic processes involved in the evolution of heteroptasmic states are strongly affected by selective values of the different mtDNA types, with a clear hierarchy among them: siII has the most advantage, then siIII and maI, and finally siI and maII. In the siII/maII heteroplasmy case, the loss of maII was more rapid at a high temperature.

The study used constant and combinations of temperatures during different instars on leaf to silk conversion using bivoltine (NB4D2) and multivoltine (Pure Mysore) races. Conversions values are presented in a tabular format for each. Although Pure Mysore shows greater temperature adaptability the bivoltine has better leaf to silk conversion rate. Overall young age silkworms reared at lower temperature 25-26°C show better adaptability and productivity.

TI  - Persistence of eclosion rhythm in Drosophila melanogaster after 600 generations in an aperiodic environment
VL  - 86
IS  - 9
SP  - 448-449
AB  - The ubiquity of circadian rhythms suggests that they have an intrinsic adaptive value (Ouyang et al. 1998; Ronneberg and Foster 1997). Some experiments have shown that organisms have enhanced longevity, development time or growth rates when maintained in environments whose periodicity closely matches their endogenous period (Aschoff et al. 1971; Highkin and Hanson 1954; Hillman 1956; Pittendrigh and Minis 1972; Went 1960). So far there has been no experimental evidence to show that circadian rhythms per se (i.e. periodicity itself, as opposed to phasing properties of a rhythm) confer a fitness advantage. We show that the circadian eclosion rhythm persists in a population of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster maintained in constant conditions of light, temperature, and humidity for over 600 generations. The results suggest that even in the absence of any environmental cycle there exists some intrinsic fitness value of circadian rhythms.

VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 79-90
AB  - Intra-specific colour differences in insects may occur as a result of environmental factors such as food type, temperature and humidity, or may be under genetic control. These colour polymorphisms may result in fitness differences through several mechanisms, including mate selection, camouflage from or warning to natural enemies, and heat absorption. Two colour morphs of adult Chrysophtharta agricola (Chapuis) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Paropsini) are present in the field in mainland Australia and Tasmania: a common green-brown form, and a rare black form. Tasmanian populations were sampled to assess the frequency of each morph at eight localities. The black form represented less than 3% of beetles (N=1724), with the proportion not significantly different between localities. Crossing tests using the two colour morphs of C. agricola showed that the black form was genetically dominant over the common form. To assess whether colour morphs had any fitness differences, we measured pre-oviposition period, fecundity, longevity, adult size and egg hatch rate, which each showed no significant difference between colour morphs. Field sampling of mating pairs and rearing the offspring of field-collected females showed no evidence of non-random mating. Modelling the population over 100 generations confirmed that for this species, melanism is controlled by a dominant but neutral allele, and, thus, is maintained at a constant low level in the population. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 27

SP  - 756-762
AB  - Immature stages of Culex annulirostris Skuse from Ross River Dam were reared in the laboratory at constant temperatures (18.0, 24.5, 28.5 and 35.0 degrees C) and in the field in the presence or absence of predators. In the laboratory, survival from first instar to adult emergence increased from 5.5% at 18 degrees C to 96.5% at 35 degrees C. In the field predators increased mortality by almost 60%. Adult wing length increased inversely with constant temperature except at 18 degrees C. In the field the largest adults were produced in the presence of predators. The developmental threshold temperature (to) and thermal constant (K) were estimated from laboratory data to be 13.7 degrees C and 129.3 DD, respectively. K determined in the laboratory did not differ significantly from that required in the field (132.8 and 153.5 DD above 13.7 degrees C in the presence and absence of predators). Numbers of immature Cx. annulirostris at four sites in the dam rose to a peak after four or five generations and then rapidly declined. Overall survival of immatures was very low but was significantly higher at the one site where Melaleucas also occurred. Age-specific survival was highest in the first instar. Estimated survival from hatching to eclosion ranged from 4/1,000 to 185/1,000. Mortality appeared to be density independent and was attributed mostly to predation.

AB  - Responses to temperature of a population of Meloidogyne javanica from Tanzania were examined. The minimum time for development from J2 to first J2 of the next generation was determined over a temperature range from 18-30-degrees-C. The rate of development increased linearly between 18-degrees-C and 27-degrees-C and, on a thermal time basis, the threshold or base temperature for development was estimated by extrapolation to be 12.9-degrees-C and the requirement for development c. 350-degrees-C days above base. These values are compared with those for M. hapla, a temperate species, and their effects on development time in relation to temperature are discussed. The effect of higher temperatures on egg viability was also tested. Short exposures to 70-degrees-C were lethal and exposure to 45-degrees-C and above killed a progressively increasing proportion of eggs. Exposure in the field in Tanzania of egg masses buried at different depths to solarization under clear polythene sheeting showed that at 15 cm depth all eggs were dead after 2-3 weeks with an average and a maximum soil temperature at 16.00 h of 43-degrees-C and 45-degrees-C respectively for the covered and 40-degrees-C and 42-degrees-C for the uncovered plots. Irrigating the plots before covering slightly decreased mean soil temperatures compared with the covered, dry plots and greatly increased egg survival.

AB  - The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), exists with holocyclic life cycle in Tacheng, Xinjiang in Northwest China. It produces males and oviparae to mate and oviposit for overwintering by eggs. Under laboratory conditions with 14 h/d photophase and temperature not lower than 15 degreesC, RWA occurred in parthenogenesis and produced no males. The laboratory populations of Russian wheat aphid, which were kept under natural conditions in fall by 15th, 49th and 81st generation while wild populations produced males and oviparae for mating, produced males and oviparae with their number decreased gradually, but viviparae and nymphs increased sequentially. As a result, it produced a small amount of oviparae and no males emerged in fields by 49 generations' reproduction in laboratory. After development of 81 generations, oviparae happened occasionally and no eggs occurred for overwintering instead of viviparae and nymphs. A hypothesis of RWA disastrous process was proposed. The life cycle of RWA can be changed from holocycly to anholocycly in its long-term spread and evolution. Anholocycly is more dangerous than holocycly to small grains for its strong adaptability and dispersal ability.

The experiments were carried out on 2-4-year old White Kołuda ganders derived from naturally mated flocks and their four subsequent generations obtained after geese insemination with thawed semen, evaluated in the first cycle of reproduction. The freezing process did not effect the fresh semen quality, but with every subsequent generation the spermatozoa susceptibility to cryoinjury increased, manifested as a higher number of live morphologically intact cells (evaluated in a light microscope) in the thawed semen. In relation to the fresh semen, the freezing process preserved on average 25.6; 39.1; 47.1 and 66.6 percent of the live normal spermatozoa, in the first, second, third and fourth generations, respectively.

TI  - Optimization of induction heating using numerical modeling and genetic algorithm
VL  - 76
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-68
AB  - Induction heating is one of the most widely used methods for heat treatment of steel. However, due to the complex interplay of electromagnetic, thermal and metallurgic phenomena, it is very demanding to model it numerically. The aim of our study was to determine the optimal coil position and the optimal amplitude and frequency of the electric current to attain the desired heat profile (temperature of the outer layer of the heated steel object should reach 450 - 500 K) by using the genetic algorithm optimization method in combination with finite-element numerical modelling. The object of our study was a non-ferromagnetic steel cylinder (Fig. 1) surrounded by a copper coil consisting of four loops. We calculated the magnetic field (Eq. 4), which causes joule heating (Eq. 6), and redistribution of the temperature throughout the material. In our calculations we took into account the steels temperature-dependent material properties (Eqs. 1, 2 and 3). We considered the following optimization parameter constraints: position of the single-coil loop and amplitude and frequency of the electric current through the coil (Fig. 2). Solutions were selected according to their fitness (Eq. 9) depending on the accuracy of heating and the amount of the used energy. We compared our optimized solution with an educated guess and the actual global optimum. The optimized solution and the global optimum had very comparable temperature profiles and almost identical fitness function values due to a better selection of the electric current parameters compared to the educated guess (Table 3). The genetic algorithm was terminated after 30 generations, when the fitness of the top solution usually converged close to the global optimum (Fig. 4). One of the advantages of our approach is the adaptability of the algorithm enabling its easy use in various heat treatment applications. Even though the optimized solution is not identical to the global optimum, it is always close to it and it can also be used as an initial approximation for other more precise deterministic optimization methods. We demonstrated that our approach assures precise heating of the steel cylinder at low-energy consumption and high time-efficiency. We believe these advantages will become even more pronounced when the algorithm is used on more complex induction heating problems.

AB  - The present paper is a survey of the economics of survival, a branch of ecological economics that stresses the preservation of the opportunities of future generations over an extended time horizon. It outlines the main analytical foundation of the branch - in which the concept of entropy is a major building block -, and its analysis of the interaction between the economic system and the environment. Regarding its outlook of the future, we see that the founders of the branch were mainly concerned with the consequences of a serious depletion of natural resources - particularly the energetic capital of the earth. More recently, however, emphasis is being placed on problems that stem from the fragility of the global ecosystem in face of the disturbances caused by the entropic acceleration imposed by mankind. It is feared that the ongoing expansion of the scale of the economy may bring about irreversible damages to vital environmental functions, such as protection against undesirable consequences of solar radiation, maintenance of temperature within a range that will support life, and preservation of ecosystem resiliency.

AB  - All organisms must display a certain degree of environmental adaptability to survive and reproduce. Growth and reproduction are metabolically expensive and carry other costs that contribute to aging. Therefore, animals have developed physiologic strategies to assess the harshness of the environment before devoting resources to reproduction. Presumably, these strategies maximize the possibility for offspring survival. Current views of aging reflect a trade-off between reproductive fitness and somatic maintenance whereby environmental stress induces an adaptive metabolic response aimed at preserving cellular integrity while inhibiting growth, whereas favorable environmental conditions (abundance of food and water, and optimal temperature, etc.) promote growth and reproductive maturity but simultaneously increase cellular damage and aging. Here we propose that the prevalence of infectious pathogens in a given niche represents an additional environmental factor that, via innate immune pathways, actively shifts this balance in favor of somatic maintenance at the expense of reproduction and growth. We additionally propose the construction of a genetic model system with which to test this hypothesis. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

SP  - 717-725
AB  - Temperature adaptability was compared among three different races of ayu Plecoglossus altivelis at 205-220 days of age by recording changes in their tolerance temperatures after acclimation to various temperatures. These races were raised under the same conditions from hatching up to the performance of temperature-tolerance tests to make environment factors uniform. Tolerance temperatures of the fish changed depending on the acclimation temperature within the race and there were significant differences in the indices of temperature tolerance among he races. Average critical thermal maximum and minimum acclimated to 15-23degreesC and ranged from 29.7-32.2degreesC, 2.5-6.0degreesC in amphidromous form, 28.7-31.7degreesC, 2.3-5.3degreesC in landlocked form and 29.7-33.0degreesC, 1.7-5.0degreesC in Setogawa artificial landlocked form. The magnitude of thermal tolerance zones for each race calculated from the upper and lower incipient lethal temperatures against acclimation temperatures were 481degreesC(2), 415degreesC(2) and 517degreesC(2) respectively. These results suggested that a difference may exist in the temperature adaptability among the ayu races.

AB  - A quasi-static model is proposed to describe wafer deformation due to stress build up in the Si epitaxy process. The analysis takes into account temporal stress variations as the wafer sags into the dish-shaped pocket of the susceptor at a deposition temperature above 1100 degreesC. It is shown that the magnitude of the negative bending moment at the wafer supporting edge decreases over time. As a result, the maximum deflection at the wafer center and the tensile stress at the wafer supporting edge also decrease over time. The generation of slip defects near the wafer edge as the wafer responds the thermal, Gravitational and contact stress is explored. A new test methodology is developed to track the time-varying wafer deflection. It allows for the measurement of quality of the susceptor and its fitness for use in the reactor system.

AB  - A stable association of the stress-tolerant zooxanthellae, Symbiodinium clade D, with the low-temperature-tolerant coral, Oulastrea crispata (Scleractinia: Faviidae) in subtropical non-reefal coral communities. Zoological Studies 42(4): 540-550. We examined spatial and temporal zooxanthellae diversity in a low-temperature-tolerant coral, Oulastrea crispata, from 2 subtropical non-reefal coral communities, the Penghu Islands (the Pescadores), Taiwan and from Hong Kong, China using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of partial nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (nssrDNA) and large subunit ribosomal DNA (nlsrDNA), together with phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences. Oulastrea crispata occurs commonly on shallow reef depressions and on turbid bay bedrock inhabited by only a few other corals, and is a pioneer coral colonizing artificial substrates where environmental disturbance is high. This study demonstrates that the zooxanthellae associated with O. crispata, in Penghu and in Hong Kong belong to Symbiodinium clade D, a clade of zooxanthellae formally proposed to be stress tolerant in marginal habitats (Toiler et al. 2001a). Analyses of zooxanthellae diversity showed no apparent symbiosis polymorphism on either a spatial or temporal scale, suggesting that the association with Symbiodinium clade D is stable in O. crispata. Oulastrea crispata possesses opportunistic life history traits, including a variety of reproductive strategies and physiological tolerances, enabling it to colonize a variety of substrata unfavorable to other corals. Our finding showed a stable association with a stress-tolerant symbiont which may provide a key to how O. crispata can achieve such physiological adaptability.

AB  - Insects can increase their resistance to cold stress when they are exposed to non-lethal conditions prior to the stress; these plastic responses are normally described only in terms of immediate effects on mortality. Here we examine in Drosophila melanogaster the short-and longer-term effects of different conditions on several measures of cold resistance, but particularly chill coma recovery. Short-term exposure to sublethal temperature (cold hardening) did not decrease chill coma recovery times even though it decreased mortality. Exposure to 12 degrees C for 2 days (acclimation) decreased chill coma recovery times for a range of stressful temperatures when flies were cultured at 25 degrees C, but did not usually affect recovery times when flies were cultured at 19 degrees C. In contrast, 2-day exposure to 12 degrees C decreased mortality regardless of rearing temperature. Rearing at 19 degrees C decreased mortality and chill coma recovery time relative to rearing at 25 degrees C. Acclimation increased the eclosion rate of eggs from stressed females, but did not affect development time or size of the offspring. These results indicate that plastic responses to cold in D. melanogaster are complex when resistance is scored in different ways, and that effects can extend across generations.

VL  - 38

SP  - 499-504
AB  - In the house fly, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), sex is usually determined by a dominant factor, M, located on the Y chromosome. However, there are autosomal male (A M) populations in which the M factor is located on one or more of the five autosomes (I-V), most commonly on the third chromosome. Herein we report the use of isogenic strains to determine the relative fitness of Y M versus III M males in three different experiments. First, cages were started with 50% Y M and 50% m M males, and the frequencies of Y M and III M males were evaluated across generations. Second, mating competition studies were preformed with these isogenic strains. Third, the relative emergence rates of III M versus Y M male pupae held at three temperatures for 3 d were examined. All three studies indicate that HI M males have a greater fitness than Y M males. In the cage competition studies, &gt;90% of the males were RT M after seven generations. III M males were more likely to mate than Y M males, and a higher percent of III M males emerged after being held as pupae at 4, 16, or 28°C for 3 d. The implications of these studies to the distribution of III M and Y M males in field populations are discussed. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.

VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-96
AB  - This study was conducted from May, 2002 to September, 2003 by comparing the growth of Tetraena mongolica Maxim in ex situ seeding area and analyzing the adaptabilities of T. mongolica to soil and climate factors. Some results were shown below: Firstly rank of T. mongolica growth was Dongsheng soil in Wuhai area (12.17g), local soil in Wuhai area (10.57g), Wuhai soil in Dongsheng area (3.10g), and local soil in Dongsheng area (2.59g). There was no significant difference among soil derived from the same area in terms of the amount of growth (p ≥ 0.05). However, the growth of T. mongolica showed more significant difference in the same soil from different areas. Consequently, the survival of T. mongolica was most likely to be determined by climate other than by soil. Secondly content of available N, P, and K showed significant differences between T. mongolica distribution area and their ex situ conservation area. However it contributed little to the growth of T. mongolica. The amount of 9 kinds of trace elements was higher in T. mongolica than in soil, which suggested that this plant had the ability to accumulate trace elements. Therefore the content of 9 trace elements although they showed significant differences. Impacted little on the survival and growth of T. mongolica There were significant differences between T. mongolica distribution area and their ex situ conservation area in annual mean precipitation (157.89 < 381.48mm, p ≤ 0.05), monthly mean precipitation (p ≤ 0.05), annual mean temperature (9.84 > 6.16°C, p ≤ 0.05), monthly mean temperature (p ≤ 0.05), warm index (97.6467 > 68.2267, p ≤ 0.05), cold index (- 39.5200 < - 53.1200, p ≤ 0.05), humidity index (1.6151 < 5.6610, p ≤ 0.05), and integrated index of precipitation and temperature (13.6031 < 32.6013, p ≤ 0.05). In the distribution area of T. mongolica, the mean day-to-night difference in surface atmosphere temperature is around 12°C. However, this difference for surface soil temperature reaches to about 35°C due to large amount of middle-fine sand and coarse sand in soil profile. In ex situ conservation area the prevalent soil is chestnut soil containing some clay. The difference in surface soil temperature is very low. Therefore although the day-to-night difference in surface atmosphere temperature is around 10°C which is almost the same as that in T. mongolica distribution area.

VL  - 73
IS  - 17
SP  - 5633-5638
AB  - Streptococcus mutans, a member of the dental plaque community, has been shown to be involved in the carious process. Cells of S. mutans induce an acid tolerance response (ATR) when exposed to sublethal pH values that enhances their survival at a lower pH. Mature biofilm cells are more resistant to acid stress than planktonic cells. We were interested in studying the acid tolerance and ATR-inducing ability of newly adhered biofilm cells of S. mutans. All experiments were carried out using flow-cell systems, with acid tolerance tested by exposing 3-h biofilm cells to pH 3.0 for 2 h and counting the number of survivors by plating on blood agar. Acid adaptability experiments were conducted by exposing biofilm cells to pH 5.5 for 3 h and then lowering the pH to 3.5 for 30 min. The viability of the cells was assessed by staining the cells with LIVE/DEAD BacLight viability stain. Three-hour biofilm cells of three different strains of S. mutans were between 820- and 70,000-fold more acid tolerant than corresponding planktonic cells. These strains also induced an ATR that enhanced the viability at pH 3.5. The presence of fluoride (0.5 M) inhibited the induction of an ATR, with 77% fewer viable cells at pH 3.5 as a consequence. Our data suggest that adhesion to a surface is an important step in the development of acid tolerance in biofilm cells and that different strains of S. mutans possess different degrees of acid tolerance and ability to induce an ATR.

AB  - This review traces some of the developments in population physiology based on contributions to the Annals over the last 25 years. Two broad themes are evident, physiological systems variation and adaptation, and by way of introduction an historical perspective of their relationship within human ecology is explored. Studies of physical fitness and work capacity, and the efforts to create standardized field procedures make up a number of the early papers. Longitudinal studies have provided reliable reference standards for Westernized populations, but are virtually non-existent for primitive groups. The relative importance of phenotypic and genotypic variations in working capacity have yet to be clearly defined. The level of habitual activity during childhood contributes to the development of ventilatory capacity though constitutional influences are of major importance. Variability in strength and motor performance of skeletal muscles are shown to have a direct bearing on aspects of growth, development and biological maturation. Physical and psychological stress in communities have been investigated. These and other studies contribute valuable data on the issue of stress, hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. On the theme of human adaptability, high altitude populations, variations in thermal tolerance and adaptations in ageing populations have all received recent investigation. Highland people of all ages have considerably larger lung volumes than coastal dwellers. Haematological, biochemical and pulmonary function show adaptive phenomena that vary in different highland groups. In the tropical biome, more recent work includes the functional consequences of malnutrition, ethnic and cultural differences in work capacity, and the effects of endemic disease on physical performance. Annals of Human Biology papers have more recently contributed to investigations on morphological and physiological changes with human ageing. Though there is a decline in the ability to adapt to environmental stresses with age this may be met by changes in adaptational strategy in physiological systems.

TI  - Studies on the Diapause of the Apple Leaf Miner, Phyllonorycter ringoniella (Matsumura) (Lepi-Doptera: Gracillariidae). IV. Variations in the Photoperiodic Responses upon the Induction of Diapause among Generations
VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 375-380
AB  - Most of the 2nd and 3rd generations of the Morioka population of the apple leaf miner developed to diapausing pupae under the photoperiodic regime of 13 h or less at 15°C and 20°C. In the 1st generation, however, the percentage of diapause was about 50% or lower under the same photo-periodic-thermal conditions. In two hybrids between the overwintered (O) and the 1st (I) generations, the photoperiod-% diapause curve in the progeny of O § X I § closely resembled that of the 1st generation. On the other hand, the curve in the reverse crossing (I § X O §) was similar to that of the 2nd generation. From these results, it was suggested that the information for the inhibition of the induction of the diapause acquired within the body of the overwintering female during the course of her development, was transmitted maternally in the 1st generation eggs. As the information disappeared after the 2nd generation, it is considered that the information did not affect the genetic sensibility for photoperiod, but was a secondary and temporary factor. The small differences observed between the 2nd and the 3rd generations, can be mainly ascribed to differences in the leaf age or number of instars during the sap-feeding larval stage. The decline of the photoperiodic responses in the 1st generation was also observed to some extent in all the other local populations examined; Asahikawa, Kanazawa, Suzaka, Hamamatsu and Amagi. © 1987, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

VL  - 274
IS  - 1610
SP  - 671-679
AB  - The long-term history of Zeiraphera diniana Gn. (the larch budmoth, LBM) outbreaks was reconstructed from tree rings of host subalpine larch in the European Alps. This record was derived from 47 513 maximum latewood density measurements, and highlights the impact of contemporary climate change on ecological disturbance regimes. With over 1000 generations represented, this is the longest annually resolved record of herbivore population dynamics, and our analysis demonstrates that remarkably regular LBM fluctuations persisted over the past 1173 years with population peaks averaging every 9.3 years. These regular abundance oscillations recurred until 1981, with the absence of peak events during recent decades. Comparison with an annually resolved, millennium-long temperature reconstruction representative for the European Alps (r=0.72, correlation with instrumental data) demonstrates that regular insect population cycles continued despite major climatic changes related to warming during medieval times and cooling during the Little Ice Age. The late twentieth century absence of LBM outbreaks, however, corresponds to a period of regional warmth that is exceptional with respect to the last 1000+ years, suggesting vulnerability of an otherwise stable ecological system in a warming environment. © 2006 The Royal Society.

VL  - 16
IS  - 1
SP  - 8-17
AB  - The smaller brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus Fallén, has been reared continuously for over 10 generations on holidic diets. By letting the planthoppers lay their eggs on Parafilm M membrane, the planthoppers were maintained free of their natural host plants for many generations. On holidic diets the nymphal growth was retarded but became improved after the 4th generation, although it was still slower than the controls even at the 10th generation. Nymphal mortality showed similar trends to nymphal growth, increasing up to the 3rd generation and decreasing thereafter. It was also noted that the resulting adults on holidic diets showed apparently no difference in size compared with the controls. In artificial rearing the multiplication rate of the planthoppers were extremely low, probably because of the inadequacy in the collecting methods of their eggs and their preservation. Mortality was found to be very high just after hatching. Therefore, the rearing conditions for the first instar nymphs were examined, and the following became evident. A shorter vessel is better than a taller vessel and as for light source, yellow, orange and red colors are preferable. The higher the relative humidity, the better is the survivorship. The preferred temperature for the first instar nymphs ranges from 15°C to 23°C. © 1972, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved.

Findings are summarized as follows: 1). Mortality generally curves up to a peak in winter. In summer, it declines for haemorrhage but slightly increases for thrombosis & embolism, probably due to high humidity in this season. 2) This phenomenon appears more clearly in the central (warm) than in the northern (cold) and southern (subtropical) parts of the Japanese archipelago, suggestive of the limited adaptability to the meteorological environment of the old-aged affected by cerebrovascular diseases. 3) The summer maximum of mortality from cerebral thrombosis & embolism is somewhat higher in the urban than in the rural districts, but there is little difference between Kanto (East) and Kansai (West) in this country. 4) The death rate is generally going down for haemorrhage but up for thrombosis & embolism year by year. It is necessary to secure better heating in winter and better air conditioning (less humidity) in summer, especially for old people. © 1973, Japan Meteorological Agency. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ways and means for accomplishing a proportionate increase of the actual rolling time with respect to the total operating time in cold rolling of sheet and strip metals are discussed. These approaches, which are also applicable in the case of modernization of existing plants, include reduction of breakdown and idle times, improved control of the actual condition of the strip, and improved adaptability of the roll gap to the desired strip characteristics.

TI  - Escaping an ecological dead-end: Asexual overwintering and morph determination in the lettuce root aphid Pemphigus bursarius L
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 336-344
AB  - 1. Pemphigus bursarius exhibits a host-alternating life-cycle, overwintering as eggs on the primary host plant (poplar) before migrating in summer to the secondary host plant (mainly annual Compositae). A proportion of the population does not produce return migrants (sexuparae) in the autumn but remains in the soil and overwinters as asexual apterae, even after the annual plants have died in early winter. Laboratory and field experiments investigated the biology and overwintering success of these asexual apterae. 2. Both temperature and photoperiod are important in morph determination. The highest number of apterae (approximately 50% of progeny) was produced in a 20 degrees C, LD 18:6 h regime. Very few apterae were produced in an alatae-inducing environment (15 degrees C, LD 12:12 h), but the proportion increased over successive generations. 3. Apterae remaining in the soil in the autumn overwintered successfully in large numbers and were able to reinfest directly the root systems of newly planted lettuce grown in the same field in the following growing season. 4. Overwintered asexual populations also produced alates in July, which were able to colonise other lettuce plants, indicating that they were not sexuparae. Hence, P. bursarius can avoid the ecological dead-end that would occur through local patch extinction. Clones can therefore persist indefinitely as both asexual apterae and alatae without the need to return to poplar and undergo the sexual phase of the life-cycle.

TI  - Indoor climate guidelines in The Netherlands: Developments towards adaptive thermal comfort
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SP  - 72-84
AB  - Purpose – This paper sets out to highlight several aspects of a project, aimed at developing an advanced thermal comfort guideline, based on the adaptive thermal comfort theory. Design/methodology/approach – The paper introduces the new Dutch adaptive guideline for thermal comfort. The initial method exceeding hours (TO) is discussed, as well as the more recent method of weighted temperature exceeding hours (GTO). An evaluation of the practical and theoretical shortcomings of the TO and GTO methods is discussed, as well as the rationale behind the adaptive ATG guideline. Furthermore, the results are presented of computer simulations in which the predictions of the different methods are compared. Productivity effects of the new guideline are also discussed, as well as the implications for cooling system sizing and energy efficiency. Findings – The adaptive temperature limits (ATG) guidelines appears to be a more reliable method for the assessment of thermal comfort, in particular for passive, free-running buildings, compared with the PMV-based method of weighted temperature exceeding hours (GTO). Furthermore, the ATG method allows for a wider temperature range for Alpha type buildings and gives more opportunity for the development of sustainable, naturally ventilated buildings and limiting cooling energy. Research limitations/implications – Although the new ATG method shows promising results, more research is needed. The exact distinction between Alpha and Beta is still subject to further research, as well as the question whether a certain amount of exceeding hours of the ATG limits should be accepted. Practical implications – The ATG method is being used in The Netherlands for the assessment of thermal comfort in the design stage as well as in the assessment of the performance of buildings in use. Originality/value – This paper discusses the first application of the adaptive thermal comfort theory in a practical guideline. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Fluctuation in the number of overwintering Nephotettix cincticeps was studied during a period of 3 years at 3 localities. For the estimation of the number of individuals, “quadrate-suction” method was used together with the removal (time-unit capture) method. In the over-wintering generation, mortality of eggs and young nymphs seemed to be caused mainly be the effect of temperature. Death of hibernating nymphs was observed mainly during the period from December to the first 10 days of January in different years and localities. Survival rate of the 4th instar nymphs in winter was usually high as compared with other the developmental stages. The blowing method captured 20%-50% of insects. Sampling efficiency of this method was lower than the “quadrate-suction” method, and was affected considerably by temperature. Spiders played an important role in reducing the number of N. cincticeps during winter. © 1972, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper summed up the reproductive strategies and the ecological adaptability of clonal plants in six different habitats such as forest understory, steppe, desert, farmlands and water area, and discussed the trade-off relations or relative importance of sexual vs. asexual reproduction which regularly change with water status, light and temperature. Such regularity was clarified as: the harsher the environment is, the more asexual reproduction would contribute to the regeneration and survival of the populations. In addition, we compared the ecological and functional properties of sexual vs. asexual reproduction modes, reviewed recent researches on the trade-off relations between the two reproductive modes, and mentioned some factors influencing such tradeoff relations. Finally, we made a prospect about future research of reproductive strategy of clonal plants especially in terms of approaches.

TI  - THE VIABILITY OF THE EGGS OF THE AFRICAN ARMY‐WORM, SPODOPTERA EXEMPTA IN LABORATORY CULTURES
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 269-280
AB  - When two stocks of S. exempta were established in the laboratory from five and seven adults, respectively, the viability of the eggs of the parent generations was high (90%–100%) but thereafter it declined erractically until in the 9th generation it was less than 25%. Even though the adults paired and females contained spermatophores, their eggs often failed to hatch. The viability was not increased by changing the normal breeding temperature (25°) or the normal humidity (60% RH). The decline in hatch occurred in stocks which were always fed on growing maize as well as in stocks fed on the various diets. When vitamin E was added to the larval food the viability of eggs laid by the resulting adults substantially increased but declined in later generations fed on the same diet. No other change made in the composition of the larval or adult foods influenced the viability favourably, and it is concluded that the poor hatch which developed after several generations was due to the accumulation of deleterious genotypes resulting from inbreeding. LA FERTILITÉ DES ŒUFS DE SPODOPTERA EXEMPTA CULTIVÉ EN LABORATOIRE Quand deux lignées de S. exempta sont réalisées en laboratoire à partir, respectivement de 5 et 7 géniteurs, la fertilité des œufs de la première génération est élevée (90%–100%) mais par la suite celle‐ci décline erratiquement jusqu'à 25% à la 9e génération. Bien que les femelles aient été fécondées (présence de spermatophores) leurs œufs souvent n'éclosent pas. Le taux d'éclosion n'est pas amélioré en changeant la température d'élevage (25°) ou l'humidité relative (60%). Le déclin de la fertilité se manifeste aussi bien dans les lignées nourries sur maïs jeune que dans celles nourries sur divers aliments artificiels. Quand on ajoute de la vitamine E à la nourriture larvaire la viabilité des œufs pondus par les adultes correspondants est nettement améliorée, mais celle‐ci décline à nouveau irrémédiablement dans les générations suivantes élevées cependant sur le même aliment. Aucune autre modification apportée tant à la nourriture larvaire qu'à la nourriture des adultes n'a pu modifier la fertilité des œufs. On en conclut que c'est l'accumulation dans la population, des génotypes déficients résultant de l'inbreeding qui est responsable du déclin de la fertilité des œufs après plusieurs générations. 1975 The Netherlands Entomological Society

VL  - 79

SP  - 252-259
AB  - Stress tolerance is often measured as a threshold trait, the proportion of a group that survives a defined stress regime. Requirements of large offspring numbers coupled with fitness variation in the surviving cohort limit the use of some standard genetic analyses for estimating heritability. Therefore, we present an isofemale line analysis, which is a modified full-sib design, to estimate heritability of tolerance to heat shock in pretreated Drosophila buzzatii adults. Highly significant levels or genetic variation were found in males and females at the third generation of laboratory rearing, and the intraclass correlations were estimated to be about 0.2 for four independent sets of 25 isofemale lines. The proportion of the variance explained within lines among same-sex replicates, however, was larger than that between replicates of males and females. Because genetic variation was estimated from groups, the error variation required factoring by the group size to estimate heritability, which averaged 0.03. The four most tolerant, four least tolerant and four lines of average tolerance to heat stress in each set were reanalysed after 10-11 generations of rearing at 25 degrees C. Survival in the 13th-13th generations was positively and significantly associated with survival at generation 3. These comparisons indicate the high repeatability of measurements of heat-shock tolerance.

AB  - This species is the neritic animal in warm waters, especially a large number of the species appear in the tide pool in spring to summer season. The species has the adaptability to the environment, namely, the species is eurythermal and euryhaline organism. Each nauplius stage of T. japonicus changed into the next stage in 18 to 20 hours. After hatching the nauplius developed into the copepodite stage in 3 to 5 days. The nauplius is disk-shaped in outline. A small antennule is 3-segmented. The antenna and mandible are the assistant oral organs for foods rather than swimming ones. On the antenna the coxa has the process with the strong cutting edge, the basipodite is extremely small, the long endopodite has a hook and a seta ventrally, and a hook, a seta and a spine terminally, and the long exopodite has the setae of which the number was changed according to the stage. On the mandible the coxa with a seta is a bulge. The endopodite is a small mound, on this mound there are a strong hook and a few setae which were changed according to the stage. The exopodite has a ventral seta and a small and a long thick terminal setae. The caudal appendages are rudimentary. The maxillule first appears as a seta on the 2nd stage. On the copedite stage of T. japonicus the segment of body is short. The cephalothoracic segments are indistinguishable from the abdominal segments. It is the character of Harpacticoida that the antennules are small. On this copedodite there are 6 stages as in the nauplius, but the last stage is the adult stage. The 1st and the 2nd stages changed into the next stage in 18 to 20 hours as in the nauplius. The 3rd to the 5th stages changed into the next stage within 1 day. After hatching the nauplius developed into the adult by 10 days. The period of each stage fluctuates according to the amount of foods which were supplied to the animal. On the starved condition the development of this animal does not occur by any means. The most of male have mated with the adult female, but some of them mated with the earlier stage, especially the 2nd copepodite stage female. The female which developed into the adult produced the first brood in a few minutes to 3 days. A period of the adult stage is assumed 1 to 2 months. A female produced 5∼10 broods. After hatching of the brood the next brood was bred in a few minutes to 1 day. The female which was 0.9 mm in the mean length produced 30 eggs per a brood. © 1970 The Oceanographical Society of Japan.

AB  - First feed production continues to be a major barrier to the cultivation of many fish species. Although copepod nauplii are a suitable food, consistency and high production have been difficult. Temporal changes in production in batch cultures of the calanoid copepod, Bestiolina similis, were investigated to develop management strategies for the use of copepod nauplii as a live food. Population abundances and female egg production rates were measured, and recruitment and mortality rates were calculated. Relative expression levels of a molecular biomarker for stress, heat shock protein hsp70, were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The population cycle included a period of rapid increase in abundances, followed by a steep decline and a period of stable but low population densities. Initially, egg production exceeded 25 eggs per female per day and low mortality rates prevailed. The population decline was preceded by upregulation of hsp70 and followed by an 80-90% decline in female fecundity and an increase in mortality rates. Egg production rates remained below four eggs per female per day even after new generations of females reached adulthood. The predictable population cycle provides opportunities to coordinate nauplius production rates with first feed needs of fish larvae. © Copyright by the World Aquaculture Society 2009.

TI  - Effect of physiological parameters on the temperature distribution of a layered head model
VL  - 373
SP  - 63-67
AB  - Brain temperature control is important in clinical therapy, because moderate temperature reduction of brain temperature increases the survival rate after head trauma. A factor that affects the brain temperature distribution is the cerebral blood flow, which is controlled by autoregulatory mechanisms. To improve the existing thermal models of brain, we incorporate the effect of the temperature over the metabolic heat generation, and the regulatory processes that control the cerebral blood perfusion and depend on physiological parameters like, the mean arterial blood pressure, the partial pressure of oxygen, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption. The introduction of these parameters in a thermal model gives information about how specific conditions, such as brain edema, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or hypotension, affect the temperature distribution within the brain. Existing biological thermal models of the human brain, assume constant blood perfusion, and neglect metabolic heat generation or consider it constant, which is a valid assumption for healthy tissue. But during sickness, trauma or under the effect of drugs like anesthetics, the metabolic activity and organ blood flow vary considerably, and such variations must be accounted for in order to achieve accurate thermal modeling. Our work, on a layered head model, shows that variations of the physiological parameters have profound effect on the temperature gradients within the head.

AB  - First instar nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sirobion auenae that had been reared at 10°C and 20°C over a number of generations, were cooled to ‐5°C and ‐10°C for 1 h and 6 h and returned to 20°C to assess the effects of brief exposures to low temperatures (cold‐pulses) on their survival. rate of development, longevity and fecundity. A strong acclimation response was observed in first instar nymphs, with significantly less mortality in groups reared to 10°C compared to 20°C. Mean development time from first instar to adult was not significantly affected by low temperature exposure at the first nymphal stage. Longevity in all groups cooled as first instars was reduced by the sub‐zero cold‐pulses, and was also dependent on temperature and exposure time. Acclimated aphids survived longer than non‐acclimated individuals. Reproductive rate, in terms of the number of nymphs born per aphid per day, was unaffected by cold stress applied at the first instar stage. Total fecundity was however reduced, being a function of the number and longevity of the survivors. Adult aphids were less cold hardy than nymphs; mortality was higher at ‐10°C than ‐5°C increasing with duration of exposure from 1 h to 6 h. Mean fecundity was reduced significantly in aphids cooled at the adult stage, the number of aphids born per day decreasing as the exposure period of the cold‐pulse increased, suggesting that low temperature had affected embryogenesis. All the nymphs born to adults surviving exposure to ‐5°C for 6 h died within 48 h of birth, indicating that low temperature has a pre‐natal effect on mortality. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - Clarkus papillatus is a widely distributed predatory soil nematode and is of interest in the study of soil ecology, yet very little information exists on its in vitro culturing. In this investigation, an artificial environment was created to maintain C. papillatus for multi-generational studies. The mean number of C. papillatus increased significantly over time when starting the cultures with three adults per plate. Clarkus papillatus had a significantly higher median fecundity at 20, 25 and 28°C than at five other temperatures. Juvenile C. papillatus could not survive without adults in culture and, therefore, may require adult maceration of prey nematodes to survive in vitro. © Koninklijke Brill NV, 2005.

AB  - A laboratory test was conducted to study the effects of different sea water temperature (17 grads) and salinity (19grads) on the growth and survival of juvenile Meretrix meretrix. The suitable and optimum sea water salinities for thesurvival of juvenile M. meretrix were 6.5-39.5 and 9.0-31.0, and those for the juvenile growth were 7.3-38.7 and15.0-23.0, respectively. The suitable sea water temperature for the survival of the juveniles was 4.0 °C-36.1 °C; the suitable temperature for the growth was 7.0 °C-35.4 °C, more suitable temperature was 17 °C-33.5°C, and the optimum growth temperature was 24 °C-27 °C. Juvenile M. meretrix had stronger adaptability tohigh sea water temperature and low sea water salinity.

AB  - In this paper, the authors evaluated the efficiency and productivity of an SMT and iron-machine soldering process using Sn-Ag-Cu type solders. This solder is superior to conventional ones in terms of strength, heat fatigue resistance and toughness. The results obtained are as follows: (1) in SMT processes using Sn-Ag-Cu type solders, the quality of products and efficiency obtained are similar to conventional solders, when small electric parts are selected; and (2) in iron-machine soldering processes, Sn-Ag-Cu solder is similar to conventional solders when the iron temperature is high. © 1999 IEEE.

AB  - The adaptations to climatic stress of invertebrates have been extensively studied and the underlying physiology is relatively well understood. It is therefore possible to predict critical lower temperature and moisture limits at which a species will suffer increased mortality. Environmental pollution can reduce the tolerance to climatic stress considerably but it is not known how significant these synergistic effects are in polluted areas. Results are presented showing examples of synergism between toxic and climatic stress. The physiological mechanisms involved in the synergistic effects are discussed.

VL  - 28

SP  - 285-292
AB  - Respiratory adaptation to different sea temperatures on the Natal (east) and Table Bay (west) coasts of southern Africa is demonstrated in Actinia equina L. Animals are able to acclimate to lower sea temperatures but are unable to adapt to an increase of 3 °C or more above summer sea temperatures. Acclimation to elevated water temperatures may be limited by thermal sensitivity of the tissues and by lack of feeding when under thermal stress. The successful colonization of the Natal littoral zone by A. equina may be attributed partially to metabolic adaptability but also to its brooding ability, tolerance of desiccation, and capacity to retain water within the coelenteron. Slow exudation of this water enables evaporative cooling of the tissues during low tide. Other actinian species from Natal lack this range of features and are hence limited to damp habitats at lower tidal levels. © 1977.

VL  - 28

AB  - To evaluate differences in growth and adaptability of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), we studied growth, polycyclism, needle tissue carbon isotope composition (δ13C) as an estimate of water-use efficiency (WUE) and survival of seven populations at 10 years of age growing in a performance trial at a provenance test site in Escaroupim, Portugal. Six populations were from relatively high rainfall sites in Portugal and southwestern France (Atlantic group), and one population was from a more arid Mediterranean site in Spain. There were significant differences between some populations in total height, diameter at breast height, δ13C of bulk needle tissue, polycyclism and survival. A population from central Portugal (Leiria, on the Atlantic coast) was the tallest and had the lowest δ13C. Overall, the variation in δ13C was better explained by the mean minimum temperatures of the coldest month than by annual precipitation at the place of origin. Analyses of the relationships between δ13C and growth or survival revealed a distinct pattern for the Mediterranean population, with low δ13C (and WUE) associated with the lowest growth potential and reduced survival. There were significant negative correlations between δ13C and height or survival in the Atlantic group. Variation in polycyclism was correlated with annual precipitation at the place of origin. Some Atlantic populations maintained a high growth potential while experiencing moderate water stress. A detailed knowledge of the relationships between growth, survival and δ 13C in contrasting environments will enhance our ability to select populations for forestry or conservation. © 2008 Heron Publishing.

TI  - Life cycle strategies of copepods in coastal upwelling zones
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
SP  - 313-326
AB  - Life cycles of copepods of coastal upwelling zones are of the multigenerational type-as many as 10 or more generations may be produced each year, depending upon water temperature, food concentration and length of the upwelling season. Abundant food resources and moderate temperature convey advantages to those copepods living in coastal upwelling zones, however, there is a clear disadvantage in that coastal upwelling zones are highly advective environments. Typically, water circulation patterns are such that surface waters are carried offshore, deeper waters carried onshore and most of the water column over the continental shelf is moving equatorward. The challenge to copepod species that inhabit upwelling systems is Life cycle closure-how do eggs, nauplii, juveniles and adults avoid being swept out of these ecosystems in the face of persistent transport out of the system? In this review, I first list the species which dominate coastal upwelling ecosystems then discuss three variations on the multigenerational life cycle scheme that are observed in upwelling systems. The latter part of the review is devoted to discussion of how individuals are retained in the productive continental shelf waters within coastal upwelling ecosystems. The suggestion is made that the only copepod species that successfully achieve life cycle closure in such systems are those that are preadapted to upwelling circulation patterns. Our quantitative understanding of the relative importance of physical factors (such as advection) and biological factors (birth, growth, and mortality) on life cycle strategies and population dynamics is quite rudimentary. It would help our understanding if there were more field studies and more computer modeling studies that focused on seasonal cycles of abundance, development times and vertical distribution of life cycle stages, and measurements of water circulation patterns.

Salmon (0+ to 1 year old) failed to adapt to seawater from December to March (austral summer) when seawater temperatures were higher than 16 °C. In freshwater-sampled salmon, smoltification coincided with high gill Na+-K+-ATPase activities and plasma cortisol levels (35 ng/ml) and low plasma chloride levels ( &lt; 120 mmol/l). Seawater survival was highly correlated with the 24-h-seawater-challenge samples of plasma cortisol and ionic levels which provide the best indicators for successful seawater adaptation. © 1992.

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-25
AB  - Haemocytes comprise a major component of the non-specific defence mechanismsin marine bivalves. Induction of stress protein (SP) synthesis and accumulation of SPs was studied in vitro to define the metabolic response of oyster (C. virginica) haemocytes to acute temperature changes. An acute cold shock to near freezing had no significant effect on protein synthesis. However, a comparable heat shock of 20-28° C above the acclimation temperature of 20° C provoked a robust increase in synthesis of several SPs, especially those of about 70 (SP70), 37, 34 and 32 kDa. This response persisted for at least 24 h, during which time both isoforms of SP70-like immunoreactivity accumulated. Concomitantly, there was a decrease in the synthesis, but not in the level, of an actin-like protein of about 45 kDa. The extent of SP synthesis induction also was directly dependent on the duration of the preceding hyperthermia. Extending the duration of heat shock necessitated a longer recovery period, during which time amino acid incorporation returned towards or beyond the initial control values and cell viability was retained. After a severe heat shock at 46° C for 1 h, the predominant protein made for several days was SP70, which is known to be essential for stress tolerance in other biological systems. The results suggest that oyster haemocytes are remarkably resilient, and that SPs may contribute to their ability to resist or repair heat-evoked damage. This molecular adaptability could permit them to maintain immune surveillance during or immediately following serious threats to survival of these sessile ectotherms. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - Characteristics and adaptability of iron- and sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms used for the recovery of metals from minerals and their concentrates
VL  - 4
AB  - Microorganisms are used in large-scale heap or tank aeration processes for the commercial extraction of a variety of metals from their ores or concentrates. These include copper, cobalt, gold and, in the past, uranium. The metal solubilization processes are considered to be largely chemical with the microorganisms providing the chemicals and the space (exopolysaccharide layer) where the mineral dissolution reactions occur. Temperatures at which these processes are carried out can vary from ambient to 80°C and the types of organisms present depends to a large extent on the process temperature used. Irrespective of the operation temperature, biomining microbes have several characteristics in common. One shared characteristic is their ability to produce the ferric iron and sulfuric acid required to degrade the mineral and facilitate metal recovery. Other characteristics are their ability to grow autotrophically, their acid-tolerance and their inherent metal resistance or ability to acquire metal resistance. Although the microorganisms that drive the process have the above properties in common, biomining microbes usually occur in consortia in which cross-feeding may occur such that a combination of microbes including some with heterotrophic tendencies may contribute to the efficiency of the process. The remarkable adaptability of these organisms is assisted by several of the processes being continuous-flow systems that enable the continual selection of microorganisms that are more efficient at mineral degradation. Adaptability is also assisted by the processes being open and non-sterile thereby permitting new organisms to enter. This openness allows for the possibility of new genes that improve cell fitness to be selected from the horizontal gene pool. Characteristics that biomining microorganisms have in common and examples of their remarkable adaptability are described. © 2005 Rawlings; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - The adaptability of embryos and larvae of Tridentiger trigonocephalus at the Yangtze River estuary to ecological factors
VL  - 29
IS  - 10
SP  - 5185-5194
AB  - Tridentiger trigonocephalus widely distributed at the Yangtze River estuary with abundant population. Young T. trigonocephalus is an important prey for many aquatic animal species at the Yangtze River estuary. However, studies of effects of ecological factors on the early life stages of T. trigonocephalus are scarce. Because of pollution and large scale constructions, the environmental conditions of the Yangtze River estuary have been changing recently. It is necessary to understand the effects of environmental changes on the early life stages of fishes in the estuarine area. In this study, the ecological adaptability of embryos and larvae of T. trigonocephalus were investigated. The experimental results showed that the fertility rate and hatching rate reduced with the increase of water temperature. Temperature ranging from 17°C to 21°C is an optimal water temperature for the development of the embryos. The model of effective accumulative temperature for the embryonic development is N = 3128.3 / (T -4.36) , and the range of temperature coefficient Q10 was from 1.33 to 2.84. The larva development speeded up, but the survival rate reduced with the increase of temperature. The embryonic development speeded up, but the hatching rate reduced when the photoperiod was increased. Moreover, the larval development also speeded up with the increase of photoperiod. The embryonic development speeded up and the hatching rate rose with the increase of pH value. The larva development also speeded up and the abnormality rate rose with the increase of pH value, e. g. , the activity ability of high pH value groups (pH 7.5, pH 8.5 and pH 9.5) was better than that of low pH value groups (pH 4.5, pH 5.5 and pH 6.5). In conclusion, the optimal ecological factors for the early life development of T. trigonocephalus were 17°C to 21°C of water temperatures, over 12-hour of daily photoperiod, and 7.5 to 9.5 of pH values. It may be inferred that the early life development and the population dynamics of T. trigonocephalus may be influenced by the environmental alteration at the Yangtze River estuary.

Pre-reproductive period, longevity, fecundity, age-specific survival rate and age-specific fecundity were calculated. From these data, the intrinsic rate of natural increase, net reproductive rate and mean generation time were estimated. Temperature at which the intrinsic rate of natural increase became maximum was near 27°C for Toxoptera citricidus and Aphis citricola, but for Aphis gossypii, this was near 22°C. From the curve of the intrinsic rate of natural increase, these species were compared with other aphid species and their adaptability to temperature was discussed. © 1982, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

SP  - 110-119
AB  - The present study examined the morphological and physiological effects of amorphous diatomaceous earth against the stored product pests Sitophilus granarius and Tenebrio molitor. Diatomaceous earth was toxic against adults of S. granarius and T. molitor. Treatment of wheat with Dryacide®, Fossil Shield®, and Silico-Sec® reduced the survival of S. granarius, at dosages of 1 g and 2 g/kg, at corn moisture of 13-14%, r.h. of 70 ± 2% and temperatures of 25°C. However, highest adult mortality of 98% was only observed with the high dosage of Fossil Shield® after two weeks. Diatomaceous earth's did not completely prevent hatching of the next generation. After one-day contact to diatomaceous earth, the individuals of S. granarius had a significant lost on weight and reduced their water content respectively. Consequently, the silica dusts dehydrated insects. Comparing scanning electronic microscopic examinations of treated and untreated T. molitor and S. molitor showed that dusts were adhered to the hole integument, but stigmata were not blocked. After application of Fossil Shield® at the cuticle of adults. T. molitor no wax layer was detectble. This leads to the conclusion that the effect of the particle is sorptive. Consequently, the primary action of diatomaceous earth is to break the water barrier of the cuticle (the wax layer) with following dehydration of the insect.

AB  - Cobia Rachycentron canadum is a marine finfish species with emerging global potential for mariculture. Positive culture attributes include capacity for natural and induced tank spawning, growth rates in excess of 6 kg/year, high disease resistance, high survival rates (post-larviculture stage) in tanks and net pens, adaptability to commercially available extruded diets, and high-quality fillets suitable for the sashimi as well as white tablecloth restaurant markets. Nonetheless, cobia production faces several bottlenecks limiting industrial expansion including limitations in fingerling production per unit volume. This paper will provide an overview of production limitations, and focus on recent spawning and larviculture research results and ongoing research initiatives. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In order to unravel the physiological, endocrine, and behavioral differences between gregarious and solitarious forms of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.) (Orthoptera, Acrididae), a constant supply of rather large numbers of solitary individuals has to be guaranteed. This represents a bottleneck, mainly because of the intensity of the labor involved and limited laboratory accommodation. The method we describe here substantially reduces the space and manpower needed. The survival rate we obtained in the solitarised population was relatively high, reaching about 55%. The optimal rearing temperature proved to be 32-36degreesC. Cabbage leaves and oat flakes sufficed for feeding all year round. Special racks have been designed that enable high density stacking and easy handling. The solitarisation process was monitored over ten consecutive generations. Changes in morphometrics, eye stripes, color, and behavior were recorded, of which only morphometrics, temperature related development, and mortality are discussed. A shift towards the solitarious phase was recorded, with clear differences between gregarious, 1st generation and 7th to 10th generation solitarious locusts.

TI  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates are essential for maintenance of redox state in the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 during low temperature adaptation
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 59-66
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are highly reduced bacterial storage compounds that increase fitness in changing environments. We have previously shown that phaRBAC genes from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 are located in a genomic island containing other genes probably related with its adaptability to cold environments. In this paper, Pseudomonas sp. 14-3 and its PHA synthase-minus mutant (phaC) were used to asses the effect of PHA accumulation on the adaptability to cold conditions. The phaC mutant was unable to grow at 10°C and was more susceptible to freezing than its parent strain. PHA was necessary for the development of the oxidative stress response induced by cold treatment. Addition of reduced compounds cystine and gluthathione suppressed the cold sensitive phenotype of the phaC mutant. Cold shock produced very rapid degradation of PHA in the wild type strain. The NADH/NAD ratio and NADPH content, estimated by diamide sensitivity, decreased strongly in the mutant after cold shock while only minor changes were observed in the wild type. Accordingly, the level of lipid peroxidation in the mutant strain was 25-fold higher after temperature downshift. We propose that PHA metabolism modulates the availability of reducing equivalents, contributing to alleviate the oxidative stress produced by low temperature. © 2008 Springer.

AB  - The spawning period of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) was greatly extended by the manipulation of water temperature. Adult bass that had been removed from natural populations before spawning and maintained in creek water at ambient temperatures (9.5-19.5ºC), spawned within 1.5 to 11 days after being stocked directly into ponds with higher ambient temperature (average 23ºC). Spawning occurred in groups of fish stocked from 10 June to 6 September - a significant extension of the average spawning season for northern populations. Upward temperature shock to stocked fish averaged 7 Celsius degrees. Fecundity, percentage fertilization, and percentage hatch were unaffected by the holding and stocking procedures. Some male and female bass spawned more than once under the thermal regime employed. Despite their origin from lake populations, stocked bass readily spawned in small ponds, demonstrating both the importance of temperature increases in inducing spawning and the adaptability of individual bass to new environments. Temperature-controlled spawning provides a means of scheduling bass reproduction in relation to not only favorable weather conditions but also the demand for young bass and the efficient use of manpower and facilities. The concentration of spawning into short periods can also reduce the potential for cannibalism among bass fry by reducing age-related differences in size. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the United States interest in Tocqueville has never been higher. He is cited and invoked at all levels of political and intellectual life. However, the focus of interest has changed. During the generation after 1945, the existence of the Cold War encouraged the use of his writings to stress the exceptionality of American society and history. During the last two decades attention has turned to two other aspects of Tocqueville's thought. His writings on race and gender relations in America have inspired prolonged debate over the applicability of his idea of "equality of conditions" as the point of departure for understanding America. But, above all, Tocqueville's ideas on association and civil society have inspired a new empirical dimension of political science, and a renewed emphasis on the role of spiritual values in the survival of democracy. © 2001 Presses de la Fondation nationale des sciences politiques.

TI  - Characterization of a novel epigenetic effect of ionizing radiation: The death-inducing effect
VL  - 63
IS  - 2
SP  - 324-328
AB  - The detrimental effects associated with exposure to ionizing radiation have long been thought to result from the direct targeting of the nucleus leading to DNA damage; however, the emergence of concepts such as radiation-induced genomic instability and bystander effects have challenged this dogma. After cellular exposure to ionizing radiation, we have isolated a number of clones of Chinese hamster-human hybrid GM10115 cells that demonstrate genomic instability as measured by chromosomal destabilization. These clones show dynamic and persistent generation of chromosomal rearrangements multiple generations after the original insult. We hypothesize that these unstable clones maintain this delayed instability phenotype by secreting factors into the culture medium. To test this hypothesis we transferred filtered medium from unstable cells to unirradiated GM10115 cells. No GM10115 cells were able to survive this medium. This phenomenon by which GM10115 cells die when cultured in medium from chromosomally unstable GM10115 clones is the death-inducing effect. Medium transfer experiments indicate that a factor or factors is/are secreted by unstable cells within 8 h of growth in fresh medium and result in cell killing within 24 h. These factors are stable at ambient temperature but do not survive heating or freezing, and are biologically active when diluted with fresh medium. We present the initial description and characterization of the death-inducing effect. This novel epigenetic effect of radiation has implications for radiation risk assessment and for health risks associated with radiation exposure.

VL  - 33

SP  - 801-809
AB  - The tolerance to temperature and salinity of a Calanoida copepod: Drepanopus bispinosus from the Burton Lake in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, was tested in each season. The results obtained show that the copepod has a marked physiological property of tolerance to low temperature and high salinity, and this property could be strengthened after winter. The response to different temperature and salinity of the copepod evidently expressed the tardy characteristics contrasted with seasons. This means that for a long term in early winter (lower temperature and higher salinity) the animal still has higher tolerance to lower salinity and higher temperature; and it is opposite in early summer. These physiological features are possibly caused by natural acclimatization in the lake. The experimental data were processed and plotted by computer. The correlation of animal's survival rate with the changes of temperature and salinity presented an approximately smooth surface of a three-degree elliptic sphere. © 1990.

TI  - Adapting to climate change: Is there scope for ecological management in the face of a global threat?
VL  - 42
IS  - 5
SP  - 784-794
AB  - 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability. 2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature. 3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change. 4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change. © 2005 British Ecological Society.

AB  - In this paper, the genetic algorithms were used to realize optimization of the chemical vapor infiltration (CVI) process for manufacturing carbon-carbon composites for the first time. The density homogeneity, bulk density and infiltration time were selected as the optimizing objectives, and the density homogeneity was taken as the main optimizing objective. By combining selection, crossover and mutation operator of genetic algorithms with computer simulation technology, the CVI process parameters including deposition temperature and concentration of reacting gases had been optimized. After 30 generation evolutions, the fitness values were converged, and the optimized results were obtained. So, this paper has provided an effective optimization method for CVI process, which can solve the problem of difficulty of establishing a model for the process.

VL  - 200
IS  - 1
SP  - 33-53
AB  - Utilizing the potential and untapped productivity of the sea through the development of stock enhancement technology has a long history in Japan. In 1997, of the 88 species of seed produced in Japan by 284 facilities, 73 species were released. The total numbers of finfish seeds produced and released were 97 million from 36 species, and 71 million from 30 species, respectively. Over 10 million seed were produced for each of three finfish species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and red sea bream (Pagrus major), which have been developed throughout Japan, and black sea bream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli), which has been developed only in the Seto Inland Sea region and the Japan Sea region. Steady progress made by stock enhancement programs, based on the release of hatchery-raised juveniles, has highlighted the importance of physiological, morphological, and ecological characteristics of the hatchery-raised juveniles in the effectiveness of the release operations. Fish health (or physiological wellness) and fish quality (or ecological robustness, described in terms of behavior and feeding activity) determine the ability of hatchery-raised juveniles to adapt to natural conditions in released environments. The releasing time, which is dependent upon the spawning time, is another important factor affecting the recovery rate of released hatchery-raised seed. Technological development of broodstock management is in induced spawning techniques, including manipulating temperature and photoperiod. Technological development of seed production in Japan has shifted its focus from quantity to quality, since health and adaptability of hatchery-raised seed are the most important factors determining the recovery rate. As a result, the focus of development of stock enhancement technology for the Japanese flounder and red sea bream is on raising the quality of health and the adaptability of the seeds.

VL  - 32
IS  - 6
SP  - 722-731
AB  - 1. Most temperate insects undergo diapause at a specific developmental stage to overcome severe winters. The bruchine beetle Bruchidius dorsalis in a warmer region in Japan, however, has diverse over-wintering stages - non-diapausing larvae, diapausing larvae, and diapausing adults, whereas in a cooler region, it over-winters only as the final instar larva or adult in diapause. 2. The geographical pattern of over-wintering stages in 12 populations was investigated over a wide range along the mainland of Japan. It revealed that a distinct geographical pattern of over-wintering stages exists in relation to temperature conditions. In regions with warmer climates, the proportion of non-diapausing larvae increased and B. dorsalis had a more complex over-wintering stage structure. 3. Life cycles were also compared between two areas of Japan by field experiments. In the cooler area, the first generation over-wintered in the diapausing larval or adult stage. Conversely, in the warmer area, diapause was induced later and some of the first-generation adults produced second-generation offspring before over-wintering. 4. Based on the geographical cline of climates and the differences in cold hardiness among stages, we can demonstrate that the over-wintering stage variation among and within populations results from an adaptive timing of diapause induction in each region, because the late larval or adult diapauses protect pupae or eggs - which unlike other stages are not cold hardy - from being produced late in the season. © 2007 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Under field condition with 16∼18°C water temperature, single-factor acute toxicity test was used to study the toxicity effects of water pH, salinity and carbonate-alkalinity on abnormal tadpole (R. chensinensis). The results showed that when the water salinity was 0.18 g·L-1, carbonate-alkalinity was 1.41 mmol·L-1, and water pH was 4.3∼9.7, the survival rate of abnormal tadpole within 96 hours was not affected. The upper limit of LC50 for the pH within 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours was 10.33, 10.18, 10.08 and 10.02, and the prescribed minimum was 3.92, 4.07, 4.11 and 4.16, respectively. The upper limit of LC0 was 9.95, 9.80, 9.70 and 9.70, and the prescribed minimum was 4.23, 4.45, 4.30 and 4.30, and that of LC100 was 10.70, 10.55, 10.45 and 10.33, and the prescribed minimum was 3.55, 3.70, 3.92 and 4.03, respectively. The survival rate of abnormal tadpole within 96 hours was not affected in the water salinity between 2.0∼3.0 g·L-1. When water pH was 7.0∼8.5 and carbonate-alkalinity was 1.41 mmol·L-1, the LC50 of the salinity within 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours was 8.21, 7.25, 5.17 and 3.70 g·L-1, the LC0 was 7.14, 6.00, 2.67 and 2.20 g·L-1, and the LC100 was 9.98, 9.00, 7.67 and 5.20 g·L-1, respectively, while the SC was 1.70 g·L-1. Under the same water pH and when the water salinity was 0.18 g·L-1, the LC50 of carbonate-alkalinity within 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours was 14.36, 11.83, 10.35, and 7.68 mmol·L-1, the LC0 was 8.76, 8.51, 4.65 and 3.88 mmol·L-1, and the LC100 was 19.96, 15.14, 16.05 and 11.48 mmol·L-1, respectively, while the SC was 1.70 mmol·L-1. The survival rate of abnormal tadpole (R. chensinensis) was decreased with increasing water pH, salinity and carbonate-alkalinity. The optimum water salinity and carbonate-alkalinity to the survival and the growth of abnormal tadpole (R. chensinensis) were below 2.0 g·L-1 and 3.0 mmol·L-1, respectively, and water pH was between 6.0 and 9.0.

TI  - SPECIAL DROUGHT OPERATIONS OF OROVILLE RESERVOIR
SP  - 859-863
AB  - Special operations of Oroville Reservoir during the 1976-77 California drought resulted in good spawning conditions in the Feather River for migrating king salmon. Special cold water releases from Oroville Reservoir were made in the fall of 1977 to establish a maximum temperature of 57 degree F (14 degree C) in portions of the Feather River. However, as a result of the special operations, about 52,000 was lost in potential hydroelectric power generation revenues. This loss was offset by a record 28,700,000 steelhead and salmon eggs which were collected at the Feather River Fish Hatchery. An additional measure of success for the special operations was seen in 1981 when an estimated 53,200 king salmon returned to spawn in the Feather River. These four year old fish were offspring of salmon that had spawned during the drought. It is estimated that for every dollar lost in hydroelectric power generation, over one hundred dollars was returned in the salmon fishing industry.

AB  - In this paper the screw extrusion principle is actually used on fused deposition RP systems. With the help of hydrokinetics principle, experiment data and design experiences, a screw extruder will be designed. Due to characteristics of fused deposition process, integrated influence of maximum press, press sensitivity and consistency, temperature adaptability, system reliability and cost, and etc. must be thought over in design process. A RP system with the screw extruder has been built, and its productivity increases 3~5 times higher than else RP systems. Moreover, parts built on it have smooth surface and accurate dimensions. This system costs less than 20000US. Maybe it is the most inexpensive RP system all over the world.

AB  - Smoltification-related developmental events (smolting, seawater adaptability and downstream migratory behaviour) were investigated in growth-accelerated underyearling broodstock masu salmon produced by using different schedules of shifting from warm water (12-13°C) to cooler water (5-6°C) in January or February. The accelerated growth led to a close relationship between the occurrence of smolting, the development of seawater adaptability, and the initiation of downstream migratory behaviour, thus suggesting the possibility of a successful performance of the growth-accelerated underyearling broodstock masu salmon upon release. © 1989.

AB  - We have developed methods for the laboratory culture of chaetognaths over a number of generations, and have documented growth and reproduction of the benthic arrowworm Paraspadella gotoi cultivated with different foods and temperatures. We classified growing P. gotoi into four stages based on predatory ability: non-feeding, first feeding, second feeding, and late stages. The first feeding stage was fed nauplii of Tigriopus japonicus; the second feeding stage was fed copepodites of T. japonicus or newly hatched Artemia salina nauplii. The duration of each of these stages was about 10 days at 24 degrees C. The late-stage individuals preferred adult T. japonicus. The growth rate at 24 degrees C was higher than at 17 degrees C. Development from the first feeding stage to mature individuals at first egg-laying took about 50 days at 24 degrees C and about 70 days at 17 degrees C. Survival also strongly depended on temperature being higher at 17 degrees C than 24 degrees C. At 17 degrees C, P. gotoi laid eggs four times at about 10-days intervals, and the estimated life span was 4-5 months.

TI  - Seawater adaptability in three different river stocks of Baltic salmon (Salmo salar L.) during smolting
VL  - 52
IS  - 3
SP  - 219-229
AB  - Two-summer-old Baltic salmon (Salmo salar) from three different stocks in northern Sweden held at Heden, Norrfors and Bergeforsen hatcheries were subjected to five successive seawater challenge tests each from 2 May until 5 July 1983. A pronounced seasonal pattern of plasma sodium levels was observed in sexually immature fish at Norrfors but not at the other two hatcheries. Response surface analysis of sodium data from the Norrfors fish predicted minimum plasma sodium concentration (i.e., maximum seawater adaptation) for transfer of 14.8-cm fish to sea water on 4 June. Precocious male parr at Norrfors had significantly higher plasma sodium concentrations after seawater challenge than did sexually immature fish in all tests. At the time of the fifth seawater challenge test in early July, a number of males at Bergeforsen and Norrfors were becoming sexually mature again and they suffered heavy mortality in sea water. The inhibitory effect of low temperature on testis regression in precocious male parr and its effect on their ability to smoltify is described. It is suggested that the seasonal variation in ambient water temperature near the time of the smolt-run might affect the proportion of precocious males which migrate from northern rivers. We view the seasonal pattern of seawater adaptability in juvenile Baltic salmon as an indicator of the endogenous annual timing system involved in the control of smolting and conclude that it can assist in deciding when to release Baltic salmon smolts from hatcheries. © 1986.

TI  - The consequences of growth of a mutator strain of Escherichia coli as measured by loss of function among multiple gene targets and loss of fitness
VL  - 154
IS  - 3
SP  - 959-970
AB  - We have examined the composition of members of mutator populations of Escherichia coli by employing an extensive set of phenotypic screens that allow us to monitor die function of >700 genes, constituting similar to 15% of the genome. We looked at mismatch repair deficient cells after repeated cycles of sing le colony isolation on rich medium to generate lineages that are forced through severe bottlenecks, and compared the results to those for wild-type strains. The mutator lineages continued to accumulate mutations rapidly with each increasing cycle of colony isolation. By die end of the 40th cycle, after similar to 1000 generations, most of the lineages had reduced colony size, 4% had died out, 55% had auxotrophic requirements (increasing to 80% after 60 cycles), and 70% had defects in at least one sugar or catabolic pathway. In addition, 33% had a defect in cell motility, and 26% were either temperature-sensitive or cold-sensitive lethals. On the other hand, only 3% of die wild-type lineages had detectable mutations of any type after 40 cycles. By the 60th cycle, the typical mutator cell carried 4-5 inactive genes among the 15% of the genome being monitored, indicating that the average cell carried at least 24-30 inactivated genes distributed throughout the genome. Remarkably, 30% of the lineages had lost title ability to utilize xylose as a carbon source. DNA sequencing revealed that most of the Xyl(-) mutants had a frameshift in a run of eight G's (GGGGGGGG) in the xylB gene, either adding or deleting one -G-. Further analysis indicated that rendering E. coli deficient in mismatch repair unmasks hypermutable sites in certain genes or intergenic regions. Growth curves and competition tests on lineages that passed through 90 cycles of single colony isolation slowed that all lineages suffered reduced fitness. We discuss these results in terms of the value of mutators in cellular evolution.

TI  - Sequence and inactivation of the pss gene of Escherichia coli: Phosphatidylethanolamine may not be essential for cell viability
VL  - 266
IS  - 8
SP  - 5323-5332
AB  - Phosphatidylethanolamine is the only zwitterionic phospholipid in Escherichia coli and accounts for 70-80% of the total glycerophospholipids of this organism. To investigate the function of phosphatidylethanolamine in E. coli, we constructed an inactivated allele (pss93::kan) of the gene encoding the phosphatidylserine synthase which catalyzes the committed step to the synthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. Growth of this mutant was dependent on a plasmid-borne copy of the wild type gene. After curing the mutant of the wild type gene, growth stopped when the content of phosphatidylethanolamine reached 30% of the total phospholipid. Divalent metal ions at millimolar concentrations suppressed the growth phenotype of the mutant in the following order of efficiency: Ca2+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt; Sr2+. Although phosphatidylserine synthase activity was not detectable, phosphatidylethanolamine was still present at 0.007% of the total phospholipid after growth for many generations in rich medium containing 20 mM Mg2+. The remainder of the phospholipid was primarily phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin with no other unique phosphate-containing chloroform-soluble material present. The phospholipid to protein ratio and the fatty acid composition were very similar to the parental strain. The broad divalent metal ion auxotrophy brought about by the lack of phosphatidylethanolamine suggests a primarily structural role for this phospholipid in E. coli.

VL  - 290

SP  - 541-549
AB  - The oviposition rhythm of individual flies of Drosophila melanogaster from a population maintained in an aperiodic environment (with light, temperature, humidity, and other factors which could provide time cues, kept constant) for several hundred generations was assayed in constant light (LL), in light/dark (LD 12:12 hr) cycle, and in constant darkness (DD). More than 50% of the flies assayed exhibited rhythmicity in oviposition in all three light regimes. The results indicate that the phenomenon of egg laying is rhythmic in individual D. melanogaster females and is controlled by an endogenous time keeping mechanism. The persistence of the oviposition rhythm in a large proportion of individuals in the population after several hundred generations of rearing in a constant environment strengthens the view that possessing biological clocks may confer some intrinsic fitness advantage even to organisms living in aperiodic environments.

TI  - Influence of High Altitude on Lung Development and Function
SP  - 267-275
AB  - This chapter reviews the impact of hypoxia on lung growth and development in the fetus, as well as on the lungs of the adolescent and adultIt also comments briefly on the evidence for cellular alterations at altitude. Environmental stressors at altitude are cold and hypoxia, and the capacity of humans to thrive under such adverse conditions attests to their adaptability as a species. At high altitude, the low PIO2 is less effective, resulting in a slower decrease in both pulmonary artery pressure and flow, presumably due to continued vasoconstriction. This probably accounts for the higher prevalence of atrial septal defects reported in some high altitude residents and may contribute to the increased neonatal mortality rate. Infants residing at altitude during the growth phase appear to develop larger and heavier lungs with more alveoli than their lowland counterparts. These adaptive changes are primarily acquired during growth and development as they do not appear to be observed in adults who move to altitude. Thus it appears that prolonged exposure to the hypoxia of altitude results in accelerated lung growth towards values typical of normal adults living at sea level. An increased resistance to the pulmonary vasoconstriction that normally occurs in response to hypoxia appears to be another survival advantage of residents at altitude. Potentially important mediators that may be involved in these differing responses to hypoxia include nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and prostacyclin (PGI2). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..

AB  - A synthetic medium for Opercularia coarctata was developed that contains 20 amino acids, 10 vitamins, an 8‐component balanced salt solution, Fe2(SO4)3·(NH4)2SO4·24H2O, Tween 80, stigmasterol, a 7‐component nucleic acid mixture, phenol red as an indicator, and 2,500 U.S.P. units/ml penicillin to maintain sterility. This medium supported axenic survival for 96 hr. Multiple supplements of thioctic acid, niacin, niacinamide, inositol, PABA, oleic acid, and Fe(NO3)2·9H2O instead of Fe2(SO4)3·(NH4)2SO4·24H2O coverted the survival medium into a growth medium, which permitted 36–45 days continuous cultivation of populations in excess of 4 × 103 cells/3.0 ml final volume. Five generations were produced during the 48 hr logarithmic growth period. Serial transfers at 72 hr and during periods of greatest cell density produced a maximum of 8 generations 96 hr after initiation but the medium failed to sustain growth through more than 6 serial transfers. Extension of this investigation to formulating a minimal axenic medium is discussed. Copyright © 1974, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 16
IS  - 4
SP  - 303-308
AB  - The adaptability of five kinds of methods expressing the viscosity-temperature relationship to paving asphalt cement was examined. The measurement of viscosity was made on the four types of paving asphalt cement over the temperature range of 5°C to 200°C using the Sliding Plate Microviscometer and a Rotating Coaxial Cylinder Viscometer. The five methods designed to obtain some straight line relations, were applied to data, and the temperature range where a good approximation to a straight line holds was determined with each method. Deviations from the straight line were compared by means of ηc/ηa where ηa andηc are observed and calculated values and calculated values on the equation respectively. The results are summarized as follows. 1) In the expressions log η vs. t and log η vs. log T, a straight line relationship was obtained over the low temperature range from 5°C to 55°C, but over the temperatures ranging from 55°C to 200°C these plots showed a smooth curve for all kinds of asphalt cement. 2) In the plot of ln η vs. 1/T a straight line relationship was also obtained over the low temperature range from 5°C to 55°C. The fitness of this expression to a straight line was better than the two expressions mentioned above over the higher temperature range. 3) The methods of plotting loglog η vs. log T and log η vs. 1/T4 showed the most accurate straight line relationship over the widest temperature range from 5°C to 200°C for all kinds of asphalt cement. © 1973, The Japan Petroleum Institute.

VL  - 56
IS  - 2
SP  - 347-373
AB  - In winter, brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis demonstrated poor osmoregulatory ability. Salt-water (SW) transfer resulted in sharp increases in plasma osmolality and chloride levels, a decrease in white muscle water content and high mortality. A clear improvement of the hypo-osmoregulatory mechanism efficiency was observed in spring; by May or June, fish achieved full acclimation within 1 week of SW transfer. In early fall, the time needed to restore osmotic and ionic balance increased once again. A high level of stress was detected only in winter and fall, as indicated by plasma cortisol and glucose concentrations. Great improvement in osmotic and ionic regulation was observed when brook charr were transferred to 8 degrees C SW in February and April while impaired SW adaptability was recorded in individuals transferred to 2.5 degrees C SW in June and August. Temperature itself was more important than a thermal gradient between fresh and salt water. Stress indicators substantiate this temperature-dependent improvement of osmotic and ionic regulation in brook charr. The results support the hypothesis of a minor contribution of cortisol to hypo-osmotic regulation in brook charr, as the cortisol response always seemed to be associated with stress in the experiments.

SP  - 5706-5716
AB  - The current study examines the adaptability of flameless combustion to gas turbine engines. This mode of combustion has been used in industrial furnaces as a means of producing uniform combustion temperature with low emissions. Industrial applications use multiple staged burners, or heavy exterior recirculation lines unsuited for aero-engines. This study is to determine the viability of a flameless burner design for aero-engines. Variations of inlet temperature, pressure drop, and combustor geometry were tested to determine the limits of flameless combustion within constraints acceptable to current and future aircraft engines. Important aspects of flameless combustion include uniform temperature distribution, low emissions, and decoupling between heat transfer, fluid mechanisms, and acoustics. To determine these relationships, emissions of CO, NOx, O2, CO2, and UHC were taken. Multiple thermocouples at the combustor exit were placed to determine exit temperature uniformity, while a microphone was used to collect acoustical measurements. Data was taken starting at equivalence ratio of 0.7 and decreasing to lean-blow-out (LBO) to determine flammability limits using the flameless burner.

SP  - 21-31
AB  - Fall chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry were reared in fresh water and transferred to sea water at intervals in order to determine the optimum conditions for entry into sea water. The three factors in the experiment were temperature in fresh water (7 to 17°C), temperature in sea water (9.5 to 14.5°C) and time of transfer to sea water (April to June). Fry of 1.50 g and larger could survive and grow in sea water. There was a considerable delayed mortality in sea water associated with scale loss in fish which were reared in warm water. The optimum for regulation of plasma sodium concentrations occurred with transfer of 5.6-g fish from 13.8°C fresh water to 10.2°C sea water on 18 May. Maximal growth in sea water relative to that in fresh water occurred with transfer of 6-g fish from 9.7°C fresh water to 14.1°C sea water on 11 June. © 1985.

VL  - 60
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-19
AB  - The effects of light intensity and salinity on eggs and yolk sac larvae of summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus were examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Fertilized eggs (early gastrula stage), obtained by induced spawning of captive broodstock, were stocked (53 eggs/L) into forty-eight 5-L translucent containers under light intensities of 0 (constant dark), 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000 lx and at salinities of 26, 31, and 36 g/L. Temperature was 19°C and photoperiod was 12 h light:12 h dark. Light intensity and salinity produced significant (P < 0.05) additive effects on larval growth. At the stage when 97% of the yolk sac was absorbed (114–131 h postfertilization, hpf), at the first-feeding stage (129.5–135 hpf), and at yolk exhaustion (153.5–159 hpf), notochord lengths were generally maximal at low light intensity (500 lx) and high salinity (36 g/L) and minimal at high intensity (2, 000 lx) and low salinity (26 g/L). Yolk utilization efficiency declined significantly (P < 0.01) with increasing light intensity, presumably due to light-induced activity. Largest larvae were produced under low light intensity (500 lx) and high-salinity (36 g/L), conditions consistent with shelf waters where eggs and early larvae of summer flounder prevail in nature. High survival (85.1%) to yolk exhaustion under all light intensities and salinities reflects an adaptability for inshore movement during the pelagic larval phase. © by the American Fisheries Society 1998.

AB  - Laboratory experiment was conducted to examine sublethal effects of beta-cyfluthrin (Bulldock(R) 025 SC) on the sepia mutant of Drosophila melanogaster at a temperature of 25+/-0.5 degrees C, 50 +/- 5% relative humidity and a photoperiod of 16: 8 (light: dark) hours. Males and females were exposed separately to beta-cyfluthrin (one tenth of the calculated LC50 value) mixed in the diet for 24, 48 and 72 h. Fecundity, hatchability, pupation, adult emergence, larval, pupal and total developmental periods were evaluated in the F, generation after various cross combinations. A reduction in fecundity, egg hatching, number of larvae, pupae, adults and prolongation of larval, pupal and total developmental periods was observed. A significant reduction (p<0.05) in fecundity was observed only on the treated diet after treatment of both the sexes. Maximum effects were observed after 72 h treatment followed by 48 and 24 h. Males were found to be more susceptible to beta-cyfluthrin as compared to the females.

AB  - The effect of inbreeding on two reproductive traits (number of birth per clutch and percentage of sexually mature animals per clutch) on three consecutive generations of full sibs of edible snail raised under laboratory conditions (20-25degreesC temperature; 70-90% relative humidity) was studied. Inbreeding effect was negative for both traits. When F values increased from 0.25 to 0.50, percentages of sexually mature animals after 120 days from birth, decreased from 59 to 18% and the number of birth per clutch decreased from 94 to 53. Population size of at least 100 non related mating snail replaced after 10 generations to avoid inbreeding effect is recommended.

VL  - 48

AB  - Biological studies on Laricobius nigrinus Fender (Coleoptera: Derodontidae) were conducted in the laboratory to obtain basic information on this little known predator. Laricobius nigrinus is a candidate biological control agent of the hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand (Homoptera: Adelgidae), an exotic pest on eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carriere) and Carolina (T. caroliniana Engelmann) hemlocks in the eastern United States. It is univoltine and undergoes an aestival diapause. Post-aestivation activity period was 36.6 and 30.8 weeks for males and females, respectively. Adult activity and oviposition are well synchronized with the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae. Mean lifetime fecundity was 100.8 eggs over a mean duration of 13.2 weeks oviposition period. Within the temperature range (12-18 degreesC) studied, development was fastest at 18 degreesC. Mean development time from egg to adult was 88.8, 64.8 and 46.6 days at 12, 15 and 18 degreesC, respectively. Laricobius nigrinus has four larval instars. Mean larval consumption was 225.9 and 252.3 A. tsugae eggs at 12 and 18 degreesC, respectively. These findings provide essential data on the rate of development and feeding capacity of L. nigrinus at temperatures typical of ambient conditions during late winter/early spring in Virginia. Its rapid development at 18 degreesC indicates that it has potential as a biological control agent of A. tsugae because of its synchrony with the development of the over-wintering generation of A. tsugae in eastern United States.

VL  - 17

SP  - 919-923
AB  - Cerastoderma glaucum Bruguiere has a wide geographical distribution in Europe, from the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea. This cockle is found mainly in coastal embayments and lagoons on muddy, soft bottom. The different reproductive behavior of cockles is related to latitude. In Lesina Lagoon, cockles initiate gametogenesis several times per year; this has been confirmed in laboratory tests where cockles are provided ample Tahitian Isochrysis aff. galbana (clone T-ISO). In the laboratory, cockle biomass (density 400-800 g/m(2)) releases viable gametes all year in a relatively wide range of temperatures (9-24 degrees C). During 12 months of repeated spawning, cockles released a mean of 68,100 eggs/cockle, with an average of 1.13 spawning per week. Because of its high genetic variability, which accounts for its adaptability and ease of spreading in environments with striking changes of physical and chemical aquatic conditions, cockles may have an excellent potential for mariculture application. In addition cockles may play an important ecological role in reducing the particulate organic load of eutrophic lagoons and embayments with a wide range type of salinity and thermal characteristics.

AB  - The larvae of the North African winter breeders Broscus laevigatus and Orthomus atlanticus survive a temperature of 30° C and a relative atmospheric humidity of 75% only briefly. The first larval instar of O. atlanticus is particularly sensitive to dehydration. It does not live longer than the corresponding larval instar of the Central European species Pterostichus angustatus Dft. Examinations at a temperature of 20° C and a relative atmospheric humidity of 75% proved that the first larval instar of Br. laevigatus is well adapted to these conditions and on average remains alive for 121.7 hours, as against 19.6 hours at a temperature of 30° C. This is regarded as adaptability to the short periods of drought which still occur at the beginning of the rainy season. In their first stage the larvae of O. atlanticus die after as little as 4.5 hours. The two species develop at a low temperature which corresponds to the average winter temperature in the Cyrenaika (Libya, North Africa). Susceptibility to drought at high temperatures and the absence of the low temperatures they need for their development prevent Br. laevigatus and O. atlanticus from breeding during the North African summer. As the larvae of O. atlanticus in their first stage of development are susceptible to dehydration, reproduction in this species is mainly limited to the winter. Its different stages of development withstand high temperatures better than those of B. laevigatus. On account to the poor adaptability of its larval stages to high temperatures B. laevigatus is forced to propagate during the winter. Low temperatures (14° C) during the first larval instars accelerate the development of the third instar of the two species at a temperature of 20° C and reduce the mortality rate of O. atlanticus considerably. The accelerated development caused by low temperatures reflects in a somewhat lesser degree the larval diapause of the autumn breeders that live in the temperature zones. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.

SP  - 221-229
AB  - The article presents final results of a 6-year screening trial carried out in central Chile comparing the adaptability and growth rates of 38 woody legume trees or shrubs mainly originating in the Chaco savanna region of southern South America, and two non-legumes of western European origin, Quercus suber (cork oak)and European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Introductory plots, containing 28 individuals of each species, were established in the subhumid mediterranean climate, inner drylands (secano interior), of southcentral Chile (35 degrees 58'S 72 degrees 17'W, mean annual precipitation 695 mm, concentrated in the seven coldest months of the year). After 6 years, only three species showed excellent growth and survival (>86%) rates, and none of these was from the Chaco region: Acacia decurrens (Australia), Fraxinus excelsior (Europe), and Chamaecytisus proliferus subsp. palmensis (Tagasaste) from La Palma, Canary Islands. These latter two species were the fastest growing, yielding large quantities of edible and N-rich forage (4406+/-1650 and 223.0+/-137.4 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively). F. excelsior also showed high potential as a source of a high quality wood for turning or cabinetry. Unexpectedly, the principal cause of mortality among the 38 species tested was frost rather than drought or acid soils. Many species in the legume genera Anadenanthera, Caesalpinia, Enterolobium, Faidherbia, Gleditsia and Prosopis performed poorly. Results are discussed in the context of a long-term ecological rehabilitation project based on agroforestry development and innovation for the Chilean secano interior. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - As the Global Environmental Outlook 2000 issued by the United Nations Environmental Program has pointed out, the ongoing global warming may no longer be denied. Expansion of income inequality accelerated by economic globalization is expected to aggravate environmental disruption through two major processes: 1) environmental destruction such as deforestation and desertification due to struggle for survival by the havenots and 2) increased CO2 generation due to over-consumption of fossil fuel mostly by the haves. It should not be overlooked that some 800 million humans in developing countries are now starving while obesity and its related diseases due to over-sating prevail in many developed countries. Since no technological breakthrough is foreseeable to solve the environmental problems, behavioural changes already prescribed by traditional ethics should be re-considered. A modest example is proposed.

SP  - 477-483
AB  - Abstract Reproduction and population parameters of vegetable leafminer, Liriomyza sativae Blanchard were measured on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) at seven constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40°C). No eggs were found at 10°C and flies died after exposure to 40°C. The significantly highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), net reproductive rate (R0) and finite rate of increase (δ) of L. sativae were obtained at 25°C as 0.196, 52.452, and 1.216, respectively. The above-mentioned parameters decreased at 15°C and 35°C and this reduction at 35°C was strong. Doubling time (DT) varied significantly with temperature. The shortest doubling time was obtained at 25°C. Mean generation time (T) decreased significantly with increasing temperature between 15°C and 35°C. Percentage of immature ages in the stable age distribution was more than 95% at all temperatures. Female longevity was greater than male at all temperatures. Liriomyza sativae lived for a long time at 15°C, whereas at 35°C had lower survival rates. The effect of temperature on reproduction, especially the intrinsic rate of increase of L. sativae would be useful for predicting its long-term population fluctuation over several generations. © 2017 Wiley.

VL  - 38

AB  - A comparative analysis was carried out of reproductive mode, larval development pattern, and larval growth rate under identical conditions of three members of the Capitella capitata species complex: Capitella sp I from New York, US, Capitella sp M from shallow hydrothermal vents off Milos, Greece, and Capitella sp S from an intertidal flat on Sylt, Germany. In addition, three populations from salmon farms, Capitella K (Kilmelford, Scotland), Capitella Cm and Capitella Ct (Cranford, Ireland), are described for the first time. Three development patterns were observed: planktotrophic (Capitella K and Ct populations), lecithotrophic (Capitella spp I, M and Cm populations), and direct development (Capitella sp S). Experiments with planktotrophic larvae from the Capitella K population at different temperatures, in the presence and absence of light and with several kinds of substrate were not successful in inducing settlement, although differences in the duration of larval survival were observed. Overall, major differences in reproductive modes and larval development patterns were observed among representatives of different species and populations reared under identical culture conditions. In contrast, such modes and patterns are consistent across generations. Whereas larval type and developmental mode appear to be determined largely by genetic factors, environmental conditions have an important influence on the timing of key developmental processes, such as settling and growth. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 226
IS  - 3
SP  - 351-368
AB  - A large colony of Euscorpius flavicaudis was studied at Sheerness Docks, Isle of Sheppey, Kent. It was probably established in the late nineteenth century. The scorpions inhabit cracks in the dockyard perimeter wall where the mortar pointing has crumbled away. They are nocturnal, “sit‐and‐wait”, generalist predators. They are extremely sedentary: females leave their cracks fewer than 10 times per year; males are more active as they become vagrant prior to the mating season, which occurs in summer. Marked adults were resighted at intervals of over a year and the distance scorpions moved between resightings was not proportional to the interval. The number of scorpions seen per night was influenced by temperature, amount of rainfall and phase of the moon. In winter, the scorpions retreated far into the wall and, by doing so, reduced the risk of suffering mortality due to cold. During this time, they were seldom active. In general, this species does not behave in any way that can be correlated with living in a temperate rather than a desert area. This illustrates the extreme adaptability of scorpions. 1992 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - The parasitic chalcid, Coccobius azumai Tachikawa, was introduced from Japan at the end of 1980's. The parasitoid was an important biological agent used to control the pine armored scale, Hemiberlesia pitysophila Takagi in southern China. The parameters of supercooling point (SCP) , mortality exposed to designated low temperature, and median lethal sum of low temperature (LST50 ) of the chalcid adults collected from different seasons, were measured and compared in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China in 2007 and 2008. Mean SCP value for female adults collected in spring, summer, fall and winter was - 13. 7559 - 11. 9700 - 12. 7936 and - 13.6000 °C, respectively, indicating females collected in spring and winter had a significantly lower SCP value than female adults collected in summer. Mean SCP value for male adults collected in spring was -15.3917 °C, which is significantly lower than that for male adults collected in summer ( - 13. 8400 °C ) and autumn ( - 13. 2143 °C ). For adults collected in spring and summer, mean SCP value for females were considerably lower than those for males. However, this value was almost equal for both males and females collected irf fall. When exposed to different constant temperatures, no female adults survived under - 15 °C. Mortality ( under 0 °C ) was clearly lower for females collected in spring than females collected in summer. However, under -5 and -10 °C females collected in spring had lower mortality than that in summer and fall. The relationships between the sum of exposed low temperature and mortality of female adults collected in each season fits very well to a revised logistic model ( equation 1). Significant differences were observed between LST50s estimated by this model for female adults from different seasons (df= 2,33, F=30. 45, P &lt;0.01). Mean LST50 for the spring female adults was significantly lower than those for the summer and fall female adults. The SCP and LST50 for female adults decreased as the seasonal extreme low air temperature drops off and as the seasonal extreme difference in air temperature increases. The LST50 for the female adults also decreased with drop of SCP. These results suggested that, in terms of cold tolerance, C. azumai adults have obvious adaptability to seasonal variation of air temperature. One important strategy for the wasp to increase cold tolerance is to lower the SCP, which may be the results of its exposure to lower extreme low air temperature and high extreme difference in air temperature in fall.

AB  - The pine armored scale, Hemiberlesia pitysophila Takagi is a dangerous pine forest pest which mainly attacks needle leaves, cones and twigs of various evergreen pines, and has led to great damage in south China since early 1980s. The parameters of supercooling point (SCP), mortality exposed to designated low temperature (ME), discriminating temperature (DT) and median lethal sum of low temperature (LST50) of the pest collected in different seasons in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China from 2007 to 2008 were measured and compared. The results showed that individual SCP of this pest fluctuated from-22.4 °C to-3.1 °C. Among all the developmental stages of the pest in every season, winter female adults had the lowest SCP with the mean value of - 14. 83 °C, which was significantly lower than those of summer female adults, winter newly hatched nymph and 1st instar nymph (P &lt; 0. 01). However, SCPs of other developmental stages in winter and summer all showed no markedly differences (P &gt; 0. 05). Experiments exposed to low temperature indicated that the parameters of ME, DT and LST50 of 1st instar nymph, 2nd instar nymph before sex differentiation, 2nd instar male nymph after sex differentiation, female adults and population were all obviously lower in winter than in summer. A linear correlative analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between seasonal mean air temperature and LST50s of 1st instar nymph, 2 nd instar male nymph after sex differentiation and the pest population (R &gt; R0.05 =0.950, n-2 =2), but no significant correlations between SCPs and LST50s in each developmental stage (R&lt;R0.05 =0.950, n-2 =2). Therefore, it is concluded that the cold tolerance of H. pitysophila population seems to peak in winter and drop in summer. The adaptability to low air temperature in winter may be independent of SCP, but is nearly correlative with seasonal mean air temperature.

AB  - The response to three different climate change policies is measured within a general equilibrium model of world output, technological change, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-driven changes in productivity. The proposed policies, including an approximation to the Kyoto protocol, are shown to differ greatly in how they mitigate climate change, support economic growth, and allocate rents across generations. Benefits of alternative policies, relative to the status quo, do not necessarily accrue to the generations that bear the costs. The results also show that the chosen rent distribution rule has a profound effect on policy evaluation. In particular, policies which allocate rents on a per-capita basis are shown to be systematically welfare-preferred to situations where emissions rights are grandfathered to emitting firms. This implies that both the optimal level of emissions and the welfare cost of reaching a given target of emissions or atmospheric concentration would be lower under a per-capita allocation of emissions permits or carbon tax revenues. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 1. At temperature levels from 10 to 25°C animals from resting eggs produce subitaneous eggs independent on temperature. In contrast animals from subitaneous eggs produce subitaneous eggs dependent on temperature. At a high rate subitaneous eggs are only formed at temperature levels above 20°C. 2. Below 10°C no development occurs in the juveniles. At temperatures of 30/22°C (24.7°C) the first subitaneous eggs are formed after 6-9 days, at 14/9°C (10.7°C) they are formed after 34 days. At different temperature levels the developmental rate of the young is from 10.5 to 42 days. One generation extends over 16.5 (30/22°C) to 75 days (14/9°C). The average egg production is 10-20 subitaneous eggs or 30-60 resting eggs. The maximum egg production of one individual is 50 subitaneous eggs or 84 resting eggs. 50% of the animals have just formed resting eggs, before the juveniles are hatched. Resting eggs in the first egg-batch are formed 6-20 days later than subitaneous eggs. The duration of life is between 65 (30/22°C) and 140 days (19/13°C). 3. Young worms in resting eggs have a dormance period of at least 15-30 days. At room temperatures (20°C) no juvenile in resting eggs hatches from water. By combining room and refrigerator (3.5°C) temperatures the hatching rate increases to a maximum of 85%. To reach a hatching rate of 50-65% the influence of low temperatures must be at least 30 days. At room temperatures 60% of the young in resting eggs hatch from mud covered with water. Combining high and low temperatures the hatching success is between 67 and 81%, where the highest percentage of the young may hatch at room temperature. Up to 90 days low temperatures cause a maximum hatching rate of 79%. It decreases to approximately 30% after 180 days. At high temperatures resting eggs preserved in 100% moist mud, survive for two months. By adding a period of low temperatures the hatching rate increases to a maximum of 52%. Low temperatures are survived for more than 6 months. Up to 30 days preservation at 3.5°C causes a maximum hatching rate of 61%, up to 12o days it decreases to 30%. At room temperature the young in resting eggs are not resistant against air-dried mud (30-40% rel. air moisture). Combining high and low temperatures air-dried mud is endured 1 month (hatching rate 5-14%). Preservation of 30-120 days at 3.5°C and 70% rel. air moisture result in a hatching rate of 43-61%. li]4. In the open air in Middle-Europe there occur 5-6 generations of M. ehrenbergii per life-cycle. The first generation hatches from resting eggs in May, where the production of subitaneous eggs is independent on temperature. All other generations up to October hatch from subitaneous eggs. The egg-production of those worms is dependent on environmental factors. In summer subitaneous egg production prevails, in autumn resting egg production. The abundance during the life-cycle is dependent on the number of animals which produce subitaneous eggs. Resting eggs are predestinated to endure periods of dryness and cold. The life-cycles of the species M. lingua and M. productum are different from those of M. ehrenbergii in length and in the number of generations. In both species 7 generations occur over 8 to 8.5 respectively 5.5 months. M. nigrirostrum only forms resting eggs. The life-cycle consists of one generation from February/March to May/June. © 1977 Dr. W. Junk b.v. Publishers.

VL  - 54

SP  - 35-45
AB  - The outdoor establishment of non-native biocontrol agents released for inundative control of glasshouse pests is determined primarily by two factors: ecophysiological compatibility with local climate, particularly winter cold tolerance, and ability to locate and utilise wild prey. Observations on the number and diversity of acceptable wild prey as part of an assessment of establishment potential therefore overlap with more focused studies to determine host range. This study investigated two aspects of the interactions between biocontrol agents and non-target prey that are rarely considered in tests for establishment or host range: the role of different host plant-prey associations in modifying the development and reproduction of biocontrol agents, and the longer term sustainability of such relationships beyond the single generation observed in most laboratory studies. Using the glasshouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) predator Macrolophus caliginosus Wagner (Hemiptera: Miridae) as a case study, the mirid was able to sustain viable populations over three generations on the related cabbage whitefly Aleyrodes proletella (Linnaeus) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) and the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), including when these prey were feeding on different host plants (Chinese cabbage, cabbage and Brussels sprout). However, the rate of development, fecundity and mortality of the predator varied between the different prey and host plant combinations, and in all cases differed than when feeding on its glasshouse prey T. vaporariorum reared on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The results are discussed in the light of the current debate on methods for conducting host range testing as part of an environmental risk assessment. © 2008 International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).

AB  - Timing of reproduction can help adjust the lifecycle of a species to coincide with biotic and abiotic conditions favorable for the growth and survival of its young. In fishes, factors related to the selection of spawning time include temperature regime, abundance and distribution of prey, and density-dependent feedbacks between population size, growth, survival, and reproduction. An individual-based model for young-of-year largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is presented. The model is then used to explore how these factors interact to determine optimal spawning time, defined here as that spawning time for which the total biomass of a cohort of bass at one year of age is maximized. When food intake per individual was assumed to be independent of population size, a broad peak in total cohort biomass occurred at intermediate spawning temperatures. With the addition of density dependence in food intake, a nearly constant total biomass was attained across a range of prescribed spawning temperatures. When largemouth bass spawned at different times within a year competed for a common food resource, those spawned earliest tended to produce the greatest total biomass. Fish representing a variety of spawning strategies were able to coexist over 15 simulated generations, however, because the number of offspring produced by any one strategy was limiting by the availability of prey of suitable size. Simulation results argue that recruitment success should not be assessed until well after young begin feeding, as density-dependent factors will determine the relative success of cohorts that survive adverse environmental conditions. © 1991.

AB  - Malolactic fermentation, a spontaneous step in vinification, is frequently controlled by use of malolactic bacterial starters of Leuconostoc nos. Strains isolated from fermenting wines and then submitted to industrial processes to obtain freeze-dried preparations lose their natural adaptation to survive and to grow in wine. However, culture conditions influence their adaptability as well as their survival after exposure to stress. As the plasma membrane was considered as the primary target for the deleterious effects of the environment, the changes of its components after cell heating and incubation in hostile conditions were studied. The ratio of phospholipids to proteins of the membrane decreased significantly when cells were submitted to any kind of stress. Phospholipids decreased while the protein content increased up to fivefold. Only some membrane proteins were over-synthesized compared to control cells. Seventeen protein bands were separated by gel electrophoresis of which three in particular were always over-expressed after the cells were shocked. Some also appeared when the cells entered the stationary phase. These results show that Laïc, nos responded to environmental stresses by changing its membrane composition. Stress proteins appeared whatever the nature of the shock. This phenomenon may be involved in the acquisition of resistance of Leuc. nos to harsh conditions in wine. © 1996 The Society for Applied Bacteriology.

VL  - 146

SP  - 755-763
AB  - S. nutans BHT was grown in Todd-Hewitt dialysate medium containing N-acetyl[ 14C]glucosamine for 6 to 11 generations. After treatment with cold and hot trichloroacetic acid and trypsin, 52 to 65% of the radioactivity remained present in insoluble peptidoglycan-containing residues. Hen egg white lysozyme or mutanolysin treatment of the peptidolgycan residues resulted in the release 80 and 97%, respectively, of the 14C label to the supernatant fraction. Hydrochloric acid hydrolysates of such supernatants showed that essentially all of the radioactivity present in insoluble peptidoglycan fractions was present in compounds that comigrated on paper chromatography with glucosamine (≃60%) or muramic acid (~30%). Treatment of whole cells with low and high concentrations of lysozyme alone resulted in losses of 45 and 70% of the insoluble peptidoglycan, respectively, yet release of deoxyribonucleic acid from cells was not detected. Sequential addition of appropriate concentrations of selected inorganic salts after lysozyme treatment did result in the liberation of deoxyribonucleic acid. Deoxyribonucleic acid release was correlated with a further release of peptidoglycan from the insoluble fraction. However, the total amount of peptidoglycan lost effected by the low concentration of lysozyme and NaSCN (lysis) was significantly less than the amount of peptidoglycan hydrolyzed by high concentrations of lysozyme alone (no lysis), suggesting that the overall amount of peptidoglycan lost did not correlate well with cellular lysis. The total amount of insoluble peptidoglycan lost at the highest salt concentration tested was found to be greater than could be accounted for by lysozyme-sensitive linkages of the peptidoglycan, possibly implicating autolysins. The results obtained suggested that hydrolysis of peptidoglycan bonds in topologically localized, but strategically important, sites was a more significant factor in the sequence that results in loss of cellular integrity (lysis).

AB  - Bivalves are newly discovered models of natural aging. This invertebrate group includes species with the longest metazoan lifespan approaching 400 y, as well as species of swimming and sessile lifestyles that live just for 1 y. Bivalves from natural populations can be aged by shell growth bands formed at regular intervals of time. This enables the study of abiotic and biotic environment factors (temperature, salinity, predator and physical disturbance) on senescence and fitness in natural populations, and distinguishes the impact of extrinsic effectors from intrinsic (genetic) determinants of animal aging. Extreme longevity of some bivalve models may help to analyze general metabolic strategies thought to be life prolonging, like the transient depression of metabolism, which forms part of natural behaviour in these species. Thus, seasonal food shortage experienced by benthic filter feeding bivalves in polar and temperate seas may mimic caloric restriction in vertebrates. Incidence of malignant neoplasms in bivalves needs to be investigated, to determine the implication of late acting mutations for bivalve longevity. Finally, bivalves are applicable models for testing the implication of heterozygosity of multiple genes for physiological tolerance, adaptability (heterozygote superiority), and life expectancy.

VL  - 122

SP  - 535-569
AB  - The physiological mechanisms of adaptation will be reported. In a primary step of adaptation, the body reacts with immediate response, which already leads to a first classification: whether or not altitude will be tolerated by an individual. More steady biological processes follow with the same intention of balancing oxygen deficiency. They may be successful and acclimatization is possible, or they do not achieve the necessary level, i.e. that consequently developing pathological conditions of different severity lead to a next assortation of individuals with insufficient adaptability. The first state of lability can be compensated, or the intolerance will make a further stay in high altitudes impossible. No parameters exist which could allow a prognosis as to what kind of individuals will tolerate altitude or not. A different pattern of biological reaction is seen in permanent inhabitants of high altitudes who have been residing there for generations and haven't experienced conditions other than those of their special altitude in their individual lives. While ascending to higher altitudes, permanent residents also have to undergo new adaptation, as well as when descending to lower altitudes. Returning to their native environment requires reacclimatization. The mechanisms of adaptation on the organ level will be reviewed, as well as on the fluid and cellular level. All those functional and morphological mechanisms of adaptation to oxygen deficiency in high altitudes tend to maintain optimal equilibrium. Maladaptation may result. Expected genetically determined physiological alterations of adaptational value in permanent residents, which could have manifested themselves by way of "soft" selection and change of gene frequency in those high altitude populations, will be discussed. Genetical determination in such physiological parameters does not seem probable, although some pecularities such as the "blunted response" ventilation, the higher Bohr-Effect in Quenchua etc. might be interpreted in this direction.

AB  - Ecological and physiological adaptabilities of earthworm in biofilter under domestication stage is presented, as well as related factors. The results show that, due to the coercion of natural and filter environment, the number and biomass of earthworms present a gradual downward trend after added. But once the conditions become appropriate, hatching of larvae could add the number and biomass of earthworm in the filter. With the increase of temperature, circumjacent earthworms gradually move to the water distribution area, 58 days later earthworms distribution become more uniform. Earthworm density and moisture content exist the significant negative correlation. Temperature, precipitation and rainfall don't affect the ecological indicators of earthworms significantly. When temperature is below 15°C, the earthworms' respiratory rate become more sensitive and decline significantly which is not conducive for earthworms treatment of sewage sludge. In a certain range, it's effective for improving the efficiency of sludge treatment to increase the density of earthworms and distribute earthworms evenly.

VL  - 73

SP  - 239-258
AB  - Biological control of Aonidiella aurantii (Mask.) is notoriously difficult in the hot lowlands of Swaziland and the eastern Transvaal. In view of resistance to organophosphates in populations elsewhere in the Transvaal, there is renewed interest in the commercial application of integrated pest management on citrus. Accordingly, data from a population of A. aurantii on orange trees in the Swaziland lowlands were examined to answer questions about biological control of the pest in this climatic region. Sections of the population on twigs and fruit were treated separately, and that on the leaves was ignored as not contributing much to the economy of the whole. The infestation of fruit each year depended largely on the size of the infestation on twigs in November (early summer), when crawlers from twigs first colonised the fruitlets. Mortality on twigs was estimated, checked from predictions of the recruitment rate and related to indices of climatic and biotic factors; 73% of the variation was described by mean predator intensity, mean minimum temperature and excess rainfall above the long-term mean, all measured over the generation time. On fruit, 32% of the variation in mortality was described by mean maximum saturation deficit in the generation time, the relationship being inverse. The dryness of the lowland climate appeared to be its favourable characteristic. The population appeared to be regulated about a mean level which was unacceptably high. Predators were the most effective natural enemies, probably followed by parasitoids (Aphytis spp.) on fruit. Endoparasitoids were probably ineffective. © 1983, Cambridge University Press.

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-75
AB  - Rumex obtusifolius plants and three generations of the tri-voltine leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula were simultaneously exposed to elevated CO2 (600 ppm) to determine its effect on plant quality and insect performance. This exposure resulted in a reduction in leaf nitrogen, an increase in the C/N ratio and lower concentrations of oxalate in the leaves than in ambient air (350 ppm). Despite these changes in food quality, the effect of elevated CO2 on larvae of Gastrophysa viridula over three generations was minimal. However, the effect of CO2 did differ slightly between the generations of the insect. For the first generation, the results obtained were different from many of the published results in that elevated CO2 had no measurable effects on performance, except that third instar larvae showed compensatory feeding. Food quality, including leaf nitrogen content, declined over time in material grown in both ambient and elevated CO2. The results obtained for the second generation were similar to the first except that first instar larvae showed reduced relative growth rate in elevated CO2. Development time from hatching to pupation decreased over each generation, probably as a result of increasing temperatures. Measurements of adult performance showed that fecundity at the end of the second generation was reduced relative to the first, in line with the reduction in food quality. In addition at the end of the second generation, but not at the end of the first generation, adult females in elevated CO2 laid 30% fewer eggs per day and the eggs laid were 15% lighter than those in ambient conditions. These lighter eggs, coupled with no effect of elevated CO2 on growth during the third generation, meant that the larvae were consistently smaller in elevated CO2 during this generation. These results offer further insights into the effect that elevated CO2 will have on insect herbivores and provide a more detailed basis for population predictions.

AB  - Ecological research on extreme environments can be applied to exobiological problems such as the question of life on Mars. If life forms (fossil or extant) are found on Mars, their study will help to solve fundamental questions about the nature of life on Earth. Extreme environments that are beyond the range of adaptability of their inhabitants are defined as "absolute extreme". Such environments can serve as terrestrial models for the last stages of life in the history of Mars, when the surface cooled down and atmosphere and water disappeared. The cryptoendolithic microbial community in porous rocks of the Ross Desert in Antarctica and the microbial mats at the bottom of frozen Antarctic lakes are such examples. The microbial communities of Siberian permafrost show that, in frozen but stable communities, long-term survival is possible. In the context of terraforming Mars, selected microorganisms isolated from absolute extreme environments are considered for use in creation of a biological carbon cycle.

VL  - 87
IS  - 2
SP  - 220-226
AB  - Selfish genetic elements that distort the sex ratio are common in arthropods. Theory predicts they will invade and spread to fixation if they are vertically transmitted with perfect fidelity, potentially leading to host extinction. For inherited microorganisms that distort the sex ratio., inefficient vertical transmission or incomplete sex ratio distorting ability is required for host persistence. However, the relative roles of genetic and environmental factors in permitting the survival of male hosts and preventing parasite transmission are poorly understood. We examined the causes of transmission infidelity and male survival for a male-killing Wolbachia strain in Drosophila bifasciata. Under standard laboratory conditions (18 degreesC), in its standard genetic background. males are produced very rarely, and no case of reversion has been observed in 20 generations of laboratory rearing. To investigate the role of host genetic factors, Wolbachia was crossed into 27 different inbred lines of D. bifasciata, but in no case was reversion observed at preferred environmental temperatures. The role of elevated temperature in inducing inefficient transmission was examined. Whilst vertical transmission was perfect over three generations of maintenance at 23.5 degrees. transmission infidelity was observed at 25 degrees. We conclude that there is no evidence for the presence of either fixed or polymorphic host genes that repress transmission at standard environmental temperatures. However, severe temperature treatment does make vertical transmission imperfect. We suggest that the case of Wolbachia in D. bifasciata is one that is naturally balanced. the population being maintained polymorphic without the evolution of host resistance genes.

AB  - A study is reported in which the possible occurrence of a significant relationship between the experience of parenting, in a large series of parent-offspring pairs from 67 multigenerational families, aged 17-90 yr was investigated. The sample generated 448 parent-offspring pairs. Both parents and offsprings, independently of each other, completed the EMBU (a Swedish acronym for 'early memories of parental rearing'). Consistently with other studies in the literature, in which different approaches were used, several significant correlations were found, especially concerning the experience of emotional warmth in fathers and a similar experience both in sons and daughters. Correlations between the experience of mothers and those of offsprings proved to be weaker and mostly refer to dysfunctional rearing attitudes (overprotection and rejection). Even though, the reported findings add to the body of knowledge as to a possible intergenerational transmission of parenting, they cannot answer the question concerning the extent to which temperamental characteristics contribute to the correlations which were presented. Suggestions for further studies to elucidate this and other relevant issues are therefore, warranted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 29

SP  - 3790-3799
AB  - The environmental vulnerability has been the issue in the field of international environment, but such domestic study is few. As county is the basic regional units characterized with regional, spatial and administrational independence in china, assessment of the environmental vulnerability at county level is a matter of importance. Based on the requirement of environment management, focused on county level, this paper clarified the attribute of environmental vulnerability, selected evaluation indexes from three aspects of stability, sensitivity and applicability, and established the evaluation models so as to systematically assess environmental vulnerability within county area. The results indicated that the environmental stability of Kenli County was instable, the environmental sensitivity appeared a descend trend and the environmental adaptability showed an uptrend as a whole during 1986-2003. The partial correlation method was adopted to analyze the natural factor sensitivity of Kenli County, and their sensitivity sequence was that the groundwater level > evaporation and precipitation ratio > groundwater salinity > air temperature. Therefore, the natural sensitive factors of the study area were determined as the former three. The results of obstacle degree of regional adaptability indicated that the saline-alkali soil amelioration rate was the most important obstacle factor during 1986-2003, the restriction of the farmland shelter-forest density mainly appeared during 1995-1998, and the pesticide and fertilization application became the main obstacle since 2000, and the effective irrigation area ratio and the drainage system area ratio raised as the problem before 1990. The conclusions are that the environmental vulnerability of Kenli County is declining,but still in vulnerable state. At the same time, Kenli County should put the emphases on the development of the sensitive and obstacle factors. The assessment method can find the fundamental reasons and the development process of the County environmental vulnerability, which is significant for the current domestic study.

VL  - 1

SP  - 31-40
AB  - Populations of Microlophium carnosum on patches of perennial stinging nettle, Urtica dioica increased rapidly during April and May to reach their peaks in June. The decline in numbers was equally rapid and very small populations persisted into autumn; parthenogenetic over‐wintering was recorded. Suboptimal ambient temperature and mortality due to natural enemies contributed mainly to the post‐peak development of aphid populations. The combined effects of intraspecific competition and a deterioration in the food quality of the host plant appeared to be the major factors determining the temporal pattern of aphid abundance. Variation in the size of populations between the three sampled sites was correlated with differences in the food quality of nettles as indicated by aphid mean relative growth rate. Each nettle patch has a particular ‘carrying capacity’ for aphids, within which a biennial fluctuation between relatively large and small aphid populations appeared to be emerging at most of the sites investigated. A natural or aphid‐induced cycle in host plant quality, or alternatively, the persistent effects of intraspecific competition over several generations, may explain this fluctuation.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 56-69
AB  - This paper discusses the effects of physical factors, especially temperature, on sex ratio and sex determination in some euryplastic amphipods and isopods. In particular, it subjects to critical analysis a recently published article by Traut (1960) which purports to prove that temperature does not affect sex ratio and sex determination in the amphipod Gammarus duebeni Lillj. Traut comes to the conclusion that “a significant effect of temperature can be excluded with certainty” (: 454; the present author's translation), and that sex determination is genotypical and practically independent of the environment (polyfactorial sex determination). This conclusion is not in accord with my earlier results (Kinne, 1952a, b, 1953a), ecological considerations (: present paper) – or Traut's own data (Table II). The present paper presents (1) a brief review of the techniques and conditions employed in my experiments, and of my results; (2) proof that Traut used a different technique and exposed his animals to different conditions – circumstances which a priori had to lead to different results; (3) proof that Traut misinterprets his data, which, in general, confirm that the temperature affects sex determination; (4) a discussion of the ecological significance of an environment-dependent sex determination versus a genetically fixed “monogeny”. The sex ratio and sex determination of G. duebeni is controlled to a large degree by temperature, to a much lesser degree by salinity (Kinne, 1952a, b, 1953c), and possibly also by other environmental factors. Females kept at a constant salinity of 10 ± o.4‰ and under normal annual temperature fluctuations (minimum 1-2° C, in January; maximum 23° C, in July, August) produced males if the temperature during the “sensitive phase” (a certain number of days previous to ovi-position; Kinne, 1953c; 266) happened to be below 5° C, they produced females if this temperature happened to be above 6° C, and mixed broods if it happened to be between 5° and 6° C. The “critical temperature range” (5-6° C) may change with adaptation to different environmental conditions (Kinne, 1952b, 1953c); it is, for example, higher and wider in warm adapted (19-20° C) females, and also in females adapted to higher (30‰) salinities. Examples are presented to elucidate the importance for survival and ecological success of a plastic, environment-dependent sex determination in G. duebeni. Traut exposed his G. duebeni to only two different temperature conditions: a constant temperature of 4° C and “room temperature” (he gives no information on salinity, light, food, etc.). Under these conditions he finds that certain females (“arrhenogen”) produce only males, others (“thelygen”) only females. This “monogeny” is, according to Traut, genetically fixed. The difficulties of explaining monogeny on a purely genetical basis (as attempted in the genetical-polyfactorial theory of sex determination: de Lattin, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952; Seitz, 1953, 1954; Anders, 1953, 1957; Traut, 1960), the various exceptions observed (e.g. “thelygen” females suddenly producing males, etc.), and the criticisms of the assumed polyfactorial sex determination theory (Hartmann, 1956, and others) have led the present author to suggest a different interpretation of the phenomena observed by de Lattin and his pupils. It is suggested that it is not monogeny itself but rather the range of the critical temperature or, more generally, the physiological reaction norm (“Umwelteinstellung”) of individuals that is genetically fixed. Arrhenogen and thelygen females would then represent individuals with different, genetically fixed ranges of critical temperature. Genetically fixed differences of this sort are found in various species (temperature races, climatic races; see e.g. Precht et al., 1955; 170-176), and indeed are sometimes deliberately enhanced by selective breeding, e.g. in food plants and domestic animals. On the basis of the pertinent experimental results and the assumed genetic differences in the “Umwelteinstellung” of individuals, the following would seem to be the most important factors controlling a plastic environment-dependent sex ratio (for simplicity, reference is made to temperature only); (1) Temperature-dependent sex determination with the critical temperature range capable of “physiological adaptation” (in the sense of Prosser, 1958) (2) Temperature-dependence and adaptability of secondary processes: timing of reproductive and resting periods; molting frequency; ovi-position frequency; growth rate; egg production; incubation time; duration of precopula (Kinne, 1952b; 130) (3) Selective mortality (4) Genetically fixed differences in the physiological reaction norm (“Temperatureinstellung”) of individuals (see e.g. Precht et al., 1955; 171); mutations; selection of genetically suitable material.

AB  - The sepiolid squid Rossia pacifica was trawled in the NE Pacific and brought into the laboratory where it is in cultivation. At seasonally varying temperatures, the generation is 2 yr; 18-19 months from hatching to a spawning-related death, and 5-6 months for embryonic development. Repeated spawning was observed. Hatching of eggs appeared to be keyed to the new moon and extended >2 months. Low seawater temperatures may affect this process. Two relatively independent year classes coexist on the same ground with little competition. The early life is characterized by low growth, adaptability and a conservative strategy. It is released by the semelparous death of the preceding year class to become more opportunistic, grow faster and become sexually mature.-from Author
