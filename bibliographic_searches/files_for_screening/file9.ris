TI  - Rethinking local adaptation: Mind the environment!
VL  - 312
SP  - 271-281
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions has led to adaptive genetic differentiation and the development of home-site fitness advantage (local adaptation) among populations of many widespread plant species such as forest trees. Although its overall patterns have been well characterised, earlier studies on adaptation have predominantly used long-term averages of environmental variables to describe local climates. Subsequently, only little is currently known about more complex patterns of variation in potential selective forces and how they affect adaptive processes. Furthermore, we also lack a good understanding of why adaptive traits often vary within populations despite clear evidence of local selection. Because the capacity of a population to respond to changes in its home environment depends on the amount of genetic variation that it contains, an understanding of these patterns is fundamental to predicting how extant populations will cope with climate change. In this paper, I call attention to these two issues and discuss adaptation in heterogeneous environments using studies mainly on Finnish populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) as an example. In this geographic area, population means in growth cessation are closely related to the latitude at the population's home site, indicating adaptation to local environments. Yet the trait varies considerably also within populations, with the highest levels of phenotypic variation found in the central part of the latitudinal gradient. Increased variation further north may have a significant genetic component. In stable local environments this would indicate that populations with less variation are more optimally adapted to their home site environments. On the other hand, climate data show that growing season temperature conditions within Finland become temporally more variable towards the north which might contribute to different levels of trait variation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the weaknesses of focusing only on long-term averages of environmental variables or trait means when examining adaptation in natural populations. Moreover, better integrated analyses of both genetic and environmental variation might help in disentangling the mechanisms that maintain adaptive genetic diversity and adaptive capacity in natural populations of perennial species under changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Rethinking the thermal melanism hypothesis: Rearing temperature and coloration in pygmy grasshoppers
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1247-1257
AB  - Selection for efficient conversion of solar radiation to body heat has favored the evolution of dark coloration in many ectotherms. The thermal melanism hypothesis posits that dark coloration is beneficial under conditions of low ambient temperatures because it results in faster heating rates and higher body temperatures. Fast heating rates, however, may come at a cost of overheating unless compensated for by thermal physiology or behaviour. Pygmy grasshopper (Orthoptera, Tetrigidae) populations that inhabit fire-ravaged areas characterized by blackened backgrounds and hot surface temperatures due to high absorbance of solar radiation show an increased frequency of black phenotypes. I raised the progeny of wild-captured Tetrix undulata in cold and hot temperatures and used data on color patterns and survival in a greenhouse to examine whether a cold thermal environment triggered the development of melanic coloration or differently affected survival of melanic versus non-melanic individuals. My results indicate that melanism was not influenced by rearing temperature but by genes or epigenetic maternal effects. Temperature also did not affect survival. However, melanic individuals produced by melanic mothers survived longer than melanic individuals produced by non- melanic mothers, whereas non-melanic individuals produced by non-black mothers survived longer than melanic individuals produced by non-black mothers. This suggests a mismatch between color and physiology in offspring belonging to a different color morph than their mother. Future investigations into the evolution of melanism should consider conflicting selection pressures on thermal capacity and camouflage as well as the influence of correlated responses to selection on traits associated with coloration. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary considerations regarding corals in a rapidly changing environment
SP  - 553-576
AB  - Coral reefs have been threatened for ≥35 years, primarily by global warming, disease, and unwanted inter-oceanic species introductions. Here we discuss differences between the evolution of corals and other organisms in the Atlantic vs. the Pacific Oceans through natural selection caused by oceanic cooling in the Atlantic and the resultant differential extinctions. We will also consider the implications of differential Pacific vs. Atlantic adaptations for invasive species and how it makes the former formidable predators and competitors. The effects of climate change and global warming on corals will also be considered, including the poleward movement of our current climatic zones at the expense of the polar and subpolar zones. We also predict the creation of a new “Hyper-Tropical Zone” in the center of the Equatorial Zone, characterized by mass mortalities of zooxanthellate organisms, causing both local endemic and global pandemic extinctions. The effects of global warming on the coral-zooxanthellar symbiotic relationship examines how zooxanthellae may be the “weak” link in the system, explaining why they are having difficulty keeping up with the pace of global warming. We also consider the possibility of a replacement symbiont arising. In this context, we examine the evolution of coral immunity as it affects the host, symbiont replacement, and disease. Such studies will help us to better understand the evolution of innate and adaptive immune systems, and ultimately better understand vertebrate model systems for human health studies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Through greenhouse pots experiments, an orthogonal test method was employed here to study the optimum degradation conditions of cold-adapted degrading bacterial and the winter wheat. This orthogonal experiment selected four influencing factors: oil content, bacteria amount, soil moisture content and fertilizer. The results showed that in different stages, the optimum degradation conditions were different. Oil content and the bacterial amount were the two most important factors that influenced the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The impact of fertilizers on the degradation rate increased with time, while water content on the degradation rate decreased with time. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - Evolution of a volcanogenic hydrothermal system recorded by the behavior of LREE and Eu: Case study of the Key Tuffite at Bracemac-McLeod deposits, Matagami, Canada
VL  - 63
SP  - 160-177
AB  - The distribution of rare earth elements (REE) in the alteration zones surrounding modern and ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits is often characterized by a wide range of variations comprising both gains and losses of light REE (LREE: La to Sm) and europium. The evolution of the hydrothermal system is recorded by mineral assemblages and their chemical composition. To address the behavior of the REE in such a context, the Bracemac-McLeod Archean VMS deposits of the Matagami district are used. There, mineralization was formed mainly by subsea-floor replacement along a tuffaceous marker unit (Key Tuffite) of homogenous andesitic composition, hence providing a single protolith to account for mineral and chemical variations in relation to ore position. We combine whole-rock and mineral REE data in both distal sericite and proximal chlorite alteration surrounding the mineralization. A model, integrating observed textural relationships, geochemical data and current understanding of mineral stabilities, is proposed to explain the redistribution of the REE during the evolution of the VMS hydrothermal system. The distal sericite zone represents the early, low temperature alteration. It is characterized by the destruction of volcanic glass and plagioclase leading to a negative Eu anomaly in the whole-rock analyses and the depletion of LREE. The proximal chlorite zone was formed during the thermal evolution of a fertile VMS hydrothermal system. It is generally characterized by gains of LREE and Eu, although some chloritized samples are depleted in LREE. Petrographic observations suggest that the coprecipitation of allanite with chlorite explains the increase of LREE, whereas a mass balance calculation indicates that the precipitation of apatite (carbonates) essentially controls the Eu. Local silicification, occurring as pulses during the hydrothermal system life, is also of interest because it could preserve an intermediate alteration state and thus provide additional information on the evolution of the hydrothermal system. The mobility of REE is indicative of specific hydrothermal conditions, which may reflect the efficiency of a mineralizing hydrothermal system. At Matagami, the mobility of LREE and Eu could be used for vectoring in exploration, especially Eu which has an anomalous behavior that extends far beyond the limit of the sulfide zone, into the distal sericitic low-temperature alteration (up to 400 m from the ore zones).

TI  - The effect of climate change on volcanism during continental break-up
AB  - In this contribution we will explore the potential coupling between change in surface loading and melt generation during continental extension. The removal of a surface load will increase the rate of decompression and hence increase the rate of melt generation, yet the rate of decompression within the zone of partial melting will also be modulated by the elastic and viscous relaxation of the lithosphere. Therefore it remains an open question as to if climate can directly influence the thermal history of an evolving rift basin. To understand how linked climate and volcanism might be, we developed numerical models of rift evolution that allow for the interaction of first order surface processes. Deglaciation is found to have a strong impact on melt production if the ice-sheet is greater than 100 km in width and the lithosphere strength is low. Under such conditions, melt productivity can be increased by more than 1000 %. Rapid sediment removal due to increased run-off could have a similar effect on melt productivity. Crucially, we find that rift evolution is strongly dependent on the rate of change in surface load, suggesting that rapid climate change may strongly influence rift basin formation.

TI  - Environmental drivers of voltinism and body size in insect assemblages across Europe
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 154-165
AB  - Aim: General geographical patterns of insect body size are still a matter of considerable debate, mainly because the annual number of generations (voltinism) and its relationship with body size have largely been ignored. We present the first analyses of voltinism and body size of insect assemblages at a continental scale using lepidopteran and odonate species. We hypothesize that voltinism is strongly driven by environmental conditions and constrains body size on macroecological scales. Location: Europe. Methods: We compiled the distribution, voltinism and body size of 943 lepidopteran and odonate species within a 50 km × 50 km grid system, thereby presenting a novel method for estimating the body volume of species from digital images. Regressions and structural equation modelling were applied to distinguish the effects of temperature, productivity and season length on mean voltinism and body size within grid cells. We accounted for spatial autocorrelation with autoregressive models and analysed the possible effect of species richness and intraspecific variability. Results: Voltinism consistently decreased with latitude for both lepidopterans (r2 = 0.76) and odonates (r2 = 0.86), with species having on average fewer generations per year in northern Europe and more generations per year in southern Europe. The effects of temperature, productivity and season length on body size contrasted in sign between lepidopterans and odonates, leading to opposing geographical patterns across Europe. Main conclusions: Voltinism in insect assemblages is strongly driven by environmental temperature, and trade-offs between voltinism and body size influence the occurrence of species at macroecological scales. Insects with the ability to extend their generation time over multiple years can overcome this constraint, allowing for a relatively large body size in cold areas. Our results furthermore support the idea that body sizes of terrestrial and aquatic insects form contrasting geographical patterns because they are differently affected by temperature and resource constraints. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Genomic determinants of coral heat tolerance across latitudes
VL  - 348

SP  - 1460-1462
AB  - As global warming continues, reef-building corals could avoid local population declines through "genetic rescue" involving exchange of heat-tolerant genotypes across latitudes, but only if latitudinal variation in thermal tolerance is heritable. Here, we show an up-to-10-fold increase in odds of survival of coral larvae under heat stress when their parents come from a warmer lower-latitude location. Elevated thermal tolerance was associated with heritable differences in expression of oxidative, extracellular, transport, andmitochondrial functions that indicated a lack of prior stress. Moreover, two genomic regions strongly responded to selection for thermal tolerance in interlatitudinal crosses. These results demonstrate that variation in coral thermal tolerance across latitudes has a strong genetic basis and could serve as raw material for natural selection. © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

TI  - On the fate of seasonally plastic traits in a rainforest butterfly under relaxed selection
VL  - 4
IS  - 13
SP  - 2654-2667
AB  - Many organisms display phenotypic plasticity as adaptation to seasonal environmental fluctuations. Often, such seasonal responses entails plasticity of a whole suite of morphological and life-history traits that together contribute to the adaptive phenotypes in the alternative environments. While phenotypic plasticity in general is a well-studied phenomenon, little is known about the evolutionary fate of plastic responses if natural selection on plasticity is relaxed. Here, we study whether the presumed ancestral seasonal plasticity of the rainforest butterfly Bicyclus sanaos (Fabricius, 1793) is still retained despite the fact that this species inhabits an environmentally stable habitat. Being exposed to an atypical range of temperatures in the laboratory revealed hidden reaction norms for several traits, including wing pattern. In contrast, reproductive body allocation has lost the plastic response. In the savannah butterfly, B. anynana (Butler, 1879), these traits show strong developmental plasticity as an adaptation to the contrasting environments of its seasonal habitat and they are coordinated via a common developmental hormonal system. Our results for B. sanaos indicate that such integration of plastic traits - as a result of past selection on expressing a coordinated environmental response - can be broken when the optimal reaction norms for those traits diverge in a new environment. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Evolution of an antifreeze protein by neofunctionalization under escape from adaptive conflict
VL  - 107
IS  - 50
SP  - 21593-21598
AB  - The evolutionary model escape from adaptive conflict (EAC) posits that adaptive conflict between the old and an emerging new function within a single gene could drive the fixation of gene duplication, where each duplicate can freely optimize one of the functions. Although EAC has been suggested as a common process in functional evolution, definitive cases of neofunctionalization under EAC are lacking, and the molecular mechanisms leading to functional innovation are not well-understood. We report here clear experimental evidence for EAC-driven evolution of type III antifreeze protein gene from an old sialic acid synthase (SAS) gene in an Antarctic zoarcid fish. We found that an SAS gene, having both sialic acid synthase and rudimentary ice-binding activities, became duplicated. In one duplicate, the N-terminal SAS domain was deleted and replaced with a nascent signal peptide, removing pleiotropic structural conflict between SAS and ice-binding functions and allowing rapid optimization of the C-terminal domain to become a secreted protein capable of noncolligative freezing-point depression. This study reveals how minor functionalities in an old gene can be transformed into a distinct survival protein and provides insights into how gene duplicates facing presumed identical selection and mutation pressures at birth could take divergent evolutionary paths.

VL  - 24
SP  - 84-88
AB  - Insects utilise chemical cues for a range of different purposes and the complexity and degree of specificity of these signals is arguably unparalleled in the animal kingdom. Chemical signals are particularly important for insect reproduction and the selective pressures driving their evolution and maintenance have been the subject of previous reviews. However, the world in which chemical cues evolved and are maintained is changing at an unprecedented rate. How (or indeed whether) chemical signals used in sexual selection will respond is largely unknown. Here, we explore how recent increases in urbanisation and associated anthropogenic impacts may affect how chemical signals are produced and perceived. We focus on four anthropomorphic influences which have the potential to interact with pheromone-mediated sexual selection processes; climatic temperature shifts, exposure to chemical pollutants, the presence of artificial light at night and nutrient availability. Our aim is to provide a broad overview of key areas where the rapidly changing environment of the future might specifically affect pheromones utilised in sexual selection. © 2017

VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 269-278
AB  - This study examined how spring-flow (SF) contributions to streams related to the distribution and abundance of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu in a predominately pasture landscape in Missouri, USA. Stream segments (N=13) with similar landscape characters were classified by SF volume into high SF (HSF) or low SF (LSF) groups. The densities of smallmouth bass, channel unit (CU) use and temperature-selection patterns were assessed for several life stages and frequency distributions for age 0 fish. More smallmouth bass were present in stream segments with HSF influence. Age 0 fish were twice as likely to be present in HSF stream segments. Older age classes were present in stream reaches independent of SF contribution. For all age classes, the use of particular CUs did not depend on SF influence. All age classes were more likely to be present in pools than other CUs. Microhabitat temperature selection differed among age classes. Age 0 fish selected warmer temperatures with a gradual shift towards cooler temperatures for older age classes. The length frequency of age 0 fish was skewed towards larger individuals in streams with limited SF influence, whereas the length frequency in HSF stream segments was skewed towards smaller individuals. The benefits of significant groundwater via SF influence seem to be related to increased hatch or survival of age 0 fish and the availability of optimal temperatures for adult smallmouth bass growth. Thermal refugia and stable flows provided by springs should be recognised for their biological potential to provide suitable habitat as climate change and other land-use alterations increase temperature regimes and alter flow patterns.

TI  - Calculation of static voltage stability margin based on continuous power flow and improved differential evolution algorithm
VL  - 6
IS  - 17
SP  - 86-95
AB  - With power grid heavy-load operation, and remote transmission distance which leads to voltage collapse, the method that combines continuous power flow (CPF) and improved differential evolution (IDE) algorithm is put forward to calculate a static voltage stability margin. First, we introduce mathematical model and CPF for solving the static voltage stability margin. And then, simulated annealing strategy is brought into differential evolution (DE) algorithm. When temperature is high, it can optimize the combination of control variables, and has the ability of global search. With the temperature decreasing, local search capabilities are enhanced and search speed is accelerated. In the crossover operator of DE algorithm, adaptive crossover probability strategy is introduced. The value of the crossover probability varies with the individual fitness. The individual with high fitness has more opportunities to go into next generation, while others will be kicked out quickly. This method is simple, easy to understand and realize, has fewer controlled parameters, and fast calculation. The correctness and validity of this algorithm can be verified by IEEE14-bus and IEEE30-bus system.

TI  - Fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as the driving force of codon usage bias in the hepatitis A virus capsid
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
AB  - Hepatitis A virus (HAV), the prototype of genus Hepatovirus, has several unique biological characteristics that distinguish it from other members of the Picornaviridae family. Among these, the need for an intact eIF4G factor for the initiation of translation results in an inability to shut down host protein synthesis by a mechanism similar to that of other picornaviruses. Consequently, HAV must inefficiently compete for the cellular translational machinery and this may explain its poor growth in cell culture. In this context of virus/cell competition, HAV has strategically adopted a naturally highly deoptimized codon usage with respect to that of its cellular host. With the aim to optimize its codon usage the virus was adapted to propagate in cells with impaired protein synthesis, in order to make tRNA pools more available for the virus. A significant loss of fitness was the immediate response to the adaptation process that was, however, later on recovered and more associated to a redeoptimization rather than to an optimization of the codon usage specifically in the capsid coding region. These results exclude translation selection and instead suggest fine-tuning translation kinetics selection as the underlying mechanism of the codon usage bias in this specific genome region. Additionally, the results provide clear evidence of the Red Queen dynamics of evolution since the virus has very much evolved to re-adapt its codon usage to the environmental cellular changing conditions in order to recover the original fitness. © 2010 Aragonès et al.

TI  - The Secret to Successful Deep-Sea Invasion: Does Low Temperature Hold the Key?
VL  - 7
IS  - 12
AB  - There is a general consensus that today's deep-sea biodiversity has largely resulted from recurrent invasions and speciations occurring through homogenous waters during periods of the Phanerozoic eon. Migrations likely continue today, primarily via isothermal water columns, such as those typical of Polar Regions, but the necessary ecological and physiological adaptations behind them are poorly understood. In an evolutionary context, understanding the adaptations, which allow for colonisation to high-pressure environments, may enable us to predict future events. In this investigation, we examine pressure tolerance during development, in the shallow-water neogastropod Buccinum undatum using thermally acclimated egg masses from temperate and sub-polar regions across the species range. Fossil records indicate neogastropods to have a deep-water origin, suggesting shallow-water species may be likely candidates for re-emergence into the deep sea. Our results show population level differences in physiological thresholds, which indicate low temperature acclimation to increase pressure tolerance. These findings imply this species is capable of deep-sea penetration through isothermal water columns prevailing at high latitudes. This study gives new insight into the fundamentals behind past and future colonisation events. Such knowledge is instrumental to understand better how changes in climate envelopes affect the distribution and radiation of species along latitudinal as well as bathymetric temperature gradients. © 2012 Smith, Thatje.

VL  - 159

SP  - 2185-2194
AB  - The behavioral responses of fishes to temperature variation have received less attention than physiological responses, despite their direct implications for predator-prey dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the temperature dependence of swimming performance and behavioral characteristics of juvenile Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus; 75-125 mm total length). Maximum swimming speeds increased with temperature and body size. Routine swimming speeds of Pacific cod in small groups of similarly sized fish (N = 6) increased with body size and were 34 % faster at 9 °C than at 2 °C. The response to temperature was opposite that previously described for juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), reflecting species-specific differences in behavioral responses. In a separate experiment, we demonstrated the effect of temperature on habitat selection of juvenile Pacific cod: Use of an artificial eelgrass patch in a 5-m-long laboratory tank was significantly greater at 9 °C than at 2 °C. These results illustrate that temperature affects a range of behavioral traits that play important roles in determining the frequency and outcomes of predator-prey interactions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).

VL  - 11

AB  - We used experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster, which had either been subdivided (metapopulations) or kept undivided for 40 generations, to study the consequences of population subdivision for the tolerance and adaptive response after six generations of exposure to novel environmental factors (high temperature, medium with ethanol or salt added) for traits with different genetic architectures. In this setup, we attempted to separate the effects of the loss of fitness due to inbreeding (i. e., the survival upon first exposure to stress) from the loss of adaptive potential due to the lack of genetic variation. To place our experimental results in a more general perspective, we used individual-based simulations combining different options of levels of gene flow, intensity of selection and genetic architecture to derive quantitative hypotheses of the effects of these factors on the adaptive response to stress. We observed that population subdivision resulted in substantial inter-deme variation in tolerance due to redistribution of genetic variation from within demes to among demes. In line with the simulation results, the adaptive response was generally lower in the subdivided than in the undivided populations, particularly so for high temperature. We observed pronounced differences between stress factors that are likely related to the different genetic architectures involved in resistance to these factors. From a conservation genetics viewpoint, our results have two important implications: (i) Long-term fragmentation in combination with restricted gene flow will limit the adaptive potential of individual subpopulations because adaptive variation will become distributed among populations rather than within populations. (ii) The genetic architecture of the trait(s) under selection is of great significance to understand the possible responses to novel stresses that may be expected. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - The low-temperature dehydrogenation of propane with O2 and H2 on H3PMo12O40-modified Pt catalysts has been studied and improvement of the catalyst performance achieved with the aid of promoters and operating conditions. Introduction of phosphoric acid into the catalysts results in a more uniform distribution of heteropoly acid and enables the content of Pt to be decreased to 0.05 wt.% without affecting catalyst productivity at the low temperature (200 °C). With Ag as the promoter, the propane combustion to CO2 can be further lowered and selectivity to propene enhanced to 94%. The best results were obtained when the consumption of H2 and O2 along the catalyst bed was compensated with a new portion of the reagents (two reactors in line); propene selectivity was still near 90% at overall propane conversion of 7.5% and propene space-time yield of 370 g kgcat-1 h-1. The catalysts showed little deactivation and maintained their conversion and selectivity values for the time of the measurements (5-10 h). © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 10
IS  - 7
SP  - 718-730
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to express different phenotypes depending on the environment, provides an important mechanism by which an animal population can persist under rapid climate change. We experimentally tested both life-history and transcriptional responses of an ecological model species, the three-spined stickleback, to warm acclimation at the southern edge of its European range. We explored cross-environment genetic correlations of key life-history traits in male sticklebacks exposed to long-term temperature changes to examine whether the plasticity pattern was variable among genotypes by using a character-state approach. We also studied gene expression plasticity by analysing both whole-transcriptome and candidate gene expression in brain and liver. Male sticklebacks that developed under warmer conditions during winter were smaller in size and invested less in nuptial coloration at the beginning of the breeding season, showing similar responses across different genotypes. The lack of genetic variation in life-history responses may limit any future evolution of the thermal reaction norm in the study population. After long-term exposure to increased winter temperatures, genes responsible for several metabolic and oxidation–reduction processes were upregulated, and some hormone genes involved in growth and reproduction were downregulated in the brain. In the liver, there was no significantly represented gene ontology by the differentially expressed genes. Since a higher temperature leads to a higher resting metabolic rate, living in warmer environments may incur higher energetic costs for ectotherms to maintain cellular homoeostasis, resulting in negative consequences for life-history traits. The expression of genes related to metabolism, cellular homoeostasis and regulatory signalling may underlie temperature-induced changes in life history. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Late Cenozoic marine proxy data record a long-term transition in the tropical Pacific from El Niño-like conditions with reduced zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, deepened thermocline, and reduced upwelling in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) to conditions similar to modern. This transition coincides with kilometer-scale uplift of the central Andes. To understand whether the rise of the Andes contributed to tropical Pacific climate evolution, we performed experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Community Climate System Model version 4 to quantify changes in tropical Pacific climate and El Niño-Southern Oscillation as a function of Andean elevations. Our results demonstrate that uplift increases the equatorial east-west SST gradient and Walker circulation. The rise of the Andes from 1 to 3 km increases the SST gradient by 0.8°C and Walker circulation by 60% due to strengthened radiative cooling by enhanced low-cloud formation in the EEP. This cooling effect is largest in the southeastern tropical Pacific and accounts for about one half of the reconstructed SST cooling along the Peru coast. The uplift also strengthens upwelling north of the EEP, consistent with documented increases in biological productivity in this region, and decreases the frequency of El Niño-Southern Oscillation and the number of strong El Niño events. Simulated responses to Andean uplift are generally consistent with the late Cenozoic proxy records, but too small in magnitude. Taken together, our results indicate that Andean uplift was likely one of the multiple factors that contributed to the long-term evolution of both the mean climate state and the interannual variability in the tropical Pacific.

VL  - 117

SP  - 796-801
AB  - In oviparous species lacking parental care, successful reproduction depends on females selecting nest sites that facilitate embryonic development. Such sites may be limited in the environment, which can lead to multiple females using the same nest site simultaneously. However, there are several alternative explanations for communal nesting, including natal homing, predator satiation, and adaptive benefits to offspring. We used laboratory experiments to evaluate three hypotheses about nest-site selection in velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii), which often nest communally. We investigated whether the trend to nest communally is influenced by the following: (1) evidence of previous nesting (hatched eggshells); (2) body size; and/or (3) thermal regimes. When given the choice, females laid their eggs in shelters containing hatched eggshells rather than in empty shelters, and this was not influenced by body size. Females selected nest sites that were cooler than their own mean selected body temperatures, suggesting that thermal requirements of their developing embryos could outweigh their own thermoregulatory preferences. Field observations of natal homing and high predation rates on gravid females suggest that imprinting on nest sites and/or predator swamping also play roles in communal nesting. Collectively, our results suggest that female velvet geckos use multiple cues to select appropriate nest sites, and hence that multiple mechanisms result in communal nesting behavior in this species. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Aim: Temperature influences most components of animal ecology and life history - but what kind of temperature? Physiologists usually examine the influence of body temperatures, while biogeographers and macroecologists tend to focus on environmental temperatures. We aim to examine the relationship between these two measures, to determine the factors that affect lizard body temperatures and to test the effect of both temperature measures on lizard life history. Location: World-wide. Methods: We used a large (861 species) global dataset of lizard body temperatures, and the mean annual temperatures across their geographic ranges to examine the relationships between body and mean annual temperatures. We then examined factors influencing body temperatures, and tested for the influence of both on ecological and life-history traits while accounting for the influence of shared ancestry. Results: Body temperatures and mean annual temperatures are uncorrelated. However, accounting for activity time (nocturnal species have low body temperatures), use of space (fossorial and semi-aquatic species are 'colder'), insularity (mainland species are 'hotter') and phylogeny, the two temperatures are positively correlated. High body temperatures are only associated with larger hatchlings and increased rates of biomass production. Annual temperatures are positively correlated with clutch frequency and annual longevity, and negatively correlated with clutch size, age at first reproduction and longevity. Main conclusions: Lizards with low body temperatures do not seem to have 'slower' life-history attributes than species with high body temperatures. The longer seasons prevalent in warm regions, and physiological processes that operate while lizards are inactive (but warm enough), make environmental temperatures better predictors of lizard life-history variation than body temperatures. This surprisingly greater effect of environmental temperatures on lizard life histories hints that global warming may have a profound influence on lizard ecology and evolution. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 37

AB  - Species are expected to alter their ranges as climates change. Climate-induced range expansions of predators could threaten evolutionarily naïve prey populations, leading to high mortality at the invasion front. If prey can apply existing defenses against local predators to novel predation threats induced by climate change, mortality threats will be less than expected. Here, we examine if spotted salamander larvae Ambystoma maculatum from populations that coexist with native red-spotted newts Notophthalmus viridescens survive better when exposed to a novel predator, the marbled salamander Ambystoma opacum. We show that regional mean winter temperatures warmed 2.0°C over 116 yr in the region, and that A. opacum survival increases in ponds with higher winter temperatures. Hence as winters continue to warm, this apex predator will likely colonize ponds north of their current range limit. Next, we performed common garden experiments to determine if local adaptations to native N. viridescens and exposure to A. opacum or N. viridescens kairomones (predator chemical cues) altered A. maculatum survival in predation trials. We did not find evidence for local adaptation to N. viridescens. However, A. maculatum from high-N. viridescens ponds that were reared with A. opacum kairomones suffered significantly higher mortality from the native predator N. viridescens. This outcome suggests an unanticipated interaction between local adaptation and plastic responses to novel kairomones from a potentially range-expanding predator. Current projections of biodiversity losses from climate change generally ignore the potential for eco-evolutionary interactions between native and range-expanding species and thus could be inaccurate. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Linking embryonic temperature with adult reproductive investment in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
VL  - 515
SP  - 217-226
AB  - The expression of fitness-related traits, such as egg and gonad size, often varies among habitats and exhibits clinal variation along climatic and latitudinal gradients. However, the mechanisms allowing such variations are obscure and have been ascribed to both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. We experimentally tested whether variation in egg and gonad size of a poikilotherm vertebrate is influenced by the temperature individuals experienced during embryogenesis, possibly as an epigenetic effect. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar eggs were incubated under 3 embryonic thermal regimes: cold, mixed and warm treatments. The cold group received ambient river water (mean ± SD: 2.6 ± 0.4°C) and the warm group received water at 4.6°C above ambient temperature, the expected temperature in the river towards the end of this century, from fertilization until exogenous feeding commenced. The mixed group received ambient river water until hatching, whereupon the larvae received heated water until exogenous feeding commenced. When exogenous feeding was initiated, all fish were reared under identical, natural thermal conditions. At adulthood, fish that developed from warm-incubated eggs were largest, had the highest mass-length relationship and developed larger eggs and higher gonad mass relative to their own body size. There was no similar effect of thermal environment during larval development. The treatment did not affect age of maturity or fecundity. Thus, thermal conditions during embryo-genesis affected the expression of adult life-history traits, a mechanism by which fish may rapidly change the size of their propagules to the anticipated thermal offspring environment. This is a novel result explaining variation in these core life-history traits. © Inter-Research 2014.

VL  - 86

AB  - Studies of the relationship of performance and behavioral traits with environmental factors have tended to neglect interindividual variation even though quantification of this variation is fundamental to understanding how phenotypic traits can evolve. In ectotherms, functional integration of locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of the potential for coadaptation among these traits. For this reason, we analyzed interindividual variation, covariation, and repeatability of the thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed, preferred body temperature, thermal precision, and resting metabolic rate measured in ca. 200 common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) that varied by sex, age, and body size. We found significant interindividual variation in selected body temperatures and in the thermal performance curve of maximal sprint speed for both the intercept (expected trait value at the average temperature) and the slope (measure of thermal sensitivity). Interindividual differences in maximal sprint speed across temperatures, preferred body temperature, and thermal precision were significantly repeatable. A positive relationship existed between preferred body temperature and thermal precision, implying that individuals selecting higher temperatures were more precise. The resting metabolic rate was highly variable but was not related to thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed or thermal behavior. Thus, locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism were not directly functionally linked in the common lizard. © 2013 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

TI  - In Vivo Quantification Reveals Extensive Natural Variation in Mitochondrial Form and Function in Caenorhabditis briggsae
VL  - 7
IS  - 8
AB  - We have analyzed natural variation in mitochondrial form and function among a set of Caenorhabditis briggsae isolates known to harbor mitochondrial DNA structural variation in the form of a heteroplasmic nad5 gene deletion (nad5Δ) that correlates negatively with organismal fitness. We performed in vivo quantification of 24 mitochondrial phenotypes including reactive oxygen species level, membrane potential, and aspects of organelle morphology, and observed significant among-isolate variation in 18 traits. Although several mitochondrial phenotypes were non-linearly associated with nad5Δ levels, most of the among-isolate phenotypic variation could be accounted for by phylogeographic clade membership. In particular, isolate-specific mitochondrial membrane potential was an excellent predictor of clade membership. We interpret this result in light of recent evidence for local adaptation to temperature in C. briggsae. Analysis of mitochondrial-nuclear hybrid strains provided support for both mtDNA and nuclear genetic variation as drivers of natural mitochondrial phenotype variation. This study demonstrates that multicellular eukaryotic species are capable of extensive natural variation in organellar phenotypes and highlights the potential of integrating evolutionary and cell biology perspectives. © 2012 Hicks et al.

TI  - Patterns of maternal investment in spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata): Implications of trade-offs, scales of analyses, and incubation substrates
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-58
AB  - To maximize potential fitness, reproductive females should invest available resources in either larger propagules (egg and/or hatchling size) or more propagules (clutch size). Females may also enhance offspring performance by selecting nest sites with optimal conditions for the developing eggs. This study examined maternal investment in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Ontario, Canada over 2 y using radio telemetry, x-ray photography, and indirect assessments of hatchling fitness. Analyses were conducted at 2 scales (clutch and female), utilizing 2 measures of available resources (body size and body condition). Larger females produced wider eggs, and similarity in the slopes of egg width and maternal pelvic aperture on body size may indicate a physical constraint on egg size. However, body size did not explain variation in egg morphometrics (length, width, or mass) when considering the reproductive output of each female over the entire study. Instead, females in better body condition produced more eggs. With respect to nest site selection, no selection for thermal properties was observed, and females exhibited stronger fidelity to nest substrates than to nest locations. Hatchling righting response was not related to hatchling body size or condition, but hatchlings from a clutch performed similarly, indicating maternal genetic effects or an effect of nest conditions. Thus, females in good condition maximize the number of eggs produced over multiple years, and hatchling morphometrics may not directly influence hatchling success.

TI  - Thermotolerance adaptation to human-modified habitats occurs in the native range of the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata before long-distance dispersal
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SP  - 721-734
AB  - Key evolutionary events associated with invasion success are traditionally thought to occur in the introduced, rather than the native range of species. In the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata, however, a shift in reproductive system has been demonstrated within the native range, from the sexual non-dominant populations of natural habitats to the clonal dominant populations of human-modified habitats. Because abiotic conditions of human- modified habitats are hotter and dryer, we performed lab experiments on workers from a set of native and introduced populations, to investigate whether these ecological and genetic transitions were accompanied by a change in thermotolerance and whether such changes occurred before establishment in the introduced range. Thermotolerance levels were higher in native populations from human-modified habitats than in native populations from natural habitats, but were similar in native and introduced populations from human-modified habitats. Differences in thermotolerance could not be accounted for by differences in body size. A scenario based on local adaptation in the native range before introduction in remote areas represents the most parsimonious hypothesis to account for the observed phenotypic pattern. These findings highlight the importance of human land use in explaining major contemporary evolutionary changes. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Regional climate projections of extreme heat events in nine pilot Canadian communities for public health planning
VL  - 52
IS  - 12
SP  - 2669-2698
AB  - Public health planning needs the support of evidence-based information on current and future climate, which could be used by health professionals and decision makers to better understand and respond to the health impacts of extreme heat. Climate models provide information regarding the expected increase in temperatures and extreme heat events with climate change and can help predict the severity of future health impacts, which can be used in the public health sector for the development of adaptation strategies to reduce heat-related morbidity and mortality. This study analyzes the evolution of extreme temperature indices specifically defined to characterize heat events associated with health risks, in the context of a changing climate. The analysis is performed by using temperature projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model. A quantile-based statistical correction is applied to the projected temperatures, in order to reduce model biases and account for the representativeness error. Moreover, generalized Pareto distributions are used to extend the temperature distribution upper tails and extrapolate the statistical correction to extremes that are not observed in the present but that might occur in the future. The largest increase in extreme daytime temperatures occurs in southern Manitoba, Canada, where the already overly dry climate and lack of soil moisture can lead to an uncontrolled enhancement of hot extremes. The occurrence of warm nights and heat waves, on the other hand, is already large and will increase substantially in the communities of the Great Lakes region, characterized by a humid climate. Impact and adaptation studies need to account for the temperature variability due to local effects, since it can be considerably larger than the model natural variability. © 2013 American Meteorological Society.

VL  - 60

SP  - 6352-6361
AB  - Microstructural evolution determined by mechanical testing is usually modelled from perceived mechanisms of work hardening during dislocation passage and storage in complex arrays. The predicted stress strain behaviour is then compared with the measured one. Recently a new functional constitutive relation was derived by Saimoto and Van Houtte based on Taylor slip analysis that is optimally fitted to replicate the measured data. The curve fitting parameters arise from the incremental strain Delta gamma producing a mean slip distance lambda and the retained dislocation density rho assessed from the flow stress tau. A method has been derived to precisely determine lambda from the measured data. Moreover, the yield stress determined from the optimum curve fitting is derived from strains beyond the yield point and, hence, has the capacity to separate the solid solution and grain size effects from that of the yield phenomenon. Typically two fit curves are required, the intersection of which defines tau(3), gamma(3) and lambda(3), akin to the stage II to stage III transition in single crystals. A tabulation of these parameters permits reproduction of the mechanical curves. Furthermore, a plot of flow stress tau vs. 1/lambda results in a description of work hardening evolution onto which the inverse cell size 1/d(C) can be superimposed. Using the results from standard materials testing practice the temperature dependence and evolution of the pertinent parameters show that point defect drag effects are prominent below 273 K for AA1100 but not for AA5754.

VL  - 124
IS  - 6
SP  - 740-744
AB  - Background: The mortality impacts of hot and cold temperatures have been thoroughly documented, with most locations reporting a U-shaped relationship with a minimum mortality temperature (MMT) at which mortality is lowest. How MMT may have evolved over previous decades as the global mean surface temperature has increased has not been thoroughly explored. Objective: We used observations of daily mean temperatures to investigate whether MMT changed in Stockholm, Sweden, from the beginning of the 20th century until 2009. Methods: Daily mortality and temperature data for the period 1901–2009 in Stockholm, Sweden, were used to model the temperature–mortality relationship. We estimated MMT using distributed lag nonlinear Poisson regression models considering lags up to 21 days of daily mean temperature as the exposure variable. To avoid large influences on the MMT from intra- and interannual climatic variability, we estimated MMT based on 30-year periods. Furthermore, we investigated whether there were trends in the absolute value of the MMT and in the relative value of the MMT (the corresponding percentile of the same-day temperature distribution) over the study period. Results: Our findings suggest that both the absolute MMT and the relative MMT increased in Stockholm, Sweden, over the course of the 20th century. Conclusions: The increase in the MMT over the course of the 20th century suggests autonomous adaptation within the context of the large epidemiological, demographical, and societal changes that occurred. Whether the rate of increase will be sustained with climate change is an open question. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.

Results indicated sea cucumbers fed with diets containing 0.05 and 0.25 g HK L-137 kg−1 diets showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher body weight gain and specific growth rate than other groups. Sea cucumbers fed with diets containing 0.05 and 0.25 g HK L-137 kg−1 diets showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher protease activity than control group. Higher amylase, lysozyme and phagocytic activities were found in 0.25 g HK L-137 kg−1 diet group. Higher superoxide dismutase enzyme and alkaline phosphatase activity was found in 0.05 g HK L-137 kg−1. While no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were found in acid phosphatase activity. These results suggested that dietary supplementation of 0.05 g HK L-137 kg−1 diets would have benefit on growth, digestive enzymes and several non-specific immune parameters of sea cucumber. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

SP  - 1713-1718
AB  - Accessing the thermo-mechanical response of large deep Hot Dry Rock (HDR) reservoirs during geothermal extraction remains a challenging task that can be comprehended with numerical tools. Of crucial importance to the economic viability of these HDR reservoirs is the knowledge of thermal output evolution, fluid excessive pressure and induced thermal stress, at various steps of the circulation tests. Thermal recovery from a HDR reservoir, viewed as a deformable fractured medium, is investigated with a focus on the assumption of Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE). To this end, a fully coupled finite element formulation for a thermoelastic fractured medium in LTNE is developed (Gelet et al. 2013). Hydraulic diffusion, thermal diffusion, forced convection and deformation are considered in a two-phase framework, the solid phase being made by impermeable solid blocks separated by saturated fractures. Each of the two phases is endowed with its own temperature. The resulting system of equations is used to address a generic HDR reservoir subjected to temperature and pressure gradients. A change of time profile of the outlet fluid temperature is observed as the fracture spacing increases, switching from a single-step pattern to a double-step pattern, a feature which is viewed as characteristic of established LTNE.A dimensionless number is proposed to delineate between Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE) and non-equilibrium. This number embodies local physical properties of the mixture, elements of the geometry of the reservoir and the production flow rate. All the above properties being fixed, the resulting fracture spacing threshold between LTNE and LTE is found to decrease with increasing porosity. The thermally induced effective stress is tensile near the injection well, illustrating the thermal contraction of the rock, while the pressure contribution of the fracture fluid is negligible during the late period. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

TI  - Early stage oxynitridation process of Si(001) surface by NO gas: Reactive molecular dynamics simulation study
VL  - 119
IS  - 12
AB  - Initial stage of oxynitridation process of Si substrate is of crucial importance in fabricating the ultrathin gate dielectric layer of high quality in advanced MOSFET devices. The oxynitridation reaction on a relaxed Si(001) surface is investigated via reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A total of 1120 events of a single nitric oxide (NO) molecule reaction at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 K are statistically analyzed. The observed reaction kinetics are consistent with the previous experimental or calculation results, which show the viability of the reactive MD technique to study the NO dissociation reaction on Si. We suggest the reaction pathway for NO dissociation that is characterized by the inter-dimer bridge of a NO molecule as the intermediate state prior to NO dissociation. Although the energy of the inter-dimer bridge is higher than that of the intra-dimer one, our suggestion is supported by the ab initio nudged elastic band calculations showing that the energy barrier for the inter-dimer bridge formation is much lower. The growth mechanism of an ultrathin Si oxynitride layer is also investigated via consecutive NO reactions simulation. The simulation reveals the mechanism of self-limiting reaction at low temperature and the time evolution of the depth profile of N and O atoms depending on the process temperature, which would guide to optimize the oxynitridation process condition.

TI  - A short history of the iron and steel industry in central Europe during the Roman iron age
SP  - 72-77
AB  - Metallurgy includes the oldest branch of technology and science of the humanity. Starting with discovering of the first metals till the actual nanostructures and special alloyed materials, the evolution of the metallurgy is fascinating. The ferrous metallurgy had a fast evolution during time. The technical processes are in continuous changing, depending on humanity demands. The present article limits only to some milestones regarding the evolution of the thermal aggregates used for iron manufacturing. There are presented some processing technologies of iron ore in Europe, starting with the proto-metallurgy, when the used row material was the meteorite iron. At the beginning, human believed that everything must remain hidden in the basement. Also, the entire equipment was rudimentary, constructed by wood, burned clay or iron and had specific forms, seemingly a cavity. Later, humanity began to understand the iron ore importance, starting to use iron for many activities. Being such a big demand, there has been an evolution of the iron ore processing instruments that has reflected in materials, shape and techniques. The main objective was to ease people's work and to increase their productivity. The article has in view the primary extractive processes and the processing methods as puddling, forging or casting. In the context of Central European ferrous metallurgy, it is interesting to have a perspective view of the processes evolution, by comparing the rudimentary techniques with the modern ones, to understand better where we come from and where we are heading.

TI  - Landscape genetic approaches to guide native plant restoration in the Mojave Desert:
VL  - 27
IS  - 2
SP  - 429-445
AB  - Restoring dryland ecosystems is a global challenge due to synergistic drivers of disturbance coupled with unpredictable environmental conditions. Dryland plant species have evolved complex life-history strategies to cope with fluctuating resources and climatic extremes. Although rarely quantified, local adaptation is likely widespread among these species and potentially influences restoration outcomes. The common practice of reintroducing propagules to restore dryland ecosystems, often across large spatial scales, compels evaluation of adaptive divergence within these species. Such evaluations are critical to understanding the consequences of large-scale manipulation of gene flow and to predicting success of restoration efforts. However, genetic information for species of interest can be difficult and expensive to obtain through traditional common garden experiments. Recent advances in landscape genetics offer marker-based approaches for identifying environmental drivers of adaptive genetic variability in non-model species, but tools are still needed to link these approaches with practical aspects of ecological restoration. Here, we combine spatially explicit landscape genetics models with flexible visualization tools to demonstrate how cost-effective evaluations of adaptive genetic divergence can facilitate implementation of different seed sourcing strategies in ecological restoration. We apply these methods to Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers genotyped in two Mojave Desert shrub species of high restoration importance: the long-lived, wind-pollinated gymnosperm Ephedra nevadensis, and the short-lived, insect-pollinated angiosperm Sphaeralcea ambigua. Mean annual temperature was identified as an important driver of adaptive genetic divergence for both species. Ephedra showed stronger adaptive divergence with respect to precipitation variability, while temperature variability and precipitation averages explained a larger fraction of adaptive divergence in Sphaeralcea. We describe multivariate statistical approaches for interpolating spatial patterns of adaptive divergence while accounting for potential bias due to neutral genetic structure. Through a spatial bootstrapping procedure, we also visualize patterns in the magnitude of model uncertainty. Finally, we introduce an interactive, distance-based mapping approach that explicitly links marker-based models of adaptive divergence with local or admixture seed sourcing strategies, promoting effective native plant restoration. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - The effects of selection, drift and genetic variation on life-history trait divergence among insular populations of natterjack toad, Bufo calamita
VL  - 19
IS  - 11
SP  - 2229-2240
AB  - Although loss of genetic variation is frequently assumed to be associated with loss of adaptive potential, only few studies have examined adaptation in populations with little genetic variation. On the Swedish west coast, the northern fringe populations of the natterjack toad Bufo calamita inhabit an atypical habitat consisting of offshore rock islands. There are strong among-population differences in the amount of neutral genetic variation, making this system suitable for studies on mechanisms of trait divergence along a gradient of within-population genetic variation. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of population divergence using QST-FST comparisons and correlations between quantitative and neutral genetic variation. Our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the six populations included in this study, as indicated by low QST-F ST values, lack of significant population × temperature interactions and lack of significant differences among the islands in breeding pond size. The six populations included in this study differed in both neutral and quantitative genetic variation. Also, the correlations between neutral and quantitative genetic variation tended to be positive, however, the relatively small number of populations prevents any strong conclusions based on these correlations. Contrary to the majority of QST-FST comparisons, our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the examined populations. Furthermore, the low heritability of fitness-related traits may limit evolutionary responses in some of the populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Thermal ablative technologies have evolved considerably in the recent past and are now an important component of current clinical guidelines for the treatment of small renal masses. Both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation have intermediate-term oncologic control that rivals surgical options, with favorable complication profiles. Studies comparing cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation show no significant difference in oncologic control or complication profile between the two modalities. Early data from small series with microwave ablation have shown similar promising results. Newer technologies including irreversible electroporation and high-intensity-focused ultrasound have theoretical advantages, but will require further research before becoming a routine part of the ablation armamentarium. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the current ablative technologies available, briefly review their mechanisms of action, discuss technical aspects of each, and provide current data supporting their use. © 2014 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Unified framework for quasispecies evolution and stochastic quantization
VL  - 83
IS  - 5
AB  - In this paper we provide a unified framework for quasispecies evolution and stochastic quantization. We map the biological evolution described by the quasispecies equation to the stochastic dynamics of an ensemble of particles undergoing a creation-annihilation process. We show that this mapping identifies a natural decomposition of the probability that an individual has a certain genotype into eigenfunctions of the evolutionary operator. This alternative approach to study the quasispecies equation allows for a generalization of the Fisher theorem equivalent to the Price equation. According to this relation the average fitness of an asexual population increases with time proportional to the variance of the eigenvalues of the evolutionary operator. Moreover, from the present alternative formulation of stochastic quantization a novel scenario emerges to be compared with existing approaches. The evolution of an ensemble of particles undergoing diffusion and a creation-annihilation process is parametrized by a variable β that we call the inverse temperature of the stochastic dynamics. We find that the evolution equation at high temperatures is simply related to the Schrödinger equation, but at low temperature it strongly deviates from it. In the presence of additional noise in scattering processes between the particles, the evolution reaches a steady state described by the Bose-Einstein statistics. © 2011 American Physical Society.

VL  - 107

SP  - 281-298
AB  - A permanent snow cover for several months is typical for large parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Snow layers thicker than about 20 cm insulate the soil surface and stabilize the ground temperature close to 0°C. Many ground-living invertebrates are active at this temperature in the subnivean air space. From this "base camp", some invertebrates migrate upwards to use the snow as a substrate. The intranivean fauna consists of springtails (Collembola) and mites (Acari) that are small enough to move within the narrow pores between snow crystals. The supranivean fauna consists of various invertebrates that are active on the snow surface. Some of them are Collembola that have migrated through the snow layers. However, most of them are larger insects and spiders which migrate between the subnivean and supranivean habitats following air channels which are naturally created along tree stems, bushes etc. penetrating the snow. Likewise, certain Chironomidae and Plecoptera, hatching from winter-open rivers and brooks, are active on the snow surface. The supranivean arthropod fauna has the following characteristics: 1. It is a weather dependent assemblage of species, coming and going with changes in air temperature, cloud cover, and wind. Below ca. -6°C animals are absent, but at temperatures around or above zero, many groups can be simultaneously active on snow. 2. The snow surface fauna shows phenological changes throughout the winter, as certain species and groups are mainly active during certain months. 3. Some invertebrates are highly specialized and take advantage of the snow surface as an arena in their life cycle. Examples are Hypogastrura socialis (Collembola), and the two wingless insects Chionea sp. (Diptera: Limoniidae) and Boreus sp. (Mecoptera). They use the smooth snow surface for efficient migration. Chionea sp. and Boreus sp. lay their eggs during the snow-covered period, while H. socialis migrates to create new colonies. The cold tolerant spider Bolephthyphantes index is unique in constructing webs in small depressions on the snow, to catch migrating Collembola. Various adaptations for using the snow as a substrate are discussed. Besides physiological and morphological adaptations, snow surface arthropods show special behavioural adaptations. Most conspicuous is the ability of several Collembola species to navigate during migration, using the position of the sun for orientation. Furthermore, in Collembola and Mecoptera, jumping as an original mechanism to escape predators has independently evolved into a migrating mechanism. An evolutionary potential exists for more invertebrate groups to take advantage of snow as a substrate in their life cycle. For instance, several more cold tolerant spiders might evolve the ability to catch migrating Collembola on snow. © 2003 Institute of Entomology.

VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 135-153
AB  - Changes in body size inversely related to ambient temperatures have been described in woodrats (Neotoma) over time scales ranging from decades to millennia. However, climate-mediated variation in other traits has not been evaluated, and the effects of precipitation have been overlooked. We assessed variation in skull morphology among bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea) over two sampling transects spanning coastal rainforest and interior desert environments to determine whether skull morphology varied with climate. We also tested whether previously described size-temperature relationships could be generalized to our study populations. In both transects, linear measurements of functionally significant traits differed between coastal and interior populations. Geometric morphometric analyses of shape confirmed some of those differences and revealed additional patterns of skull variation. Variation in some linear measurements, including body size, was predicted by climate. However, body and skull size, as well as measurements of skull components, displayed varying responses. Although longitudinal patterns of body size variation supported Bergmann's rule, skull size variation was only weakly associated with climate. The strongest phenotypic responses to climate were those of auditory, dental, and palatal skull traits. Altogether, our findings suggest that geographic variation in temperature and precipitation mediated selective heterogeneity and plasticity in skull traits associated with food processing and sensory organs in N. cinerea. This was consistent with our expectation of resource-dependent phenotypic variation among populations in environments with highly contrasting climatic regimes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Thickening of arc lithosphere influences the extent of magmatic differentiation and is thereby important for the evolution of juvenile arcs into mature continental crust. Here, we use mantle xenoliths from the late Mesozoic Sierra Nevada continental arc in California (USA) to constrain the pressure, temperature, and compositional evolution of the deep lithosphere beneath a mature arc. These xenoliths consist of spinel peridotites and garnet-bearing spinel peridotites. The former are characterized by coarse-grained protogranular textures having bulk compositions indicative of high-degree melting. The latter are characterized by porphyroclastic textures, garnet coronas around spinels, garnet exsolution lamellae in pyroxenes, and pyroxenes with high-Al cores and low-Al rims. The garnet-bearing spinel peridotites range from depleted to fertile compositions, but the high Cr-numbers [molar Cr/(Cr + Al)] of spinel cores reflect high-degree melting. These observations suggest that the protoliths of the garnet-bearing spinel peridotites were melt-depleted spinel peridotites. Constraints from geothermobarometry and bulk compositions coupled with mantle melting models suggest that the protoliths underwent shallow melt depletion (1-2 GPa, 1300-1400°C), followed by compression, cooling, and final equilibration within the garnet stability field (~3 GPa, <800°C). The deepest equilibrated samples are the most refertilized, suggesting that refertilization occurred during compression. We interpret this P-T-composition path to reflect progressive thickening of the Sierran arc lithosphere perhaps as a result of magmatic inflation or tectonic thickening. We hypothesize that newly formed arc lithospheric mantle thickens enough to pinch out the asthenospheric wedge, juxtaposing Sierran arc lithosphere against the subducting oceanic plate. This could have terminated arc magmatism and initiated cooling of the deep Sierran lithosphere. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

VL  - 25

SP  - 4450-4460
AB  - What limits a species' distribution in the absence of physical barriers? Genetic load due to asymmetric gene flow and the absence of genetic variation due to lack of gene flow are hypothesized to constrain adaptation to novel environments in marginal populations, preventing range expansion. Here, we examined the genetic structure and geographic variation in morphological traits in two damselflies (Ischnura asiatica and I. senegalensis) along a latitudinal gradient in Japan, which is the distribution centre of I. asiatica and the northern limit of I. senegalensis. Genomewide genetic analyses found a loss of genetic diversity at the edge of distribution in I. senegalensis but consistently high diversity in I. asiatica. Gene flow was asymmetric in a south-north direction in both species. Although body size and wing loading showed decreasing latitudinal clines (smaller in north) in I. asiatica in Japan, increasing latitudinal clines (larger in north) in these phenotypic markers were observed in I. senegalensis, particularly near the northern boundary, which coincided well with the location where genetic diversity began a sharp decline. In ectothermic animals, increasing latitudinal cline in these traits was suggested to be established when they failed to adapt to thermal gradient. Therefore, our findings support the possibility that a lack of genetic variation rather than geneflow swamping is responsible for the constraint of adaptation at the margin of geographic distribution. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Selection of a new scallop strain, the Bohai Red, from the hybrid between the bay scallop and the Peruvian scallop
VL  - 479
SP  - 250-255
AB  - In our previous studies, inter-specific hybrid F1 with significant heterosis in growth was produced by hybridizing the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians with the Peruvian scallop, A. purpuratus. However, due to the hermaphroditic nature of the two Argopecten scallops, it is difficult to produce the hybrid seed at large scales. To efficiently utilize the genetic resources of the two scallops, this study aimed to breed a new scallop strain from the hybrids. The key step in the selection was the breeding of the F1 generation from the hybrid cohort, most of which were both male- and female-sterile. A small cohort of F1 with normal male- and female-fertility was produced through mass spawning of a large cohort of hybrids. The F2–F6 cohorts were reproduced with size- and color-selected brood stocks from the F1–F5 cohort, respectively. The results showed that, compared with the control bay scallop cohorts, the average shell height, average whole body weight and average adductor muscle weight were increased by 15.6%, 37.9% and 40.7% in F1, by 14.7%, 33.9% and 43.6% in F2, by 14.1%, 33.1% and 38.4% in F3, by 11.7%, 38.8% and 49.3% in F4, by 12.2%, 37.9% and 53.8% in F5, by 18.5%, 42.6% and 75% in F6, respectively. After six generations of selection, the median lethal temperature range was expanded from 3.0–29.0 °C in F1 to 0 °C–29.1 °C in F6, suggesting that the selected strain can be reared in most waters of China, especially in Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea. Thus, through continuous selection on size and color, we have obtained a superior strain from the hybrids between the bay scallop and the Peruvian scallop, which is named ‘Bohai Red’. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The translocation of populations within their natural distribution ranges to instigate crossings between genetic stocks may enhance adaptive potential and resilience. Colonies of the reef-building coral, Acropora millepora, collected in the warmer central Great Barrier Reef (GBR) were experimentally crossed with conspecific colonies from the cooler southern GBR. Fertilisation success was high in all purebred and regional hybrid crosses (>83 %). After 4 months in the field at the southern location, survival rates differed as follows: native purebreds > regional hybrids > central GBR purebreds. The southern GBR purebreds were smaller at settlement compared with the other groups, but this difference disappeared towards the end of the grow-out period. While no benefit of genetic mixing in the F1 generation of this species was evident from our work, it is possible that hybrid vigour exists for other traits, such as thermal tolerance, and over different spatial scales, for different species, or in later generations. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Phenotypic evidence for local adaptation to heat stress in the marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly Tegula) funebralis
VL  - 448
SP  - 360-366
AB  - Southern California (USA) populations of the intertidal marine snail Chlorostoma (formerly Tegula) funebralis generally occupy warmer climates and are exposed to high air temperatures during low tides more often than northern California populations. Available genetic data suggest there is extensive gene flow across a broad range of C funebralis populations, so it is unclear if populations can adapt to differences in local environments. To test for population-specific responses to heat stress, three phenotypic assays were performed on three northern and on three southern populations of C. funebralis, after acclimation to common-garden conditions in the laboratory. Thermal drop-down, heat stress mortality, and heat stress reattachment assays were designed to evaluate ecologically relevant phenotypic responses to heat stress; these assays assessed tolerance during, mortality following, and speed of recovery following heat stress. The latter two tests indicate that southern populations consistently suffer significantly lower mortality and recover significantly more quickly following heat stress compared to northern populations. Hierarchical cluster analysis of stress response data clearly identified northern California and southern California regional groupings of populations. Thus, these results indicate that southern populations have higher tolerance to heat stress than northern populations and suggest that adaptation to local environmental differences can evolve despite moderate potential for larval dispersal in this species. Accounting for intraspecific population variation in thermal tolerance may provide important insights for predicting how species distributions will respond to global warming. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Summary: When a species experiences a new climate, it can adapt in two main ways: become genetically adapted to the new temperature, or adopt a plastic approach that allows it to survive at a range of temperatures. The constraint on fitness for genetically adapted populations that are exposed to a new temperature has been well studied, but the range of optimal temperatures and their effect on fitness has never been examined across the worldwide distribution of a plastic species. Here, we determined the optimum temperature range of 11 populations of the phenotypically plastic species Drosophila simulans. We measured the influence of temperature on eggs, larvae and adults at six temperatures that span the natural range the flies experience during their primary breeding season. We found no correlation between optimum temperature and native temperature, an effect that is not likely due to laboratory maintenance, suggesting that the species has not locally adapted to temperature. We also found that this species had equal survival and reproductive success at most of the temperatures and life stages that we tested, regardless of the native temperature where the flies originated. Thus, this genetically plastic species has an optimum fitness at a surprisingly wide range of temperatures, and is the first example of a cosmopolitan species exhibiting this large amount of plasticity across its sampling distribution. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

VL  - 183

SP  - 875-886
AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors but little is known about the combined effects of environmental warming and invasive species on ecosystem functioning. We quantified thermal preferences and then compared leaf-litter processing rates at eight different temperatures (5.0–22.5 °C) by the invasive freshwater crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus and the Great Britain native Gammarus pulex at a range of body sizes. D. villosus preferred warmer temperatures but there was considerable overlap in the range of temperatures that the two species occupied during preference trials. When matched for size, G. pulex had a greater leaf shredding efficiency than D. villosus, suggesting that invasion and subsequent displacement of the native amphipod will result in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, D. villosus is an inherently larger species and interspecific variation in shredding was reduced when animals of a representative size range were compared. D. villosus shredding rates increased at a faster rate than G. pulex with increasing temperature suggesting that climate change may offset some of the reduction in function. D. villosus, but not G. pulex, showed evidence of an ability to select those temperatures at which its shredding rate was maximised, and the activation energy for shredding in D. villosus was more similar to predictions from metabolic theory. While per capita and mass-corrected shredding rates were lower in the invasive D. villosus than the native G. pulex, our study provides novel insights in to how the interactive effects of metabolic function, body size, behavioural thermoregulation, and density produce antagonistic effects between anthropogenic stressors. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - The evolution of protein moonlighting: Adaptive traps and promiscuity in the chaperonins
VL  - 42
IS  - 6
SP  - 1709-1714
AB  - Moonlighting proteins exhibit functions that are alternative to their main role in the cell. Heat-shock proteins, also known as molecular chaperones, are now recognized for their wide range of activities in and/or outside the cell, being prominent examples of moonlighting proteins. Chaperonins are highly conserved molecular chaperones that fold other proteins into their native conformation allowing them to carry out essential functions in the cell. Activities alternative to folding have been reported for the chaperonin (Cpn) 60 protein. Preservation of various alternative functions in one protein conflicts with the optimization of each of the functions. What evolutionary mechanisms have allowed the persistence of moonlighting proteins, and in particular the chaperonins, remains a mystery. In the present article, I argue that mechanisms that increase the resistance of phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations enable the persistence of a reservoir of genetic variants, each potentially codifying for a distinct function. Gene duplication is one such mechanism that has characterized the expansion and has been concomitant with the emergence of novel functions in these protein families. Indeed, Cpn60 performs a large list of folding-independent functions, including roles in the transmission of viruses from insects to plants and stimulation of the immune system, among others. In addition to the innovation promoted by gene duplication, I discuss that the Cpn60 protein comprises a hidden amino acid combinatorial code that may well be responsible for its ability to develop novel functions while maintaining an optimized folding ability. The present review points to a complex model of evolution of protein moonlighting. © 2014 Biochemical Society.

TI  - Adaptation to a latitudinal thermal gradient within a widespread copepod species: The contributions of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity
VL  - 284
IS  - 1853
AB  - Understanding how populations adapt to heterogeneous thermal regimes is essential for comprehending how latitudinal gradients in species diversification are formed, and how taxa will respond to ongoing climate change. Adaptation can occur by innate genetic factors, by phenotypic plasticity, or by a combination of both mechanisms. Yet, the relative contribution of such mechanisms to large-scale latitudinal gradients of thermal tolerance across conspecific populations remains unclear. We examine thermal performance in 11 populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus, ranging from Baja California Sur (Mexico) to British Columbia (Canada). Common garden experiments show that survivorship to acute heat-stress differs between populations (by up to 3.8°C in LD50 values), reflecting a strong genetic thermal adaptation. Using a split-brood experiment with two rearing temperatures, we also show that developmental phenotypic plasticity is beneficial to thermal tolerance (by up to 1.3°C), and that this effect differs across populations. Although genetic divergence in heat tolerance strongly correlates with latitude and temperature, differences in the plastic response do not. In the context of climate warming, our results confirm the general prediction that low-latitude populations aremost susceptible to local extinction because genetic adaptation has placed physiological limits closer to current environmental maxima, but our results also contradict the prediction that phenotypic plasticity is constrained at lower latitudes. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity allows the Mediterranean parsley frog Pelodytes punctatus to exploit two temporal niches under continuous gene flow
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SP  - 876-886
AB  - Environmental changes, such as climate change, lead to the opening of new niches. In such situations, species that adapt to new niches can survive and/or expand their ranges. However, gene flow can hamper genetic adaptation to new environments. Alternatively, recent models have highlighted the importance of phenotypic plasticity in tracking environmental change. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic plasticity or genetic evolution (or both) allows an amphibian species to exploit two divergent climatic niches. In the Mediterranean region, the parsley frog Pelodytes punctatus breeds both in spring, as do most other species, and in autumn, a temporal niche not exploited by most other species, but which may become increasingly important with global warming. Conditions of development are dramatically different between the two seasons and deeply impact tadpole life-history traits. To determine whether these temporal niches are exploited by two genetically differentiated subpopulations, or whether the bimodal phenology arises in a panmictic population displaying plastic life-history traits, we use two complementary approaches. We measure both molecular genetic differentiation and quantitative-trait differentiation between spring and autumn cohorts, using microsatellites and common garden experiments, respectively. Seasonal cohorts were not genetically differentiated and differences in tadpole life history between cohorts were not maintained in laboratory conditions. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity, rather than genetic adaptation, allows Parsley frog to exploit two contrasting temporal niches. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Parabolic variation in sexual selection intensity across the range of a cold-water pipefish: implications for susceptibility to climate change
VL  - 23
IS  - 9
SP  - 3600-3609
AB  - While an understanding of evolutionary processes in shifting environments is vital in the context of rapid ecological change, one of the most potent selective forces, sexual selection, remains curiously unexplored. Variation in sexual selection across a species range, especially across a gradient of temperature regimes, has the potential to provide a window into the possible impacts of climate change on the evolution of mating patterns. Here, we investigated some of the links between temperature and indicators of sexual selection, using a cold-water pipefish as model. We found that populations differed with respect to body size, length of the breeding season, fecundity, and sexual dimorphism across a wide latitudinal gradient. We encountered two types of latitudinal patterns, either linear, when related to body size, or parabolic in shape when considering variables related to sexual selection intensity, such as sexual dimorphism and reproductive investment. Our results suggest that sexual selection intensity increases toward both edges of the distribution and that the large differences in temperature likely play a significant role. Shorter breeding seasons in the north and reduced periods for gamete production in the south certainly have the potential to alter mating systems, breeding synchrony, and mate monopolization rates. As latitude and water temperature are tightly coupled across the European coasts, the observed patterns in traits related to sexual selection can lead to predictions regarding how sexual selection should change in response to climate change. Based on data from extant populations, we can predict that as the worm pipefish moves northward, a wave of decreasing selection intensity will likely replace the strong sexual selection at the northern range margin. In contrast, the southern populations will be followed by heightened sexual selection, which may exacerbate the problem of local extinction at this retreating boundary. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Effects of cold selective breeding on the body length, fatty acid content, and productivity of the tropical copepod Apocyclops royi (Cyclopoida, Copepoda)
VL  - 39
IS  - 6
SP  - 994-1003
AB  - In this study, we conducted a novel approach of selective breeding by using temperature acclimation to enhance the aquaculture potential of the tropical cyclopoid copepod Apocyclops royi. Two copepod culture strains were acclimated separately at high (28°C, control strain) and low (18°C, selective strain) temperature for 10 months, corresponding to ∼40 and 15 generations, respectively. After temperature acclimation, multigenerational observations were made to investigate the effects of cold selection on the copepods. Differences in female and nauplius lengths, nauplius production, and fatty acid contents were evaluated between the control and selective strains before (F0) and during the multigenerational observation (F1-F4). Overall, the selective strain exhibited larger females, higher nauplius production, but smaller nauplii than the control strain did. In generation F1, the total fatty acid and omega 6 and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were higher in the selective strain than in the control strain; however, the fatty acid content gradually decreased in subsequent generations. This paper reports the effects of temperature acclimation on the morphological and physiological traits of A. royi and provides preliminary suggestions for improving its productivity and nutritional value as "designer feed" for aquaculture applications. © The Author 2017.

TI  - A new platform for ultra-high density Staphylococcus aureus transposon libraries
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Staphylococcus aureus readily develops resistance to antibiotics and achieving effective therapies to overcome resistance requires in-depth understanding of S. aureus biology. High throughput, parallel-sequencing methods for analyzing transposon mutant libraries have the potential to revolutionize studies of S. aureus, but the genetic tools to take advantage of the power of next generation sequencing have not been fully developed. Results: Here we report a phage-based transposition system to make ultra-high density transposon libraries for genome-wide analysis of mutant fitness in any 11-transducible S. aureus strain. The high efficiency of the delivery system has made it possible to multiplex transposon cassettes containing different regulatory elements in order to make libraries in which genes are over- or under-expressed as well as deleted. By incorporating transposon-specific barcodes into the cassettes, we can evaluate how null mutations and changes in gene expression levels affect fitness in a single sequencing data set. Demonstrating the power of the system, we have prepared a library containing more than 690,000 unique insertions. Because one unique feature of the phage-based approach is that temperature-sensitive mutants are retained, we have carried out a genome-wide study of S. aureus genes involved in withstanding temperature stress. We find that many genes previously identified as essential are temperature sensitive and also identify a number of genes that, when disrupted, confer a growth advantage at elevated temperatures. Conclusions: The platform described here reliably provides mutant collections of unparalleled genotypic diversity and will enable a wide range of functional genomic studies in S. aureus. © Santiago et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

TI  - Interpopulational variation in chemosensory responses to selected steroids from femoral secretions of male lizards, Podarcis hispanica, mirrors population differences in chemical signals
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SP  - 65-73
AB  - Chemical signals are important for mate and species recognition. If variation in chemical signals occurs between populations of the same species, these differences could later preclude mating between populations and lead to speciation. In the Iberian wall lizard, Podarcis hispanica, the lipophilic fraction of femoral secretions of males is mainly a mix of steroids and fatty acids. Among steroids, the most abundant compounds are cholesterol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol, which are implicated in intraspecific communication and sexual selection. Interpopulational differences in chemical signals of males, and in response to these chemicals, could contribute to reproductive isolation between populations, which would explain the known genetic differences between these populations. Chemical analyses indicated that five distinct populations of this lizard from Madrid (Central Spain) differed in the proportions of two steroids (cholesterol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol) in femoral secretions. Moreover, lizards discriminated and had high chemosensory responses (i. e., high tongue-flick rates) to these steroids, but showed interpopulational differences. Lizards from populations with cold temperatures and high relative humidity (i. e., northern Madrid) elicited higher responses to these steroids, whereas the converse occurred for lizards from populations occupying dry and hot habitats (i. e., southern Madrid). Interestingly, the magnitude of the chemosensory responses to cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol in each population mirrored the abundance of this compound in secretions of males of that population. These results suggest that the importance of cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol in males' secretions might be lower for lizards from the southern populations. These differences in the relative importance of chemical signals could explain reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between populations of this lizard. © 2011 Springer Basel AG.

TI  - Diachronous Palaeoproterozoic deformation and metamorphism in the Committee Bay belt, Rae Province, Nunavut: insights from 40Ar-39Ar cooling ages and thermal modelling
VL  - 28
IS  - 5
SP  - 439-457
AB  - Regional-scale 40Ar-39Ar data presented in this paper reveal significant across-strike and along-strike age differences in the Committee Bay belt (CBb), Rae Province, Nunavut, Canada, that complement variations in observed monazite ages. 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages are c. 1795, 1775, and 1750 Ma in the western, eastern and central parts of the Prince Albert Group (PAG) domain respectively. The migmatite domain and Walker Lake intrusive complex are characterized by c. 1750-1730 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages without significant along-strike variation. The 40Ar-39Ar data provide important constraints on the cooling history and on thermal modelling that elucidates the controls on diachroneity and metamorphic patterns within the belt. In the western CBb, prograde monazite growth occurred 26 ± 10 Myr earlier in the migmatite domain (1864 ± 9 Ma; peak P-T = 5 kbar-700 °C) than in the PAG domain (1838 ± 5 Ma; peak P-T = 5 kbar-580 °C). Calculations indicate that this earlier monazite growth results from tectonic thickening of higher heat productivity Archean lithologies in the migmatite domain, which undergoes more rapid prograde heating than the less radiogenetic and lower grade rocks of the PAG domain. Granite generation via biotite dehydration melting at 800 °C and 20 km depth is predicted to occur c. 1835 Ma, in agreement with geochronological constraints. The tectonic burial of crustal domains with contrasting radiogenic properties also explains the general congruence of lower to upper amphibolite facies metamorphic zones generated during the two main orogenic cycles (i.e. M2-D1 and M3-D2). The modelled timing of prograde monazite growth in the migmatite domain suggests that D2 tectonic thickening began at 1872 ± 9 Ma, some 8 ± 3 Myr before monzazite growth, coeval with the inferred time of collision of the Meta Incognita terrane with the southern Rae Province. Along-strike diachroneity, reflected in 25 Myr younger monazite and 40Ar-39Ar hornblende ages in the eastern relative to the western PAG domain, cannot be accounted for by heat productivity contrasts along the belt. Instead the younger deformation and metamorphism in the eastern CBb was driven by its proximity to the eastern promontory of the Superior Province which collided with the Rae Province at c. 1820 Ma. The 40Ar-39Ar data presented here support the interpretation that the youngest monazite in the CBb crystallized at c. 1790 Ma in the central CBb when this part of the belt was downfolded into a gentle synformal structure while the western part of the belt cooled through 40Ar-39Ar hornblende closure. The results of this study illustrate the important influence of contrasting rock properties on the thermal evolution of orogenic belts and on the temporal record of this evolution. © 2010 Crown in the right of Canada.

VL  - 87

AB  - Temperature affects multiple aspects of an organism''s biology and thus defines a major axis of the fundamental niche. For ectotherms, variation in the thermal environment is particularly important because most of these taxa have a limited capacity to thermoregulate via metabolic heat production. While temperature affects all life-history stages, stages can differ in their ability to respond to the thermal environment. For example, in oviparous organisms, free-living adults can behaviorally thermoregulate, whereas developing embryos are at the mercy of the nest environment. These differences in the realized thermal environment should select for life-history stages to have different thermal tolerances, although this has been rarely examined. I tested the hypothesis that stage-specific thermal reaction norms can evolve independently by using southern alligator lizards (Elgaria multicarinata, Anguidae). Using incubation experiments (five temperatures: 24 degrees degrees, 26 degrees degrees, 28 degrees degrees, 30 degrees degrees, and 32 degrees degrees C), I described the thermal reaction norm for embryonic development and compared these results to previous studies on the thermal ecology of adults. Offspring survivorship and morphology were similarly affected by incubation temperature. While developing embryos had the same optimum temperature as adults (approximately 28 degrees degrees C), the breadth of their thermal reaction norms differed. My results suggest that developing embryos of E. multicarinata are more sensitive to variation in the average thermal environment than are adults. Variation in the thermal sensitivity of life-history stages might be common and has implications for how organisms respond to variation in the thermal environment. Identifying those life-history stages that are most sensitive/limiting will be important for developing models that best predict species'' responses to impending environmental change.

TI  - Do digger wasps time their provisioning activity to avoid cuckoo wasps (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae and Chrysididae)?
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-21
AB  - Strategies adopted by parasitoids and kleptoparasites co-evolve with the defensive adaptations of their hosts, and vice-versa. Hedychrum rutilans and Hedychrum nobile are brood parasites of, respectively, Philanthus triangulum and Cerceris arenaria, two digger wasps that share most aspects of their nesting biology (solitary females dig aggregated nests in the ground and mass-provision the brood with paralyzed insects). We tested the hypothesis that similarity in the hosts' nesting habits corresponds to similar defensive strategies against these cuckoo wasps. Peak provisioning activity by P. triangulum occurred in late afternoon (and early morning in 1 year) while peak H. rutilans activity was in early afternoon. In contrast, peak provisioning by C. arenaria and peak H. nobile activity occurred in early afternoon. Thus, P. triangulum (as previously found in other populations) appears to have timed its provisioning to avoid its brood parasite whereas C. arenaria did not, rejecting our hypothesis. The daily activity of both chrysidid wasps was positively correlated to air temperature. Host nest density positively affected only H. rutilans activity, in agreement with previous reports for other populations of this species, whereas the daily pattern of activity of the host was the key correlate with the activity of H. nobile. Mortality due to cuckoo wasps was low for both digger wasps, although it was somewhat higher at sites with many nests of P. triangulum. We suggest that perhaps the degree to which digger wasps time their activity to avoid cuckoo wasps is related to the degree of specialization in host choice by their brood parasite. H. rutilans is more highly dependent on P. triangulum, which may have had a greater effect on the timing of provision by its host. © 2010 Springer-Verlag and ISPA.

TI  - Chlorella for protein and biofuels: From strain selection to outdoor cultivation in a Green Wall Panel photobioreactor
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Chlorella is one of the few microalgae employed for human consumption. It typically has a high protein content, but it can also accumulate high amounts of lipids or carbohydrates under stress conditions and, for this reason, it is of interest in the production of biofuels. High production costs and energy consumption are associated with its cultivation. This work describes a strategy to reduce costs and environmental impact of Chlorella biomass production for food, biofuels and other applications. Results: The growth of four Chlorella strains, selected after a laboratory screening, was investigated outdoors in a low-cost 0.25 m2 GWP-II photobioreactor. The capacity of the selected strains to grow at high temperature was tested. On the basis of these results, in the nitrogen starvation trials the culture was cooled only when the temperature exceeded 40°C to allow for significant energy savings, and performed in a seawater-based medium to reduce the freshwater footprint. Under nutrient sufficiency, strain CH2 was the most productive. In all the strains, nitrogen starvation strongly reduced productivity, depressed protein and induced accumulation of carbohydrate (about 50%) in strains F&amp;M-M49 and IAM C-212, and lipid (40 - 45%) in strains PROD1 and CH2. Starved cultures achieved high storage product productivities: 0.12 g L-1 d -1 of lipids for CH2 and 0.19 g L-1 d-1 of carbohydrates for F&amp;M-M49. When extrapolated to large-scale in central Italy, CH2 showed a potential productivity of 41 t ha-1 y -1 for biomass, 16 t ha-1 y-1 for protein and 11 t ha-1 y-1 for lipid under nutrient sufficiency, and 8 t ha-1 y-1 for lipid under nitrogen starvation. Conclusions: The environmental and economic sustainability of Chlorella production was enhanced by growing the organisms in a seawater-based medium, so as not to compete with crops for freshwater, and at high temperatures, so as to reduce energy consumption for cooling. All the four selected strains are good candidates for food or biofuels production in lands unsuitable for conventional agriculture. Chlorella strain CH2 has the potential for more than 80 tonnes of biomass, 32 tonnes of protein and 22 tonnes of lipid per year under favourable climates. © 2014 Guccione et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 89

SP  - 245-252
AB  - Forests and trees throughout the world are increasingly affected by factors related to global change. Expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions. Many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage, economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees. Climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens, with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests. Although climate change will benefit many forest insects, changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches. Individually, the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious. Although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict, it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated. Here we introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of Forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens, climate change, forest management and their interactions, as well as methods to predict, assess and mitigate these impacts. Most of these contributions were presented at the XXIV IUFRO World Congress in 2014. © 2015 Institute of Chartered Foresters.

SP  - 269-285
AB  - Over many glacial cycles, the glacial erosion of alpine valleys can be sufficient to reduce the length of glaciers in the most recent cycles. We document field cases illustrative of this erosional feedback and model the long-term evolution of glacier lengths analytically and numerically. The general feature we target is a moraine deposited well beyond the last glacial maximum (LGM) limit, which we refer to as a "far-flung" moraine. Firstly, we assemble published observations to illustrate that far-flung moraines are documented around the world. The observations suggest that the downvalley distance to such far-flung moraines can exceed the distance to LGM moraines by up to twofold. Secondly, we address the problem analytically, making several simplifying assumptions, to demonstrate that glacier length scales linearly with erosion depth. Finally, we employ a numerical model to test the analytical solution. This 1D (depth-integrated) flowline model includes: (i) a depth-averaged longitudinal coupling stress approximation, (ii) prescribed winter and summer surface mass balance profiles, (iii) evolving ice temperature calculated via the conventional heat equation, and (iv) glacier sliding velocity parameterized as a function of basal ice temperature and spatially and temporally variable prescribed flotation fraction. The simulated alpine landscape is modified through the competing processes of glacier erosion, which is dependent on glacier sliding velocity and prescribed bedrock erodibility, and prescribed uplift rate. The climate controlling surface mass balance is prescribed by time series of air temperature and snowfall approximated by the sum of two sinusoidal cycles. The recurrence statistics of these prescribed climate drivers closely match those of the marine isotopic record; hence the prescribed climate drivers faithfully mimic observed long-term climate drivers. Consistent with earlier landscape evolution studies, we find that the primary effect of repeated glaciations is to flatten a valley floor and steepen its headwall, effectively cutting a longitudinal notch in a fluvial valley profile. Analytical and numerical model results also demonstrate that far-flung moraines are an inevitable consequence of repeated glaciations: glaciers in tectonically inactive regions can sufficiently erode their valleys so that the earliest glaciations leave moraines many kilometers down-valley from moraines left by the latest glaciations, despite similar climates. This suggests that a different landscape, rather than a different climate, is capable of explaining the early glacier extents. As a corollary, the long-term drift toward reduced glacier length favors the survival of early moraines in the face of later glacial advances. Finally, rock uplift can defeat this erosional feedback, while rock subsidence enhances the feedback. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Habitat-specific differences alter traditional biogeographic patterns of life history in a climate-change induced range expansion
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Range shifts and expansions resulting from global climate change have the potential to create novel communities with unique plant-animal interactions. Organisms expanding their range into novel biotic and abiotic environments may encounter selection pressures that alter traditional biogeographic patterns of life history traits. Here, we used field surveys to examine latitudinal patterns of life history traits in a broadly distributed ectotherm (mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii) that has recently experienced a climate change-induced range expansion into a novel habitat type. Additionally, we conducted laboratory and field experiments to investigate characteristics associated with these life history traits (e.g. fecundity, offspring quality, and potential selection pressures). We compared these characteristics in native mangrove habitats in which the species has historically dwelled and novel salt marsh habitats into which the species has recently expanded its range. Consistent with traditional biogeographic concepts (i.e. Bergmann's clines), size at maturity and mean body size of reproductive females increased with latitude within the native habitat. However, they decreased significantly in novel habitats at the highest latitudes of the species' range, which was consistent with habitat-specific differences in both biotic (predation) and abiotic (temperature) selection pressures. Although initial maternal investment (egg volume and weight) did not differ between habitats, fecundity was lower in novel habitats as a result of differences in size at reproduction. Offspring quality, as measured by larval starvation resistance, was likewise diminished in novel habitats relative to native habitats. These differences in offspring quality may have enduring consequences for species success and persistence in novel habitats. Life history characteristics such as those investigated here are fundamental organismal traits; consequently, understanding the potential impacts of climate change responses on latitudinal patterns of these traits is key to understanding climate change impacts on natural systems. © 2017 Riley, Griffen.

VL  - 133

SP  - 471-482
AB  - Turbine airfoils have complex geometries and, during service operation, are subjected to complex loadings. In most publications, results are typically reported for either uniaxial, isothermal tensile creep or for thermal cyclic tests. The former generally provides data for creep of the superalloy and the overall performance, and the later provide data for thermal barrier coating (TBC) spallation as a function of thermally grown oxide thickness, surface roughness, temperature, and thermal mismatch between the layers. Both tests provide valuable data but little is known about the effect of compressive creep strain on the performance of the superalloy/protective system at elevated temperatures. In conjunction with computational model development, laboratory-scale experimental validation was undertaken to verify the viability of the underlying damage mechanics concepts for the evolution of TBC damage. Nickel-based single crystal Rene N5 coupons that were coated with a similar to 150-200 mu m MCrAlY bond coat and a similar to 200-240 mu m 7-YSZ APS top coat were used in this effort. The coupons were exposed to 900 degrees C, 1000 degrees C, and 1100 degrees C, for periods of 100 h, 300 h, 1000 h, and 3000 h in slotted silicon carbide fixtures. The difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the Rene N5 substrate and the test fixture introduces thermally induced compressive stress in the coupon samples. Exposed samples were cross sectioned and evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Performance data were collected based on image analysis. Energy-dispersive X-ray was employed to study the elemental distribution in the TBC system after exposure. To better understand the loading and failure mechanisms of the coating system under loading conditions, nanoindentation was used to study the mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness) of the components in the TBC system and their evolution with temperature and time. The effect of uniaxial in-plane compressive creep strain on the rate of growth of the thermally grown oxide layer, the time to coating failure in TBC systems, and the evolution in the mechanical properties are presented.

VL  - 31

SP  - 1252-1261
AB  - Life-history theory predicts a trade-off between early-life fitness and life span. While the focus traditionally has been on the fecundity-life span trade-off, there are strong reasons to expect trade-offs with growth rate and/or development time. We investigated the roles of growth rate and development time in the evolution of life span in two independent selection experiments in the outcrossing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. First, we found that selection under heat-shock leads to the evolution of increased life span without fecundity costs, but at the cost of slower development. Thereafter, the putative evolutionary links between development time, growth rate, fecundity, heat-shock resistance and life span were independently assessed in the second experiment by directly selecting for fast or slow development. This experiment confirmed our initial findings, since selection for slow development resulted in the evolution of long life span and increased heat-shock resistance. Because there were no consistent trade-offs with growth rate or fecundity, our results highlight the key role of development rate – differentiation of the somatic cells per unit of time – in the evolution of life span. Since development time is under strong selection in nature, reduced somatic maintenance resulting in shorter life span may be a widespread cost of rapid development.

TI  - Improvement of eri silkworm (Samia ricini D.) tolerance to high temperature and low humidity conditions by discontinuous regime
VL  - 37
IS  - 4
SP  - 401-408
AB  - Improvement of eri silkworm tolerance to high temperature was carried out under high temperature (42±1°C) and low relative humidity (50±5% R.H., relative humidity). Eri silkworm rearing at normal temperature (25±2°C; 80±5% R.H.) served as control treatment and was compared to rearing at high temperatures. Directional selection was undertaken with the batches reared at 42±1°C and 50±5% R.H. until the 5th generation. From 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th generations, rearing was conducted as normal rearing (25±2°C; 80±5% R.H.), while for 7th, 9th, and 11th generations directional selection was done as 1st – 5th generations. Various parameters were used as indexes for high temperature tolerance. When the silkworms were reared until to F12 (12th generation), the survival rate of larva (1st –5th instar) (95.33%) and larva (1st –5th instar) – adult (69.33%) including cocooning rate (80.67%) of F12 were the highest compared to F1 and F11. For cocoon yields among F1, F11, and F12, the highest values of fresh cocoon weight (2.7144 g), pupa weight (2.3490 g), shell weight (0.3671 g), shell ratio(13.53%), total cocoon shell weight(17.01 g), and fresh cocoon/10,000 larvae (25. 16 kg) were achieved from F12, which were significantly different (P&lt; 0.05) to F1 and F11. In the same manner for egg yields, F12 provided the maximum numbers in case of eggs/moth (311.33 eggs), total eggs (6,693.33 eggs) and total hatching eggs (4,842.67 eggs) except hatching eggs (73.15%). Of these evaluations between F11 and F1, it was found that F11 was higher than F1 and statistically different (P&lt;0.05) in all parameters excluding the percentage of hatching eggs, which was not significant difference. These results indicate that the property of high temperature tolerance was improved and heat tolerant property of eri silkworm (SaKKU1) is heritable. This is a first to report on heat tolerance improvement of eri silkworm. Although it is a first trial that was carried out in a laboratory, it can be applied on eri silkworm rearing in the future to cope with recent global warming trends. © 2015, Prince of Songkla University.

SP  - 315-319
AB  - In a random block design with four replications, quality indicators related to the climate and age of Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cuba CT-169 were determined in both seasonal periods. The experiment was carried out in a fluvisol soil, under non-irrigation conditions and without fertilization. A multivariate analysis of main components was made, considering the climatic factors and the quality indicators. The preponderance value, equal or higher than 0.75 was considered as the selection factor. Linear multiple equations and the values of the coefficient of determination were above 0.88. The highest R2 were obtained for DMD and OMD (equation II = a + b*CF +d*Age, P < 0.001). Pennisetum purpureum cv. Cuba CT-169 can be characterized by rainfall, temperature (minimum, mean, maximum) and relative humidity, also through CP, CF, ADF, L, CW, DMD, OMD, ME, FNE, CC and cellulose. Linear multiple regression equations were established between DMD, OMD, ME and FNE considering: a) CP, CC and age; b) CF, CW and age; c) CP, L and age, with high R2 and low standard errors of estimation and square mean of the error. Further studies on regrowth physiology in other varieties and types of soil are recommended. More studies mainly on the performance of the chemical composition indicators are suggested to collect more information about the climatic conditions of Cauto Valley so as to validate results in other regions of the country.

TI  - The Mokrsko-West gold deposit, Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic: Mineralogy, deposit setting and classification
VL  - 58
SP  - 238-263
AB  - The Mokrsko-West deposit is unique among European Variscan gold deposits from the points of view of both the structure (an approx. 200 m thick complex of sheeted, several mm-thick, densely spaced quartz veins) and the economic viability (gold reserves of about 100 t). The deposit is hosted mainly by tonalite of the calc-alkaline Sazava tonalite suite (ca. 354 Ma) of the Central Bohemian Plutonic Complex. Mineralization is characterized by quartz-dominated gangue, no visible hydrothermal alteration, low sulfide content, high fineness native gold accompanied by maldonite, aurostibite, native bismuth and numerous Bi-Te-(S) phases. Five mineralogical stages are described in great detail. Arsenopyrite and chlorite thermometers, mineral phase stabilities and published isotope and fluid inclusion data are used to reconstruct the temperature and compositional evolution of the system. The role of liquid bismuth in the sequestration of gold is also discussed. The deposit shares the features of both orogenic gold (ORG) and intrusion-related gold (IRG) deposits. The IRG model is advocated by close spatial association between the ore zone and the tonalite host-intrusion, by the absence/scarcity of hydrothermal alteration, by the Au-Bi-Te-As elemental association and by marked thermal gradients from the early to late mineralization stages. The ORG model is advocated by an approx. 15-10 Ma gap between the intrusion of the tonalite-host and the ore formation, by isotope and geochemical evidence for a key role of metamorphic fluids in the mobilization and transfer of many elements/species (inclusive S and Au). The apparently ambiguous classification of the deposit can most probably be attributed to deposit formation at a depth of >= 9 km and to setting of the deposit at/inside a large-scale plutonic complex with multiple and prolonged tectonic and intrusive activity.

VL  - 121

SP  - 1627-1637
AB  - Little is known about the evolutionary implications of habitat fragmentation, although altered selection regimes could influence the genetic constitution of fragmented populations. In particular, fragmentation might lead to selection for enhanced stress resistance and tolerance of unfavorable environmental conditions. We investigated the evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation in Drosophila birchii flies from small fragments and the interior of large forests of northern Queensland, Australia, in three consecutive years. Evolved differences were detected in a common garden design. Flies from fragments were larger and less desiccation resistant, particularly in the first year, when they also developed faster, and had higher preadult survival under fluctuating temperatures. Furthermore, juvenile survival and adult body size were linked to a measure of habitat quality, the abundance of D. birchii in nature. The results support the hypothesis that fragmentation and habitat quality impose divergent selection. The results also bolster the conservation strategy of maintaining genetic variation for ecologically relevant traits, because persistence in fragmented habitats seems to depend on genetic variation in multiple expressed traits. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Aqueous alteration on main belt primitive asteroids: Results from visible spectroscopy
VL  - 233
SP  - 163-178
AB  - This work focuses on the study of the aqueous alteration process which acted in the main belt and produced hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. Hydrated minerals have been found mainly on Mars surface, on main belt primitive asteroids and possibly also on few TNOs. These materials have been produced by hydration of pristine anhydrous silicates during the aqueous alteration process, that, to be active, needed the presence of liquid water under low temperature conditions (below 320 K) to chemically alter the minerals. The aqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of water sources in the asteroid belt. To investigate this process, we present reflected light spectral observations in the visible region (0.4-0.94 mu m) of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C (prevalently), G, F, B and P, following the Tholen (Tholen, D.J. [1984]. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson). classification scheme. We find that about 65% of the C-type and all the G-type asteroids investigated reveal features suggesting the presence of hydrous materials, mainly a band centered around 0.7 mu m, while we do not find evidence of hydrated materials in the other low albedo asteroids (B, F, and P) investigated. We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt asteroids. We analyze all these spectra in a similar way to characterize the absorption band parameters (band center, depth and width) and spectral slope, and to look for possible correlations between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids taxonomic classes, orbital elements, heliocentric distances, albedo and sizes. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from the P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the P F B C G asteroids, these last being widely aqueous altered, strengthening thus the results previously obtained by Vilas (Vilas, F. [1994]. Icarus 111,456-467). Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption feature in the visible range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than similar to 70% of them will have a 3 mu m absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on their surfaces, based on correlations between those two absorptions (Howell, E.S. et al. [2011]. EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2011, vol. 6. Abstracts, 637). We find that the aqueous alteration process dominates in primitive asteroids located between 2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously suggested by Vilas et al. (Vilas, F., Hatch, E.C., Larson, S.M., Sawyer, S.R., Gaffey, M.J. [1993]. Icarus 102, 225-231). The percentage of hydrated asteroids is strongly correlated with their size. The aqueous alteration process is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km, while it dominates in the 50-240 km sized primitive asteroids. No correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the similar to 0.7 p,m band parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, the meteorites that have aqueous altered asteroids as parent bodies, we see that the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids. This difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals abundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.

VL  - 50

SP  - 7020-7034
AB  - The Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) is a federally listed endangered species living solely within the confines of Devils Hole, a geothermal pool ecosystem in the Mojave Desert of the American Southwest. This unique species has suffered a significant, yet unexplained, population decline in the past two decades, with a record low survey of 35 individuals in early 2013. The species survives on a highly variable seasonal input of nutrients and has evolved in a thermal regime lethal to other pupfish species. The short lifespan of the species (approximately 1 year) makes annual recruitment in Devils Hole critical to the persistence of the species, and elevated temperatures on the shallow shelf that comprises the optimal spawning habitat in the ecosystem can significantly reduce egg viability and increase larval mortality. Here we combine computational fluid dynamic modeling and ecological analysis to investigate the timing of thresholds in the seasonal cycles of food supply and temperature. Numerical results indicate a warming climate most impacts the heat loss from the water column, resulting in warming temperatures and reduced buoyancy-driven circulation. Observed climate change is shown to have already warmed the shallow shelf, and climate change by 2050 is shown to shorten the window of optimum conditions for recruitment by as much as 2 weeks. While there are many possible reasons for the precipitous decline of this species, the changing climate of the Mojave region is shown to produce thermal and nutrient conditions likely to reduce the success of annual recruitment of young C. diabolis in the future, leading to continued threats to the survival of this unique and enigmatic species. © 2014.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is thought to be an important mechanism for adapting to environmental heterogeneity. Nonetheless, the genetic basis of plasticity is still not well understood. In Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, body size and thermal stress resistance show clinal patterns along the east coast of Australia, and exhibit plastic responses to different developmental temperatures. The genetic basis of thermal plasticity, and whether the genetic effects underlying clinal variation in traits and their plasticity are similar, remains unknown. Here, we use line-cross analyses between a tropical and temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans developed at three constant temperatures (18°C, 25°C, and 29°C) to investigate the quantitative genetic basis of clinal divergence in mean thermal response (elevation) and plasticity (slope and curvature) for thermal stress and body size traits. Generally, the genetic effects underlying divergence in mean response and plasticity differed, suggesting that different genetic models may be required to understand the evolution of trait means and plasticity. Furthermore, our results suggest that nonadditive genetic effects, in particular epistasis, may commonly underlie plastic responses, indicating that current models that ignore epistasis may be insufficient to understand and predict evolutionary responses to environmental change. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that uses powders to fabricate 3Dparts directly. The objective of this paper is to perform an experimental investigation of selective laser melted 17-4PH stainless steel. The investigation involved the influence of separate processing parameters on the density, defect, microhardness and the influence of heat-treatment on the mechanical properties. The outcomes of this study show that scan velocity and slice thickness have significant effects on the density and the characteristics of pores of the SLMed parts. The effect of hatch spacing depends on scan velocity. The processing parameters, such as scan velocity, hatch spacing and slice thickness, have effect on microhardness. Compared to the samples with no heat-treatment, the yield strength of the heat treated sample increases significantly and the elongation decreases due to the transformation of microstructure and the changes in the precipitation strengthening phases. By a combination of changes in composition and precipitation strengthening, microhardness improved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 354

AB  - The addition of triphenylbismuth (BiPh 3) efficiently buffers Lewis acidic chloroaluminate ionic liquids over a wide range of compositions. Since the melting points of these ternary mixtures are lower compared to unbuffered chloroaluminate systems, the scope of cations for the formation of buffered room temperature ionic liquids is greatly extended. The buffered ionic liquids were used to activate nickel complexes for selective biphasic propene dimerization reactions. Lifetimes, selectivities and productivities of such dimerization catalysts could be adjusted by the choice of the cation and the composition. At lower reaction temperatures, the selectivities to give dimers increased significantly. Propene dimers were obtained with selectivities of up to 98%. A cation screening with 100 ammonium and phosphonium halide salts was performed. N-Methylpyrrolidine hydrochloride gave the best results in terms of selectivity and lifetime. Propene dimerization reactions in BiPh 3-buffered chloroaluminate melts were catalyzed by various soluble nickel compounds with similar performances. The introduction of basic, sterically demanding tricyclohexylphosphine ligands led to higher degrees of branching, however, at the expense of lower dimer selectivities.

VL  - 70
SP  - 20-26
AB  - Fishes are always exposed to various environmental stresses and the chances of succumbing to such stresses are of great physiological concern. Any change in temperature from the ambient condition can induce various metabolic and physiological changes in the body. The present study evaluates the effects of temperature induced stress on the antioxidant profile of Etroplus suratensis such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation. Fishes of same size were kept in a thermostatized bath at three different temperature regimes viz 16 °C, 27 °C (ambient temperature) and 38 °C for 72 h. These temperatures were selected based on the CT Max (Critical Thermal Maximum) and CT Min (Critical Thermal Minimum) exhibited by E. suratensis. Superoxide dismutase and catalase activity was found maximum in brain and muscle respectively during the 48th hour of exposure in fishes kept at 38 °C. At 16 °C the antioxidant response of glutathione peroxidase was maximum in muscles, whereas the lipid peroxidation rate was found to be high in gills compared to other tissues. The profound increase in the levels of oxidative stress related biomarkers indicate that the thermal stressors severely affected oxidative state of E. suratensis by the second day of experiment. Such down-regulation of redox state accompanied with the induction of oxidative stress cascade may lead to physiological damage in various tissues in fishes, in vivo. However current data indicate that a transition to low and high temperature environment from ambient condition severely affected the levels and profile of the antioxidant markers overtime in E. suratensis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Respiration rates of the polyps of four jellyfish species: Potential thermal triggers and limits
VL  - 459
SP  - 17-22
AB  - The bloom dynamics of metagenic jellyfish are regulated, to a large degree, by the asexual reproduction of benthic polyps. The ecophysiology of polyps is poorly studied compared to pelagic (ephyrae and medusae) life stages. We measured unfed (routine) respiration rates (R-R) of the polyps of four scyphozoan species (Cyanea capillata, Aurelio aurita, Aurelia labiata and Aurelia limbata) acclimated to six temperatures between 7 and 20 degrees C and one species (A. aurita) under hypoxic conditions. Strong increases (Q(10) similar to 7 to 13) in R-R occurred after subtle warming across specific test temperatures (e.g., 12 to 15 degrees C for C. capillata, A. labiata, and A aurita). In some species, R-R at 20 degrees C was lower than at 15 or 18 degrees C suggesting that sub-optimally warm temperatures were approached. Polyps of A. aurita were unable to maintain R-R below 11, 22 and 24% O-2 saturation at 8.0, 15.5 and 19.0 degrees C, respectively. Despite obvious differences in activity and habitat, rates of respiration in polyps, ephyrae and medusae of A. aurita at 15 degrees C appear similar after taking into account differences in body size. A literature comparison of polyp respiration rates suggests a narrowing of thermal windows in individuals collected from higher latitudes. Common garden experiments are needed to thoroughly examine potential local adaptation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 24-31
AB  - Purpose: The aim of the present research was to study and model drying of loquat fruit under vacuum conditions at three temperatures to select the best mathematical model for predicting drying rate of loquat during times which is used in designing of vacuum dryer. The dried product may be used in the preparation of soups, jam, premixed foods, snacks, etc. Design/methodology/approach: Loquat samples were dried by vacuum oven (52 cm Hg) at three temperatures, 60, 70 and 80°C. First, moisture content was plotted against time for each treatment and after that moisture ratio curves were plotted. These curves were fitted with nine well-known models to select the best model. Findings: Regression analysis of different models and values of RMSE and χ2 showed that page model had the best fitness due to highest R2 and lowest RMSE and χ2. Moisture diffusivity of loquat samples at 60, 70 and 80°C was calculated to be 6.87×10-10, 9.17×10-10 and 1.29×10-9 m2/s, respectively, which increased with temperature. Originality/value: This paper is believed to be the only one which investigates and models drying loquat under vacuum conditions to select the best mathematical model for predicting drying rate of loquat. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Adaptation to spatially varying environments has been studied for decades, but advances in sequencing technology are now enabling researchers to investigate the landscape of genetic variation underlying this adaptation genome wide. In this review we highlight some of the decades-long research on local adaptation in Drosophila melanogaster from well-studied clines in North America and Australia. We explore the evidence for parallel adaptation and identify commonalities in the genes responding to clinal selection across continents as well as discussing instances where patterns differ among clines. We also investigate recent studies utilizing whole-genome data to identify clines in D. melanogaster and several other systems. Although connecting segregating genomic variation to variation in phenotypes and fitness remains challenging, clinal genomics is poised to increase our understanding of local adaptation and the selective pressures that drive the extensive phenotypic diversity observed in nature. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Thermal preference and hibernation period of Hodgson's bats (Myotis formosus) in the temperate zone: How does the phylogenetic origin of a species affect its hibernation strategy?
VL  - 91
IS  - 2
SP  - 47-55
AB  - Hibernation is regarded as a physiological and behavioral adaptation that permits the survival of animals such as bats during seasonal periods of energy shortage. Moreover, the phylogenetic history of a species can be used to investigate the evolution of its thermal regulation system during torpor. Hodgson's bat (Myotis formosus (Hodgson, 1835)) is a temperate species that arose phylogenetically from an Ethiopian lineage, suggesting that this bat lineage secondarily colonized a temperate climate. Therefore, the hibernation pattern of M. formosus may differ from that of other temperate bat species. This study investigated the hibernation period of M. formosus in the temperate climate zone and the relationship between thermal preference and hibernating process of bats. Myotis formosus hibernated in roosts maintained in warm (temperature, 12-14 °C) and humid (relative humidity, >95%) ambient conditions. The bats began to hibernate in early October and final arousals occurred in mid-May so that the total length of the hibernation "season" was 220 days. The period of hibernation was strongly influenced by fluctuations in the external minimal temperature. Most bats entered the hibernacula when the external minimal temperature was lower than the temperature of the hibernacula (mean, 13 °C) and emerged from the hibernacula when the external temperature exceeded the temperature of the hibernacula. This study suggests that the onset and termination of M. formosus hibernation is due to the interaction between the temperature of the hibernacula and that of the external environment and is based on the thermal preference of the bats. The study also suggests that the hibernation strategy of this species may be a product of its phylogenetic origin as a tropical bat species adapting to a severely cold climate.

AB  - The ideas on the evolutionary value of hard inbreeding under conditions of extreme environmental conditions (especially temperatures) for the processes of the formation of adaptive genetic polymorphism and speciation are substantiated. The main manifestations of the paradoxical effect of hard inbreeding include (1) structural and functional reorganization of the genome of generative (reproductive) system and (2) activation of mobile genetic elements. This can lead to the generation of different types of mutations (gene, chromosomal, genomic, and systemic) and heterochromatin modifications. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

VL  - 23

SP  - 408-414
AB  - Introduction Atractylodes Macrocephala Rhizoma (AMR) is a traditional Chinese medicine containing several sesquiterpenoids with a series of effects. These bioactive compounds may be used as chemical markers for the quality control of AMR. It is necessary to optimise the extraction method and conditions in order to improve extraction productivity. Objective To develop a simple and effective method for the extraction of sesquiterpenoids from AMR and then to simultaneously determine four sesquiterpenoids, selina-4 (14), 7(11)-dien-8-one (SA), atractylenolide II (AII), atractylenolide III (AIII) and atractylenolide VII (AVII), in AMR. Methodology Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was optimised by central composite design (CCD) to obtain the maximum efficiency. The gas chromatography method was validated and applied for the quantification of four sesquiterpenoids. Results The optimum values of factors were: particle size (120?mesh), extraction time (26?min), extraction temperature (39 degrees C) and 31?mL of chloroform. The selectivity, linear range, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision and repeatability of the method developed indicated its validity. The application of the method showed that the contents of four sesquiterpenoids in AMR were rather variable. Conclusion The results indicated that the described GC method could be used for the quality control of AMR and its related preparations. Meanwhile, this research revealed that UAE under optimum conditions could be considered as a powerful tool for the extraction of phytochemicals from plants. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Exceptionally large, U-rich apatite from the Schwarzwald ore district (Germany) was triple dated using ID-TIMS U-Pb, fission track (FT) and (U-Th)/He dating methods. The aim of adopting the multi-dating approach on a single sample was to (i) further constrain thermo-tectonic evolution of the Schwarzwald from the formation of crystalline basement through to cooling and exhumation, and (ii) test potential and limitations of in-situ FT-(U-Th)/He double dating.The apatite U-Pb age of 289.5 ± 4.5. Ma records the cooling of the basement through the 550 °C during the Early Permian and brackets the age of the apatite-hosting rhyolite between 289.5 ± 4.5. Ma and 314 ± 6. Ma, which is the age of rhyolite-hosting granite. This is in excellent agreement with radiometric ages of related rhyolites and fits with the magmatic evolution of the Schwarzwald during Variscan orogeny. In the Eocene between ~. 50 and 40. Ma, the basement resided at ≥ 100 °C and then cooled to surface temperatures as revealed by the FT age (37.6 ± 1.3. Ma) and thermal modelling results based on track lengths. During the cooling event, the basement was likely exhumed as a rift shoulder of newly formed Upper Rhine Graben rift.Nine apatite grains yielded (U-Th)/He ages from 30.7 ± 1.5 to 65.0 ± 2.6. Ma (mean age: 45.7 ± 1.3. Ma). Three possible reasons for the lack of reproducibility are: (i) non-homogeneous distribution of parent isotopes evidenced by strong U zoning, (ii) 'bad neighbourhood causing implantation of extraneous He, and (iii) radiation damage leading to increased He retentivity, implied by the high (> 250. ppm) U concentration. These problems could not be circumvented by mechanical abrasion of outermost rim of dated crystals which yielded (U-Th)/He ages from 26.0 ± 1.0 to 56.2 ± 2.2. Ma (mean age: 37.2 ± 1.4. Ma).In-situ FT and traditional (U-Th)/He double dating of single apatite crystals revealed that the vast majority of (U-Th)/He ages were younger than, indistinguishable from or overlap within error with corresponding FT ages, proving the robustness of this approach. The results also show that apparent discrepancies between FT and (U-Th)/He ages reported in the literature may arise simply as a result of statistical misconceptions and conventional data treatment. Considering the range of single grain FT ages and the oldest single grain FT age (in addition to the central FT age), may provide an effective basis on which to evaluate the viability of (U-Th)/He data. © 2010.

VL  - 89

AB  - Environmental conditions may influence mating behaviour in otariids breeding in areas with elevated temperatures and intense solar radiation. Although they have evolved morphological and physiological adaptations to prevent overheating while breeding on land, under extreme temperature conditions, they must adjust their behaviour in order to thermoregulate. The California sea lion mating system is based on male competition and displays that occur while defending their territories when females are present. We studied the agonistic behaviour of adult males at two breeding colonies in Mexico with contrasting environmental characteristics: Isla Santa Margarita (ISM) (Pacific coast) and Isla San Esteban (ISE) (Gulf of California). The goal of this study was to determine which variables influence where (i.e. on land or in the water) aggressive interactions between adult males occurred using logistic regression analysis. We analysed three scenarios: (1) both islands, (2) only ISM and (3) only ISE. The best model for the first scenario included the air temperature, density of females and type of aggression. The second scenario involved the density of females, and the third scenario included the rate of female interactions. Although the California sea lion mating strategy involves monopolizing critical resources, our results indicate that density of females and rate of female interactions have a significant impact on where male aggressive interactions occur. Our results highlight how changing environmental conditions affect the behavioural plasticity of this species' mating system. Most notably, males inhabiting high-temperature environments use the thermoregulatory strategy of defending territories adjacent to the coast while remaining immersed in the water. This strategy may result in decreased polygyny in the Gulf of California colonies relative to those on the Pacific coast. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

VL  - 141
IS  - 5
SP  - 1230-1235
AB  - The ability of coldwater species and populations to respond to temperature increases associated with climate change will depend on the existing adaptive potential within and among populations. Brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis is a valued coldwater species that has been widely stocked across its native range as well as extensively introduced in western North America. We investigated the thermal tolerance of the three primary brook trout hatchery strains used in Ontario (Dickson Lake, Lake Nipigon, and Hill's Lake strains) and the thermal tolerance of a brook trout subspecies, Aurora trout S. fontinalis timagamiensis; all strains were reared in a common hatchery environment. In addition to comparing the strains' responses to acute thermal stress, we also examined variability in temperature tolerance among families within several of these strains. Evidence for significant differences in temperature tolerance was observed both within and among the strains, with Aurora trout showing the least capacity to cope with higher temperatures. The results of this study suggest that thermal performance of brook trout populations will be under substantial selective pressure as water temperatures increase and that strains with existing tolerances for warmer conditions will be better equipped to handle these anticipated changes.

AB  - This article reviews the recent literature on the economics of exposure to temperature extremes. There is growing evidence from both micro and macro studies that in the short run, exposure to extreme temperature affects health, labor supply, and labor productivity, although empirical research on potential adaptive responses in the long run remains thin. We argue that, in addition to providing well-identified causal estimates of heat-related damages, environmental economics has an important role to play in estimating the full welfare costs of temperature stress, taking into account behavioral responses and institutional settings. © The Author 2016.

VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 112-122
AB  - Populations within species often occur across divergent habitats and, under the right conditions, can adapt to local conditions. For adult and larval insects, local adaptation in tolerance traits, e.g. thermoregulation and water conservation, is well documented. Eggs of insects are immobile, non-feeding and relatively small, and therefore may be at greater risk from abiotic threats. Selection, therefore, may favour strategies that allow embryos to be robust to desiccation and thermal stresses. In particular, the canteen hypothesis predicts that eggs in hot and dry environments contain more water, and this extra water protects them from elevated rates of water loss. This study tests the canteen hypothesis by (i) examining geographic patterns of egg size and water content and (ii) measuring egg and neonate performance across a range of manipulated temperatures and humidities. We focused on eggs of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). Manduca eggs are larger in xeric regions of the United States - e.g. the southwestern deserts - compared with M. sexta eggs from eastern, mesic regions. Specifically, we asked: do eggs from warmer or drier regions (i) contain more water, (ii) perform better in dry conditions and (iii) tolerate higher temperatures? We also assessed whether desiccation during the egg stage affects subsequent growth of larvae. We tested M. sexta eggs from three environments: Arizona (warm, dry), North Carolina (cool, humid) and a laboratory strain (cool, dry). Although M. sexta eggs from warmer and drier populations were larger and contained more water, these changes did not protect them better from abiotic stress. Eggs from all populations were similarly tolerant of high heat and low humidity. Desiccation during the egg stage also had no long-term effects on hatchling growth rate. Our results provided little support for local adaptation in abiotic stress physiology via the canteen hypothesis. However, low humidity and delayed hatching suggest a different mechanism for desiccation resistance: embryos may modify eggshell conductance in response to internal water status. The geographic cline in egg size may instead arise from selection on any of the three subsequent life stages or may reflect other evolutionary pressures on number-size trade-offs. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Ceramic powders from fossil deposits were thoroughly characterized from the material point of view and sintered to produce massive components. The raw material, a mixture of apatite minerals, feldspars, and quartz, seems ideally suitable to obtain a biologically compatible glass ceramic. Preliminary in vitro tests of proliferation and adhesion of MG63 human osteoblast-like cell line on a selected sample are encouraging. Results are correlated with sintering conditions and phase composition: the fossil can be sintered to almost full density at temperatures as low as 900°C and seems to quickly promote cell activation with respect to hydroxylapatite. © 2011 The Author(s).

VL  - 517
SP  - 75-83
AB  - Because of their complex life histories, different life stages of many marine invertebrates may be exposed to varying environmental challenges. Ultimately, the life stage that is least tolerant of its environment will determine the species' abundance and distribution. The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus lives in high intertidal pools along the Pacific coast of North America. Unlike most other invertebrates, the different life stages of T. californicus all share the same tidepool habitat. To determine physiological tolerances of various life history stages of this species, we examined responses to acute heat stress in nauplii, copepodids, and adults from 6 populations along a latitudinal gradient. Results show that early developmental stages (nauplii and copepodids) are generally more tolerant than adults. Our results contrast with the widely accepted generalization that larval forms are more sensitive to physical stressors than adults. As previously observed in adults, nauplii and copepodids from southern populations survive higher temperatures than those from northern populations. Acute heat stress was found to delay development but did not affect adult size. We hypothesize that variation in the thermal tolerance of early life stages among intertidal species reflects ecological differences in larval habitats: where larvae remain in the intertidal zone and experience the same high temperatures as adults, selection will favor high larval thermal tolerance, while in species with planktonic larvae, the buffered temperature regime of the water column might relax such selection, and thermal tolerance will be highest in the more exposed intertidal adults. © Inter-Research 2014.

VL  - 22

AB  - This study develops a quantitative approach to the establishment of a maximum allowable thermal discharge into a freshwater body (the Beloyarsk Reservoir) incorporated in the once-through cooling technology at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant (NPP) (South Urals, Russian Federation). The study is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic model, embracing water circulation, heat transfer, and ice-cover formation in the Beloyarsk Reservoir. The model is driven by atmospheric forcing, river runoff, and the discharge/intake of NPP cooling water. It was used to simulate the horizontal and vertical distribution of water temperature under the effect of the operation of existing (number 3) and anticipated (numbers 4 and 5) nuclear power units. The model is validated by the comparison of the computation results with observed water temperature distribution and ice-cover configuration obtained with remote sensing techniques. The model was also used to predict the future evolution of water temperature after the launching of two new power units, which, having a common cooling system, may affect each other. It was shown that the first of the new units, no. 4, will not dramatically affect the existing thermal conditions in the reservoir, while launching one more unit, no. 5, will apparently result in overheating of the reservoir water in response to the greater volume of cooling-water discharge from the two power units. Because of a specific configuration of the recirculation flow, the reservoir may fail to cope with the dissipation of the generated heat, leading to a steady (uncontrolled) rise of water temperature in the inlet channel to one of the power units. This will reduce the potential of NPP, using the once-through cooling technology, and will most likely have an adverse effect on the survival of aquatic organisms in the Beloyarsk Reservoir. Therefore, some other environment-saving technologies must be developed for removing surplus heat from the unit no. 5 of the Beloyarsk NPP. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG Switzerland.

VL  - 467
SP  - 219-224
AB  - In September 2013, hatchery reared sub-yearling steelhead trout, Oncorhynchusmykiss, juvenileswere separated into three groups andwere reared in 3 differentwater temperature regimes (ambient (14.4-16.9 degrees C), cool (10.6-11.8 degrees C), and warm (20.0-22.3 degrees C)) in circular hatchery tanks for approximately 1.5 weeks. In Experiment 1, an individual steelhead trout juvenile acclimated in ambient water was transferred into a two-choice stream tank where the fish received either ambient (n= 12) or cool (n= 6)/warm(n= 6) water. During a 30min observation, steelhead trout juveniles clearly avoided both cool and warm water areas. In Experiment 2, we transferred an individual steelhead trout juvenile, which was acclimated in cooled water, into the cool two-choice stream tank and introduced ambient water (relative water temperature increase) (n = 6). Such an increase caused the juvenile to stay in cool water, suggesting that once steelhead juvenile have acclimated in cool water for 1.5 weeks, these fishwould avoid relatively higher temperature (ambient) water and stay in a cooler area. In Experiment 3, we transferred an individual steelhead trout juvenile, which was acclimated in warmed water, into the warm two-choice stream tank and introduced ambient water (relative water temperature decrease) (n= 6). As a result, the relative decrease in water temperature did not influence swimming location choice of the juveniles, suggesting that juvenile steelhead trout do not avoid ambient water (relatively cooler water) even after they were acclimated in warm water. Based on these findings, we suggest that water temperature changes may promote swimming location choice in steelhead trout juveniles, depending on the changing patterns.

AB  - There is nowstrong evidence that the earth's climate is changing rapidly, mainly due to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. It suggests that the trend will continue to grow in the coming decades. For some time now, the question of the direct and indirect effects of climate change on public health has been a major topic of debate. However, it is never easy to separate the plausible from the unlikely, or science from either disinformation or activist bias. The aim of this paper is to present a review of current knowledge and hypotheses on the subject, focusing on key points for which significant advances have been made since 2012. Direct observed and projected effects on health include primarily thermal stresses due to the increased frequency, intensity, or persistence of heat waves, which can trigger heat exhaustion and heatstroke as well as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Any decrease in cold-related deaths cannot outweigh this increase in those related to heat. Other extreme weather events, such as long drought periods, severe storms, heavy precipitation, and tropical cyclones, can also have adverse outcomes and cause injury and death. Among the indirect effects of climate change are the alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and of safe water supplies, the worsening of air quality, and all of their consequences for infectious (especially vectorborne) diseases. In conclusion, the nature and extent of the potential effects of climate evolution will vary markedly on the earth's surface depending on climate type, socioeconomic context, demographic structure, and each country's resilience.

TI  - Maternal exposure to predator scents: Offspring phenotypic adjustment and dispersal
VL  - 281
IS  - 1792
AB  - Predation is a strong selective pressure generating morphological, physiological and behavioural responses in organisms. As predation risk is often higher during juvenile stages, antipredator defences expressed early in life are paramount to survival. Maternal effects are an efficient pathway to produce such defences. We investigated whether maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation affected juvenile morphology, behaviour and dispersal in common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). We exposed 21 gravid females to saurophagous snake cues for one month while 21 females remained unexposed (i.e. control). We measured body size, preferred temperature and activity level for each neonate, and released them into semi-natural enclosures connected to corridors in order to measure dispersal. Offspring from exposed mothers grew longer tails, selected lower temperatures and dispersed thrice more than offspring from unexposed mothers. Because both tail autotomy and altered thermoregulatory behaviour are common antipredator tactics in lizards, these results suggest that mothers adjusted offspring phenotype to risky natal environments (tail length) or increased risk avoidance (dispersal). Although maternal effects can be passive consequences of maternal stress, our results strongly militate for them to be an adaptive antipredator response that may increase offspring survival prospects. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Recent climate change has re-invigorated scientific interest in the dynamics of geographic distributions of organisms. Climate responses and their biogeographical ramifications can be predicted indirectly by studying variation in fitness-related traits across environmental gradients in wide-ranging species. We review evidence for such variation in reptiles. Clinal variation in seasonal timing (onset) of nesting is common but may offer only minor compensation. In contrast, clinal variation in nesting behavior in two wide-ranging species suggests that reptiles can use nest site choice to counter climate differences. We suggest that when range boundaries located at climate extremes are determined by thermal conditions of embryos (vs. the adult stage) they cannot be predicted by the combination of environmental temperatures and thermal tolerances of embryos alone. We propose that nest site choice can reduce or eliminate the environmental variation that would be experienced by embryos in nests selected randomly with respect to temperature or factors influencing temperature. We also hypothesize that this compensation is limited at climate extremes; when temperatures are too cold for behavioral compensation (e.g., due to lack of suitably warm nest sites), reptiles can only invade colder climates by evolving viviparity. Animals with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are more vulnerable to climate change than those with genetic sex determination (GSD) because the complete production of one sex in TSD species would occur before complete embryonic failure in GSD species. Collectively, research on reptiles suggests that range boundaries at climate extremes are determined by: (1) thermal limits and compensatory thermoregulation of free-living adults; (2) thermal limits of embryos; (3) the extent of compensatory nest site choice behavior; (4) mode of sex determination; and in cold climates (5) reproductive mode (oviparity vs. viviparity).

VL  - 57

SP  - 108-117
AB  - In order to preserve key activities or improve survival, insects facing variable and unfavourable thermal environments may employ physiological adjustments on a daily basis. Here, we investigate the survival of laboratory-reared adult Cydia pomonella at high or low temperatures and their responses to pre-treatments at sub-lethal temperatures over short time-scales. We also determined critical thermal limits (CTLs) of activity of C pomonella and the effect of different rates of cooling or heating on CTLs to complement the survival assays. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected adult C. pomonella survival with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Lethal temperatures, explored between -20 degrees C to -5 degrees C and 32 degrees C to 47 degrees C over 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h exposures, for 50% of the population of adult C pomonella were -12 degrees C for 2 h and 44 degrees C for 2 h. Investigation of rapid thermal responses (i.e. hardening) found limited low temperature responses but more pronounced high temperature responses. For example, C. pomonella pre-treated for 2 h at 5 degrees C improved survival at -9 degrees C for 2 h from 50% to 90% (p < 0.001). At high temperatures, pre-treatment at 37 degrees C for 1 h markedly improved survival at 43 degrees C for 2 h from 20% to 90% (p < 0.0001). We also examined cross-tolerance of thermal stressors. Here, low temperature pre-treatments did not improve high temperature survival, while high temperature pre-treatment (37 degrees C for 1 h) significantly improved low temperature survival (-9 degrees C for 2 h). Inducible cross-tolerance implicates a heat shock protein response. Critical thermal minima (CTmin) were not significantly affected by cooling at rates of 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 degrees C min(-1) (CTmin range: 0.3-1.3 degrees C). By contrast, critical thermal maxima (CTmax) were significantly affected by heating at these rates and ranged from 42.5 to 44.9 degrees C. In sum, these results suggest pronounced plasticity of acute high temperature tolerance in adult C. pomonella, but limited acute low temperature responses. We discuss these results in the context of local agroecosystem microclimate recordings. These responses are significant to pest control programmes presently underway and have implications for understanding the evolution of thermal tolerance in these and other insects.

VL  - 18
IS  - 9
SP  - 2679-2687
AB  - Hydrologic restriction of salt marshes and subsequent invasion by Phragmites australis could influence the reproductive success of Fundulus heteroclitus, a common salt marsh resident that forages and spawns on the marsh surface at flood tide. Previous research in our laboratory using data from 2010 to 2011 examined the proportion of actively spawning F. heteroclitus residing in altered New England salt marshes as part of a larger experiment to examine the physiological condition of fish in restricted and restored marshes relative to paired unrestricted (reference) sites. We detected a significant decrease in the proportion of actively spawning fish in restricted relative to paired unrestricted marshes, but no difference between restored and paired unrestricted marsh fish. In this manuscript, we conduct a re-analysis of a portion of that data (July 2011) to explore potential mechanisms behind previous results. Using forward stepwise selection and generalized linear mixed models, we determined that the reduction in actively spawning restricted marsh fish was due to a single predictor (lipid mass); there were no effects of water temperature, body size, parasite prevalence, parasite density, and growth rate on the response. Previous results indicate healthy restricted marsh fish already have reduced energy reserves. Since investment in oocytes is energetically costly (this analysis), the effect could manifest at the population level as a reduction in actively spawning fish. In addition, oocyte quality is reduced in restricted marshes (as measured by % lipid; 13.9 ± 1.6 % SD) relative to paired unrestricted marshes (15.9 ± 2.3 % SD). Although these data are preliminary and represent a single lunar cycle, additional studies are warranted to explore relationships between P. australis invasion, restoration, and effects on the fecundity of this ubiquitous salt marsh fish. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) resistance to columnaris disease is heritable and favorably correlated with bacterial cold water disease resistance
VL  - 93
IS  - 4
SP  - 1546-1554
AB  - Columnaris disease (CD), caused by Flavobacterium columnare, is an emerging disease affecting rainbow trout aquaculture. Objectives of this study were to 1) estimate heritability of CD resistance in a rainbow trout line (ARS-Fp-R) previously selected 4 generations for improved bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) resistance; 2) estimate genetic correlations among CD resistance, BCWD resistance, and growth to market BW; and 3) compare CD resistance among the ARS-Fp-R, ARS-Fp-S (selected 1 generation for increased BCWD susceptibility), and ARS-Fp-C (selection control) lines. Heritability of CD resistance was estimated using data from a waterborne challenge of 44 full-sib ARS-Fp-R families produced using a paternal half-sib mating design, and genetic correlations were estimated using these data and 5 generations of BCWD resistance, 9-mo BW (approximately 0.5 kg), and 12-mo BW (approximately 1.0 kg) data from 405 ARSFp- R full-sib families. The CD and BCWD challenges were initiated at approximately 52 and 84 d posthatch, or approximately 650 and 1,050 degree days (°C × d), respectively. Survival of ARS-Fp-R families ranged from 0 to 48% following CD challenge and heritability estimates were similar between CD (0.17 ± 0.09) and BCWD (0.18 ± 0.03) resistance, and the genetic correlation between these 2 traits was favorable (0.35 ± 0.25). Genetic correlations were small and antagonistic (–0.15 ± 0.08 to –0.19 ± 0.24) between the 2 resistance traits and 9- and 12-mo BW. Two challenges were conducted in consecutive years to compare CD resistance among ARS-Fp-R, ARS-Fp-C, and ARS-Fp-S families. In the first challenge, ARS-Fp-R families (83% survival) had greater CD resistance than ARS-Fp-C (73.5%; P = 0.02) and ARS-Fp-S (68%; P < 0.001) families, which did not differ (P = 0.16). In the second challenge, using an approximately 2.5-fold greater challenge dose, ARS-Fp-R families exhibited greater CD resistance (56% survival) than ARS-Fp-S (38% survival; P = 0.02) families. The favorable genetic correlation between CD and BCWD resistance is supported by greater CD resistance of the ARS-Fp-R line compared to the ARS-Fp-C and ARS-Fp-S lines and suggests that both traits will be improved simultaneously when selection is practiced on only 1 trait. In summary, these data indicate the feasibility of further selective breeding of the BCWD-resistant ARS-Fp-R line for increased CD resistance to produce a double pathogen–resistant line of rainbow trout. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science.

TI  - On the nature of the most obscured C-rich AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds
VL  - 457
IS  - 2
SP  - 1456-1467
AB  - The stars in the Magellanic Clouds with the largest degree of obscuration are used to probe the highly uncertain physics of stars in the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of evolution. Carbon stars in particular provide key information on the amount of third dredge-up and mass-loss. We use two independent stellar evolution codes to test how a different treatment of the physics affects the evolution on the AGB. The output from the two codes is used to determine the rates of dust formation in the circumstellar envelope, where the method used to determine the dust is the same for each case. The stars with the largest degree of obscuration in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are identified as the progeny of objects of initial mass 2.5-3 M-aS (TM) and similar to 1.5 M-aS (TM), respectively. This difference in mass is motivated by the difference in the star formation histories of the two galaxies, and offers a simple explanation of the redder infrared colours of C-stars in the LMC compared to their counterparts in the SMC. The comparison with the Spitzer colours of C-rich AGB stars in the SMC shows that a minimum surface carbon mass fraction X(C) similar to 5 x 10(-3) must have been reached by stars of initial mass around 1.5 M-aS (TM). Our results confirm the necessity of adopting low-temperature opacities in stellar evolutionary models of AGB stars. These opacities allow the stars to obtain mass-loss rates high enough (a parts per thousand(3)10(-4) M-aS (TM) yr(-1)) to produce the amount of dust needed to reproduce the Spitzer colours.

TI  - Relating adaptive genetic traits to climate for Sandberg bluegrass from the intermountain western United States
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SP  - 172-184
AB  - Genetic variation for potentially adaptive traits of the key restoration species Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl) was assessed over the intermountain western United States in relation to source population climate. Common gardens were established at two intermountain west sites with progeny from two maternal parents from each of 130 wild populations. Data were collected over 2 years at each site on fifteen plant traits associated with production, phenology, and morphology. Analyses of variance revealed strong population differences for all plant traits (P &lt; 0.0001), indicating genetic variation. Both the canonical correlation and linear correlation established associations between source populations and climate variability. Populations from warmer, more arid climates had generally lower dry weight, earlier phenology, and smaller, narrower leaves than those from cooler, moister climates. The first three canonical variates were regressed with climate variables resulting in significant models (P &lt; 0.0001) used to map 12 seed zones. Of the 700 981 km2 mapped, four seed zones represented 92% of the area in typically semi-arid and arid regions. The association of genetic variation with source climates in the intermountain west suggested climate driven natural selection and evolution. We recommend seed transfer zones and population movement guidelines to enhance adaptation and diversity for large-scale restoration projects. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Ultrasound-assisted aqueous extraction (USAE) of crude fucoidan from Sargassum muticum using an ultrasonic bath (150 W and 40 kHz) at room temperature (25 °C) for 5–30 min was studied. Fucoidan-containing extracts were separated by centrifugation and characterized by HPLC, HPSEC, FT-IR, and MALDI-TOF spectrometry. Crude fucoidan on the best conditions was composed by oligosaccharides of fucose:galactose:glucose:xylose:mannose:rhamnose in a mass ratio of 1:0.70:0.33:0.27:0.22:0.10. The maximum sulfate content was 39.54 ± 0.001-mg sulfate ion g−1 extract. Furthermore, extract contained 25-mg phlorotannins g−1 extract and showed an ABTS radical scavenging activity equivalent to 40-mg Trolox g−1 extract measured with the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) assay. The cell viability of selected tumoral human cell lines was reduced up to 30% in the presence of crude extracts at 500 mg L−1. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 94

SP  - 2652-2655
AB  - K2CaSiO4 or K2O × CaO × SiO2 has been reported to be a major constituent of residual materials that are of interest for the field of applied mineralogy, including ashes from biomass combustion as well as fertilizers produced from the residues of oil-shale industry or from steelmaking slags. Unfortunately, contradictory results concerning basic crystallographic and physicochemical data of this compound have been described in the literature. In a series of solid-state reactions we tried to prepare this material for a more detailed investigation. The temperature regime for the subsolidus synthesis experiments was selected according to previous studies where the occurrence of this so-called "1:1:1" phase had been reported. The samples were characterized by thermal and X-ray fluorescence analysis as well as X-ray powder diffraction. Our results indicate that "K2CaSiO4" does not exist as a crystalline phase in the ternary system K2O-CaO-SiO2 and that the 1:1:1 compound, mentioned in earlier studies is actually misinterpreted K2Ca2Si2O7. Furthermore, the start of melt formation of an oxide mixture with composition K2O × CaO × SiO2 has been determined to be 1170°C, which is dramatically lower than the value of 1630°C mentioned in the only available comprehensive but more than 80 years old phase analytical study on potassium calcium silicates. © 2011 The American Ceramic Society.

TI  - Influence of climate change on the incidence of rice diseases and our adaptive strategies
VL  - 52
IS  - 2
SP  - 25-42
AB  - A complex relationship exists between climate change and plant pest management. Available studies have been based on the effects of limited environmental factors on host plants, pests, and/or their interactions. The lack of knowledge makes it difficult to predict the impacts of climate change on plant diseases. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in its 2007 report that global warming and increasing atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide can potentially cause sea level rise, widespread changes in precipitation, as well as more frequent extreme weather events. In Taiwan, average land temperature has risen by 1.3°C from 1901 to 2000, which is twice the Earth's average warming rate. The rapid increase in nighttime temperature has resulted in a decrease of difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures. Changes in not only temperatures but also carbon dioxide concentrations, pest epidemics, and weather conditions are known to affect rice yields. Here we discuss the impacts of climate change on several important rice diseases in Taiwan, focusing on the influence of variable weather conditions, higher carbon dioxide concentration, and differential nutrient deposition on the blast disease, bakanae disease, sheath blight, brown spot, and bacterial leaf blight of rice. In view of a higher risk of yield losses caused by these damaging diseases in the near future, we propose to conduct an integrated strategy combining resistance breeding, cultural practices, and coordinate monitoring for pest management. Disease severity can be significantly reduced if proper control measurements are applied the right way at the right time, with consideration of the progress of individual diseases in specific weather conditions. To strengthen food security in an era of climate change, future pest management should include the collection and maintenance of long-term weather data, and the improvement of timeliness and accuracy in disease forecasting. Understanding how different weather factors affect plant- pest interactions is also important. Research topics regarding the effects of individual environmental factors on the life cycles, sexual reproduction, adaptation, population dynamics, dissemination, evolution, and ecology of key pests should be further explored in depth.

AB  - Observations of climate impacts on ecosystems highlight the need for an understanding of organismal thermal ranges and their implications at the ecosystem level. Where changes in aquatic animal populations have been observed, the integrative concept of oxygen- And capacitylimited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) has successfully characterised the onset of thermal limits to performance and field abundance. The OCLTT concept addresses the molecular to whole-animal mechanisms that define thermal constraints on the capacity for oxygen supply to the organism in relation to oxygen demand. The resulting 'total excess aerobic power budget' supports an animal's performance (e.g. comprising motor activity, reproduction and growth) within an individual's thermal range. The aerobic power budget is often approximated through measurements of aerobic scope for activity (i.e. the maximumdifference between resting and the highest exerciseinduced rate of oxygen consumption), whereas most animals in the field rely on lower (i.e. routine) modes of activity. At thermal limits, OCLTT also integrates protective mechanisms that extend time-limited tolerance to temperature extremes - mechanisms such as chaperones, anaerobic metabolism and antioxidative defence. Here, we briefly summarise the OCLTT concept and update it by addressing the role of routine metabolism.We highlight potential pitfalls in applying the concept and discuss the variables measured that led to the development ofOCLTT.We propose that OCLTTexplains why thermal vulnerability is highest at the whole-animal level and lowest at the molecular level. We also discuss how OCLTT captures the thermal constraints on the evolution of aquatic animal life and supports an understanding of the benefits of transitioning from water to land. © 2017.

AB  - The significance of microzooplankton as grazers in pelagic ecosystems has been established, yet relatively few studies of microzooplankton grazing, compared to that of macrozooplankton, have been conducted in the Southern Ocean. We report phytoplankton and bacterial growth and grazing mortality rates along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), a region of rapid climate change. Growth and grazing rates were determined by dilution experiments at select stations along the WAP in January of 2009 to 2011 and in the nearshore waters near Palmer Station in February and March 2011. Microzooplankton exerted higher grazing pressure on bacteria compared to phytoplankton along the WAP and also selectively grazed on smaller phytoplankton (picoautotrophs and nanophytoplankton) and on the more actively growing (high nucleic acid) bacterial cells. Among all phytoplankton size classes, growth rates ranged from undetectable (i.e. not significant; NS) to 0.99 d-1, grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.56 d-1, and microzooplankton removed &lt;100% of daily phytoplankton production in all but one experiment. For high and low nucleic acid content bacteria, growth rates were NS to 0.95 d -1, and grazing mortality rates were NS to 0.43 d-1; microzooplankton often removed &gt;100% of daily bacterial production. There was a significant (albeit weak) exponential relationship between temperature and phytoplankton mortality, although the range of experimental temperatures was small. The present study provides a reference point of microzooplankton grazing impact along the WAP in the summer and contributes valuable information to studies modeling the flow of carbon through the WAP food web, improving our ability to predict climate-induced changes in the WAP ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2013.

VL  - 15
IS  - 3
SP  - 342-343
AB  - Background. Problem of influenza is sadly underappreciated, and this can be proved by the data concerning the incidence, hospitalization and influenza-related mortality. Objectives. To investigate the level of general knowledge among the selected group of people on influenza and their behaviour that they display on the appearance of symptoms of the flu/influenza-like illness. Material and methods. Studies used results of author surveys performed in February-March 2012. The test group was 100 randomly selected people. The questionnaire consisted of 10 one-choice questions. Results. 82% of the respondents believe that the flu is caused by a virus, 10%, a bacterium. 86% respondents asked what symptoms clearly point to the flu responded that the high fever, pain in the joints, muscles, throat and lack of appetite. On the question whether the cold and flu was the same disease as much as 87% replied negatively. Most people (53%) treat flu symptoms/influenza-like illness with OTC drugs. 70% respondents asked to select influenza complications in 70% gave an incomplete answer. Conclusions. The respondents have only general knowledge and awareness of influenza. Therefore they do not take the proper preventive and curative measures in the event of an influenza infection. Broad education about the flu is a milestone in this topic. © by Wydawnictwo Continuo.

AB  - The selective oxidation of methane to methanol has been studied using trimetallic AuPdCu/TiO2 catalysts prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. They are able to catalyse the selective oxidation of methane to methanol under mild aqueous reaction conditions using H2O2 as the oxidant. When compared with bimetallic, Au-Pd/TiO2 analogues, the new trimetallic catalysts present productivities which are up to 5 times greater under the same test conditions, and this is coupled with methanol selectivity of up to 83%. Characterisation shows that whilst Au-Pd is present as Au-core-Pd-shell nanoparticles, copper is present as either Cu or Cu2O in &lt;5 nm particles. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Environmental predictors of diversity in recent planktonic foraminifera as recorded in marine sediments
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - Global diversity patterns are thought to result from a combination of environmental and historical factors. This study tests the set of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses proposed to explain the global variation in present-day coretop diversity in the macroperforate planktonic foraminifera, a clade with an exceptional fossil record. Within this group, marine surface sediment assemblages are thought to represent an accurate, although centennial to millennial time-averaged, representation of recent diversity patterns. Environmental variables chosen to capture ocean temperature, structure, productivity and seasonality were used to model a range of diversity measures across the world's oceans. Spatial autoregressive models showed that the same broad suite of environmental variables were important in shaping each of the four largely independent diversity measures (rarefied species richness, Simpson's evenness, functional richness and mean evolutionary age). Sea-surface temperature explains the largest portion of diversity in all four diversity measures, but not in the way predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology. Vertical structure could be linked to increased diversity through the strength of stratification, but not through the depth of the mixed layer. There is limited evidence that seasonal turnover explains diversity patterns. There is evidence for functional redundancy in the low-latitude sites. The evolutionary mechanism of deep-time stability finds mixed support whilst there is relatively little evidence for an out-of-the-tropics model. These results suggest the diversity patterns of planktonic foraminifera cannot be explained by any one environmental variable or proposed mechanism, but instead reflect multiple processes acting in concert. © 2016 Fenton et al.

TI  - Does tail autotomy affect thermoregulation in an accurately thermoregulating lizard? Lessons from a 2200-m elevational gradient
VL  - 297
IS  - 3
SP  - 204-210
AB  - Tail autotomy is an antipredatory defense that allows lizards to escape predator attacks by shedding their tails. While the benefits of preserving life are indisputable, tail loss implies a number of physiological, social, reproductive and even metabolic costs derived from tail regeneration and reduced motility. In addition, predation risk is increased in lizards with autotomized tails. Metabolic rates increase with body temperature, which in ectotherms depends on external heat sources. Ectotherm thermoregulation is costly in terms of time consumption and exposure to predators, this cost depending on habitat thermal quality. In this work, we seek to disentangle the effects of tail autotomy on field and selected body temperature of an accurately thermoregulating lizard Psammodromus algirus in different thermal environments along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses. According to a physiological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to show higher body temperatures that allow them to regenerate lost tissues faster, at least when the thermal environment is not limiting (at mid and low elevations). By contrast, according to an ethological hypothesis, we expect lizards with autotomized tails to avoid exposure to predators by reducing thermoregulation time, thus showing lower temperatures than lizards with non-autotomized tails. However, we found that the tail state did not significantly affect lizard field or selected body temperatures. On the one hand, a warmer thermal optimum could imply greater exposure to predators during basking, making motility-impaired lizards with autotomized tails more vulnerable, which could explain why the physiological hypothesis of autotomy thermal effect does not apply. On the other hand, lower body temperatures could be physiologically costly for lizards, which, together with the other costs resulting from tail autotomy, could jeopardize lizard fitness. Therefore, both hypotheses were not supported. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.

VL  - 59
IS  - 8
SP  - 745-751
AB  - Reproductive diapause, and its correct timing, plays an important role in the life cycle of many insect species living in a seasonally varying environment at high latitudes. In the present paper we have documented variation in the critical day length (CDL) for adult reproductive diapause and the steepness of photoperiodic response curves (PPRCs) in seven clinal populations of Drosophila montana in Finland between the latitudes 61 and 67°N, paying special attention to variation in these traits within and between cline populations. The isofemale lines representing these populations showed a sharp transition from 0% to 100% in females' diapause incidence in the shortening day lengths, indicated by steep PPRCs. The mean CDL showed a clear latitudinal cline decreasing by 1.6. h from North to South regardless of the age of the lines, variation within the populations (i.e. among lines) in this trait being up to 3. h. The steepness of the PPRCs correlated with the age of the line and this trait showed no clear latitudinal cline. Further studies on a large number of lines from one D. montana population confirmed that while maintaining the flies in diapause preventing conditions in the laboratory has no effect on CDL, older lines had steeper PPRCs. High variation in CDL within and between D. montana cline populations is likely to be heritable and provide a good potential for the evolution of photoperiodic responses. Information on genetic variation in life-history traits, such as diapause, is of utmost importance for predicting the ability of insects to survive in seasonally changing environmental conditions and to respond to long term changes in the length of the growing period e.g. by postponing the timing of diapause towards shorter day length and later calendar date. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Winter temperatures decrease swimming performance and limit distributions of tropical damselfishes
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Coral reefs within 10 degrees of the equator generally experience <= 3 degrees C seasonal variation in water temperature. Ectotherms that have evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6 degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45% in five species and three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was reduced by 17% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42% in six species spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents year round, and >95% of individuals were observed only in habitats where the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera within and among coral reef habitats. Ultimately, thermal variability across latitudes may progressively cause sublethal changes to species performance and lead to a contraction of biogeographical range.

VL  - 33
IS  - 5
SP  - 1337-1348
AB  - Studying the genetic signatures of climate-driven selection can produce insights into local adaptation and the potential impacts of climate change on populations. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an interesting species to study local adaptation because it originated in tropical/subtropical climatic regions and subsequently spread into temperate regions. However, little is known about the genetic basis of its adaptation to temperate climates. Here, we resequenced the whole genomes of ten individual bees from a newly discovered population in temperate China and downloaded resequenced data from 35 individuals from other populations. We found that the new population is an undescribed subspecies in the M-lineage of A. mellifera (Apis mellifera sinisxinyuan). Analyses of population history show that long-term global temperature has strongly influenced the demographic history of A. m. sinisxinyuan and its divergence from other subspecies. Further analyses comparing temperate and tropical populations identified several candidate genes related to fat body and the Hippo signaling pathway that are potentially involved in adaptation to temperate climates. Our results provide insights into the demographic history of the newly discovered A. m. sinisxinyuan, as well as the genetic basis of adaptation of A. mellifera to temperate climates at the genomic level. These findings will facilitate the selective breeding of A. mellifera to improve the survival of overwintering colonies. © 2016 The Author 2016.

AB  - Persistent thermohaline pollution at a site along the northern coast of Israel, due to power and desalination plants, is used as a natural laboratory to evaluate the effects of rising temperature and salinity levels on benthic foraminifera living in shallow hard-bottom habitats. Biomonitoring of the disturbed area and a control station shows that elevated temperature is a more significant stressor compared to salinity, thus causing a decrease in abundance and richness. Critical temperature thresholds were observed at 30 and 35 degrees C, the latter representing the most thermally tolerant species in the studied area Pararotalia calcariformata, which is the only symbiont-bearing species observed within the core of the heated area. Common species of the shallow hard-bottom habitats including several Lessepsian invaders are almost absent in the most exposed site indicating that excess warming will likely impede the survival of these species that currently benefit from the ongoing warming of the Eastern Mediterranean.

VL  - 459
SP  - 348-364
AB  - One of the most enigmatic features of long-term Cenozoic climatic evolution, with some analog potential for present/future global climate change, is the last sustained warm and high-atmospheric CO2 interval in Earth's history, which started after the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.971-5.332 Ma) in the Mediterranean Sea. We present high-resolution, astronomically-tuned climate (Mg/Ca, delta O-18) and productivity (Ba/Ca, delta C-13) proxy records from the planktonic foraminifera Globigerinoides obliquus in the Kalamaki section (Zakynthos Island, Greece), which sheds new light on the early Pliocene Mediterranean hydrographic dynamics, and the associated climatic transition from 5.33 to 5.11 Ma. We recognized four distinct climatic phases with variable amplitude changes: (1) very warm climate interval prior to 5.28 Ma characterized by minimum ice volume, large salinity fluctuations, enhanced productivity, and intense river runoff, (2) stable paleoceanographic conditions from 5.28 to 523 Ma, which reflect a relatively warm and mesotrophic to eutrophic open-marine environment with improved ventilation, (3) a brief interval (20 ky) characterized by the most pronounced ice growth and intense cooling (similar to 5 degrees C) coupled with the abrupt decrease of ventilation and primary productivity, and (4) reinstatement of relatively stable conditions (warm and well-ventilated mesotrophic upper water column) in conjunction with relatively stable sea-level after 5.21 Ma. Overall, the succession of these phases provides an explanation for the more variable Mediterranean climate and stronger hydrographic variability with respect to other regions during the early Pliocene.

TI  - Thermal ecology of the post-metamorphic Andean toad (Rhinella spinulosa) at elevation in the monte desert, Argentina
VL  - 52
SP  - 52-57
AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is an anuran toad species distributed latitudinal and altitudinal (1200-5000 m) from Peru to Argentina, inhabiting mountain valleys in the Andes. Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-meta-morphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9 degrees C to crystallization temperatures below 0 degrees C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0 degrees C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (similar to 35 degrees C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ancient DNA analysis identifies marine mollusc shells as new metagenomic archives of the past
VL  - 17
IS  - 5
SP  - 835-853
AB  - Marine mollusc shells enclose a wealth of information on coastal organisms and their environment. Their life history traits as well as (palaeo-) environmental conditions, including temperature, food availability, salinity and pollution, can be traced through the analysis of their shell (micro-) structure and biogeochemical composition. Adding to this list, the DNA entrapped in shell carbonate biominerals potentially offers a novel and complementary proxy both for reconstructing palaeoenvironments and tracking mollusc evolutionary trajectories. Here, we assess this potential by applying DNA extraction, high-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing and metagenomic analyses to marine mollusc shells spanning the last ~7,000 years. We report successful DNA extraction from shells, including a variety of ancient specimens, and find that DNA recovery is highly dependent on their biomineral structure, carbonate layer preservation and disease state. We demonstrate positive taxonomic identification of mollusc species using a combination of mitochondrial DNA genomes, barcodes, genome-scale data and metagenomic approaches. We also find shell biominerals to contain a diversity of microbial DNA from the marine environment. Finally, we reconstruct genomic sequences of organisms closely related to the Vibrio tapetis bacteria from Manila clam shells previously diagnosed with Brown Ring Disease. Our results reveal marine mollusc shells as novel genetic archives of the past, which opens new perspectives in ancient DNA research, with the potential to reconstruct the evolutionary history of molluscs, microbial communities and pathogens in the face of environmental changes. Other future applications include conservation of endangered mollusc species and aquaculture management. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Intraspecific differences in thermal biology among inland lake trout populations
VL  - 142
IS  - 3
SP  - 756-766
AB  - The ability of coldwater species and populations to respond to the predicted temperature increases associated with climate change will largely depend on existing adaptive potential within and among populations. Southern inland populations of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush are broadly characterized by two ecotypes (small and large bodied) which differ in their trophic ecology, life history traits, and body size. Using common-garden experiments, we investigated population-specific differences in thermal performance (growth, temperature tolerance, and temperature preference) and whether the differences were consistent between ecotypes. We further explored the role of acclimation temperature on growth and thermal performance in two representative ecotypic populations. The evidence from this study indicated that the differences were population specific rather than ecotype specific. A strong inverse relationship between early growth rate and temperature preference suggests that the differences in early growth among Lake Trout populations are driven by adaptive variation in temperature preference. Acclimation temperature had a greater effect than source population on growth and temperature tolerance, although both significantly influenced temperature preferences. Small-bodied ecotypes were less tolerant of elevated temperatures and exhibited less within-population variation, potentially indicating their greater vulnerability to changing ecological conditions under climate change scenarios.

TI  - Impact of water-deficit stress on tritrophic interactions in a wheat-aphid-parasitoid system
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Increasing temperature and CO2 concentrations can alter tritrophic interactions in ecosystems, but the impact of increasingly severe drought on such interactions is not well understood. We examined the response of a wheat-aphid-parasitoid system to variation in water-deficit stress levels. Our results showed that arid area clones of the aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), tended to have longer developmental times compared to semiarid and moist area clones, and the development of S. avenae clones tended to be slower with increasing levels of water-deficit. Body sizes of S. avenae clones from all areas decreased with increasing water-deficit levels, indicating their declining adaptation potential under drought. Compared to arid area clones, moist area clones of S. avenae had a higher frequency of backing under severe water stress only, but a higher frequency of kicking under well-watered conditions only, suggesting a water-deficit level dependent pattern of resistance against the parasitoid, Aphidius gifuensis (Ashmead). The number of S. avenae individuals attacked by the parasitoid in 10 min showed a tendency to decrease with increasing water-deficit levels. Clones of S. avenae tended to have lower parasitism rates under treatments with higher water-deficit levels. The development of the parasitoid tended to be slower under higher levels of water-deficit stress. Thus, the bottom-up effects of water-deficit stressed plants were negative on S. avenae. However, the top-down effects via parasitoids were compromised by water-deficit, which could favor the growth of aphid populations. Overall, the first trophic level under water-deficit stress was shown to have an indirect and negative impact on the third trophic level parasitoid, suggesting that parasitoids could be increasingly vulnerable in future warming scenarios. © 2017 Ahmed et al.

TI  - Distribution and predictors of wing shape and size variability in three sister species of solitary bees
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - Morphological traits can be highly variable over time in a particular geographical area. Different selective pressures shape those traits, which is crucial in evolutionary biology. Among these traits, insect wing morphometry has already been widely used to describe phenotypic variability at the inter-specific level. On the contrary, fewer studies have focused on intraspecific wing morphometric variability. Yet, such investigations are relevant to study potential convergences of variation that could highlight micro-evolutionary processes. The recent sampling and sequencing of three solitary bees of the genus Melitta across their entire species range provides an excellent opportunity to jointly analyse genetic and morphometric variability. In the present study, we first aim to analyse the spatial distribution of the wing shape and centroid size (used as a proxy for body size) variability. Secondly, we aim to test different potential predictors of this variability at both the intra- and inter-population levels, which includes genetic variability, but also geographic locations and distances, elevation, annual mean temperature and precipitation. The comparison of spatial distribution of intrapopulation morphometric diversity does not reveal any convergent pattern between species, thus undermining the assumption of a potential local and selective adaptation at the population level. Regarding intra-specific wing shape differentiation, our results reveal that some tested predictors, such as geographic and genetic distances, are associated with a significant correlation for some species. However, none of these predictors are systematically identified for the three species as an important factor that could explain the intra-specific morphometric variability. As a conclusion, for the three solitary bee species and at the scale of this study, our results clearly tend to discard the assumption of the existence of a common pattern of intra-specific signal/structure within the intra-specific wing shape and body size variability. © 2017 Dellicour et al.

VL  - 144

AB  - Sixty-three strains of the taxonomically related species Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, L. plantarum subsp. argentoratensis, L. paraplantarum and L. pentosus isolated from sourdoughs and other food and non-food sources and 14 strains of other members of the genus Lactobacillus were screened for their tolerance of acid, alkaline, heat, oxidative, osmotic, detergent and starvation stresses in order to evaluate the diversity of stress response. Most strains of the L. plantarum group were highly tolerant of acid, alkaline and osmotic stress and highly sensitive to detergent stress, while a larger diversity was found for other stress. Multivariate analysis allowed grouping the strains in clusters with similar response patterns. Stress response patterns in the L. plantarum group were similar to those of species of the L. casei/. L. paracasei group but clearly different from those of other mesophilic Lactobacillus. No relationship was found between grouping obtained on the basis of stress response patterns and by genotypic fingerprinting (rep-PCR), nor with the taxonomic position or isolation source of the strains. Further experiments with selected strains showed that exponential phase cells were generally but not always more sensitive than stationary phase cells. The ability to grow under stressful conditions showed a slightly better correlation with the ecological conditions prevailing in the isolation niches of the strains. This study will be the basis for further investigations to identify and exploit the basis of diversity in the stress response of lactic acid bacteria. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 388

SP  - 128-136
AB  - Selective fish breeding programs for disease resistance comprise an increasingly important role in aquaculture production and offer an additional management tool for reducing bacterial-caused disease losses. Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) is one of the most frequent causes of elevated mortality in juvenile salmonids, and we have selectively bred three genetic lines of rainbow trout for varying resistance to BCWD. These lines, designated ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-C (control) and ARS-Fp-S (susceptible), differ in survival following standardized laboratory challenges with the causative agent of BCWD, Flavobacterium psychrophilum. This study evaluated survival of the genetic lines in laboratory challenges and in a production environment. Evaluations of disease resistance demonstrated a reproducible, 30% or greater, survival difference between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S lines at body weights ranging from 0.7 to 13 g. Farm trials were performed to evaluate survival over an 80-day growth period starting after the trout began feeding. After a BCWD epizootic, the ARS-Fp-R line displayed significantly greater risk-adjusted survival (95.7%) than the ARS-Fp-S line (91.2%, P < 0.0001) and the ARS-Fp-C line (92.4%, P < 0.0001). Phenotype stability in farm-trial fish was also evaluated using laboratory challenges. The ARS-Fp-R line consistently displayed a higher, but not always statistically significant, survival percentage compared to the other lines and the data suggest that the magnitude of the survival phenotype difference is sensitive to environmental influence. In summary, the overall greater survival of the ARS-Fp-R line provides evidence of genetic improvement under production conditions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The potential for adaptation in a natural Daphnia magna population: Broad and narrow-sense heritability of net reproductive rate under Cd stress at two temperatures
VL  - 21
IS  - 7
SP  - 1899-1910
AB  - The existence of genetic variability is a key element of the adaptive potential of a natural population to stress. In this study we estimated the additive and non-additive components of the genetic variability of net reproductive rate (R-0) in a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd stress at two different temperatures. To this end, life-table experiments were conducted with 20 parental and 39 offspring clonal lineages following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration (control vs. 3.7 mu g Cd/L) and temperature (20 vs. 24 A degrees C) as factors. Offspring lineages were obtained through inter-clonal crossing of the different parental lineages. The population mean, additive and non-additive genetic components of variation in each treatment were estimated by fitting an Animal Model to the observed R-0 values using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. From those estimates broad-sense heritabilities (H-2), narrow-sense heritabilities (h(2)), total (CVG) and additive genetic coefficients of variation (CVA) of R-0 were calculated. The exposure to Cd imposed a considerable level of stress to the population, as shown by the fact that the population mean of R-0 exposed to Cd was significantly lower than in the control at the corresponding temperature, i.e. by 23 % at 20 A degrees C and by 88 % at 24 A degrees C. The latter difference indicates that increasing temperature increased the stress level imposed by Cd. The HA(2) and CVG were significantly greater than 0 in all treatments, suggesting that there is a considerable degree of genetic determination of R-0 in this population and that clonal selection could rapidly lead to increasing population mean fitness under all investigated conditions. More specifically, the HA(2) was 0.392 at 20 A degrees C+Cd and 0.563 at 24 A degrees C+Cd; the CVG was 30.0 % at 20 A degrees C+Cd and was significantly higher (147.6 %) in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment. Significant values of h(2) (= 0.23) and CVA (= 89.7 %) were only found in the 24 A degrees C+Cd treatment, suggesting that the ability to produce more offspring under this stressful condition may be inherited across sexual generations. In contrast, in the less stressful 20 A degrees C+Cd treatment the h(2) (0.06) and CVA (7.0 %) were very low and not significantly higher than zero. Collectively our data indicate that both the asexual and sexual reproduction phases in cyclic parthenogenetic D. magna populations may play a role in the long-term adaptive potential of Daphnia populations to chemical stress (with Cd as the current example) and that environmental variables which influence the stress level of that chemical may influence this adaptive potential (with temperature as current example).

AB  - Life histories show genetic population-level variation due to spatial variation in selection pressures. Phenotypic plasticity in life histories is also common, facilitating fine-tuning of the phenotype in relation to the prevailing selection regime. In multivoltine (≥2 generations per year) insects, individuals following alternative developmental pathways (diapause/direct development) experience different selection regimes. We studied the genetic and phenotypic components of juvenile development in Cabera exanthemata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in a factorial split-brood experiment. F 2 offspring of individuals originating from populations in northern and central Finland were divided among manipulations defined by temperature (14°C/20°C) and day length (24h/15h). Short day length invariably induced diapause, whereas continuous light almost invariably induced direct development in both regions, although northern populations are strictly univoltine in the wild. Individuals from northern Finland had higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than individuals from central Finland across the conditions, indicating genetic differences between regions. Individuals that developed directly into adults tended to have higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than those entering diapause, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Temperature-induced plasticity was substantial; growth rate was much higher, development time much shorter and pupal mass higher at 20°C than at 14°C. The degree of plasticity in relation to developmental pathway was pronounced at 20°C in growth rate and development time and at 14°C in pupal mass, emphasizing multidimensionality of reaction norms. The observed genetic variation and developmental plasticity seem adaptive in relation to time-stress due to seasonality. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 75

AB  - Since the appearance of western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte) (Coleoptera: Chrysometidae) in Romania, many researchers have been made, in more or less success. In this study we try to clarify the ecology of the species in order to predict its evolution and its potential area of distribution. In Romania, this species was signalled for the first time in 1996, in western part of country neighbouring with Hungary. This region is an important area for maize production for seed and silage. Together, the climatic conditions, altitude and their influence on species behaviour and distribution have become more apparent. Their habitat and survival strategies are strongly dependent on local weather patents and altitude. In order to investigate the potential impact of weather and altitude on pest populations, a clear understanding of the nature and characterization of pest is required. In general, most pest species are influenced by warm, rainfall and altitude. Taking into consideration our data from the years 2008 and 2009, we can emphasize a very serious influence of air temperature, rainfall and altitude on WCR flight dynamics in adults. Dry and warm conditions generally lead to increasing of insects' number. Our data shown positive correlations between air temperature (daily mean) and adults number captured on pheromone traps (daily mean), but the there are limits from which these become negative. The same trend was recorded in previous research period (2004-2006). The rainfall is an important factor that influences adults' dynamics in maize fields. Excessive rainfall leads to adults' number decreasing. Our daily observations showed a decreasing number of beetles while rainfall increases. Regarding the altitude, we observed a decreasing number of WCR adults at once the attitude increase. For capture of adults we used pheromone traps, in 3 replications (T1, T2 and T3) at difference altitude where maize was grown. Significant relationship of WCR flight dynamic with weather and geographical conditions were found. Activities were carried out under the PN-II-ID-PCE-2007-1/RO project.

VL  - 66

SP  - 343-348
AB  - Inertial fusion energy (IFE) targets injected into fusion chambers must withstand the demanding acceleration forces and the intense thermal environment of the fusion chamber. For indirect targets, the ultrathin capsule support membrane is the target component that is most sensitive to acceleration forces. Maintaining the deuterium-tritium (DT) temperature, to prevent a significant increase in DT vapor pressure, is the most critical thermal requirement. Secondarily, material selection of the high-temperature laser entrance hole window is required. This paper briefly describes how these requirements are satisfied for a laser-driven IFE plant design.

TI  - Quantifying the impact of gene flow on phenotype- environment mismatch: A demonstration with the scarlet monkeyflower Mimulus cardinalis
VL  - 178
SP  - S62-S79
AB  - Geographic range margins offer testing grounds for limits to adaptation. If range limits are concordant with niche limits, range expansions require the evolution of new phenotypes that can maintain populations beyond current range margins. However, many species' range margins appear static over time, suggesting limits on the ability of marginal populations to evolve appropriate phenotypes. A potential explanation is the swamping gene flow hypothesis, which posits that asymmetrical gene flow from large, well-adapted central populations prevents marginal populations from locally adapting.We present an empirical framework for combining gene flow, environment, and fitness-related phenotypes to infer the potential for maladaptation, and we demonstrate its application using the scarlet monkeyflower Mimulus cardinalis. We grew individuals sampled from populations on a latitudinal transect under varied temperatures and determined the phenotypic deviation (PD), the mismatch between phenotype and local environment. We inferred gene flow among populations and predicted that populations receiving the most temperature- or latitude-weighted immigration would show the greatest PD and that these populations were likely marginal.We found asymmetrical gene flow from central to marginal populations. Populations with more latitude-weighted immigration had significantly greater PD but were not necessarily marginal. Gene flow may limit local adaptation in this species, but swamping gene flow is unlikely to explain its northern range limit. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Survival and Hsp70 Gene Expression in Plutella xylostella and Its Larval Parasitoid Diadegma insulare Varied between Slowly Ramping and Abrupt Extreme Temperature Regimes
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - Background: In nature, insects have evolved behavioural and physiological adaptations to cope with short term exposure to extreme temperatures. Extreme heat events may increase as a result of climate change; this in turn will affect insect population dynamics. We examined the effect of abrupt and ecologically relevant gradual exposure to high temperatures on the survival and hsp70 gene expression in diamondback moth (DBM) adults and the parasitoid Diadegma insulare, as well as in parasitized and non-parasitized DBM larvae. Principal Findings: Tolerance to high temperatures in DBM adults was higher than in D. insulare adults. There was no difference in the survival of DBM adults between abrupt and ramped increases from 25 to 38 degrees C; however, at 40 degrees C survival was higher when the temperature increased gradually. In contrast, more D. insulare adults survived when the temperature was ramped rather than shifted abruptly to both 38 and 40 degrees C. There was no heat stress effect of up to 40 degrees C on the survival of either parasitized or non-parasitized DBM larvae. In adults of both species, more hsp70 expression was observed when temperatures increased abruptly to 38 degrees C compared to ramping. In contrast, at 40 degrees C significantly more expression was found in insects exposed to the ramping rather than the abrupt regime. Hsp70 expression level was in agreement with adult survival data and appears to be a good indicator of stress levels. In parasitized and non-parasitized larvae, hsp70 expression was significantly higher after abrupt shifts compared to ramping at both temperatures. Conclusions/Significance: Hsp70 gene expression was responsive to extreme temperatures in both DBM and D. insulare, which may underlie the ability of these insects to survive in extreme temperatures. Survival and hsp70 expression upon abrupt changes are distinctly different from those after ramping indicating that experimental protocol must be considered before extrapolating laboratory results to natural field situations.

TI  - The red coral (Corallium rubrum) transcriptome: A new resource for population genetics and local adaptation studies
VL  - 15
IS  - 5
SP  - 1205-1215
AB  - The question of species survival and evolution in heterogeneous environments has long been a subject for study. Indeed, it is often difficult to identify the molecular basis of adaptation to contrasted environments, and nongenetic effects increase the difficulty to disentangle fixed effects, such as genetic adaptation, from variable effects, such as individual phenotypic plasticity, in adaptation. Nevertheless, this question is also of great importance for understanding the evolution of species in a context of climate change. The red coral (Corallium rubrum) lives in the Mediterranean Sea, where at depths ranging from 5 to 600 m, it meets very contrasted thermal conditions. The shallowest populations of this species suffered from mortality events linked with thermal anomalies that have highlighted thermotolerance differences between individuals. We provide here a new transcriptomic resource, as well as candidate markers for the study of local adaptation. We sequenced the transcriptome of six individuals from 5 m and six individuals from 40 m depth at the same site of the Marseilles bay, after a period of common garden acclimatization. We found differential expression maintained between the two depths even after common garden acclimatization, and we analysed the polymorphism pattern of these samples. We highlighted contigs potentially implicated in the response to thermal stress, which could be good candidates for the study of thermal adaptation for the red coral. Some of these genes are also involved in the response to thermal stress in other corals. Our method enables the identification of candidate loci of local adaptation useful for other nonmodel organisms. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Impact of selective breeding on European aquaculture
VL  - 472
SP  - 8-16
AB  - Objectives of this study were to determine the combined market share of breeding companies in aquaculture production in Europe, to describe the main characteristics of breeding companies and their programs, and to provide per species estimates on cumulative genetic gain in growth performance. Surveys were conducted among breeding companies of five major species cultured in Europe: Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, European seabass, gilthead seabream, and turbot. The market share was estimated as the combined egg or juvenile production of breeding companies relative to the total egg or juvenile production in Europe for each species in 2012. Cumulative genetic gain was estimated from the number of selected generations in current breeding programs, combined with genetic trends, reported selection responses in literature, and phenotypic differences. The combined market share of breeding companies ranged from 43–56% for seabass to 100% for turbot. The total volume of fish production in Europe that originated from selective breeding was 1653–1706 thousand tonnes, corresponding to 80–83% of the total aquaculture production. Over species, there were 37 breeding programs of which the majority performed family selection. Growth performance was universally selected upon. Cumulative genetic gain in growth performance varied from + 65% for turbot to + 900% for trout in terms of harvest weight, and from + 25% for turbot to + 200% for trout in terms of thermal growth coefficient. It is concluded that selective breeding has a major impact on European aquaculture and will contribute to future growth of the sector. Statement of relevance This manuscript helps to understand the impact of selective breeding on European aquaculture. It shows that the adoption of selective breeding is much higher in Europe than globally. It demonstrates that selective breeding has led to major improvements. Forecasts of industry trends are made and the importance of selective breeding to future growth of aquaculture production is illustrated. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 299-304
AB  - Coevolution plays a key role in shaping the biodiversity on Earth. Coevolution is commonly defined as reciprocal evolutionary changes brought about by interactions between species, implying that interacting species impose selection on each other. The covariance between fitness and trait value determines the strength of natural selection. Thus, to understand coevolution, it is necessary to understand fitness both within and between species. A large amount of research has focused on fitness consequences resulting from interacting with other species (e.g., antagonisms, mutualisms). The geographic mosaic theory places coevolutionary fitness outcomes in a broader landscape of both spatial and environmental variability. © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The adaptive potential of subtropical rainbowfish in the face of climate change: Heritability and heritable plasticity for the expression of candidate genes
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
SP  - 531-545
AB  - Whilst adaptation and phenotypic plasticity might buffer species against habitat degradation associated with global climate change, few studies making such claims also possess the necessary and sufficient data to support them. Doing so requires demonstration of heritable variation in traits affecting fitness under new environmental conditions. We address this issue using an emerging aquatic system to study adaptation to climate change, the crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), a freshwater species from a region of eastern Australia projected to be affected by marked temperature increases. Captive born M. duboulayi of known pedigree were used to assess the long-term effects of contemporary and 2070-projected summer temperatures on the expression of genes previously identified in a climate change transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) experiment. Nearly all genes responded to increasing temperature. Significant additive genetic variance explained a moderate proportion of transcriptional variation for all genes. Most genes also showed broad-sense genetic variation in transcriptional plasticity. Additionally, molecular pathways of candidate genes co-occur with genes inferred to be under climate-mediated selection in wild M. duboulayi populations. Together, these results indicate the presence of existing variation in important physiological traits, and the potential for adaptive responses to a changing thermal environment. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Predicting demographically sustainable rates of adaptation: Can great tit breeding time keep pace with climate change?
VL  - 368
IS  - 1610
AB  - Populations need to adapt to sustained climate change, which requires micro-evolutionary change in the long term. A key question is how the rate of this micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of environmental change, given that theoretically there is a 'critical rate of environmental change' beyond which increased maladaptation leads to population extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related models to predict this critical rate using data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We used stochastic dynamic programming to predict changes in optimal breeding time under three different climate scenarios. Using these results we parametrized two theoretical models to predict critical rates. Results from both models agreed qualitatively in that even 'mild' rates of climate change would be close to these critical rates with respect to great tit breeding time, while for scenarios close to the upper limit of IPCC climate projections the calculated critical rates would be clearly exceeded with possible consequences for population persistence. We therefore tentatively conclude that microevolution, together with plasticity, would rescue only the population from mild rates of climate change, although the models make many simplifying assumptions that remain to be tested. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The local random variation of selected cell, leakage (and its variation) from unselected cells on the selected Bit-Line (BL), and variation of sense amplifier offset voltage (for differential sensing) and trip voltage (for large-signal sensing) are considered simultaneously at subthreshold (V dd=0.4V) and superthreshold (V dd=1.0V) regions. For differential sensing, the subthreshold sensing margin is severely degraded by the variation in Bitline voltage and sufficient time before enabling the sense amplifier is required to improve the limited margin. For large-signal sensing scheme, we show that there is large disparity between the sense "0" margin and sense "1" margin with the significantly worse sense "0" margin limiting the affordable number of cells per Bitline. The possibility of using double-fin PFET in large-signal sensing inverter to improve the sense "0" margin is examined, and shown to be of limited benefit, especially for operation in subthreshold region. Compared with BULK CMOS, the superior electrostatic integrity and variability of FinFET enhances/enables the feasibility of differential sensing in subthreshold/superthreshold SRAM applications. © 2012 IEEE.

VL  - 7
SP  - 127-133
AB  - Coral reefs are highly threatened by human activities at both global (ocean warming and acidification) and local scales (overfishing, pollution, and physical destruction) especially given that current rates of environmental change exceed those seen for tens of millions of years. Recent authors, however, have suggested that coral reefs might increase their tolerance to these rapid environmental changes through acclimatisation, genetic adaptation, and migration. While there is evidence of all three responses acting within coral populations, there is little basis for the conclusion that reef-building corals and coral reefs will become more sustainable and resilient over time under current high rates of change. Most studies that make this claim have correctly identified components and mechanisms but have otherwise incorrectly extended this evidence which is otherwise necessary but not sufficient to support the conclusion that coral reefs will survive due to their ability to acclimatise, adapt and/or migrate to the current rapid environmental changes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Agriculture in West Africa in the twenty-first century: Climate change and impacts scenarios, and potential for adaptation
VL  - 7
AB  - West Africa is known to be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to high climate variability, high reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and limited economic and institutional capacity to respond to climate variability and change. In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation. © 2016 Sultan and Gaetani.

TI  - Sustainable and cost effective biosolids management planning at OCSD
VL  - 7
SP  - 4870-4895
AB  - The Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) in Southern California recently identified the need for a new Biosolids Master Plan (BMP). The BMP technical evaluations are complete, and a preferred biosolids management alternative has been identified. This paper presents the findings and recommendations associated with the offsite and onsite biosolids management evaluations, alternatives screening, life cycle cost analysis, and triple bottom line selection process that led to the recommended alternative. The lessons learned for this BMP will be useful for utilities that are considering updating their residuals treatment, reuse, and disposal program. The planning effort began with the biosolids end use in mind to ensure that any product generated, whether onsite or offsite, has an associated reliable, cost-effective, and sustainable end use market. In order to better define available markets for the potential biosolids products and onsite processing options, as well as determine the product's value and marketability, comprehensive market research on the regional horticultural (lawn/garden), agricultural, and fertilizer industries was completed. This included overall industry data evaluations coupled with telephone surveys and a series of in-person meetings with companies in the local targeted outlets. Two sets of evaluation criteria were developed - one market-based set for the evaluation of product-market pairs and a second set for evaluation for products only (and associated processing technologies). A total of 20 final product alternatives and 10 final market options were evaluated using predetermined evaluation criteria and weighting values. The project team then identified potential onsite processing alternatives for solids digestion and post dewatering that met the preferred product/markets that had been identified. An initial screening of these technologies was performed using the pre-established evaluation criteria noted above. The technical evaluation team then performed concept designs for the preferred onsite alternatives identified. The offsite (end-use) and onsite evaluations were merged to form end-to-end alternatives and 26 alternatives were identified. The final stage in the decision making process consisted of a Solids Water Energy Evaluation Tool (SWEET) life cycle cost evaluation followed by a comprehensive triple bottom line evaluation using Criterium Decision Plus™ (CDP). This paper focuses on the evaluations performed and the recommendations made for OCSD Plant No. 2, one of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) owned and operated by OCSD.

TI  - RNA genetic algorithm with adaptive crossover probability for estimating parameters of heavy oil thermal cracking model
SP  - 1866-1870
AB  - Inspired by the biological RNA, a RNA genetic algorithm with adaptive crossover probability (acRNA-GA) is proposed to estimate parameters of the heavy oil thermal cracking three-lumped model. In acRNA-GA, each individual is represented by nucleotide bases. The crossover operators including competitive permutation operator, translocation operators and inversion operator based on RNA molecular operations are designed to improve the diversity of the population and overcome the premature convergence of GA. An adaptive crossover probability in term of the fitness value is employed to further enhance the global searching ability and the convergence speed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by four typical benchmark functions. Finally, acRNA-GA is implemented on parameter estimation of the heavy oil thermal cracking three-lumped model. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has better performance than that of SGA. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.

AB  - The present study describes the response of a bacterial strain, isolated from a hot spring in an area with the highest levels of natural radiation, under radium (226Ra) stress. The bacterium has been characterized as a novel and efficient radium biosorbent and identified as a variant of Serratia marcescens by biochemical tests and molecular recognition. In order to gain insights into key cellular events that allow this strain to survive and undergo 226Ra adaptation and biosorption, the strain was tested under two experimental conditions of 1000 and 6000Bq 226Ra stress. A proteomic approach involving two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins under 226Ra stress. Functional assessment of identified proteins with significantly altered expression levels revealed several mechanisms thought to be involved in 226Ra adaptation and conferring resistant phenotype to the isolate, including general stress adaptation, anti-oxidative stress, protein and nucleic acid synthesis, energy metabolism, efflux and transport proteins. It suggests that this strain through evolution is particularly well adapted to the high background radiation environment and could represent an alternative source to remove 226Ra from such areas as well as industrial radionuclide polluted wastewaters. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of host plant quality on geometrid moth expansion on environmental and local population scales
VL  - 34
IS  - 5
SP  - 848-855
AB  - The warming climate has enabled a rapid expansion of many forest pests. The adaptation potential of the invaders affects largely on how well the invasive species can spread to new areas and in what extent can they have an impact on the invaded ecosystem. To measure the adaptation potential of an invasive (winter moth) and a potentially invasive defoliating moth species (scarce umber moth), we examined life history parameters in two environments on a set of genetically diverse host trees and compared the traits with those of a resident moth species (autumnal moth). In addition, variations in life history parameters due to host genotype were calculated and compared. The bioassay was executed by rearing moth larvae on 11 half-sib families of the host tree in two large tree line gardens. The use of half-sib families allowed us to calculate the variances due to tree genotype and also to examine if the new arrivals can affect the selection pressure on the genetic population structure of the host. According to our results, the natural genetic variation in host plant quality and small environmental differences are not sufficiently effective to restrict the spread of the already established invasive species. The invading moth species may even be better at adapting to variation in food quality than the resident moth species. The overall effect of the natural variation in tree quality was similar for all three moth species. Therefore, the newcomers are likely to only inflict a quantitative rather than qualitative change in the selection pressure on the host. © 2011 The Authors.

VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 71-79
AB  - Populations of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as of other Drosophila species, show body size differences according to their geographic origin. Thermal selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these differences. We investigated wing size, wing shape and their relationship in 3 different geographic populations of D. melanogaster, 1 population of D. simulans, and their interspecific hybrids grown at 18, 21, 25 and 28°C. The aim was to explore how the past adaptive history of 2 related species, or populations of the same species, modulates the plastic response to the environment. The wing size plasticity of hybrids between the temperate D. simulans (Bologna) and the 2 tropical D. melanogaster populations (Belém and Rio de Janeiro) was higher than that of parental species, probably as a side effect of a decanalized and compromised development at higher temperatures. The wing size plasticity of Bologna hybrids was the same as the parents, suggesting that the 2 species are subjected to the same plasticity selection. Wing shape was typical of each species, population and temperature. Shape differences increased in hybrids at higher temperatures as a consequence of developmental perturbation. The allometric relationship between size and shape changed among temperatures and among species, suggesting that the wing development is differently regulated in the 2 species and can be altered by natural selection. The allometry changed between populations of different geographic origin of D. melanogaster, but was similar in the 2 species that shared the same selective environment. Two species would have been subjected to the same plasticity selection, so the breakdown of the plastic response is avoided in hybrids. As a whole, these data suggest that thermal plasticity is a trait under selection and that similar mechanisms are at work in different species. © Inter-Research 2010.

TI  - Evaluation of three exploitation concepts for a deep geothermal system in the North German Basin
VL  - 82
SP  - 120-129
AB  - In this paper, we compare three exploitation strategies for the deep geothermal system of Gross Schonebeck in the North German Basin. Investigating optimum reservoir designs is one of the key issues for efficient and sustainable utilization of geothermal resource. With this objective we simulate the hydraulic-thermal coupled subsurface processes related to the provision of geothermal energy. The presented application, including visualization, mesh generation and numerical simulation, is based on open source software. The numerical investigations of the three exploitation concepts take into account all geological layers, major natural fault zones, hydraulic fractures, geothermal wells and related hydraulic-thermal coupled processes. In the current exploitation concept, the fluid flows through the rock matrix between the injection and the production well (matrix dominated). The related numerical model is compared and calibrated to available field data. Then, the model is used to investigate two alternative stimulation concepts. All three concepts were evaluated taking into account the evolution of the production temperature as well as the hydraulic conductivity between production and injection well. As an alternative to the current situation, a fracture dominated system is investigated where the fluid flows through hydraulically induced fractures between injection and production well. Compared to the reference model, a twofold increase in productivity could be observed together with a significantly reduced time before the onset of a thermal breakthrough. The second alternative is a hybrid concept combining both matrix and fracture-dominated flow paths between the production and the injection well. We show that this hybrid approach could significantly increase the reservoir productivity and prolongs the time before the onset of thermal breakthrough. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Copper partitioning between silicate melts and amphibole: Experimental insight into magma evolution leading to porphyry copper ore formation
VL  - 448
SP  - 151-163
AB  - A series of piston cylinder experiments were conducted to determine the partition coefficient of Cu between amphibole and andesitic to rhyolitic silicate melts. The experiments were run at T = 740-990 degrees C, P = 0.7 GPa, oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) ranging from that of the Ni-NiO buffer (NNO) to 2.3 log units higher (NNO + 2.3 and dissolved water in variable concentrations (under-saturated to saturated conditions). Fixed metal activities were imposed by using Au97Cu3 and Au92Cu8 alloy capsules, which allowed simultaneously determination of Cu solubility. Our data demonstrate that Cu solubilities in both the silicate melt and amphibole decrease with decreasing temperature. The solubility of Cu decreases by a factor of 6 from 990 to 740 degrees C in equilibrium with andesitic to rhyolitic melt compositions. The average amphibole/silicate melt partition coefficient of Cu [D-cu, (amph/melt)] is 0.066 +/- 0.006, and is essentially constant without showing any correlation with silicate melt composition, dissolved water concentration, temperature or fO(2). The low D-cu' (amph/melt) value suggests that amphibole crystallizing at any stage of calc-alkaline magma evolution is unable to scavenge a significant fraction of the initially available Cu from the melt. However, D-cu (amph/ melt) is high enough to yield precisely measurable Cu concentrations in natural amphiboles. As D-cu (amph/melt) results constant along the liquid line of descent of calc-alkaline magmas, amphibole compositions may thus be used as a proxy to monitor the evolution of the Cu concentration in the silicate melt (not the bulk magma if sulfide is present). This may be useful for understanding the metallogenic evolution of intrusive rocks, in which silicate melt inclusions in minerals are generally absent. As most porphyry-type Cu ore deposits are associated with upper crustal intrusions, in-situ microanalysis of inclusion-free amphiboles in such rocks may help understand ore genesis and might also be used in mineral exploration to assess the fertility of prospective magmatic systems.

TI  - A coupled movement and bioenergetics model to explore the spawning migration of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay
VL  - 313
SP  - 212-222
AB  - Adult anchovies in the Bay of Biscay perform north to south migration from late winter to early summer for spawning. However, what triggers and drives the geographic shift of the population remains unclear and poorly understood. An individual-based fish model has been implemented to explore the potential mechanisms that control anchovy's movement routes toward its spawning habitats. To achieve this goal, two fish movement behaviors - gradient detection through restricted area search and kinesis - simulated fish response to its dynamic environment. A bioenergetics model was used to represent individual growth and reproduction along the fish trajectory. The environmental forcing (food, temperature) of the model was provided by a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. We followed a hypothesis-testing strategy to actualize a series of simulations using different cues and computational assumptions. The gradient detection behavior was found as the most suitable mechanism to recreate the observed shift of anchovy distribution under the combined effect of sea-surface temperature and zooplankton. In addition, our results suggested that southward movement occurred more actively from early April to middle May following favorably the spatio-temporal evolution of zooplankton and temperature. In terms of fish bioenergetics, individuals who ended up in the southern part of the bay presented better condition based on energy content, proposing the resulting energy gain as an ecological explanation for this migration. The kinesis approach resulted in a moderate performance, producing distribution pattern with the highest spread. Finally, model performance was not significantly affected by changes on the starting date, initial fish distribution and number of particles used in the simulations, whereas it was drastically influenced by the adopted cues.

TI  - Variation in temperature tolerance among families of atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is associated with hypoxia tolerance, ventricle size and myoglobin level
VL  - 216
IS  - 7
SP  - 1183-1190
AB  - In fishes, performance failure at high temperature is thought to be due to a limitation on oxygen delivery (the theory of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance, OCLTT), which suggests that thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance might be functionally associated. Here we examined variation in temperature and hypoxia tolerance among 41 families of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which allowed us to evaluate the association between these two traits. Both temperature and hypoxia tolerance varied significantly among families and there was a significant positive correlation between critical maximum temperature (CTmax) and hypoxia tolerance, supporting the OCLTT concept. At the organ and cellular levels, we also discovered support for the OCLTT concept as relative ventricle mass (RVM) and cardiac myoglobin (Mb) levels both correlated positively with CTmax (R2=0.21, P&lt;0.001 and R2=0.17, P=0.003, respectively). A large RVM has previously been shown to be associated with high cardiac output, which might facilitate tissue oxygen supply during elevated oxygen demand at high temperatures, while Mb facilitates the oxygen transfer from the blood to tissues, especially during hypoxia. The data presented here demonstrate for the first time that RVM and Mb are correlated with increased upper temperature tolerance in fish. High phenotypic variation between families and greater similarity among full- and half-siblings suggests that there is substantial standing genetic variation in thermal and hypoxia tolerance, which could respond to selection either in aquaculture or in response to anthropogenic stressors such as global climate change. © 2013.

TI  - Bet hedging in a warming ocean: Predictability of maternal environment shapes offspring size variation in marine sticklebacks
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SP  - 4387-4400
AB  - Bet hedging at reproduction is expected to evolve when mothers are exposed to unpredictable cues for future environmental conditions, whereas transgenerational plasticity (TGP) should be favoured when cues reliably predict the environment offspring will experience. Since climate predictions forecast an increase in both temperature and climate variability, both TGP and bet hedging are likely to become important strategies to mediate climate change effects. Here, the potential to produce variably sized offspring in both warming and unpredictable environments was tested by investigating whether stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) mothers adjusted mean offspring size and within-clutch variation in offspring size in response to experimental manipulation of maternal thermal environment and predictability (alternating between ambient and elevated water temperatures). Reproductive output traits of F1 females were influenced by both temperature and environmental predictability. Mothers that developed at ambient temperature (17 °C) produced larger, but fewer eggs than mothers that developed at elevated temperature (21 °C), implying selection for different-sized offspring in different environments. Mothers in unpredictable environments had smaller mean egg sizes and tended to have greater within-female egg size variability, especially at 21 °C, suggesting that mothers may have dynamically modified the variance in offspring size to spread the risk of incorrectly predicting future environmental conditions. Both TGP and diversification influenced F2 offspring body size. F2 offspring reared at 21 °C had larger mean body sizes if their mother developed at 21 °C, but this TGP benefit was not present for offspring of 17 °C mothers reared at 17 °C, indicating that maternal TGP will be highly relevant for ocean warming scenarios in this system. Offspring of variable environment mothers were smaller but more variable in size than offspring from constant environment mothers, particularly at 21 °C. In summary, stickleback mothers may have used both TGP and diversified bet-hedging strategies to cope with the dual stress of ocean warming and environmental uncertainty. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Chlorine isotope behavior during prograde metamorphism of sedimentary rocks
VL  - 417
SP  - 120-131
AB  - Chlorine stable isotope compositions of two sedimentary sequences and their metamorphic equivalents were measured in order to study fractionation effects during prograde metamorphism and devolatilization. Protoliths (n=25) were collected from a 50 m section of Triassic fluvial and playa-lake strata and Jurassic (Liassic) marine black shales in a well-characterized quarry. Low greenschist to middle amphibolite facies equivalents (n&gt;80) were collected from the Glarus Alps, Urseren Zone, and Lucomagno region. Bulk δ37Cl values are constant within individual sedimentary layers, but vary from -2.0 to +2.4‰ in Triassic rocks and from -3.0 to 0‰ in the black shales. Dolomitic and gypsiferous samples have positive δ37Cl values, but marls and shales are isotopically negative. Bulk Cl contents show only small declines during the earliest stages of metamorphism. Metamorphic equivalents of the Triassic and Liassic protoliths record the same overall ranges in δ37Cl as their protoliths. Samples with highly correlated bulk compositions but different metamorphic grade show no statistically significant difference in δ37Cl. These data lead to the following conclusions: (1) Terrestrial and marine sedimentary rocks display large primary heterogeneities in chlorine isotope composition. As a result, an unambiguous "sedimentary signature" does not exist in the chlorine stable isotope system. (2) No isotopic fractionation is discernable during metamorphic devolatilization, even at low temperatures. Alpine-style metamorphism thus has little to no effect on bulk chlorine isotopic compositions, despite significant devolatilization. (3) Cl is largely retained in the rocks during devolatilization, contrary to the normally assumed hydrophilic behavior of chlorine. Continuous release of mixed-volatile C-O-H fluids likely affected Cl partitioning between fluid and minerals and allowed chlorine to remain in the rocks. (4) There is no evidence for fluid communication across (meta)sedimentary layers except within the Urseren shear zone. These data contribute to a relatively closed-system view of metamorphic devolatilization from anchizone through mid-amphibolite facies conditions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A clinally varying promoter polymorphism associated with adaptive variation in wing size in Drosophila
VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SP  - 775-784
AB  - Body size often shows adaptive clines in many ectotherms across altitude and latitude, but little is known about the genetic basis of these adaptive clines. Here we identify a polymorphism in the Dca (Drosophila cold acclimation) gene in Drosophila melanogaster that influences wing size, affects wing:thorax allometry and also controls a substantial proportion of the clinal wing-size variation. A polymorphism in the promoter region of Dca had two common alleles showing strong reciprocal clinal variation in frequency with latitude along the east coast of Australia. The Dca-237 allele increased towards the tropics where wing size is smaller. A within-population association study highlighted that an increase in the frequency of this allele decreased wing size but did not influence thorax size. A manipulated increase in the level of expression of Dca achieved through UAS-GAL4 was associated with a decrease in wing size but had no effect on thorax size. This was consistent with higher Dca expression levels in family lines with higher frequency of the Dca-237 allele. Genetic variation in the promoter region of the Dca gene appears to influence adaptive size variation in the eastern Australian cline of Drosophila melanogaster and accounts for more than 10% of the genetic variation in size within and between populations. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The genetic consequences of spatially varying selection in the panmictic american eel (Anguilla rostrata)
VL  - 190
IS  - 2
SP  - 725-736
AB  - Our understanding of the genetic basis of local adaptation has recently benefited from the increased power to identify functional variants associated with environmental variables at the genome scale. However, it often remains challenging to determine whether locally adaptive alleles are actively maintained at intermediate frequencies by spatially varying selection. Here, we evaluate the extent to which this particular type of balancing selection explains the retention of adaptive genetic variation in the extreme situation of perfect panmixia, using the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) as a model. We first conducted a genome scan between two samples from opposite ends of a latitudinal environmental gradient using 454 sequencing of individually tagged cDNA libraries. Candidate SNPs were then genotyped in 992 individuals from 16 sampling sites at different life stages of the same cohort (including larvae from the Sargasso Sea, glass eels, and 1-year-old individuals) as well as in glass eels of the following cohort. Evidence for spatially varying selection was found at 13 loci showing correlations between allele frequencies and environmental variables across the entire species range. Simulations under a multiple-niche Levene's model using estimated relative fitness values among genotypes rarely predicted a stable polymorphic equilibrium at these loci. Our results suggest that some genetic-by-environment interactions detected in our study arise during the progress toward fixation of a globally advantageous allele with spatially variable effects on fitness. © 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.

TI  - Inter-annual variability of North Sea plaice spawning habitat
VL  - 64
IS  - 4
SP  - 427-435
AB  - Potential spawning habitat is defined as the area where environmental conditions are suitable for spawning to occur. Spawning adult data from the first quarter (January-March) of the International Bottom Trawl Survey have been used to study the inter-annual variability of the potential spawning habitat of North Sea plaice from 1980 to 2007. Generalised additive models (GAM) were used to create a model that related five environmental variables (depth, bottom temperature and salinity, seabed stress and sediment type) to presence-absence and abundance of spawning adults. Then, the habitat model was applied each year from 1970 to 2007 to predict inter-annual variability of the potential spawning habitat. Predicted responses obtained by GAM for each year were mapped using kriging. A hierarchical classification associated with a correspondence analysis was performed to cluster spawning suitable areas and to determine how they evolved across years. The potential spawning habitat was consistent with historical spawning ground locations described in the literature from eggs surveys. It was also found that the potential spawning habitat varied across years. Suitable areas were located in the southem part of the North Sea and along the eastern coast of England and Scotland in the eighties; they expanded further north from the nineties. Annual survey distributions did not show such northward expansion and remained located in the southern North Sea. This suggests that this species' actual spatial distribution remains stable against changing environmental conditions, and that the potential spawning habitat is not fully occupied. Changes in environmental conditions appear to remain within plaice environmental ranges, meaning that other factors may control the spatial distribution of plaice spawning habitat.

TI  - Latitudinal comparison of thermotolerance and HSP70 production in F2 larvae of the greenshell mussel (perna canaliculus)
VL  - 216
IS  - 7
SP  - 1202-1209
AB  - We report the first measures of thermotolerance (recorded as percentage mortality and induced HSP70 production) for pelagic larvae of three populations of the New Zealand greenshell (green-lipped) mussel Perna canaliculus. Our goal was to determine whether distinct populations of P. canaliculus were more susceptible to predicted climate change than others, and whether such patterns of susceptibility were either genetically controlled (local adaptation of populations) or simply reflect the acclimatory capacity of this species. F2 larvae from three P. canaliculus populations (D'Urville Island, Banks Peninsula and Stewart Island) were subjected to an acute thermal challenge (3?h exposure to a fixed temperature in the range 20-42°C). No latitudinal patterns in either percentage mortality or HSP70 protein production were apparent. For all populations, larval mortality (LT50) was between 32.9 and 33.9°C, with significant amounts of HSP70 induction only occurring in those individuals that experienced temperatures of 40°C or greater. The data presented therefore do not support the hypothesis that genetic adaptation of P. canaliculus to distinct thermal environments will be reflected by a corresponding difference in acute heat tolerance. In fact, the apparently vulnerable veligers show a surprisingly wide thermal safety margin. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the effects of ocean warming upon this species, subsequent studies should consider the impacts of sub-lethal stress upon fitness in addition to chronic thermal challenge and, crucially, the response of sedentary juvenile and adult stages. © 2013.

VL  - 64
IS  - 5
SP  - 911-930
AB  - Cool climate biomes in the Northern Hemisphere have evolved relatively recently. Temperature decline between the late Eocene and the Pliocene contributed to the evolution of many plant groups in modern cool climate biomes, such as mosses belonging to the Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex. The Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex comprises three species that have a disjunct distribution in temperate and boreal regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The core species in the complex have only recently been transferred from Bryhnia to Brachythecium and the delimitation of the complex and of species within it still remains uncertain. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the group using molecular data and estimated the timing of the diversifications in the tree. In addition, we examined the morphology and compared morphological diversification with genetic diversity. The Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex diversified in East Asia in the middle Miocene, 9.1 Ma (HPD 95% 3.9–14.8 Myr). Bryhnia trichomitria and B. graminicolor were revealed not to be close relatives of the complex and are therefore transferred to Brachythecium and Koponeniella gen. nov., respectively. Both morphology and molecular data supported the position of Asian Brachythecium noesicum as sister to the Brachythecium novae-angliae crown clade that includes two species, B. hultenii and B. novae-angliae. The crown clade diverged at the end of the Miocene, 6.4 Ma (HPD 95% 2.4–11.6 Myr) and its taxa have a disjunct distribution in cool temperate and boreal areas in the Beringia region (B. novaeangliae subsp. hultenii), and eastern North America and northwestern Europe (B. novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae). In the crown clade the majority of populations belong to one common haplotype present in all three disjunct parts of the distribution area. Despite low variation in DNA sequence data, morphology allows the distinction between B. novae-angliae subsp. hultenii and B. novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae. Because of weak morphological and genetic differentiation, European Bryhnia scabrida is treated here as a synonym of Brachythecium novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae. Glacial survival during the Quaternary and climatic oscillations during the late Tertiary and Quaternary in East Asia may have resulted in diversification of the complex and enabled adaptation to cool temperate and boreal climates. © International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) 2015.

AB  - In this review, we describe the history of amniote sex determination as a classic example of Darwinian evolution. We suggest that evolutionary changes in sex determination provide a foundation for understanding important aspects of chromosome and genome organization that otherwise appear haphazard in their origins and contents. Species with genotypic sex determination often possess heteromorphic sex chromosomes, whereas species with environmental sex determination lack them. Through a series of mutations followed by selection at key genes, sex-determining mechanisms have turned over many times throughout the amniote lineage. As a consequence, amniote genomes have undergone gains or losses of sex chromosomes. We review the genomic and ecological contexts in which either temperature-dependent or genotypic sex determination has evolved. Once genotypic sex determination emerges in a lineage, viviparity and heteromorphic sex chromosomes become more likely to evolve. For example, in extinct marine reptiles, genotypic sex determination apparently led to viviparity, which in turn facilitated their pelagic radiation. Sex chromosomes comprise genome regions that differ from autosomes in recombination rate, mutation rate, levels of polymorphism, and the presence of sex-determining and sexually antagonistic genes. In short, many aspects of amniote genome complexity, life history, and adaptive radiation appear contingent on evolutionary changes in sex-determining mechanisms. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Xylella fastidiosa: An in vivo system to study possible survival strategies within citrus xylem vessels based on global gene expression analysis
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa inhabits the plant xylem, a nutrient-poor environment, so that mechanisms to sense and respond to adverse environmental conditions are extremely important for bacterial survival in the plant host. Although the complete genome sequences of different Xylella strains have been determined, little is known about stress responses and gene regulation in these organisms. In this work, a DNA microarray was constructed containing 2,600 ORFs identified in the genome sequencing project of Xylella fastidiosa 9a5c strain, and used to check global gene expression differences in the bacteria when it is infecting a symptomatic and a tolerant citrus tree. Different patterns of expression were found in each variety, suggesting that bacteria are responding differentially according to each plant xylem environment. The global gene expression profile was determined and several genes related to bacterial survival in stressed conditions were found to be differentially expressed between varieties, suggesting the involvement of different strategies for adaptation to the environment. The expression pattern of some genes related to the heat shock response, toxin and detoxification processes, adaptation to atypical conditions, repair systems as well as some regulatory genes are discussed in this paper. DNA microarray proved to be a powerful technique for global transcriptome analyses. This is one of the first studies of Xylella fastidiosa gene expression in vivo which helped to increase insight into stress responses and possible bacterial survival mechanisms in the nutrient-poor environment of xylem vessels.

TI  - Investigating the effect of different treatments with lactic acid bacteria on the fate of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus infection in galleria mellonella larvae
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
AB  - The use of Galleria mellonella as a model host to elucidate microbial pathogenesis and search for novel drugs and therapies has been well appreciated over the past years. However, the effect of microorganisms with functional appeal in the specific host remains scarce. The present study investigates the effect of treatment with selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with probiotic potential, as potential protective agents by using live or heat-killed cells at 6 and 24 h prior to infection with Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus or as potential therapeutic agents by using cell-free supernatants (CFS) after infection with the same pathogens. The employed LAB strains were Lactobacillus pentosus B281 and Lactobacillus plantarum B282 (isolated from table olive fermentations) along with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (inhabitant of human intestinal tract). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted while the pathogen's persistence in the larval hemolymph was determined by microbiological analysis. It was observed that the time (6 or 24 h) and type (live or heat-killed cells) of challenge period with LAB prior to infection greatly affected the survival of infected larvae. The highest decrease of L. monocytogenes population in the hemolymph was observed in groups challenged for 6 h with heat-killed cells by an average of 1.8 log units compared to non challenged larvae for strains B281 (p 0.0322), B282 (p 0.0325), and LGG (p 0.0356). In the case of S. aureus infection, the population of the pathogen decreased in the hemolymph by 1 log units at 8 h post infection in the groups challenged for 6 h with heat-killed cells of strains B281 (p 0.0161) and B282 (p 0.0096) and by 1.8 log units in groups challenged with heat-killed cells of LGG strain (p 0.0175). Further use of CFS of each LAB strain did not result in any significant prolonged survival but interestingly it resulted in pronounced decrease of L. monocytogenes in the hemolymph at 24 h and 48 h after infection by more than 1 log unit (p < 0.05) depending on the strain. The results of the present work support the broader use of G. mellonella larvae as a low cost in vivo tool for screening for probiotic properties.

TI  - Green sturgeon physical habitat use in the Coastal Pacific Ocean
VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - The green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) is a highly migratory, oceanic, anadromous species with a complex life history that makes it vulnerable to species-wide threats in both freshwater and at sea. Green sturgeon population declines have preceded legal protection and curtailment of activities in marine environments deemed to increase its extinction risk. Yet, its marine habitat is poorly understood. We built a statistical model to characterize green sturgeon marine habitat using data from a coastal tracking array located along the Siletz Reef near Newport, Oregon, USA that recorded the passage of 37 acoustically tagged green sturgeon. We classified seafloor physical habitat features with high-resolution bathymetric and backscatter data. We then described the distribution of habitat components and their relationship to green sturgeon presence using ordination and subsequently used generalized linear model selection to identify important habitat components. Finally, we summarized depth and temperature recordings from seven green sturgeon present off the Oregon coast that were fitted with pop-off archival geolocation tags. Our analyses indicated that green sturgeon, on average, spent a longer duration in areas with high seafloor complexity, especially where a greater proportion of the substrate consists of boulders. Green sturgeon in marine habitats are primarily found at depths of 20-60 meters and from 9.5-16.0 degrees C. Many sturgeon in this study were likely migrating in a northward direction, moving deeper, and may have been using complex seafloor habitat because it coincides with the distribution of benthic prey taxa or provides refuge from predators. Identifying important green sturgeon marine habitat is an essential step towards accurately defining the conditions that are necessary for its survival and will eventually yield range-wide, spatially explicit predictions of green sturgeon distribution.

TI  - Northern range expansion of European populations of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi is associated with global warming-correlated genetic admixture and population-specific temperature adaptations
VL  - 22
IS  - 8
SP  - 2232-2248
AB  - Poleward range expansions are observed for an increasing number of species, which may be an effect of global warming during the past decades. However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 59
SP  - 80-89
AB  - This study aims to investigate the co-composting of an inorganic industrial waste (eggshell - ES) in very high levels (up to 60% w/w). Since composting is a process in which solid, liquid and gaseous phases interact in a very complex way, there is a need to shed light on statistical tools that can unravel the main relationships structuring the variability associated to this process. In this study, PCA and data visualisation were used with that purpose. The co-composting tests were designed with increasing quantities of ES (0, 10, 20, 30 and 60%ES w/w) mixed with industrial potato peel and rice husks. Principal component analysis showed that physical properties like free air space, bulk density and moisture are the most relevant variables for explaining the variability due to ES content. On the other hand, variability in time dynamics is mostly driven by some chemical and phytoxicological parameters, such as organic matter decay and nitrate content. Higher ES incorporation (60% ES) enhanced the initial biological activity of the mixture, but the higher bulk density and lower water holding capacity had a negative effect on the aerobic biological activity as the process evolved. Nevertheless, pathogen-killing temperatures (>70 degrees C for 11 h) were attained. All the final products obtained after 90 days were stable and non-phytotoxic. This work proved that valorisation of high amounts of eggshell by co-composting is feasible, but prone to be influenced by the physical properties of the mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - FEA based reliability predictions for PBGA packages subjected to isothermal aging prior to thermal cycling
VL  - 2
AB  - The microstructure, mechanical response, and failure behavior of lead free solder joints in electronic assemblies are constantly evolving when exposed to isothermal aging and/or thermal cycling environments. In our prior work on aging effects, we have demonstrated that the observed material behavior degradations of Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) lead free solders during room temperature aging (25 C) and elevated temperature aging (50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 C) were unexpectedly large. The measured stress-strain data demonstrated large reductions in stiffness, yield stress, ultimate strength, and strain to failure (up to 50%) during the first 6 months after reflow solidification. In this study, we have used both accelerated life testing and finite element modeling to explore how prior isothermal aging affects the overall reliability of PBGA packages subjected to thermal cycling. In the experimental work, an extensive test matrix of thermal cycling reliability testing has been performed using a test vehicle incorporating several sizes (5, 10, 15, 19 mm) of BGA daisy chain components with 0.4 and 0.8 mm solder joint pitches (SAC305). PCB test boards with 3 different surface finishes (ImAg, ENIG and ENEPIG) were utilized. In this paper, we concentrate on the reporting the results for a PBGA component with 15 mm body size. Before thermal cycling began, the assembled test boards were divided up into test groups that were subjected to several sets of aging conditions (preconditioning) including 0, 6, and 12 months aging at T = 125 oC. After aging, the assemblies were subjected to thermal cycling (-40 to +125 oC) until failure occurred. The Weibull data failure plots have demonstrated that the thermal cycling reliabilities of pre-aged assemblies were significantly less than those of non-aged assemblies. A three-dimensional finite element model of the tested 15 mm PBGA packages was also developed. The cross-sectional details of the solder ball and the internal structure of the BGA were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to capture the real geometry of the package. Simulations of thermal cycling from -40 to 125 C were performed. To include the effects of aging in the calculations, we have used a revised set of Anand viscoplastic stress-strain relations for the SAC305 Pb-free solder material that includes material parameters that evolve with the thermal history of the solder material. The accumulated plastic work (energy density dissipation) was used as the failure variable; and the Darveaux approach to predict crack initiation and crack growth was applied with aging dependent parameters to estimate the fatigue lives of the studied packages. We have obtained good correlation between our new reliability modeling procedure that includes aging and the measured solder joint reliability data. As expected from our prior studies on degradation of SAC material properties with aging, the reliability reductions were more severe for higher aging temperature and longer aging times. © Copyright 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Physiological response to etho-ecological stressors in male Alpine chamois: Timescale matters!
VL  - 101
IS  - 7
SP  - 577-586
AB  - From a life history perspective, glucocorticoids secreted by the neuroendocrine system, integrating different sources of stress through an adaptive feedback mechanism, may have important consequences on individual fitness. Although stress responses have been the object of several investigations, few studies have explored the role of proximate mechanisms responsible for the potential trade-offs between physiological stress and life history traits integrating social and environmental stressors. In 2011 and 2012, we collected data on faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) in a marked male population of Alpine chamois, within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). Using a model selection approach we analysed the effect of potential etho-ecological stressors such as age, social status (territorial vs. non-territorial males), minimum temperature, snow depth and precipitation on FCM variation. To correctly interpret environmentally and socially induced stress responses, we conducted model selections over multiple temporal scales defined a priori: year, cold months, spring, warm months, mating season. Over the year, FCM levels showed a negative relationship with minimum temperature, but altogether, climatic stressors had negligible effects on glucocorticoid secretion, possibly owing to good adaptations of chamois to severe weather conditions. Age was negatively related to FCM during the rut, possibly due to greater experience of older males in agonistic contests. Social status was an important determinant of FCM excretion: while both the 'stress of subordination' and the 'stress of domination' hypotheses received some support in spring and during the mating season, respectively, previous data suggest that only the latter may have detrimental fitness consequences on male chamois. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Kinetic modeling of tandem hydrogenolysis/reforming of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol with in situ formed hydrogen in a batch slurry reactor
AB  - Glycerol is viewed as an important feedstock due to its availability in large quantities, as a byproduct during biodiesel production and possible production from sugar derived polyols. The efficient conversion of glycerol into higher value added chemicals, such as 1,2-propanediol, ethylene glycol and lactic acid is necessary to achieve the economic viability of such processes. When using a supported bimetallic Pt-Ru catalyst, this reaction system offers the possibility of generating hydrogen in situ instead of providing it from an external costly source, greatly improving the economics of the process. Furthermore, since the reaction can run at milder conditions compared to traditional hydrogenolysis with externally added hydrogen at high pressures, it improves the inherent safety of the process. This tandem approach has been recently demonstrated in our group (Roy et al., Catalysis Today 156 (2010) 31-37) for glycerol to 1,2-propanediol using admixture of supported Ru and Pt catalysts. In this presentation, a detailed kinetic model of this reforming/hydrogenolysis reaction using supported bimetallic Pt-Ru catalyst will be addressed. We build on our previous efforts (Torres et al., I&EC Research, 49 (2010) 10826-10835) by including several additional reaction pathways discerned by performing experiments with selected intermediate products such as 1,2-propanediol, ethylene glycol, methanol, syngas, among others. The experiments were carried out in a batch slurry reactor, using a 2%Pt-2%Ru/C catalyst, in which both gas and liquid phase product distribution was measured. The effects of different glycerol concentrations, pressure, and catalyst loading over a temperature range of 453-493 K were studied. A detailed analysis of mechanistic Langmuir Hinshelwood type kinetic models following a rigorous model discrimination procedure will be presented along with statistical analysis of the model parameters. This study is useful in understanding the mechanism of the reactions involved in hydrogenolysis of polyols in general, as well as the modeling and scale up of slurry and fixed bed reactors.

TI  - Thermal and compositional evolution of the martian mantle: Effects of water
VL  - 220
SP  - 50-72
AB  - We present numerical models of the thermochemical evolution of the mantle of Mars with particular attention paid to the effects of water. With a two-dimensional, anelastic, compressible convection algorithm in combination with a parameterized model of composition and thermoelastic properties, we consider how water in nominally anhydrous minerals may have influenced the melting and rheology of the martian mantle and how it may have been redistributed by melting, melt extraction, and convection over a period of 4 Gy. The strongest effect of water is found to be a marked increase in convective vigor due to the lower viscosity, which leads to faster cooling of the mantle but nonetheless enhances Melt production. Modeling results are compared with observations and independent inferences from spacecraft observations and martian meteorite analyses. Some models with radionuclide concentrations from Wanke and Dreibus (1994), but with initial mantle water concentrations between their estimate of 36 ppm by weight and 10 times this value, combined with similar to 50% degassing of crust-forming material, partly match observed crustal concentrations of K, Th, and water. In order to account for the observed chemical variation in crustal rocks, however, the formation and survival of ancient mantle heterogeneities appears to have been necessary. Water loss from the mantle since the end of the magma ocean stage has been minor. Elevated water contents notwithstanding, the depth variation of viscosity in the sub-lithospheric mantle of a given model is likely minor. Depths to the Curie temperature at the end of the Noachian range from similar to 40 to 60 km for magnetite and hematite in the models, and present-day total crustal thicknesses lie between 75 and 100 km. The depth to the brittle-ductile transition increases from values around 30 km in the early stages of the models to 170-240 km at present. An estimate of total core entropy renders the existence of a basal perovskite + ferropericlase layer unlikely. The absence of stable superplumes in all of our preferred models suggests that the volcanic provinces of Tharsis and Elysium were formed by a succession of more short-lived events, such as transient plumes, from specific regions at the core-mantle boundary.

TI  - Evidence of maternal effects on temperature preference in side-blotched lizards: Implications for evolutionary response to climate change
VL  - 3

SP  - 1977-1991
AB  - Natural populations respond to selection pressures like increasing local temperatures in many ways, including plasticity and adaptation. To predict the response of ectotherms like lizards to local temperature increase, it is essential to estimate phenotypic variation in and determine the heritability of temperature-related traits like average field body temperature (Tb) and preferred temperature (Tp). We measured Tp of Uta stansburiana in a laboratory thermal gradient and assessed the contribution of sex, reproductive status and throat color genotype to phenotypic variation in Tb of adult lizards. Females had higher Tp than males. However, they temporarily preferred lower temperature when gravid than when nongravid. Using a nested half-sib design for genetic crosses in the laboratory, we estimated relative contributions of additive genetic variation and maternal effects to Tp of hatchlings. Our results show that maternal effects, but not additive genetic variation, influence Tp of hatchlings in U. stansburiana. Maternal Tp and the presence or absence of blue throat color alleles significantly influenced Tp of hatchlings. We discuss ecological and evolutionary consequences of these maternal effects in the context of rapid climate change and natural selection that we measure on progeny survival to maturity as a function of maternal Tp. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Differences in immune defense evasion of selected inbred lines of Heterorhabditis Bacteriophora in two white grub species
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
SP  - 378-389
AB  - We determined virulence of seven Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain GPS11 inbred lines possessing superior infective juvenile longevity, and heat and ultra violet radiation tolerance against white grubs Popillia japonica and Cyclocephala borealis. At 1 and 2 weeks after treatment, inbred line A2 was significantly more virulent towards P. japonica compared to the parent strain GPS11 and inbred lines A7, A8, A12 and A21, and line A2 caused significantly higher C. borealis mortality than lines A6 and A12. Penetration, encapsulation and survival of two inbred lines, A2 and A12, that showed the highest and lowest virulence against both grub species were then assessed. There were no differences between the two lines for the total number of nematodes penetrated in either P. japonica or C. borealis within the first 24 h, but a significantly higher percentage of penetrated nematodes were alive in line A2 compared to the line A12 in both grub species. P. japonica immune response over time to hemocoel-injected nematodes of A2, A12 and the parent strain was further investigated. While all injected nematodes were encapsulated at 6 h post injection, non-encapsulated living nematodes were detected at 12 and 24 h post injection, showing the breakage out of encapsulation. A higher percentage of non-encapsulated living nematodes and a lower percentage of dead nematodes were found in line A2 as compared to the line A12 after 12 h post injection. These data suggest that virulence differences in the studied H. bacteriophora inbred lines are not due to differences in nematode penetration or recognition by the grub immune system, but are related to the ability of the infective juveniles to break out of encapsulation. © 2012 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Thermal plasticity in life-history traits in the polymorphic blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans: No differences between female morphs
VL  - 11
AB  - Female polymorphism is observed in various animal species, but is particularly common in damselflies. The maintenance of this polymorphism has traditionally been explained from frequency and density dependent sexual conflict, however, the role of abiotic factors has recently attracted more interest. Here, the role of ambient temperature in shaping life-history was investigated for the three female morphs of Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden) (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae). Eggs were obtained from the three mature female morphs for two populations in the Netherlands. Using a split-brood design, eggs of both populations were divided between a cold and a warm treatment group in the laboratory, and egg survival and hatching time were measured. Significant thermal plasticity was found in both hatching time and egg survival between both temperature treatments. However, individuals born to mothers belonging to different colour morphs did not differ in their response to temperature treatment. Independent of colour morph, clear differences in both life-history traits between the populations were found, suggesting local adaptation. Specifically, individuals from one population hatched faster but had lower egg survival in both thermal regimes. The selection force establishing fast hatching could be (facultative) bivoltinism in one of the populations compared to univoltinism in the other. This would be in line with the more southern (and more coastal) location of the presumed bivoltine population and the inverse relation between voltinism and latitude known from earlier studies. However, other natural selection forces, e. g. deterioration of the aquatic habitat, may also drive fast hatching.

TI  - Fitness of heat and desiccation tolerant hybrid strains of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Rhabditidomorpha: Heterorhabditidae)
VL  - 83
IS  - 3
SP  - 281-287
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Heterorhabditis are a suitable alternative to chemical insecticides because of their high control effect against insects in cryptic environments and their environmental safety. The availability of H. bacteriophora hybrid strains with increased tolerance to environmental extremes could be a driving force for a more widespread use of nematode-based plant protection products. However, increase in heat and desiccation tolerance of hybrid strains could compromise their fitness regarding virulence, host penetration and reproductive capacity. The fitness of heat and desiccation tolerant hybrid strains was compared to the commercial strain EN 01. Only the heat tolerant strains were superior or similar in fitness to strain EN 01. The strains with increased desiccation tolerance were usually less fit, a possible result of a trade-off effect of selection for desiccation tolerance. Hybrid strains selected for enhanced tolerance after an adaptation to stress were generally better in fitness ranking compared to those for which adaptation prior to stress exposure was excluded. This might be a result of pleitropy. Host penetration and virulence was not correlated. The commercial strain had the highest reproduction per mean number of nematodes penetrating the host insect, which is a result of automatic selection of inbred lines with high reproduction potential during the commercial production process in liquid culture. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 72
IS  - 2
SP  - 361-369
AB  - Flavour ingredients are an essential part of e-liquids. Their responsible selection and inclusion levels in e-liquids must be guided by toxicological principles. We propose an approach to the screening and toxicological risk assessment of flavour ingredients for e-liquids. The screening involves purity requirements and avoiding ingredients that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Additionally, owing to the uncertainties involved in potency determination and the derivation of a tolerable level for respiratory sensitisation, we propose excluding respiratory sensitisers. After screening, toxicological data on the ingredients should be reviewed. Inhalation-specific toxicological issues, for which no reliable safe levels can currently be derived, can lead to further ingredient exclusions. We discuss the use of toxicological thresholds of concern for flavours that lack inhalation data suitable for quantitative risk assessment. Higher toxicological thresholds of concern are suggested for flavour ingredients (170 or 980 mu g/day) than for contaminant assessment (1.5 mu g/day). Analytical detection limits for measurements of potential reaction and thermal breakdown products in vaping aerosol, should be informed by the contaminant threshold. This principle leads us to recommend 5 ng/puff as an appropriate limit of detection for untargeted aerosol measurements. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 178
SP  - 107-115
AB  - Interspecific hybridization and introgression are of conservation concern because they can lead to lower fitness, and in some cases, extinction of the parental population or species. Alternatively, hybridization can lead to increased fitness (i.e., heterosis) via generation of new genetic combinations and increased adaptive potential. There have been isolated observations of the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) hybridizing with the closely-related bobcat (Lynx rufus), but no comprehensive study has been undertaken of lynx bobcat hybridization across their geographic ranges. The lynx distribution in North America has contracted by 40% from its historical range, and hybridization with bobcats is a potential, uncertain threat to lynx conservation. We conducted a continental-scale assessment of the prevalence of hybridization and genetic introgression between lynx (n = 1776, Canada and Alaska, USA) and bobcat (n = 1075, Canada and conterminous USA). Using control region sequences and clustering of microsatellite data, we found that the prevalence of genetic introgression was relatively low (7 of 2851 individuals (0.24%)). We found evidence of backcrossing to both lynx and bobcat parental types, suggesting that hybrids can be fertile. If the abundance of Canada lynx at the southern extent of its distribution is low relative to bobcat, hybridization and backcrossing with bobcat over several generations could result in the loss of lynx in areas of sympatry. If climate warming results in the bobcat distribution shifting northward towards the southern extent of the lynx distribution, the likelihood of interspecific hybridization could increase.

VL  - 11
SP  - 71-80
AB  - Recent technological developments have facilitated intensified searches for genetic markers under selection in nonmodel species. Here, we present an approach for the identification of candidate gene variation in nonmodel organisms. We report on the characterization of 82 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and on the development of a specific genotyping assay for 30 SNPs in 18 candidate genes for growth and reproduction in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). These markers can be used for scanning natural populations for signatures of selection in both contemporary and archived historical samples, for example in retrospective studies assessing the effects of environmental changes, such as increasing temperatures, and selection imposed by high fishing pressure. Furthermore, these gene markers may be of interest to aquaculture, serving as a starting point for linking phenotypic traits important for productivity with genotypes and potentially be of use for marker-assisted selection in the future. This study demonstrates that the candidate gene approach is a valuable and targeted complement to the more random approach for discovering genetic variation in the genome and transcriptome applied through high throughput methods in nonmodel species. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Fluctuations in water temperature can have important physiological consequences for fishes. Effects of daily thermal cycles are well studied and can be beneficial, increasing prey consumption and growth rates when mean and maximum temperatures of the fluctuations are at or below the species’ optimum temperature. While less studied, subdaily temperature fluctuations are also common in many aquatic habitats and can be caused by both natural and anthropogenic processes. We performed laboratory experiments to examine how two fish species (yellow perch, Perca flavescens, and walleye, Sander vitreus) with similar thermal preferences respond to chronic exposure to subdaily temperature variability. We selected temperature treatments that reflected observed thermal variation after examining water temperature data from multiple aquatic systems. We then separately exposed yellow perch and walleye to a stable 23 °C treatment and 12-h cycles of 23 ± 2 °C or 23 ± 4 °C for 45 days. Adult yellow perch exposed to fluctuations of 23 ± 4 °C over 12 h expressed higher consumption, growth and food conversion efficiency than fish experiencing stable 23 °C. Temperature fluctuations, though, resulted in mortalities and the development of skin ulcers in yellow perch that did not occur under stable temperatures. In contrast, the same 12-h temperature fluctuations did not result in mortalities or stress responses in juvenile walleye. Moreover, unlike yellow perch, growth rates of walleye were lower under 12-h temperature fluctuations compared with the stable 23 °C treatment. Our results indicate that species with similar thermal preferences can respond differently to the same subdaily temperature fluctuations. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - The radiation exposure due to 222Rn and its progeny inhalation for clients and employees of selected thermal water spas was assessed. The radon risk was calculated using the measured 222Rn activity concentrations in the investigated thermal waters and radon transfer coefficient, defined as a fraction of radon released from the swimming pool water to the indoor air of swimming pool. The total radon in air concentration was not measured. The annual effective doses for workers and clients of the studied spa centers excluding Ladek-Zdrój ranged from 0.02 to 2.69mSv and 0.40 to 48 μSv, respectively. For thermal water from Ladek-Zdrój (Laek-Zdrój L-2), significantly elevated doses were observed both for workers (10.8 mSv) and clients (194 μSv). © The Author 2017.

TI  - Does the growth temperature of a prokaryote influence the purine content of its mRNAs?
VL  - 497
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-89
AB  - The formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between nucleic acid bases are dependent on temperature. The high G + C content of organisms was surmised to be an adaptation for high temperature survival because of the thermal stability of G:C pairs. However, a survey of genomic GC% and optimum growth temperature (OGT) of several prokaryotes revoked any direct relation between them. Significantly high purine (R=A or G) content in mRNAs is also seen as a selective response for survival among thermophiles. Nevertheless, the biological relevance of thermophiles loading their unstable mRNAs with excess purines (purine-loading or R-loading) is not persuasive. Here, we analysed the mRNA sequences from the genomes of 168 prokaryotes (as obtained from NCBI Genome database) with their OGTs ranging from -5 degrees C to 100 degrees C to verify the relation between R-loading and OCT. Our analysis fails to demonstrate any correlation between R-loading of the mRNA pool and OCT of a prokaryote. The percentage of purine-loaded mRNAs in prokaryotes is found to be in a rough negative correlation with the genomic GC% (r(2) = 0.655, slope = -1.478, P<000.1). We conclude that genomic GC% and bias against certain combinations of nucleotides drive the mRNA-synonymous (sense) strands of DNA towards variations in R-loading. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 16

SP  - 801-810
AB  - Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for longevity and fecundity at two temperatures, 20 and 30 °C, in two sets of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) highly differing in thermotolerance. Early fecundity (EF) and longevity showed a negative association between temperatures. For instance, longevity was higher and fecundity was lower in the RIL panel showing higher life span at 30 °C. One X-linked QTL (7B3-12E) co-localized for longevity and EF at 20 °C, with one QTL allele showing a positive additive effect on longevity and a negative effect on EF. The across-RIL genetic correlation between longevity and EF was not significant within each temperature, and most QTL that affect life span have no effect on EF at each temperature. EF and longevity can mostly be genetically uncoupled in the thermotolerance-divergent RIL within each temperature as opposed to between temperatures. QTL were mostly temperature specific, although some trait-specific QTL showed possible antagonistic effects between temperatures. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 81
SP  - 144-152
AB  - The main topic of this paper was the combination of statistic tools, technological, and functional properties to select starter cultures for fermented sausages. One-hundred sixty-four isolates were recovered from pork meat, and studied for their enzymatic patterns, growth as a function of temperature, pH, NaCl, nitrites and nitrates, and acidification. The growth was assessed through a spectrophotometric approach to evaluate the Growth Index; then, the data were used as input variables to run Cluster and Principal Component Analyses. Fifty-three promising isolates were selected for their Growth Index in presence of salt, nitrites, at low temperatures, or acidification. These isolates were studied for some functional properties (survival at pH 2.0/2.5, and in presence of bile salts, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial activity towards some foodborne pathogens). The results of these experiments were used to select 4 best candidates, using the statistical distribution of each trait (median and quartiles). As a final step, the isolates were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum and studied for their ability to inhibit foodborne pathogens, a mould (Mucor spp.) or for the lacking of negative interactions with an adjunct starter of fermented sausages (Staphylococcus xylosus). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Changing the game of fluid placement: Intelligent-well intervention on a trilaterad horizontal well
SP  - 83-92
AB  - Matrix acidizing stimulation in carbonate formations with open hole and multilateral completions presents several challenges to insure an optimum treatment is performed. Each lateral must be accessed to place and clean up the acid treatment. The key objective of the intervention is not only to eliminate as much as possible the damage in the matrix produced by the drilling and completion process, but also trying to connect to high conductive fractures that will maximize the drainage of hydrocarbons out of the fornation. In this type of completions, traditional practices are limited to spot stages of fluids (pre-flush, acid, and diversion) in front of the formation without much control over the placement. This document describes, through a field experience, how new Coiled Tubing (CT) conveyed downhole measurements can assist to overcome the challenges above, enabling more intelligent interventions. An innovative workflow designed to optimize stimulation treatments as they occur was implemented for the first time in Saudi Arabia on a sub-hydrostatic, trilateral horizontal openhole oil producer. The workflow uses as reference formation porosity or permeability logs as well as Distributed Temperature Surveys (DTS) for the evaluation of distribution and fluid temperature responses to decide selective placement of stimulation fluids. A consistent lateral fluid flow distribution from the preflush stages and acid stage treatments in each well's lateral, as well as a bullhead injection test recorded in the main bore, is presented. Selective lateral access was enabled by using an Indexing Flow-activated Bent Sub (IFBS) and confirmed upon entry using a real-time casing collar locator (CCL). The well began producing at the maximum capacity of the ESP pump used to clean the well after the acid treatment, with results that exceeded expectations, effectively overcoming the high drawdown and low Productivity Index (Pl) observed in the well. This experience demonstrates that innovative downhole measurements in combination with the referred workflow make possible to understand fluid distribution and control fluid placement with Coiled Tubing, unlocking the well production potential. This new technique is proven to be an optimum solution for the type of completions commonly found in Middle East.

VL  - 5
IS  - 6
AB  - Background: The potential to adapt to a changing climate depends in part upon the standing genetic variation present in wild populations. In corals, the dispersive larval phase is particularly vulnerable to the effects of environmental stress. Larval survival and response to stress during dispersal and settlement will play a key role in the persistence of coral populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test the hypothesis that larval transcription profiles reflect location-specific responses to thermal stress, symbiont-free gametes from three to four colonies of the scleractinian coral Montastraea faveolata were collected from Florida and Mexico, fertilized, and raised under mean and elevated (up 1 to 2°C above summer mean) temperatures. These locations have been shown to exchange larvae frequently enough to prevent significant differentiation of neutral loci. Differences among 1,310 unigenes were simultaneously characterized using custom cDNA microarrays, allowing investigation of gene expression patterns among larvae generated from wild populations under stress. Results show both conserved and location-specific variation in key processes including apoptosis, cell structuring, adhesion and development, energy and protein metabolism, and response to stress, in embryos of a reef-building coral. Conclusions/Significance: These results provide first insights into location-specific variation in gene expression in the face of gene flow, and support the hypothesis that coral host genomes may house adaptive potential needed to deal with changing environmental conditions. © 2010 Polato et al.

TI  - Evaluating SoilGen2 as a tool for projecting soil evolution induced by global change
VL  - 571
SP  - 110-123
AB  - To protect soils against threats, it is necessary to predict the consequences of human activities and global change on their evolution on a ten to hundred year time scale. Mechanistic modelling of soil evolution is then a useful tool. We analysed the ability of the SoilGen model to be used for projections of soil characteristics associated to various soil threats: vertical distributions of <2 mu m fraction, organic carbon content (OC), bulk density and pH. This analysis took the form of a functional sensitivity analysis in which we varied the initial conditions (parent material properties) and boundary conditions (co-evolution of precipitation and temperature; type and amount of fertilization and tillage as well as duration of agriculture). The simulated scenario variants comprised anthroposequences in Luvisols at two sites with one default scenario, six variants for initial conditions and 12 variants for boundary conditions. The variants reflect the uncertainties to our knowledge of parent material properties or reconstructed boundary conditions. We demonstrated a sensitivity of the model to climate and agricultural practices for all properties. We also conclude that final model results are not significantly affected by the uncertainties of boundary conditions for long simulations runs, although influenced by uncertainties on initial conditions. The best results were for organic carbon, although improvements can be reached through calibration or by incorporating a dynamic vegetation growth module in SoilGen. Results were poor for bulk density due to a fixed-volume assumption in the model, which is not easily modified. The <2 mu m fraction depth patterns are reasonable but the process of clay new formation needs to be added to obtain the belly shape of the Bt horizon. After calibration for organic carbon under agriculture, the model is suitable for producing soil projections due to global change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - An advanced flexible solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack concept with the potential for increased reliability, better performance and lower cost is being developed. This stack concept integrates primesurface interconnects and single cells into a lightweight and compact structure with reliable gas seals for efficient operation at various temperatures depending on selected materials. The concept has several attractive features including reduced stack weight and volume, decreased in performance losses in stacking, improved sealing, versatility in incorporation of different types of cell construction (for example, conventional sintered ceramic cells or metal-supported cells) and flexibility in gas flow configuration. The prime-surface interconnect is a one-piece metal sheet that incorporates both fuel and oxidant flow fields with peaks on one side of the interconnect serving as flow channels (valleys) on the other side, for example, the egg-carton shaped prime-surface flow field. The design of the prime-surface interconnect including the key factors impact on pressure drop, flow uniformity and formability is being evaluated. Hydroforming has been identified as the forming approach for prime surface interconnects. Development of metal-supported cells has been initiated. A fabrication process based on sputtering is being developed for producing cells on metal supports for this stack concept. © The Electrochemical Society.

TI  - Microstructural evolution during friction stir welding of Ti-6Al-4V alloy
SP  - 385-403
AB  - The successful application of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy relies heavily on the availability of welding process producing superior quality joints. Fusion welding technologies, which are conventionally used to join titanium alloys, generally enable to produce high-quality welds with a relatively high productivity. However, the fusion welding is usually associated with solidification problems which may significantly deteriorate service properties of the titanium weldments. In this regard, friction stir welding, being an innovative "solid-state" joining technology, may potentially be attractive for Ti-6Al-4V. Basically, FSW involves plunging a specially designed tool rotating at high speeds into abutted edges of sheet workpieces to be welded and then translating the tool along the weld seam. The rotating tool produces frictional heat which softens the material so it can be readily extruded around the tool to fill the cavity to the rear of the tool and to form a joint in a solid state. As a solid-state process, FSW avoids (or limits) solidification problems and thus provides defect-free welds having excellent mechanical properties. In order to improve the basic physical understanding of FSW of Ti-6Al-4V, the present contribution is focused on microstructural evolution during the welding process. The microstructural development is found to be a complex process involving α-to-β phase transformation during heating stage, deformation in the high-temperature β-phase field during stirring stage and β-to-α phase transformation upon cooling stage of FSW. The α-to-β phase transformation is shown to be governed by epitaxial growth of the pre-existing β phase consuming the α phase. Reconstruction of the β-grain structure and orientation measurements in the retained β phase have demonstrated that microstructural evolution in the high-temperature β phase field is a complex process involving grain growth, geometrical effects of strain, transverse grain subdivision and discontinuous recrystallization stimulated by local grain boundary migration; material flow may be described in the term of simple shear deformation arising from {110}<111> slip. The β-to-α phase transformation after FSW is established to be governed by Burgers orientation relationship which dictated the final weld crystallography. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is distributed in warm environments with short periods of extreme temperatures, suggesting mechanisms to adapt and expand to new areas. The aim of this study was to determine how temperature affects fitness of B. tabaci, particularly during short periods of stressful high temperatures. Thermotolerance curves were constructed at different one-hour heat shocks (37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45 degrees C and a control at 25 degrees C), measuring its effect on three life history traits involved in fitness: survival, fecundity and viability. Then, temperatures were selected to establish an induced thermotolerance or hardening treatment (40 degrees C/lh, 25 degrees C/lh and 45 degrees C/lh) to compare with the basal thermotolerance (45 degrees C/lh). The heat shocks significantly affected B. tabaci survival between 41 degrees C (82.5%) and 45 degrees C (2.7%). Fecundity was only affected significantly at 45 degrees C without oviposition. Viability diminished significantly at 44 degrees C (67%). Thermal hardening increased survival from 2.73% (45 degrees C/lh) to 10% in males and 33% in females; although it was significantly higher in females, only. These results show high thermotolerance of B. tabaci to heat shocks, evidencing plasticity of the species to survive a broad range of temperatures (>= 25 degrees C), which contributes to explaining the expansion of biotype B distribution in areas and seasons with extreme high temperatures.

TI  - Innovative application of RFID systems to special education schools
SP  - 299-304
AB  - Innovation is a new way of doing something. It may be incremental, radical, or revolutionary changes in thinking, products, processes, or organizations. Different from invention, which is an idea made manifest, innovation is ideas applied successfully. In this work, we strive to apply innovative Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems to special education school campus because in this modern age of science and technology, there still exists a wide digital gap in special education schools such that they have not yet benefited from technology advancements such as RFID. Supported by the ministry of education in Taiwan, we successfully designed and deployed RFID technology to the campus of a special education school at Chiayi in Taiwan. Though the technology was applied to eight different use case scenarios, we will focus on five of the more innovative ones in this work, including student temperature monitoring (STM), body weight monitoring (BWM), garbage disposal monitoring (GDM), mopping course recording (MCR), and campus visitor monitoring (CVM). Both active and passive tags and readers were employed to implement these five systems within the same campus. The benefits obtained from these systems by the students, teachers, and administrators were three-folds. First, student health monitoring through STM and BWM systems allowed the teachers and administration real-time control over changing health conditions that significantly affects such students. Second, course monitoring and recording through GDM and MCR allowed teachers to easily grasp and tune the learning curve of each student and also to implement a more guided training based on past learning efforts. Last but not least, campus safety monitoring through CVM allowed the administration to monitor the location of visitors in the campus and thus safeguard the students and teachers from dangerous or troublesome visitors. Novel techniques and creative methods were employed in the five systems, including temperature correction algorithm in STM, BMI-based weight tuning strategy in BWM, multiple route-tracking in GDM, learning improvement through history analysis in MCR, and face detection in CVM. The project was successfully deployed and is currently in use by the Chiayi School of Special Education which has more than 300 students and 150 administration staff and faculty. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The effects of heat-shock during pelagic stages on growth and survival of juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus were investigated to test the possibility to acquire high thermal tolerance individuals after the heat-shock selection. Larvae at the stages of blastula, gastrula, and auricularia were heat-shocked at selected temperatures (21.5, control; 26, 28, and 30°C) for 45 min and returned to 21.5°C for continuous rearing. There was a significant difference in thermal sensitivity among different developmental stages, and thermal tolerance of the larvae was correlated with the expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Juveniles after the heat-shock selection at pelagic stages showed higher induced thermotolerance than those without heat-shock. Therefore, heat-shock application at early pelagic development stages is potentially a useful way to select high-thermotolerance variety of the sea cucumbers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Association mapping of hagberg falling number in hard white spring wheat
VL  - 54
IS  - 3
SP  - 1243-1252
AB  - Hagberg falling number (FN) is an important quality trait used for grain grading. The FN test can only be measured in the late stages of variety development when progeny are homogeneous and sufficient grain is available for testing. The FN is strongly influenced by environmental conditions during reproductive growth stages, including excess moisture, extreme temperature, and biotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this study was to identify potential genomic regions that influence FN in a subset of 110 hard white spring (HWS) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accessions from the National Small Grain Collection (NSGC) using genome-wide association mapping. The FN tests were conducted using grain flour samples of these accessions grown in five environments. A total of 1740 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to detect SNP-FN associations using both the general linear model (GLM) and the mixed linear model (MLM). Thirteen quantitative trait loci (QTL) located in nine chromosomal regions were identified in both GLM and MLM approaches. Pyramiding these QTL could explain up to 45% of the phenotypic variation of FN. The present study identified several potential markers for use in marker-assisted selection for high FN lines in wheat breeding. © Crop Science Society of America.

TI  - Importance of fish behaviour in modelling conservation problems: Food limitation as an example
VL  - 79
IS  - 6
SP  - 1648-1662
AB  - Simulation experiments using the inSTREAM individual-based brown trout Salmo trutta population model explored the role of individual adaptive behaviour in food limitation, as an example of how behaviour can affect managers' understanding of conservation problems. The model includes many natural complexities in habitat (spatial and temporal variation in characteristics such as depth and velocity, temperature, hiding and feeding cover, drift-food supply and predation risk), fish physiology (especially, how food intake and growth vary with hydrodynamics, cover, fish size and temperature) and behaviour. When drift-food concentration was increased over a wide range in 7 year simulations, the simulated population was always food limited. In fact, as food supply increased, the population increased at an increasing rate and consumed a higher percentage of the food supply, apparently because higher food concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects on salmonid populations. Published 2011.

TI  - Can we improve heterosis for root growth of maize by selecting parental inbred lines with different temperature behaviour?
VL  - 367
IS  - 1595
SP  - 1580-1588
AB  - Tolerance to high and low temperature is an important breeding aim for Central and Northern Europe, where temperature fluctuations are predicted to increase. However, the extent to which genotypes differ in their response to the whole range of possible temperatures is not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines with differing temperature optima for root growth would lead to superior hybrids. This hypothesis is based on the concept of 'marginal overdominance' in which the hybrid expresses higher relative fitness than its parents, summed over all situations. The elongation rates of axile and lateral roots of the reciprocal cross between two flint and two dent inbred lines were assessed at temperatures between 15 degrees C and 40 degrees C. Indeed, the cross between UH005 and UH250 with lateral root growth temperature optima at 34 degrees C and 28 degrees C, respectively, resulted in intermediate hybrids. At temperatures below and above 31 degrees C, the hybrids' root growth was comparable to the better parent, respectively, thereby increasing temperature tolerance of the hybrid compared with its parents. The implications of and reasons for this heterosis effect are discussed in the context of breeding for abiotic stress tolerance and of putatively underlying molecular mechanisms. This finding paves the way for more detailed investigations of this phenomenon in future studies.

TI  - Effects of reproduction on immuno-suppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for their roles as mechanisms underpinning life history trade-offs, are tissue and assay dependent
VL  - 216
IS  - 22
SP  - 4242-4250
AB  - Life history parameters appear to be traded off against each other, but the physiological mechanisms involved remain unclear. One hypothesis is that potentially energetically costly processes such as immune function and protection from oxidative stress may be compromised during reproductive attempts because of selective resource allocation. Lower temperatures also impose energy costs, and hence allocation decisions might be more pronounced when animals are forced to reproduce in the cold. Here, we experimentally tested whether reproduction at different ambient temperatures was associated with elevated oxidative stress and suppressed immune function in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Using a variety of different markers for both immune function and oxidative stress, we found that some measures of immune function (serum bactericidal capacity and size of the thymus) were significantly suppressed, while some measures of oxidative protection [serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity] were also reduced, and a marker of oxidative damage (protein carbonyls in serum) was increased in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils. These changes were in line with the selective resource allocation predictions. However, the phytohaemagglutinin response and serum total immunoglobulin (IgG) were not suppressed, and other markers of oxidative damage [malondialdehyde (MDA) (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver] were actually lower in lactating compared with non-reproductive gerbils, consistent with increased levels of SOD activity and total antioxidant capacity in the liver. These latter changes were opposite of the expectations based on resource allocation. Furthermore, other measures of protection (GPx levels in the liver and protein thiols in both serum and liver) and damage [MDA (TBARS) in serum] were unrelated to reproductive status. Ambient temperature differences did not impact on these patterns. Collectively, our results indicated that the inferred effects of reproduction on immunosuppression and oxidative damage, and hence support or otherwise for particular physiological mechanisms that underpin life history trade-offs, are critically dependent on the exact markers and tissues used. This may be because during reproduction individuals selectively allocate protection to some key tissues, but sacrifice protection of others. © 2013. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Installed ultrasonic sensor systems are becoming more commonly used and accepted as a method to improve data integrity and increase productivity for Oil & Gas asset inspections - especially with underground, insulated, offshore, and other hard-To-Access thickness monitoring locations (TMLs). Example applications where installed sensor technologies have been deployed successfully include crude overhead lines, sour water service, offshore risers for sand monitoring, and midstream buried pipelines. Many additional applications of these systems are anticipated to augment static thickness monitoring, improve the accuracy of thickness data/trending, and reduce pressure-boundary penetration of conventional corrosion probes while allowing both remote and real-Time monitoring where desirable. This paper will review the development of a new, flexible, permanently installed monitoring system. Concepts for optimizing the measurement system will be discussed, including hard-wired and wireless approaches, proper transducer selection, temperature compensation, and statistical data analysis. © 2016 by NACE International.

TI  - Morphological plasticity in a calcifying modular organism: Evidence from an in situ transplant experiment in a natural CO2 vent system
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Understanding is currently limited of the biological processes underlying the responses of modular organisms to climate change and the potential to adapt through morphological plasticity related to their modularity. Here, we investigate the effects of ocean acidification and seawater warming on the growth, life history and morphological plasticity in the modular bryozoan Calpensia nobilis using transplantation experiments in a shallow Mediterranean volcanic CO2 vents system that simulates pH values expected for the year 2100. Colonies exposed at vent sites grew at approximately half the rate of those from the control site. Between days 34 and 48 of the experiment, they reached a possible ‘threshold’, due to the combined effects of exposure time and pH. Temperature did not affect zooid length, but longer zooids with wider primary orifices occurred in low pH conditions close to the vents. Growth models describing colony development under different environmental scenarios suggest that stressed colonies of C. nobilis reallocate metabolic energy to the consolidation and strengthening of existing zooids. This is interpreted as a change in life-history strategy to support persistence under unfavourable environmental conditions. Changes in the skeletal morphology of zooids evident in C. nobilis during short-time (87 days) exposure experiments reveal morphological plasticity that may indicate a potential to adapt to the more acidic Mediterranean predicted for the future. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Differential Levels of Stress Proteins (HSPs) in Male and Female Daphnia magna in Response to Thermal Stress: A Consequence of Sex-Related Behavioral Differences?
VL  - 37
IS  - 7
SP  - 670-676
AB  - In two independent experiments, we compared: (1) water depth selection (and accompanying temperature selection) by male and female Daphnia magna under different kinds of environmental stress, including the presence of filamentous cyanobacteria, the risk of predation from fish, and the presence of toxic compounds; and (2) sex-dependent production of heat shock proteins (HSP60, 70, and 90) in response to a sudden change in temperature. Male D. magna selected deep water strata, which offer a relatively stable environment, and thereby avoided the threat of predation and the presence of toxic compounds in surface waters. Correlated with this behavior, males reduce their molecular defenses against stress, such as the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs), and do not maintain the physiological machinery that triggers an increase in HSP levels in response to stress. In contrast, female D. magna actively select habitats that offer optimal conditions for growth and production of offspring. Consequently, females are exposed to variable environmental conditions that may be associated with increased stress. To permit survival in these different habitats, D. magna females require molecular mechanisms to protect their cells from rapid changes in stress levels. Thus, they maintain high constitutive levels of the heat shock proteins from HSP 60, 70, and 90 families, and they have the potential to further enhance the production of the majority of these proteins under stress conditions. The results of this study indicate that the separate habitats selected by male and female D. magna result in different patterns of HSP production, leading us to hypothesize that that male and female Daphnia magna adopt different strategies to maximize the fitness of the species. © 2011 The Author(s).

TI  - Genetic and environmental contributions to variation and population divergence in a broad-spectrum foliar defence of Eucalyptus tricarpa
VL  - 105
IS  - 5
SP  - 707-717
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both environmental and genetic effects contribute to phenotypic variation within and among populations. Genetic differentiation of quantitative traits among populations has been shown in many species, yet it can also be accompanied by other genetic changes, such as divergence in phenotypic plasticity and in genetic variance. Sideroxylonal (a formylated phloroglucinol compound or FPC) is an important chemical defence in eucalypts. The effect of environmental variation on its production is a critical gap in our understanding of its genetics and evolution. METHODS: The stability of genetic variation in sideroxylonal was assessed within and among populations of Eucalyptus tricarpa in three replicated provenance/progeny trials. The covariance structure of the data was also modelled to test whether genetic variances were consistent among populations and Fain's test was applied for major gene effects. KEY RESULTS: A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred at the level of population, and was related to temperature range and seasonality in source populations. Within-population genetic variation was not affected by genotype x environment effects or different sampling years. However, within-population genetic variance for sideroxylonal concentration differed significantly among source populations. Regression of family variance on family mean suggested that this trait is subject to major gene effects, which could explain the observed differences in genetic variances among populations. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of replicated common-garden experiments for understanding the genetic basis of population differences. Genotype x environment interactions are unlikely to impede evolution or responses to artificial selection on sideroxylonal, but the lack of genetic variation in some populations may be a constraint. The results are broadly consistent with localized selection on foliar defence and illustrate that differentiation in population means, whether due to selection or to drift, can be accompanied by changes in other characteristics, such as plasticity and genetic variance.

TI  - Local adaptations of life-history traits of a Drosophila parasitoid, Leptopilina boulardi: Does climate drive evolution?
VL  - 35

SP  - 727-736
AB  - Climate is an important source of selection on life histories, and local adaptations to climate have been described in several cline studies. Temperature is the main climatic factor that has been considered as an agent of selection, whereas other factors may vary with it, such as precipitation.We compared life-history traits of five populations of Leptopilina boulardi, a Drosophila parasitoid, originating from contrasting climates. Referring to cline studies, we hypothesised shorter lifespan, earlier reproduction, and lower lipid content in populations from the hottest and driest areas if life histories have been selected in response to temperature and/or humidity.Our results are opposite to these predictions. Females from humid and mild climates invested more in early reproduction and lived for fewer days than females from dry and hot areas, which were synovigenic (i.e. they matured additional eggs during adult life) and able to synthesise lipids during adult life.We suggest that life histories are more adapted to host distribution than to climatic factors. Drosophila patches are more abundant in the humid area, allowing the parasitoids to spend less energy and time finding hosts. This may result in selection for early reproduction traded-off against longevity. In the hot and dry climate, females have to fly large distances to find host patches. Synovigeny, a long lifespan, lipogenesis, and high dispersal ability may be adaptive there. This is the first time that between-population differences in the ability to synthesise lipids have been described in parasitoids. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Quantifying thermal extremes and biological variation to predict evolutionary responses to changing climate
VL  - 372
IS  - 1723
AB  - Central ideas from thermal biology, including thermal performance curves and tolerances, have been widely used to evaluate how changes in environmental means and variances generate changes in fitness, selection and microevolution in response to climate change. We summarize the opportunities and challenges for extending this approach to understanding the consequences of extreme climatic events. Using statistical tools from extreme value theory, we show how distributions of thermal extremes vary with latitude, time scale and climate change. Second, we review how performance curves and tolerances have been used to predict the fitness and evolutionary responses to climate change and climate gradients. Performance curves and tolerances change with prior thermal history and with time scale, complicating their use for predicting responses to thermal extremes. Third, we describe several recent case studies showing how infrequent extreme events can have outsized effects on the evolution of performance curves and heat tolerance. A key issue is whether thermal extremes affect reproduction or survival, and how these combine to determine overall fitness. We argue that a greater focus on tails—in the distribution of environmental extremes, and in the upper ends of performance curves—is needed to understand the consequences of extreme events.

VL  - 57
IS  - 3
SP  - 281-291
AB  - Inertial electrostatic confinement devices can generate secondary, thermionic, photo, and field emission electrons from the cathode grid, which is a drain on the system. Of the various electron emission contributions, methods to study and minimize the thermionic emission current are explored in this paper using a new diagnostic called "chordwire" wire placed in the form of a chord of a circle inside the cathode that intercepts particles. This chordwire intercepts particles and gets heated; the rise in temperature can be monitored externally using a pyrometer. Local power balance on the chordwires can then be used to infer the particle flux reaching the chordwires. This diagnostic helps show that to accurately estimate the ion current reaching the central grid, the thermionic electron emission has to be taken into account. The thermionic emission could become significant even for low power operation (<10 kW) in the presence of asymmetric grid heating. The asymmetric grid heating can be mitigated by homogenizing the ionization source around the chamber. The ion-recirculation current equation has been updated to accommodate the thermionic emission current. This ion-recirculation current equation shows that while the electron current increases nonlinearly with the power-supply current (when the grid is thermionically active for input power that is >10 kW), the ion current increases only in a less-than-linear fashion. Hence, the scaling of the fusion productivity with the power-supply current appears to be less than linear. Material selection and device operation should be aimed at reducing this electron energy drain for optimum performance. The overall thermionic emission from the cathode could be reduced through the selection of appropriate grid material with high work function (e. g., Re and W-25%Re). Moreover, this material also has lower sputter yield relative to Type 304 stainless steel, thus helping in high-voltage operation of the device.

TI  - Quantifying how fine-grained environmental heterogeneity and genetic variation affect demography in an annual plant population
VL  - 170
IS  - 3
SP  - 659-667
AB  - The ability of plant species to colonize new habitats and persist in changing environments depends on their ability to respond plastically to environmental variation and on the presence of genetic variation, thus allowing adaptation to new conditions. For invasive species in particular, the relationship between phenotypic trait expression, demography, and the quantitative genetic variation that is available to respond to selection are likely to be important determinants of the successful establishment and persistence of populations. However, the magnitude and sources of individual demographic variation in exotic plant populations remain poorly understood. How important is plasticity versus adaptability in populations of invasive species? Among environmental factors, is temperature, soil nutrients, or competition most influential, and at what scales and life stages do they affect the plants? To investigate these questions we planted seeds of the exotic annual plant Erodium brachycarpum into typical pasture habitat in a spatially nested design. Seeds were drawn from 30 inbred lines to enable quantification of genetic effects. Despite a positive population growth rate, a few plants (0.1 %) produced >50% of the seeds, suggesting a low effective population size. Emergence and early growth varied by genotype, but as in previous studies on native plants, environmental effects greatly exceeded genetic effects, and survival was unrelated to genotype. Environmental influences shifted from microscale soil compaction and litter depth at emergence through to larger-scale soil nutrient gradients during growth and to competition during later survival and seed production. Temperature had no effect. Most demographic rates were positively correlated, but emergence was negatively correlated with other rates. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - High hydrostatic pressure influences the in vitro response to xenobiotics in Dicentrarchus labrax liver
VL  - 173
SP  - 43-52
AB  - Hydrostatic pressure (HP) increases by about 1 atmosphere (0.1 MPa) for each ten-meter depth increase in the water column. This thermodynamical parameter could well influence the response to and effects of xenobiotics in the deep-sea biota, but this possibility remains largely overlooked. To grasp the extent of HP adaptation in deep-sea fish, comparative studies with living cells of surface species exposed to chemicals at high HP are required. We initially conducted experiments with precision-cut liver slices of a deep-sea fish (Coryphaenoides rupestris), co-exposed for 15. h to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist 3-methylcholanthrene at HP levels representative of the surface (0.1. MPa) and deep-sea (5-15. MPa; i.e., 500-1500 m depth) environments. The transcript levels of a suite of stress-responsive genes, such as the AhR battery CYP1A, were subsequently measured (Lemaire et al., 2012; Environ. Sci. Technol. 46, 10310-10316). Strikingly, the AhR agonist-mediated increase of CYP1A mRNA content was pressure-dependently reduced in C. rupestris. Here, the same co-exposure scenario was applied for 6 or 15. h to liver slices of a surface fish, Dicentrarchus labrax, a coastal species presumably not adapted to high HP. Precision-cut liver slices of D. labrax were also used in 1. h co-exposure studies with the pro-oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP) as to investigate the pressure-dependence of the oxidative stress response (i.e., reactive oxygen production, glutathione and lipid peroxidation status). Liver cells remained viable in all experiments (adenosine triphosphate content). High HP precluded the AhR agonist-mediated increase of CYP1A mRNA expression in D. labrax, as well as that of glutathione peroxidase, and significantly reduced that of heat shock protein 70. High HP (1. h) also tended per se to increase the level of oxidative stress in liver cells of the surface fish. Trends to an increased resistance to tBHP were also noted. Whether the latter observation truly reflects a protective response to oxidative stress will be addressed in future co-exposure studies with both surface and deep-sea fish liver cells, using additional pro-oxidant chemicals. Altogether, data on CYP1A inducibility with D. labrax and C. rupestris support the view that high HP represses AhR signaling in marine fishes, and that only species adapted to thrive in the deep-sea have evolved the molecular adaptations necessary to counteract to some extent this inhibition. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Plant population differentiation and climate change: Responses of grassland species along an elevational gradient
VL  - 20

SP  - 441-455
AB  - Mountain ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate change. Characterizing intraspecific variation of alpine plants along elevational gradients is crucial for estimating their vulnerability to predicted changes. Environmental conditions vary with elevation, which might influence plastic responses and affect selection pressures that lead to local adaptation. Thus, local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity among low and high elevation plant populations in response to climate, soil and other factors associated with elevational gradients might underlie different responses of these populations to climate warming. Using a transplant experiment along an elevational gradient, we investigated reproductive phenology, growth and reproduction of the nutrient-poor grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus, Trifolium montanum and Briza media. Seeds were collected from low and high elevation source populations across the Swiss Alps and grown in nine common gardens at three different elevations with two different soil depths. Despite genetic differentiation in some traits, the results revealed no indication of local adaptation to the elevation of population origin. Reproductive phenology was advanced at lower elevation in low and high elevation populations of all three species. Growth and reproduction of T. montanum and B. media were hardly affected by garden elevation and soil depth. In R. bulbosus, however, growth decreased and reproductive investment increased at higher elevation. Furthermore, soil depth influenced growth and reproduction of low elevation R. bulbosus populations. We found no evidence for local adaptation to elevation of origin and hardly any differences in the responses of low and high elevation populations. However, the consistent advanced reproductive phenology observed in all three species shows that they have the potential to plastically respond to environmental variation. We conclude that populations might not be forced to migrate to higher elevations as a consequence of climate warming, as plasticity will buffer the detrimental effects of climate change in the three investigated nutrient-poor grassland species. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Application of expert system for heating control of Annealing Furnaces in a cold rolling mill - A case study at Bokaro Steel Plant
SP  - 245-249
AB  - Steel coils in cold rolling mill of an integrated steel plant are annealed to remove the mechanical distortions ensued by hot and cold rolling. It is an extremely crucial process upon which the final quality of product depends. In annealing process coils are heated following a pre-defined thermal regime and then cooled slowly. Thermal regime or heating cycle basically depends on coil dimensions and steel grade. However in practical there are no well established co-relations are available, which can determine the thermal regime to be followed for a given set of coil parameters. Such indeterminate applications are the fittest areas, where the theoretical concepts of Artificial Intelligence or expert system in particular can be applied in real time process control. A close loop expert system guided heating control system has been developed for Annealing Furnaces of Line # 1 at Bokaro Steel Plant. The integrated automation is based on the concepts of hierarchical control, wherein a Level-II rule based expert system selects most appropriate thermal regime for a given set of steel coils and Level-I PAC controls and supervises the furnace heating operation as per the guidelines of expert system. The application has rendered significant improvement in plants performance in terms of productivity, quality and energy savings. © 2012 IEEE.

VL  - 173
SP  - 1167-1171
AB  - An economical method of lactulose production from cheese whey was developed using sodium carbonate (Na2CO3). Three parameters such as temperature, reaction time, and Na2CO3 concentration were identified as experimental factors, and yield was selected as a response parameter. The experimental factors were optimised employing Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Maximum yield of 29.6% was obtained at reaction time of 20.41 min, Na2CO3 of 0.51% at 90 °C. To overcome this limited lactulose yield, due to the conversion of lactulose to galactose, fed batch system was applied using dried cheese whey as lactose source. By this system, limit was broken, and 15.8 g/L of lactulose is produced in hour. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The physical and ecological 'fingerprints' of anthropogenic climate change over the past century are now well documented in many environments and taxa. We reviewed the evidence for phenotypic responses to recent climate change in fish. Changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. Although these traits can evolve rapidly, only two studies attributed phenotypic changes formally to evolutionary mechanisms. The correlation-based methods most frequently employed point largely to 'fine-grained' population responses to environmental variability (i.e. rapid phenotypic changes relative to generation time), consistent with plastic mechanisms. Ultimately, many species will likely adapt to long-term warming trends overlaid on natural climate oscillations. Considering the strong plasticity in all traits studied, we recommend development and expanded use of methods capable of detecting evolutionary change, such as the long term study of selection coefficients and temporal shifts in reaction norms, and increased attention to forecasting adaptive change in response to the synergistic interactions of the multiple selection pressures likely to be associated with climate change. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Effect of thermal acclimation on thermal preference, resistance and locomotor performance of hatchling soft-shelled turtle
VL  - 59

SP  - 718-724
AB  - The significant influence of thermal acclimation on physiological and behavioral performance has been documented in many ectothermic animals, but such studies are still limited in turtle species. We acclimated hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiseus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 degrees C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (T-set), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles acclimated to 10 degrees C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The turtles' resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i.e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles acclimated to 20 degrees C, and narrowest in those acclimated to 10 degrees C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatcliling turtles acclimated to relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those acclimated to lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles acclimated to a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings acclimated to relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the "hotter is better" hypothesis.

AB  - Ocean warming and acidification are serious threats to marine life. While each stressor alone has been studied in detail, their combined effects on the outcome of ecological interactions are poorly understood. We measured predation rates and predator selectivity of two closely related species of damselfish exposed to a predatory dottyback. We found temperature and CO2 interacted synergistically on overall predation rate, but antagonistically on predator selectivity. Notably, elevated CO2 or temperature alone reversed predator selectivity, but the interaction between the two stressors cancelled selectivity. Routine metabolic rates of the two prey showed strong species differences in tolerance to CO2 and not temperature, but these differences did not correlate with recorded mortality. This highlights the difficulty of linking species-level physiological tolerance to resulting ecological outcomes. This study is the first to document both synergistic and antagonistic effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on a crucial ecological process like predator-prey dynamics. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Physiological breeding crosses parents with different complex but complementary traits to achieve cumulative gene action for yield, while selecting progeny using remote sensing, possibly in combination with genomic selection. Physiological approaches have already demonstrated significant genetic gains in Australia and several developing countries of the International Wheat Improvement Network. The techniques involved (see Graphical Abstract) also provide platforms for research and refinement of breeding methodologies. Recent examples of these include screening genetic resources for novel expression of Calvin cycle enzymes, identification of common genetic bases for heat and drought adaptation, and genetic dissection of trade-offs among yield components. Such information, combined with results from physiological crosses designed to test novel trait combinations, lead to more precise breeding strategies, and feed models of genotype-by-environment interaction to help build new plant types and experimental environments for future climates. © 2016 The Authors.

VL  - 71

SP  - 112-118
AB  - Environmental factors have a varied impact on the development of juvenile and adult Cladocera, depending on their different physiological conditions and body size. The values of these factors alter spatially and temporarily thus implying that they play a role in the spatial distribution of the pre-reproductive and potentially reproductive stages of cladocerans. The aim of the study was to determine seasonal and spatial variations in the distribution of juvenile and adult individuals of limnetic Cladocera in relation to selected physico-chemical factors (temperature, conductivity, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids) and fish predation pressure (measured by Chesson's coefficient lambda) in deep Lake Piaseczno (eastern Poland). Adult Cladocera displayed spatial distribution related to fish predation pressure. The species selectively eaten, B. coregoni and D. longispina, and non-selectively eaten, D. cucullata, selected the pelagic zone to exist, whereas those avoided by fish, D. brachyurum and B. longirostris, were evenly distributed in the littoral and pelagic zone. Juvenile cladocerans were strongly impacted by physico-chemical factors. Juvenile Daphnia, Diaphanosoma and B. longirostris showed preferences to biotic zones similar to the adults but differed in their habitat choices. Juvenile and adult stages of B. coregoni differed in their distribution, indicating that adult individuals impacted by high predation pressure alternatively modified their habitat selection. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination showed a seasonal tendency for the spatial segregation of the cladocerans, suggesting that possible competitive interactions between the studied cladocerans may also influence their distribution patterns.

TI  - Can multi-generational exposure to ocean warming and acidification lead to the adaptation of life history and physiology in a marine metazoan?
VL  - 220
IS  - 4
SP  - 551-563
AB  - Ocean warming and acidification are concomitant global drivers that are currently threatening the survival of marine organisms. How species will respond to these changes depends on their capacity for plastic and adaptive responses. Little is known about the mechanisms that govern plasticity and adaptability or how global changes will influence these relationships across multiple generations. Here, we exposed the emerging model marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to conditions simulating ocean warming and acidification, in isolation and in combination over five generations to identify: (i) how multiple versus single global change drivers alter both juvenile and adult life-history traits; (ii) the mechanistic link between adult physiological and fitness-related life-history traits; and (iii) whether the phenotypic changes observed over multiple generations are of plastic and/or adaptive origin. Two juvenile (developmental rate; survival to sexual maturity) and two adult (average reproductive body size; fecundity) life-history traits were measured in each generation, in addition to three physiological (cellular reactive oxygen species content, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial capacity) traits. We found that multi-generational exposure to warming alone caused an increase in juvenile developmental rate, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial density, decreases in average reproductive body size and fecundity, and fluctuations in mitochondrial capacity, relative to control conditions. Exposure to ocean acidification alone had only minor effects on juvenile developmental rate. Remarkably, when both drivers of global change were present, only mitochondrial capacity was significantly affected, suggesting that ocean warming and acidification act as opposing vectors of stress across multiple generations. © 2017.

VL  - 22
SP  - S21-S24
AB  - In the changing climate scenario there is a need to develop the socio-economic and livelihood patterns through enhancing the productivity of agricultural sector by adopting some mitigation strategies for climate change. In such a research climate this study were conducted to explore the perception of farmers on the impact of climate change. The study was conducted in two villages of Coochbehar district in West Bengal. Multi-stage and random sampling procedures are followed in the present study. Total 80 respondents were randomly selected for the study. The data were collected through personal interview method with the help of structured interview schedule. The data were processed through statistical measures like frequency, percentage, range, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation etc. The results showed that majority of the respondents is belonging to middle aged group and has medium level of education. Most of the respondents are small farmers and primary source of income is agriculture. The study also revealed that area of the study is highly vulnerable to climate change. Most of the farmer's perception about the consequences of climate change is that temperature, drought changed rapidly but changes in rainfall pattern is moderate. Farmer's perception regarding impact of climate change on ecosystem shows that climate change has negative impact on soil, water and forest while it has little impact on flora and fauna. The results further showed that input price, price of agricultural commodities, labor availability, occurrence of diseases and pests are mostly affected by climate change. From the findings it is found that mitigation strategies like drought tolerant crop, conservation of water, intercropping, adoption of indigenous technology, migration are perceived as most important by the farmers to cope with ill effects of climate change.

AB  - Effects of recent climate change have already been detected in many species, and, in particular, in insects. The present paper reviews the key impacts of global warming on insect development and dispersal. The effects of climate change appear to be much more complex than a simple linear response to an average increase in temperature. They can differ between seasons and bioclimatic regions. Earlier flight periods, enhanced winter survival and acceleration of development rates are the major insect responses. Differential response of insects and hosts to warming up might also lead to disruption of their phenological synchrony, but adaptive genetic processes are likely to quickly restore this synchrony. In a number of cases, warming results in removing or relocating the barriers that limit present species' ranges. It is also likely to facilitate the establishment and spread of invasive alien species. Finally, knowledge gaps are identified and future research interests are suggested. © 2010 ISZS, Blackwell Publishing and IOZ/CAS.

AB  - Many apiculturally important traits of the honeybee have medium to high heritabilities and are therefore capable of strong response to selection. However, the natural mating system of honeybees makes it difficult to exclude unselected males from matings and necessitates expensive procedures like artificial insemination or isolated mating stations. By manipulating ambient light and temperature, an Australian queen breeder has developed a novel system that delays the flight time of selected queens and drones. To assess the efficacy of this "Horner system," drones and their assumed worker offspring were genotyped using microsatellite loci to test whether the workers were exclusively sired by the selected drones. The Horner system was found to provide at least 85% control of matings, equivalent to a 48% increase in the selection differential, when queens and drones are selected in a breeding program. © 2009 The American Genetic Association.

AB  - Survival of microorganisms in the Antarctic and Arctic conditions of life requires of the relevant genera and species special adaptability and resistance against stressors such as lack of substrate, UV-radiation, low temperatures for a long time and short-term intense heat during the Antarctic and Arctic summer. Therefore genetic adaptation of Antarctic and Arctic organisms to stress factors would be expected. All this suggests in a global aspect synthesis of new metabolites with unique structures and specific biological activity. Antarctic and Arctic polar regions are considered as a huge reservoir of microorganisms with versatile antimicrobial potential. Our studies are motivated by an interest in the functional role played by natural products in the ecological interactions of the polar strains with the other members of the microbial community. This overview presents some of the most important secondary metabolites (antibiotics, alkaloids, high carbon amino acids, nitro compounds, diketopiperazines etc.) produced by Antarctic and Arctic microorganisms. The secondary metabolites biosynthesis probably plays an important role in the adaptation and survival of microorganisms in the ice deserts of Antarctica and the Arctic.

VL  - 280

SP  - 396-402
AB  - Nest-site microhabitat influences hatching success, hatchling phenotype and offspring sex in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). How females assess environmental features at potential nest sites, and then use such features in predicting the future incubation regime of the site, is integral to understanding how nest-site choice affects offspring fitness and ultimately female reproductive success. Tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are colonially nesting reptiles with TSD. We examined nest-site fidelity and nest-site choice in tuatara over 5 years on Stephens Island, New Zealand. Female tuatara nested every 2-4 years and showed high fidelity to nesting rookeries. Over 93% of females nested in the same rookery at least twice in 5 years. Approximately 25% of nests contained conspecific cues from previous nesting seasons, indicating that some females choose nest sites based on locations already selected by conspecifics. In experimental plots, female tuatara selected nest sites with loose soil and minimal vegetation, but they showed no preference for shaded compared with unshaded sites. This study provides insight into the development of colonial nesting structures in reptiles in that females are both attracted to nesting areas used by conspecifics, and show strong site fidelity to areas they have used in the past. © 2009 The Authors.

TI  - A genotype–phenotype association approach to reveal thermal adaptation in Daphnia galeata
VL  - 327
IS  - 1
SP  - 53-65
AB  - Altering thermal environments impose strong selection pressures on organisms, whose local persistence depends on adaptive phenotypic plastic and genetic responses. Thus far, adaptive change is monitored using phenotypic shifts or molecular markers, although inevitable obstacles are inherent in both methods. In order to circumvent these, it is necessary to find a causal link between adaptive alleles and fitness. Combining both approaches by linking genetic analyses and life-history measurements, a potential genotype–phenotype relationship can be assessed and adaptation at the molecular level demonstrated. For our study, clonal lineages of the freshwater keystone species D. galeata from seven different populations distributed along a latitudinal gradient across Europe were tested for local thermal adaptation in common garden experiments. Fitness-related life-history responses were quantified under different thermal regimes and experimental clones were genotyped at three candidate gene marker loci to investigate a potential genotype–phenotype association. The analyses of the life-history data showed a significant temperature effect on several fitness-related life-history traits recorded in our experiments. However, we could not detect evidence for a direct association at neither candidate gene locus between genotypes and life-history traits. The observed phenotypic shifts might therefore not be based on the tested marker loci EA, M and TF, or in general not coding sequence-based and thus rather reveal phenotypic plasticity in response to thermal variation. Nonetheless, we revealed significant genotype by environment (GxE) interactions at all tested loci, potentially reflecting a contribution of marker loci to certain life-history trait values and contribution of multiple genetic loci to phenotypic traits. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SP  - 132-143
AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt the changing ambient conditions, and protect themselves from stress-induced injuries. In the present study, the expression profiles of mRNA transcripts in the haemocytes of oysters under heat stress were examined to reveal the possible mechanism of heat stress response. There were 23,315, 23,904, 23,123 and 23,672 transcripts identified in the haemocytes of oysters cultured at 25 degrees C for 0, 6, 12, and 24 h (designed as B, H6, H12, H24), respectively. And 22,330 differentially expressed transcripts (DTs) were yielded in the pairwise comparisons between the above four samples, which corresponded to 8074 genes. There were 9,12 and 22 Gene Ontology (GO) terms identified in the DT pairwise comparison groups of H6_B, H12_H6 and H24_H12, respectively, and the richest GO terms in biological process category were cellular catabolic process, translational initiation and apoptotic process, respectively. There were 108, 102 and 102 KEGG pathways successfully retrieved from DTs comparison groups DTH6_B, DTH12_H6 and DTH24_H12, respectively, among which 93 pathways were shared by all three comparison groups, and most of them were related to metabolism of protein, carbohydrate and fat. The expression patterns of 12 representative heat stress response-relevant genes detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were similar to those obtained from transcriptome analysis. By flow cytometric analysis, the apoptosis rate of haemocytes increased significantly after oysters were treated at 25 degrees C for 24 h and recovered at 4 degrees C for 12 h (p < 0.05) and 36 h (p < 0.01), and it also increased significantly when the heat treatment lasted to 60 h (p < 0.01). The present results indicated that, when oysters encountered short term heat stress, the expression of genes related to energy metabolism, as well as unfolded protein response (UPR) and anti-apoptotic system, were firstly regulated to maintain basic life activities, and then a large number of genes involved in stabilizing protein conformation and facilitating further protein refolding were activated to repair the stress injury. However, the stress injury gradually became irreparable with the stress persisting, and apoptosis was activated when the heat treatment prolonged to 24 h. The information was useful to better understand the molecular mechanism of heat stress response and develop strategies for the improvement of oyster survival rate during summer high-temperature period.

TI  - Genetic variation in heat-stress tolerance among South American Drosophila populations
VL  - 139
IS  - 10
SP  - 1331-1337
AB  - Spatial or temporal differences in environmental variables, such as temperature, are ubiquitous in nature and impose stress on organisms. This is especially true for organisms that are isothermal with the environment, such as insects. Understanding the means by which insects respond to temperature and how they will react to novel changes in environmental temperature is important for understanding the adaptive capacity of populations and to predict future trajectories of evolutionary change. The organismal response to heat has been identified as an important environmental variable for insects that can dramatically influence life history characters and geographic range. In the current study we surveyed the amount of variation in heat tolerance among Drosophila melanogaster populations collected at diverse sites along a latitudinal gradient in Argentina (24°-38°S). This is the first study to quantify heat tolerance in South American populations and our work demonstrates that most of the populations surveyed have abundant within-population phenotypic variation, while still exhibiting significant variation among populations. The one exception was the most heat tolerant population that comes from a climate exhibiting the warmest annual mean temperature. All together our results suggest there is abundant genetic variation for heat-tolerance phenotypes within and among natural populations of Drosophila and this variation has likely been shaped by environmental temperature. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Natural resilience in Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus: Life history, spatial and dietary alterations along gradients of interspecific interactions
VL  - 85
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-118
AB  - The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus species complex has been shown to be exceptionally vulnerable to rapid abiotic and biotic changes. Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation. © 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the processing technologies required to allow operation of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells fuelled by reformate, including the final cleanup steps (PrOX, SMET), which are uniquely required for PEM. Selective methanation (SMET) of CO is a viable approach for the removal of CO from hydrogen-rich gas streams to be used with PEM fuel cells. Ru- and Ni-based catalysts are among the most extensively investigated and have shown the most promising performance. The key criteria for good performance include high activity, which allows operation at lower temperatures, and high selectivity, reflecting low activity for CO2 methanation and reverse water gas shift. Catalysts based on these metals tend to be the most selective at the lower operating temperature ranges, generally because CO adsorption predominates and adsorption of CO2 (hence reaction) is minimized. However, in order to obtain full CO conversion, higher temperatures may be required with subsequent loss of selectivity. The performance of these catalysts is strongly dependent on the support, preparation method, metal loading, metal particle size, promoter, and the operating conditions. Finally, some promising SMET strategies have been proposed and demonstrated that show viability for both performances, with CO concentrations below 10 ppmv being achieved, and durability, in which stability has been demonstrated for as long as 800 h on stream. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Population-specific effects of developmental temperature on body condition and jumping performance of a widespread European frog
VL  - 6
IS  - 10
SP  - 3115-3128
AB  - All physiological processes of ectotherms depend on environmental temperature. Thus, adaptation of physiological mechanisms to the thermal environments is important for achieving optimal performance and fitness. The European Common Frog, Rana temporaria, is widely distributed across different thermal habitats. This makes it an exceptional model for studying the adaptations to different thermal conditions. We raised tadpoles from Germany and Croatia at two constant temperature treatments (15°C, 20°C), and under natural temperature fluctuations (in outdoor treatments), and tested how different developmental temperatures affected developmental traits, that is, length of larval development, morphometrics, and body condition, as well as jumping performance of metamorphs. Our results revealed population-specific differences in developmental time, body condition, and jumping performance. Croatian frogs developed faster in all treatments, were heavier, in better body condition, and had longer hind limbs and better jumping abilities than German metamorphs. The populations further differed in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance. While metamorphs from Croatia increased their jumping performance with higher temperatures, German metamorphs reached their performance maximum at lower temperatures. These population-specific differences in common environments indicate local genetic adaptation, with southern populations being better adapted to higher temperatures than those from north of the Alps. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Synthesis and gas sensing properties of biomorphic SnO2 derived from loofah sponge and eggshell membrane
VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 9561-9570
AB  - Biomorphic SnO2 was synthesized through a sol–gel approach combined with an infiltration process and a calcination treatment. This synthesis route adopted loofah sponge (LS) and eggshell membrane (ESM) as a template respectively, which was proved low-cost and environmentally friendly. Based on TG/DTA analysis, the calcination temperature was decided to be 550 °C. XRD and TEM patterns confirmed the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2. FESEM characterization revealed that the SnO2 fibers were made of nanoparticles (average particle size: ~8 nm) and faithfully duplicated the same confirmations of natural templates. The gas sensing properties of as-prepared SnO2 were investigated using different gases such as ethanol, methanol and acetone, etc. The optimal working temperature for LS-template SnO2 was 250 °C, which was relatively lower than the case of ESM-template SnO2 (300 °C). Compared with ESM-template SnO2, LS-template SnO2 showed higher response, better selectivity and stability to ethanol, which was mainly due to the three-dimensional, hierarchical and hollow structure. Synthesis mechanism and gas sensing mechanism of LS-template SnO2 were also discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Effect of thermal treatment on free-living amoeba inactivation
VL  - 116
IS  - 3
SP  - 728-736
AB  - Aims: To evaluate the effect of temperature on two amoeba strains of the genera Acanthamoeba and two amoeba strains of the genera Hartmannella separately treated depending on their life stage, trophozoite or cyst, when cells are directly exposed under controlled conditions. Methods and Results: For thermal treatments, three temperatures were selected 50, 60 and 70°C, and a microcosm was designed using dialysis bags. The inactivation of each strain was determined using a method based on the most probable number quantification on agar plates. The results showed that for all amoeba strains, thermal treatment was more effective against trophozoites compared with cyst stages. The inactivation patterns showed statistical differences between the two genera analysed at temperatures above 50°C. The effectiveness of the thermal treatments at 60 and 70°C was higher for both life stages of Hartmannella vermiformis strains compared with Acanthamoeba strains, being the most resistant Acanthamoeba cysts. Conclusions: Free-living amoebae have been isolated in a wide range of environments worldwide due to their capacity to survive under harsh conditions. This capacity is mainly based on the formation of resistant forms, such as double-walled cysts, which confers a high level of resistance as shown here for thermal treatments. Significance and Impact of Study: Free-living amoebae survival can promote a rapid recolonization of drinking water systems and is a likely source of emerging opportunistic pathogens such as Legionella. Because of that a better understanding of the factors that affect micro-organism inactivation in water systems would allow more efficient application of disinfection treatments. © 2013 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

VL  - 8
IS  - 11
SP  - 8-19
AB  - Climate change is a pressing development issue affecting agricultural productivity in many developing countries. This study examined the perceptions of farmers on climate change, their willingness to pay for mobile phone text messages on weather forecasts. Multistage sampling procedure was used to select respondents from three States in South West Nigeria. Data were analysed with Descriptive statistics and Probit regression model. The result revealed that 93.1% perceived climate change while 68.1% indicated their willing to pay. Majority of the farmers from Ogun and Osun States reported delay in rain commencement in 2013. Also, majority of the farmers in Osun State perceived that rain stopped unpredictably in 2011, while many from Ondo State reported this in 2013. The offered monthly subscription bids ranged from N100 to N500 and average monthly subscription the farmers were willing to pay was N126.32. The Probit results showed that factors significantly (p<0.05) influencing probability of willingness to subscribe for adversary weather forecast text messages were years of schooling (.0739), farming experience (-.0332), negative effect of climate change on output (-.6084), possession of GSM (1.8052), veracity of past prediction on weather forecast (.7888), past experience on rain stopping unpredictably (1.0451) and past effect of extremely high temperature (1.0451). It was recommended that network connectivity should improve in the rural area and prediction on weather forecast should be more accurate in order for farmers to pay for adversary services on weather forecast.

SP  - 659-670
AB  - The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is one of the most important pests of crucifers worldwide. Susceptibility to insecticides and host plants of P. xylostella vary geographically. To investigate local adaptation, we measured the variation of the biology, life-histories and life-table parameters of P. xylostella populations from five widely ranging geographical regions in China, Beijing (BJ), Shandong (SD), Shaanxi (SX), Yunnan (YN), and Guangdong (GD), using the same variety of cabbage (Brassicae oleracea L. var. capitata; var. “Qingan 80”) as the food plant at the same temperature in the laboratory. Principal components analysis showed the life-history and life-table parameters of P. xylostella differed among the five geographical populations. The first component, including female fecundity and adult longevity and male adult longevity, accounted for the most variation among the five geographical regions, which can be classified into three groups: BJ–SX, YN–GD, and SD. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was greatest in BJ and SX, intermediate for GD and YN, and the lowest for SD, whereas mean generation time (T) was greatest in SD, intermediate for YN and GD, and the lowest for BJ and SX. These variations reflect the importance of local genetic adaptation and should be considered when planning management of P. xylostella in China. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Effect of temperature on the survival and development of the immature stages of Monosteira unicostata (Hemiptera: Tingidae)
VL  - 112

SP  - 664-675
AB  - The poplar lace bug, Monosteira unicostata (Mulsant & Rey), is one of the most important pests of almond trees in the Mediterranean area. The developmental times and survival of the immature stages of this tingid were determined at 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 35.5, 37 and 39 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% relative humidity and under a 16L : 8D photoperiod. At 16 and 39 degrees C, 100% mortality was recorded during immature development, with the egg, first and second nymphal instars the most susceptible. The lowest mortality was recorded at 28 degrees C (9.8%). As temperature increased, the total developmental period decreased and the shortest duration was recorded at 34 degrees C (12.1-12.2 d). At 37 degrees C, the developmental time was slightly longer (12.5-13.0 d). The thermal requirement for complete development, from egg to adult, was 229.2 DD. Several non-linear models were fitted to the developmental rate data recorded for the range of temperatures tested. Selection criteria indicated that the Lactin model best described the relationship between developmental rate and temperature. It predicted lower and upper thermal thresholds for the complete preimaginal period of 14.8 and 39.1 degrees C, respectively. Models were validated by comparing their predictions for the total preimaginal period with the developmental times recorded at three different fluctuating temperature regimes. The Lactin model again best fitted the actual durations recorded. This model could be used in IPM programs for predicting the moment of occurrence of the most damaging generations of this species.

TI  - Development of a comprehensive and flexible model for fixed-bed fisher-tropsch reactors
AB  - Liquid fuels synthesized from renewable CO and H 2 could displace petroleum-based fuels to provide clean, renewable energy for the future. Small scale (&gt;100 bbl/day) reactors for synthetic liquid fuels production (e.g. methanol, Fischer-Tropsch diesel) are an emerging development area that may enable the use of diverse, renewable, carbon-neutral feedstocks, such as biomass. For small scale production of synthetic liquid fuels from syngas, fixed-bed reactors are well-suited and have high potential productivity per reactor volume. To fully realize the potential of these reactors, four key issues must be addressed: 1) minimize temperature gradients due to the highly exothermic reactions, 2) maximize diffusion of reactants and products, 3) prevent heavy hydrocarbons (waxes) from accumulating in the catalyst pellets, reducing conversion and 4) management of lifecycle degradation. Over the last 90 years, the determination of optimal Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) reactor conditions has evolved starting with primarily experimentally determined inputs, to increased use of empirical modeling, to incorporation of more theory so that optimal conditions can be predicted and laboratory and pilot plant tests are no longer needed. However, although reactor size and capacity has increased over the years, the same general reactor design today is not much different than that used in the 1940's, especially in the case of fixed-bed reactors. This has led, rightly so, to models that explicitly or implicitly take advantage of this wealth of experience and knowledge with some degree of empiricism. Although they give very accurate results for modeling traditional reactors, the existing models are unable to examine significant design changes and innovations that may be needed to solve the four challenges listed above. The goal of the model developed in this work is to improve upon the fidelity and flexibility of current models, by reducing the level of empiricism, to enable examination of small-scale reactors or unique designs. Accomplishing this requires validated, coupled, heat and mass transport and chemical kinetics models derived from a component-based, dynamic (time-varying) two-dimensional heterogeneous model that accounts for interfacial and intra-particle gradients. There is no evidence in the open literature of a model of this type being successfully developed. This paper presents our model development progress in the following areas: 1. Two-phase interparticle (bulk) flow 2. Interparticle (bulk) heat transfer 3. Intraparticle mass transfer (within pore) 4. Intraparticle heat transfer (within solid and pore) 5. FTS chemical kinetics 6. Time-dependent catalyst deactivation by coke deposition, hydrothermal sintering, liquid/wax accumulation, and poisoning. 7. Combination of the various phenomena into a single comprehensive model. The successful, validated model of this type should enable accurate simulation of innovative and non-traditional reactors.

VL  - 780

SP  - 135-143
AB  - Hatching time (HT) of autumn-spawning fishes depends strongly on the egg incubation temperature and especially on the warming of water in spring, which synchronizes the hatching with ice-out despite the large inter-annual variability in spring phenology. However, the relative roles of genetic and environmental effects on the HT have rarely been explored. We studied experimentally the parental effects on the HT and size of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) and whitefish (C. lavaretus L.) larvae under short and long winter conditions using a full-factorial breeding design. Both parents significantly affected the HT of vendace, mostly by additive genetic effects, and the difference between short and long winter treatment was also significant. In whitefish, the female × male interaction was significant, implying non-additive genetic effects. The maximum range of the HT of eggs between parent pairs within certain winter condition was 3 weeks and was clearly lower than the potential range for the temperature-adjusted HT. The size of eggs or hatched larvae did not correlate with the HT in either of the species. The variation in HT between eggs from different parents creates a basis for genetic adaptation to climate change and for local adaption of populations in their thermal environments. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Hatching time and alevin growth prior to the onset of exogenous feeding in farmed, wild and hybrid Norwegian Atlantic salmon
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
AB  - The onset of exogenous feeding, when juveniles emerge from the gravel, is a critical event for salmonids where early emergence and large size provide a competitive advantage in the wild. Studying 131 farmed, hybrid and wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon families, originating from four wild populations and two commercial strains, we investigated whether approximately 10 generations of selection for faster growth has also resulted in increased somatic growth prior to the onset of exogenous feeding. In addition, we tested whether relaxed selection in farms has allowed for alterations in hatching time between farmed and wild salmon. Across three cohorts, wild salmon families hatched earlier than farmed salmon families, while hybrid families displayed intermediate hatching times. While the observed differences were small, i.e., 1-15 degree-days (0-3 days, as water temperatures were c. 5-6°C), these data suggest additive genetic variation for hatching time. Alevin length prior to exogenous feeding was positively related to egg size. After removal of egg size effects, no systematic differences in alevin length were observed between the wild and farmed salmon families. While these results indicate additive genetic variation for egg development timing, and wild salmon families consistently hatched earlier than farmed salmon families, these differences were so small they are unlikely to significantly influence early life history competition of farmed and wild salmon in the natural environment. This is especially the case given that the timing of spawning among females can vary by several weeks in some rivers. The general lack of difference in size between farmed and wild alevins, strongly suggest that the documented differences in somatic growth rate between wild and farmed Norwegian Atlantic salmon under hatchery conditions are first detectable after the onset of exogenous feeding. © 2014 Solberg et al.

TI  - Evidence of the Complexity of Gene Expression Analysis in Fish Wild Populations
VL  - 2017
AB  - The present work examines the induction of the band 3 anion transport protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively related to osmolyte transport, cell volume regulation, and energy production in the gills of two tilapia strains exposed to either freshwater or hypersaline water. Overall, genes showed similar expression patterns between strains. However, a wild population survey across a range of natural habitats and salinities did not reveal the expected patterns. Although significant, the correlations between gene expression and salinity were slightly ambiguous and did not show any link with phenotypic differences in life history traits previously reported between the same populations. The differential expression was also not associated with the population genetic structure inferred from neutral markers. The results suggest that the differential expression observed is not the result of evolutionary forces such as genetic drift or adaptation by natural selection. Instead, it can be speculated that genes responded to various abiotic and biotic stressors, including factors intrinsic to animals. This study provides clear evidence of the complexity of gene expression analysis in wild populations and shows that more attention needs to be paid when selecting candidates as potential biomarkers for monitoring adaptive responses to a specific environmental perturbation. © 2017 Mbaye Tine.

AB  - Teleost fish have conquered a wide range of freshwater and marine habitats. Their metabolic pathways support tissue-functional capacities and are adapted to operate within environmental windows constrained by hypoxia, elevated CO2 tensions, or temperature extremes. Limits to functioning and even survival may be reached when cellular energy levels fall and approach a limiting level of Gibb's free-energy content of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis. Long-term tolerance to environmental factors is achieved through acclimatization of the individual, or by selection over generations, partly through adaptation of the capacity of aerobic metabolic pathways. These principles, their energetic consequences, and the associated trade-offs and constraints are discussed focusing on adaptation or acclimatization to temperature. In general, aerobic scope is identified to adequately describe the capacity for long-term functioning including the long-distance cruising at high velocities or the maintenance of temperature specific growth. Beyond critical thresholds, the capacity for anaerobic performance reflects the excess energy turnover available for escape or attack on short timescales. Furthermore, it likely contributes to set the capacity and thereby the length of time available to passive sustenance of extreme environmental conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 83
IS  - 3
SP  - 802-808
AB  - Egg retention (ER) and intrauterine embryonic development (IED) have been considered intermediate steps in the evolution from oviparity to viviparity. Sceloporus aeneus is an oviparous lizard that is closely related to the viviparous species (Sceloporus bicanthalis). The present study addresses the following 2 questions: 1) Are intermediate stages of egg retention (ER and IED) present in populations of Sceloporus aeneus? and 2) Are ER and/or IED explained by elevation, precipitation or phylogenetic effects? Results indicate that in S. aen us, ER differs among populations. ER was negatively related to altitude and pluvial precipitation, whereas average environmental temperature had no effect on ER or IER. In contrast to previous observations of oviparous species related to viviparous species, populations of S. aeneus with advanced IED are associated with environmental factors such as low elevation and aridity instead of high elevation and cold climate, whereas the comparative analysis shows that there are no significative evolutionary changes throughout the phylogeny, which means that the altitude has no effect on the transition to the evolution of viviparity in S. aeneus-S bicanthalis.

AB  - Freeze-thaw stress has previously been shown to alter soil community structure and function. We sought to further investigate this stress on enriched microbial consortia with the aim of identifying microbes with ice-associating adaptations that facilitate survival. Enrichments were established to obtain culturable psychrotolerant microbes from soil samples from the latitudinal extremes of the Canadian Shield plateau. The resulting consortia were subjected to consecutive freeze-thaw cycles, and survivors were putatively identified by their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Even though the northerly site was exposed to longer, colder winters and large spring-time temperature fluctuations, the selective regime similarly affected both enriched consortia. Quantitative PCR and metagenomic sequencing were used to determine the frequency of a subset of the resistant microbes in the original enrichments. The metagenomes showed 22 initial genera, only 6 survived and these were not dominant prior to selection. When survivors were assayed for ice recrystallization inhibition and ice nucleation activities, over 60% had at least one of these properties. These phenotypes were not more prevalent in the northern enrichment, indicating that regarding these adaptations, the enrichment strategy yielded seemingly functionally similar consortia from each site.

AB  - It is now recognised that genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic heterogeneity within individual human cancers is responsible for therapeutic resistance - knowledge that is having a profound impact on current thinking and experimentation. There has been concern that molecularly targeted therapy is doomed to failure, with resistant clones emerging in response to the Darwinian selective pressure of any drug treatment. However, two studies have shown that the evolution of drug resistance can be restrained by co-administration of a pharmacologic inhibitor of the HSP90 molecular chaperone.

TI  - Impact of extreme cold temperature on acute metabolic response in humans
VL  - 62

SP  - 68
AB  - Our ancestors survived in an unforgiving environment dominated by ice ages. Nevertheless, because climate change is considered to be one of the largest threats to humanity in the future, how to survive the next ice age is an important topic for study. Humans have evolved the function of sustaining constant temperature in a variety of circumstances. To survive in extreme environments, the body has to adapt physiologically. When the body is repeatedly exposed to different environments, resistance to new stress is increased. In cold-exposed adult humans, significant decreases in body temperature are delayed by reducing rates of heat loss via peripheral vasoconstriction and by increasing rates of heat production via shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. Shivering is elicited by exposure to cold air and this can increase the resting metabolic rate. Fuel selection mechanisms are responsible for sustaining shivering thermogenesis. It has been reported that over a 3-month trip in Antarctica, subjects lost more than 25% of body weight, despite an average energy intake of 21.3MJ/day (Stroud et al. 1997). However, the adaptation process of the biological systems of humans to Antarctic and other cold environments is not well understood. Cold environments have many different effects on the body, such as pronounced metabolic changes, and we are especially interested in physiological adaptations under those conditions. We have studied how acute cold stress affects human metabolism, carried out in a -15°C cold room. The results of this study showed that an acute cold environment at -15° increased resting metabolism and fat oxidation, but carbohydrate oxidation was not influenced. Extreme shivering appeared in some subjects during cold exposure at -15°, but not in all subjects. For psychological stress activities, the levels of s-amylase activity and cortisol showed a significant increase at -15°. Further investigations are needed to optimize nutrients and energy balance for extreme cold environments and to understand the mechanism underlying the combined effects of physiological and neurological responses to extreme cold stress.

TI  - Water loss in insects: An environmental change perspective
VL  - 57
IS  - 8
SP  - 1070-1084
AB  - In the context of global environmental change much of the focus has been on changing temperatures. However, patterns of rainfall and water availability have also been changing and are expected to continue doing so. In consequence, understanding the responses of insects to water availability is important, especially because it has a pronounced influence on insect activity, distribution patterns, and species richness. Here we therefore provide a critical review of key questions that either are being or need to be addressed in this field. First, an overview of insect behavioural responses to changing humidity conditions and the mechanisms underlying sensing of humidity variation is provided. The primary sensors in insects belong to the temperature receptor protein superfamily of cation channels. Temperature-activated transient receptor potential ion channels, or thermoTRPs, respond to a diverse range of stimuli and may be a primary integrator of sensory information, such as environmental temperature and moisture. Next we touch briefly on the components of water loss, drawing attention to a new, universal model of the water costs of gas exchange and its implications for responses to a warming, and in places drying, world. We also provide an overview of new understanding of the role of the sub-elytral chamber for water conservation, and developments in understanding of the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in preventing water loss. Because of an increasing focus on the molecular basis of responses to dehydration stress we touch briefly on this area, drawing attention to the role of sugars, heat shock proteins, aquaporins, and LEA proteins. Next we consider phenotypic plasticity or acclimation responses in insect water balance after initial exposures to altered humidity, temperature or nutrition. Although beneficial acclimation has been demonstrated in several instances, this is not always the case. Laboratory studies show that responses to selection for enhanced ability to survive water stress do evolve and that genetic variation for traits underlying such responses does exist in many species. However, in others, especially tropical, typically narrowly distributed species, this appears not to be the case. Using the above information we then demonstrate that habitat alteration, climate change, biological invasions, pollution and overexploitation are likely to be having considerable effects on insect populations mediated through physiological responses (or the lack thereof) to water stress, and that these effects may often be non-intuitive. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Culture site dependence on pearl size realization in Pinctada margaritifera in relation to recipient oyster growth and mantle graft biomineralization gene expression using the same donor phenotype
VL  - 182
SP  - 294-303
AB  - Size is the most important and valuable quality of the cultured black-lip pearl, Pinctada margaritifera. As this pearl aquaculture is carried out at numerous grow-out sites, this study analyzes the environmental influence on pearl size parameters (nacre weight and thickness) in relation to the recipient oyster biometric parameters (shell thickness, height, width, and oyster weight) at harvest time. Toward this end, an experimental graft was designed by using a homogeneous donor oyster phenotype. The recipient oysters were randomly and equally transferred and reared in five commercial and contrasting grow-out locations. Overall inter-site comparisons revealed that the cultured pearl size (N = 2168) and the biometric parameters of the recipient oysters were highest for sites with warmer temperatures with low seasonal variation in comparison to the southern latitude sites. These results were supported by positive correlations between pearl nacre thickness and recipient oyster shell thickness, height, and width. In parallel, the biomineralization potential of the mantle graft was screened through four genes encoding aragonite (Pif 177, MSI60) and calcite (shematrin 9, aspein). As the gene expression levels were the same among all the donor oysters, this finding demonstrates that: 1) the pearl sac that originated from the mantle graft was not isolated from environmental variations during the culture period and 2) the phenotypic expressions of the two biomineralizing tissues in the recipient oyster were consistent (shell and pearl). In the near future, this knowledge will be helpful at the production sites of genetically selected donor oyster lines for growth produced in hatchery systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, Alice finds herself running as fast as she can but not moving anywhere. The Red Queen explains to her 'Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that.' Such is the situation in global agriculture. Global demand for agricultural products continues to rise as population grows and people get richer. As they get richer, people have fewer babies but eat more. And they use a lot more energy, which is increasingly derived from agricultural products. Crop technologies have to move incredibly fast just to keep up. Remarkably, over the past 50years they have, with yields (production per hectare of land) for most crops more than doubling since 1960, and real prices of food falling for most of the period. In many ways we have come to take continued yield growth for granted. But, as Lin and Huybers show [1] elsewhere in this issue, there is increasing evidence that this growth has stalled in many regions. The question is not new - people have worried about the pace of yield growth since at least the days of Malthus [2, 3]. But Lin and Huybers [1] use updated data and bring a new rigor to identifying where stagnation is statistically significant, for example by taking care to account for year-to-year correlation in yields. They report that for slightly more than half of the regions that they inspected, it is likely (80% chance) that yield growth has already flattened out. For many of these countries, responsible for about one quarter of global wheat production, the stagnation has very likely occurred (95% chance). Why are yields of wheat stagnating in so many areas? At least four suspects seem plausible. One narrative is that for years the real price of wheat was declining, providing little incentive for innovation. The most obvious consequence was a major decline in investment in research and development in most regions. The recent rise in prices has reversed the decline, but technologies take a long time to develop and get adopted [4]. So yield increases are in the pipeline but have not arrived yet. A second narrative relates to farm policy. Farmers always have an incentive to improve profits, but this does not always mean raising yields, especially if policies encourage reducing input use. In Europe, where much of the stagnation identified by Lin and Huybers [1] is found, fertilizer rates have actually declined in recent years in response to policies. One line of evidence in support of this narrative is that total factor productivity appears to be rising steadily in many regions, including Europe, even as yields have stagnated [5]. A third story relates to biophysical limits. This narrative declares that the genetic potential of crops has not improved for a long time, and most yield growth in the past two decades was related to agronomic improvements [6, 7]. But once average yields approach genetic potential, it becomes very difficult to further raise yields, and yields will be stuck regardless of price until innovation raises genetic potential [8]. If innovation is simply a function of prices, then this story folds into the first, but it could also be that returns on breeding are becoming much harder to achieve relative to the transformative effect of dwarfing genes and rust resistance that occurred in the last century. In the fourth corner is climate change. As Lin and Huybers [1] discuss, many of their stagnating countries have experienced adverse climate trends in the past few decades. Wheat has the lowest temperature optimum of any major crop, and has been among the most affected by climate change so far [9]. So maybe the stagnation is a sign of worse things to come. Interestingly though, they find stagnation even for Northern European countries where recent warming is more likely to have helped than hurt yields [10]. The easy answer is that a combination of these factors is to blame. The real answer is we do not yet know which of these, if any, are the most important. The implications of each for future research and policy are quite different, and so working out a clearer picture is an important task. The efforts of Lin and Huybers [1] provide a useful fingerprint on where and when stagnation has occurred. Now it is time to figure out which of the suspect's fingerprints is a match.

TI  - A toolbox for studying thermal heterogeneity across spatial scales: From unmanned aerial vehicle imagery to landscape metrics
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SP  - 437-446
AB  - A major barrier for the scientific community of climate change biologists is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the resolution at which global climate data are collected and modelled. Thus, the development of integrative and quantitative tools for the monitoring and spatial characterization of microclimates across spatial scales is a key issue for climate change ecologists. We proposed an integrative toolbox for quantifying the spatial heterogeneity in surface temperatures by bringing together procedures of unmanned aerial vehicles, thermal imagery, orthomosaic, GIS classification and spatial metrics. This toolbox permits to yield high-resolution visual and infrared orthoimages that are processed into a GIS for selecting surfaces of interest in the landscape (e.g. soil, vegetation). Then, the thermal matrices of selected surfaces (i.e. temperature values of the pixels belonging to the selected surfaces only) are processed within r to generate a variety of thermal landscape metrics (e.g. thermal patch richness and density, thermal aggregation and cohesion index). We applied this toolbox to the thermal characterization of mountainous agricultural landscapes in Ecuador with implications for ectothermic pest dynamics. UAV flights at a height of 60 m above-ground level allowed us to acquired high-resolution visual and thermal images (1 and 5 cm/pixel, respectively) for 12 potato fields with a mean surface of 1017 ± 117 m2. Landscape metrics on plant and soil surfaces showed that crop phenology drives the spatial patterns of surface temperatures and strongly modifies the overall thermal ecology of crop fields, with potential implications for ectothermic pest occurrence and dynamics. Overall, our toolbox affords a timely and innovative methodological framework to better assess the thermal heterogeneity of natural landscapes across a wide range of spatial scales. In particular, this toolbox would be of topical interest for ecologists trying to bridge the gap between the resolution of their climatic data and the body size of their study organisms. © 2016 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Diapause in the seasonal cycle of stink bugs (Heteroptera, Pentatomidae) from the Temperate Zone
VL  - 92
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-26
AB  - The paper reviews the data on diapause and related phenomena in stink bugs (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). Using stink bugs as examples, the consecutive stages of the complex dynamic process of diapause (such as diapause preparation, induction, initiation, maintenance, termination, post-diapause quiescence, and resumption of direct development) are described and discussed. Out of 43 pentatomid species studied in relation to diapause in the Temperate Zone up to date, the majority (38 species) overwinter as adults, two species-as eggs, and another two species-as nymphs. Pentatoma rufipes is believed to be able to overwinter at different stages of its life cycle. Less than 5 % of pentatomid species are probably able to overwinter twice. Only five species have obligate diapause, others have the facultative one. Day-length and temperature are the main diapause inducing factors in the majority of species. The role of food in the control of seasonal development is essential in the pentatomid species feeding on plant seeds. In different species, different stages are sensitive to day-length. Some pentatomids retain sensitivity to photoperiod even after diapause, others lose it and become photo-refractory (temporarily or permanently). In Pentatomidae, such seasonal adaptations as photoperiodic control of nymphal growth rates, seasonal body colour change, migrations, and summer diapause (aestivation) are widely represented, whereas wing and/or wing muscle polymorphism has not been reported yet. In the subfamily Podopinae, induction of facultative reproductive winter diapause is under the control of photoperiod and temperature. All species feed on seeds and their seasonal development to a great extent reflects availability of food. However, the same food preferences and pattern of seasonal development are also characteristic to many species from the subfamily Pentatominae. All species of the subfamily Asopinae are predators. Among them, Picromerus bidens and Apateticus cynicus have obligate embryonic winter diapause, which is rear among true bugs. At the same time, A. cynicus and Podisus maculiventris belong to the same tribe but have different types of diapause: obligate embryonic diapause in A. cynicus and facultative adult diapause in P. maculiventris. Other Asopinae species studied up to date have facultative adult diapause controlled by photoperiod and temperature with probably only one exception: in Andrallus spinidens, adult diapause is controlled by temperature, and photoperiod plays only a secondary role. Thus, in spite of the similar habits and feeding types among Asopinae, the species of this subfamily have different types of diapause and the latter is controlled by different factors. In the subfamily Pentatominae, most species overwinter as adults and induction of their diapause is controlled by the long-day type photoperiodic response, in spite of the differences in their feeding preferences (within phytophagy). However, there are some exceptions in this subfamily, too: Palomena prasina, P. angulosa and Menida scotti have obligate diapause, which conditions univoltinism in these pentatomids. In M. scotti, only females have obligate adult diapause, whereas males remain physiologically active through the whole winter, this pattern being unusual for Heteroptera. The univoltine seasonal cycle of this species with summer diapause (aestivation) and apparent migrations is similar to that of shield bugs (Scutelleridae). According to the analysis of seasonal development, the evolution of seasonal adaptations in Pentatomidae does not directly reflect their phylogeny. However, individual genera, small tribes or even subfamilies have similar complexes of seasonal adaptations. At the same time, Pentatominae is a large and apparently collected taxon, but most of species in this subfamily have the same facultative adult diapause. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

SP  - 341-347
AB  - Plant communities have been transformed by global changes such as land-use change and biological invasion in recent decades, and climate change will drive further transformation in the coming decades. Plant species can respond to changing climates by shifting their ranges to new areas in order to track optimal conditions and/or by adapting to these changes in situ. Future climates have the potential to alter species’ productivity, phenology, and biotic interactions. In addition, species’ ranges are expected to shift towards higher latitudes, tracking favorable climate conditions as the planet warms. The same trend is expected along altitudinal gradients, where species are expected to move uphill. However, distributions of communities and ecosystems depend on their individual species’ responses to climate change and are therefore more complicated to predict. Future plant community assemblages will differ from the ones that have existed historically, and these changes could themselves influence the rate of global climate change. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

TI  - Dietary intervention improves the survival of cultured greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata Donovan) at high water temperature
VL  - 430
SP  - 230-240
AB  - Summer mortality (SM), a disease caused by an interaction between biotic and abiotic environmental factors at high water temperatures (> 22 degrees C), impacts health, growth and mortality (up to 50%) of larger (>= 60 mm) cultured abalone in southern Australia. We aimed to determine if dietary intervention could alleviate mortality demonstrated by abalone at high water temperatures. As this issue is most relevant to farm production, we aimed to demonstrate that different mortality patterns are evident for 2- and 3-year-old greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata Donovan), irrespective of reproductive state, and to provide potential, practical solutions to this issue. Growth rate, feed intake and haemolymph variables were measured. To test if dietary intervention could minimise mortality at high water temperatures, we selected a commercial diet routinely fed on-farm when SM occurred, as a negative survival control, and live macroalgae (Ulva lactuca Linnaeus) as a positive survival control. In Experiment 1, 30 mm 2-year-old and 70 mm 3-year-old abalone were subjected to water temperatures of 18, 22 and 26 degrees C for 36 days. In Experiment 2, 60 mm 3-year-olds were subjected to 22 and 26 degrees C for 38 days. In Experiment 1, survival was > 95% for all treatments at 18 and 22 degrees C (P > 0.05); whereas, survival was significantly reduced by 35% in 3-year-olds fed the commercial diet at 26 degrees C compared to all other treatments (P < 0.05). In Experiment 2, there was no mortality at 22 degrees C. At 26 degrees C, survival was significantly reduced by 50% (P < 0.05) for the commercial diet, whereas, survival was > 97% for the U. lactuca diet. We demonstrated that dietary intervention reduced mortality in larger abalone at 26 degrees C. We also demonstrated a pattern of mortality in response to high water temperatures that differed for age classes. This information is invaluable for further systematic research to alleviate on-farm abalone mortality associated with high summer water temperatures, particularly in the areas of nutritional or therapeutic intervention.

TI  - The obstetric dilemma: An ancient game of russian roulette, or a variable dilemma sensitive to ecology?
VL  - 149
SP  - 40-71
AB  - The difficult birth process of humans, often described as the obstetric dilemma, is commonly assumed to reflect antagonistic selective pressures favoring neonatal encephalization and maternal bipedal locomotion. However, cephalo-pelvic disproportion is not exclusive to humans, and is present in some primate species of smaller body size. The fossil record indicates mosaic evolution of the obstetric dilemma, involving a number of different evolutionary processes, and it appears to have shifted in magnitude between Australopithecus, Pleistocene Homo, and recent human populations. Most attention to date has focused on its generic nature, rather than on its variability between populations. We re-evaluate the nature of the human obstetric dilemma using updated hominin and primate literature, and then consider the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to variability in its magnitude. Both maternal pelvic dimensions and fetal growth patterns are sensitive to ecological factors such as diet and the thermal environment. Neonatal head girth has low plasticity, whereas neonatal mass and maternal stature have higher plasticity. Secular trends in body size may therefore exacerbate or decrease the obstetric dilemma. The emergence of agriculture may have exacerbated the dilemma, by decreasing maternal stature and increasing neonatal growth and adiposity due to dietary shifts. Paleodemographic comparisons between foragers and agriculturalists suggest that foragers have considerably lower rates of perinatal mortality. In contemporary populations, maternal stature remains strongly associated with perinatal mortality in many populations. Long-term improvements in nutrition across future generations may relieve the dilemma, but in the meantime, variability in its magnitude is likely to persist. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

AB  - Invasive crayfish are known to displace native crayfish species, alter aquatic habitat and community structure and function, and are serious pests for fish hatcheries. White River Crawfish (WRC; Procambarus acutus) were inadvertently introduced to a warm-water fish hatchery in Missouri, USA, possibly in an incoming fish shipment. We evaluated the use of chemical control for crayfish to ensure incoming and outgoing fish shipments from hatcheries do not contain live crayfish. We conducted acute (≤24 hr) static toxicity tests to determine potency, dose-response, and selectivity of pesticides to WRC, Virile Crayfish (VC; Orconectes virilis), and Fathead Minnow (FHM; Pimephales promelas). Testing identified a formulation of cypermethrin (Cynoff®) as the most potent of five pesticides evaluated for toxicity to crayfish. A 4-hr exposure to a cypermethrin concentration of 100 μg · L-1 was found to kill 100% of juvenile and adult WRC; however, adult VC were not consistently killed. Concentrations of cypermethrin ≤100 μg · L-1 did not cause significant (&gt;10%) mortality in juvenile FHM. Additional testing is needed to examine selectivity between crayfish and hatchery fish species. Biosecurity protocols at hatcheries that use chemical control have the potential to reliably prevent inadvertent transfers of live crayfish in fish shipments. Copyright © 2016 by The Author(s).

VL  - 88

AB  - Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors affecting biological processes of mosquitoes, including their interactions with viruses. In these studies, we show independent effects of rearing temperature on the immature aquatic stages and holding temperature on the adult terrestrial stage in terms of alterations in adult survival and progression of dengue-1 virus infection in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus. Our studies show that adult survival was determined by adult-holding temperature, regardless of rearing conditions of the immature stages. In contrast, spread of virus throughout the body of the mosquito, a pre-requisite for transmission, was reduced when the immature stages were reared in cool conditions. These results show that immature-rearing temperature selectively modified mosquito traits that influence competency for viruses, and they further our understanding of the nature of temperature effects on interactions between mosquitoes and virus pathogens and risk of disease transmission.

TI  - Legionella persistence in manufactured water systems: Pasteurization potentially selecting for thermal tolerance
VL  - 8
AB  - Legionella is an opportunistic waterborne pathogen of increasing public health significance. Pasteurization, otherwise known as super-heat and flush (increasing water temperature to above 70°C and flushing all outlets), has been identified as an important mechanism for the disinfection of Legionella in manufactured water systems. However, several studies have reported that this procedure was ineffective at remediating water distribution systems as Legionella was able to maintain long term persistent contamination. Up to 25% of L. pneumophila cells survived heat treatment of 70°C, but all of these were in a viable but non-culturable state. This demonstrates the limitations of the culture method of Legionella detection currently used to evaluate disinfection protocols. In addition, it has been demonstrated that pasteurization and nutrient starvation can select for thermal tolerant strains, where L. pneumophila was consistently identified as having greater thermal tolerance compared to other Legionella species. This review demonstrates that further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of pasteurization as a disinfection method. In particular, it focuses on the potential for pasteurization to select for thermal tolerant L. pneumophila strains which, as the primary causative agent of Legionnaires disease, have greater public health significance compared to other Legionella species. © 2017 Whiley, Bentham and Brown.

TI  - Summer Diapause as a Special Seasonal Adaptation in Insects: Diversity of Forms, Control Mechanisms, and Ecological Importance
VL  - 97
IS  - 9
SP  - 1183-1212
AB  - Insects living in the temperate climate include summer diapause, or aestivation, in their seasonal cycle to solve various problems related to adaptation to unfavorable seasons. Unlike winter diapause, summer diapause occurs in summer and is usually terminated in autumn when active feeding, development, and/or reproduction are restored. Typically, high temperature and long day induce summer diapause and then maintain it, whereas short day and low temperature prevent induction of this diapause or terminate it. The summer diapause syndrome is basically similar to that of winter diapause; it includes prior development of large fat body, decreased level of metabolism, increased general resistance to unfavorable abiotic and biotic conditions, etc. Inhibition of morphogenesis and gametogenesis is under the control of the endocrine system. The onset of summer diapause is often accompanied by migrations to varying, sometimes significant distances to the sites of aestivation. The selective factors responsible for evolution of summer diapause vary between insect species. Climatic factors and, consequently, availability and abundance of food, as well as pressure of predators and parasites are likely to be the main factors that stimulate its occurrence. In some species, prolonged diapause begins in spring or early summer and ceases only after over-wintering. When studied in detail, such prolonged diapause often turns out to be a sequence of two independent diapauses, summer and winter ones, occurring in succession without detectable external changes. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - This study assessed the effectivenessofimproved storage containersonhousehold drinking water quality in four low-income urban communities in Ibadan, Nigeria. Three hundred randomly selected respondents were interviewed, while 44 house holds were selected and randomly assigned to four improved container treatment groups: Covered Buckets with Taps (CBT), Covered Buckets without Taps (CB), Covered Kegs with Taps (CKT) and Covered Kegs without Taps (CK). Water samples from springs, regular storage containers (RSC), and improved containers were analysed for total coliform (TC), total viable bacteria (TVB) and Escherichia coli for 2 weeks. About 96% reported using the same containers for cooking and drinking water, while only 23.3% used a form of water treatment. TC count for RSC and CB exceeded the recommended limit. Only 3 (6.8%) of the samples from RSC contained E. coli. A statistically significant difference was observed between the mean TC counts of samples from the improved containers. Percentage reduction in TC count from RSC, and the improved containers (CB, CBT, CK and CKT) were 25.4%, 37.3%, 45.0%, 56.8% and 53.8% respectively. Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus and Pseudomonas were isolated from the water samples.CKproduced the best result. Hygiene education on use of appropriate storage containers for drinking water is recommended at the household level. © IWA Publishing 2016.

VL  - 25

SP  - 1269-1288
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in thermally-regulated traits enables close tracking of changing environmental conditions, and can thereby enhance the potential for rapid population increase, a hallmark of outbreak insect species. In a changing climate, exposure to conditions that exceed the capacity of existing phenotypic plasticity may occur. Combining information on genetic architecture and trait plasticity among populations that are distributed along a latitudinal cline can provide insight into how thermally-regulated traits evolve in divergent environments and the potential for adaptation. Dendroctonus ponderosae feed on Pinus species in diverse climatic regimes throughout western North America, and show eruptive population dynamics. We describe geographical patterns of plasticity in D. ponderosae development time and adult size by examining reaction norms of populations from multiple latitudes. The relative influence of additive and non-additive genetic effects on population differences in the two phenotypic traits at a single temperature is quantified using line-cross experiments and joint-scaling tests. We found significant genetic and phenotypic variation among D. ponderosae populations. Simple additive genetic variance was not the primary source of the observed variation, and dominance and epistasis contributed greatly to the genetic divergence of the two thermally-regulated traits. Hybrid breakdown was also observed in F2 hybrid crosses between northern and southern populations, further indication of substantial genetic differences among clinal populations and potential reproductive isolation within D. ponderosae. Although it is unclear what maintains variation in the life-history traits, observed plasticity in thermally-regulated traits that are directly linked to rapid numerical change may contribute to the outbreak nature of D. ponderosae, particularly in a changing climate. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The main problems about research and application of two-line hybrid rice were reviewed, including the confusing nomenclature and male sterile lines classification, the unclear characteristics of photoperiod and temperature responses and the unsuitable site selection for male sterile line and hybrid rice seed production. In order to efficiently and accurately use dual-purpose genic male sterile lines, four types, including PTGMS (photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice), TGMS (thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice), reverse PTGMS and reverse TGMS, were proposed. A new idea for explaining the mechanism of sterility in dual-purpose hybrid rice was proposed. The transition from sterile to fertile was involved in the cooperative regulation of major-effect sterile genes and photoperiod and/or temperature sensitive ones. The minor-effect genes with accumulative effect on sterility were important factors that affected the critical temperature of sterility transfer. In order to make better use of dual-purpose lines, the characterization of responses to photoperiod and temperature of PTGMS should be made and the identification method for the characterization of photoperiod and temperature responses of PTGMS should also be put forward. The optimal ecological site for seed production could be determined according to the historical climate data and the requirements for the meteorological conditions during the different periods of seed production. © 2011 China National Rice Research Institute.

VL  - 25

AB  - Temperature preference is vital for the survival of all animals. A small set of warm-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons acting as an internal thermosensor in the Drosophila brain is critical for optimal temperature selection (Hamada et al., 2008, Nature, 454, 217-220). Here, the authors analyze the circuit components of the AC neurons by characterization of its spatial distribution, dendrite-axon polarity, and the putative type of neurontransmitter released. The results show that the AC neurons are serotonergic, do not have any dendrites, and send axons bilaterally to the superior dorsofrontal protocerebrum (SDFP). Searching the FlyCircuit database for neurons with serotonin receptor and dendrites in the SDFP, the authors found a dorsal-anterior-lateral (DAL) neuron as a candidate postsynaptic partner of the AC neurons. In conclusion, by morphological analysis of the AC neurons, the authors show a general strategy for predicting brain circuits orchestrating thermosensory behaviors. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

TI  - Pollination of the cycad Zamia incognita A. Lindstr. & Idárraga by Pharaxonotha beetles in the Magdalena Medio Valley, Colombia: a mutualism dependent on a specific pollinator and its significance for conservation
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
SP  - 717-729
AB  - The genus Zamia (Zamiaceae: Cycadales) exhibits its greatest diversity in Colombia and is highly threatened by habitat loss, extraction for ornamental plant trade, and mining, among other factors. One of the most important considerations for the effective conservation of Zamia is its highly specialized reproductive biology. Despite the importance of pollination for the populations’ viability, no studies have examined the pollination process of cycads in Colombia. Herein, we describe the pollination process of Zamia incognita A. Lindstr. & Idárraga, in a natural population. Exclusion experiments were performed by selectively excluding wind, beetles, both, or neither, which demonstrated that Pharaxonotha beetles are effective pollinators of Zamia incognita and that wind does not play any role as pollen vector. By following beetles marked with fluorescent dyes and directly observing beetle movements on and into female cones and micropyles, we confirmed that Pharaxonotha sp. is the effective pollinator of Z. incognita. The beetles traveled a maximum dispersal distance from a male to female cone of nearly 22 m and a minimum distance of 5 m. We found Pharaxonotha beetles in male cones, where they complete their life cycle. Cones produce heat in a circadian pattern associated with the elongation of the cones and pollen shedding. The increase in cones’ temperature appears to play an important role in beetle attraction. We suggest that pollination droplets on the micropyles would be a reward to pollinators. We also discuss the relationship of this Zamia species with other insects, which have important consequences for the conservation of web interactions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Individual Variability in Reproductive Success Determines Winners and Losers under Ocean Acidification: A Case Study with Sea Urchins
VL  - 7
IS  - 12
AB  - Background: Climate change will lead to intense selection on many organisms, particularly during susceptible early life stages. To date, most studies on the likely biotic effects of climate change have focused on the mean responses of pooled groups of animals. Consequently, the extent to which inter-individual variation mediates different selection responses has not been tested. Investigating this variation is important, since some individuals may be preadapted to future climate scenarios. Methodology/Principal Findings: We examined the effect of CO2-induced pH changes ("ocean acidification") in sperm swimming behaviour on the fertilization success of the Australasian sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma, focusing on the responses of separate individuals and pairs. Acidification significantly decreased the proportion of motile sperm but had no effect on sperm swimming speed. Subsequent fertilization experiments showed strong inter-individual variation in responses to ocean acidification, ranging from a 44% decrease to a 14% increase in fertilization success. This was partly explained by the significant relationship between decreases in percent sperm motility and fertilization success at ΔpH = 0.3, but not at ΔpH = 0.5. Conclusions and Significance: The effects of ocean acidification on reproductive success varied markedly between individuals. Our results suggest that some individuals will exhibit enhanced fertilization success in acidified oceans, supporting the concept of 'winners' and 'losers' of climate change at an individual level. If these differences are heritable it is likely that ocean acidification will lead to selection against susceptible phenotypes as well as to rapid fixation of alleles that allow reproduction under more acidic conditions. This selection may ameliorate the biotic effects of climate change if taxa have sufficient extant genetic variation upon which selection can act. © 2012 Schlegel et al.

SP  - 285-288
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cell survival upon cryopreservation is affected by the cooling rate. However, it is difficult to model the heat transfer process or to predict the cooling curve of a cryoprotective agent (CPA) solution due to the uncertainty of its convective heat transfer coefficient (h). OBJECTIVE: To measure the h and to better understand the heat transfer process of cryovials filled with CPA solution being plunged in liquid nitrogen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The temperatures at three locations of the CPA solution in a cryovial were measured. Different h values were selected after the cooling process was modeled as natural convection heat transfer, the film boiling and the nucleate boiling, respectively. And the temperatures of the selected points are simulated based on the selected h values. h was determined when the simulated temperature best fitted the experimental temperature. RESULTS: When the experimental results were best fitted, according to natural convection heat transfer model, h1 = 120 W/(m2·K) while due to film boiling and nucleate boiling regimes hf = 5 W/(m2·K) followed by hn = 245 W/(m2·K). These values were verified by the differential cooling rates at the three locations of a cryovial. CONCLUSION: The heat transfer process during cooling in liquid nitrogen is better modeled as film boiling followed by nucleate boiling. © CryoLetters.

AB  - The Research and Development Center for Iron & Steel (EDCIS), SAIL, India, made significant efforts to upgrade and increase the thermal performance of the reheating furnaces at Bhilai Steel Plant's Rail & Structural Mill. The thermal performance of these furnaces was increased by improving the combustion efficiency of the injection burners and the introduction of a new preheating zone to increase the furnace productivity. These objectives were achieved by developing a mathematical model of heat transfer to enable selection of optimal thermal regimes to predict the temperature at the surface and core of the bloom. The furnace charging-end temperature has been assumed in this model, as it is dependent on the furnace zonal temperatures and pushing rate. The thermal performance has also been improved by better fuel and heat utilization, resulting in a reduction in specific fuel consumption by around 10%.

AB  - Summary: •Adaptive trait introgression is increasingly recognized as common. However, it is unclear whether adaptive genetic exchanges typically affect only a single trait, or instead affect multiple aspects of the phenotype. Here, we examine introgression of abiotic tolerance traits between two hybridizing North American sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and Helianthus debilis.•In two common gardens in the hybrid range, we measured 10 ecophysiological, phenological, and architectural traits for parents and their natural and artificial hybrids, and examined how fitness covaried with trait values.•Eight of the 10 traits showed patterns consistent with introgression from H. debilis into H. annuus, and suggested that H. debilis-like traits allowing rapid growth and reproduction before summer heat and drought have been favored in the hybrid range. Natural selection currently favors BC1 hybrids with H. debilis-like branching traits.•We demonstrate that introgression has altered multiple aspects of the H. annuus phenotype in an adaptive manner, has affected traits relevant to both biotic and abiotic environments, and may have aided expansion of the H. annuus range into central Texas, USA. © The Authors (2010).

AB  - Geochemical exploration has been applied for studying thermal groundwater characteristics in the Serbian crystalline core region. Within this hydrogeological region, thermal groundwater with temperature higher than 20. °C occurs at seven locations. The maximum discharge temperature of the thermal groundwater is 105. °C which is the highest groundwater temperature encountered in Serbia. Geothermal reservoirs are present within andesite, schist, grus (the fragmental products of in-situ granular disintegration granite), marl and sandstone.Based on the concentrations of the major elements all of the water samples are of HCO3-Na to SO4-Na type. An elevated content of F, B, Ge and Rb is observed, while some samples also exhibit higher concentrations of As, Be, Cs, Ga, Ge, Li, V and W, and one has elevated concentrations of Nb, Zr and heavy rare earth elements (HREE). The groundwater is neutral to alkaline with TDS of 130-3822mg/L.Making use of various geothermometers, it was estimated that the temperatures in the selected aquifers of the Serbian crystalline core range from 45 to 146. °C.Activity concentration of 222Rn ranges from 10.4±0.9 to 104±15Bq/L and is higher in groundwater that is in contact with schist and along faults, while 226Ra has a smaller activity concentrations, within the range of 0.21±0.09 to 0.48±0.18Bq/L. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, if the duration of embryonic development depends on temperature, changes in temperature can lead to errors in timing. Organisms may reduce such errors either by changing the timing of onset of incubation or by selecting the temperatures to which embryos are exposed. We conducted field and laboratory experiments with 2 species of fiddler crabs to examine the effects of temperature and temperature variation on the timing of larval release and synchrony of release among females. As expected, the duration of incubation increased with decreasing temperature in both species. In the field when temperature was low, Uca terpsichores released larvae earlier than expected, indicating that shifts in timing of mating reduced potential errors in timing of release. However, when temperature changed during incubation, accuracy and precision in the timing of release decreased. U. deichmanni maintained timing and synchrony of release despite variable temperature in the field, but in cold water in the laboratory, they incubated eggs longer than in the field and released larvae late. These differences suggest that U. deichmanni regulates the incubation period in the field. U. terpsichores may be less able than U. deichmanni to adjust to rapid variation in temperature that may accompany climate change, which could result in large-scale interspecific differences in larval survival and recruitment. Fiddler crabs may maintain larval release during large amplitude nocturnal tides despite temperature variation by shifting timing of mating or selecting incubation temperature. © Inter-Research 2012.

VL  - 140
SP  - 197-202
AB  - Water temperature and feeding frequency are two important components in feeding strategy that directly affect the growth and physiology of fishes. The rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) has been cultured for decades in the laboratory as an experimental fish and is widely used in environmental science research. An 8-week factorial feeding experiment was conducted on juvenile rare minnows to investigate the interaction between water temperature (ambient, 20, 24, 28 degrees C) and feeding frequency (one, two, three meals per day) on growth performance, feed utilization, gut evacuation and adaptability to variable environmental conditions. Groups fed three times a day at 28 degrees C attained the maximum final body weight, followed by those fed two times a day at 24 degrees C. There was an obvious curvilinear relationship between specific growth rate and temperature. Increased temperature significantly promoted food consumption and growth rate, but there were no benefits on growth by feeding multiple times at temperatures of 18 degrees C or lower. Temperature and feeding frequency also affected gut evacuation rates: high temperature and frequency lead to fast evacuation. These results show that the optimal temperature and feeding frequency for rare minnow is 24 degrees C and two meals a day for maximal growth, feeding efficiency, and daily management. The findings also suggest that the rare minnow has the ability to rapidly adapt to changing culture conditions by adjusting physiological activities in the short term. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 5
IS  - 3
SP  - 229-244
AB  - Intraspecific adaptation in Abies sachalinensis was examined using models based on long-term monitoring data gathered during a reciprocal transplant experiment with eight seed source populations and six transplantation sites along an altitudinal gradient. The consequence of local adaptation was evaluated by testing the home-site advantage for upslope and downslope transplants at five ages. The populations' fitness-linked trait was set as their productivity (tree height×survival rate) at each age. The effects of global warming were evaluated on the basis of the 36-year performance of downslope transplants. Evidence was found for adaptive genetic variation affecting both height and survival from an early age. Increasing the distance between seed source and planting site significantly reduced productivity for both upslope and downslope transplantation, demonstrating the existence of a significant home-site advantage. The decrease in productivity was most distinct for upslope transplantations, indicating strong local adaptation to high altitudes. Global warming is predicted to increase the productivity of high-altitude populations. However, owing to their existing local adaptation, all tested populations exhibited lower productivity under warming than demes that were optimal for the new climate. These negative predictions should be considered when planning the management of locally adapted plant species such as A. sachalinensis. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Mutations in the Bacillus subtilis β clamp that separate its roles in DNA replication from mismatch repair
VL  - 192
IS  - 13
SP  - 3452-3463
AB  - The β clamp is an essential replication sliding clamp required for processive DNA synthesis. The β clamp is also critical for several additional aspects of DNA metabolism, including DNA mismatch repair (MMR). The dnaN5 allele of Bacillus subtilis encodes a mutant form of β clamp containing the G73R substitution. Cells with the dnaN5 allele are temperature sensitive for growth due to a defect in DNA replication at 49°C, and they show an increase in mutation frequency caused by a partial defect in MMR at permissive temperatures. We selected for intragenic suppressors of dnaN5 that rescued viability at 49°C to determine if the DNA replication defect could be separated from the MMR defect. We isolated three intragenic suppressors of dnaN5 that restored growth at the nonpermissive temperature while maintaining an increase in mutation frequency. All three dnaN alleles encoded the G73R substitution along with one of three novel missense mutations. The missense mutations isolated were S22P, S181G, and E346K. Of these, S181G and E346K are located near the hydrophobic cleft of the β clamp, a common site occupied by proteins that bind the β clamp. Using several methods, we show that the increase in mutation frequency resulting from each dnaN allele is linked to a defect in MMR. Moreover, we found that S181G and E346K allowed growth at elevated temperatures and did not have an appreciable effect on mutation frequency when separated from G73R. Thus, we found that specific residue changes in the B. subtilis ̈ clamp separate the role of the ̈ clamp in DNA replication from its role in MMR. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 103
IS  - 4
SP  - 1250-1257
AB  - A series of laboratory and field studies were conducted using three lines of navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), reared on wheat bran diet and almonds, Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A.Webb, at constant and fluctuating temperature. The duration of development on wheat bran diet at constant temperature differed significantly among the three lines. Development was as much as 40% faster at constant temperature than at fluctuating temperatures, consequently the developmental duration determined at constant temperature was not an absolute measure. When the maximum temperature in fluctuating regimes exceeded 43 degrees C, survival decreased by 50% compared with the constant temperature control. In almonds held at constant temperature, the developmental rate on new-crop nuts was variety-dependent and was fastest on 'Nonpareil' almonds and slowest on the experimental selection '23-122'. Development and survival were also variety-dependent on unharvested (mummy) almonds, and navel orangeworm average emergence was earliest from Nonpareil and latest from 'Carmel' nuts, differing by 529 degree-days, whereas survival was the highest on 'Butte', 35.7%, and the lowest on Carmel nuts, 7.2%. In our trials, both the speed of development and survival depended on host age, variety and quality, indicating that almonds were a dynamic rather than a static nutrient source for navel orangeworm. Identifying the factors responsible for variation in development and survival will give insight into improving control strategies.

VL  - 7
IS  - 6
SP  - 1644-1663
AB  - Howgenomic selection enables species to adapt to divergent environments is a fundamental question in ecology and evolution. We investigated the genomic signatures of local adaptation in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) along a natural salinity gradient, ranging from 35% in the North Sea to 7% within the Baltic Sea. By utilizing a 12K SNP chip, we simultaneously assessed neutral and adaptive genetic divergence across the Atlantic cod genome. Combining outlier analyses with a landscape genomic approach, we identified a set of directionally selected loci that are strongly correlated with habitat differences in salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Our results show that discrete regions within the Atlantic cod genome are subject to directional selection and associated with adaptation to the local environmental conditions in the Baltic- and the North Sea, indicating divergence hitchhiking and the presence of genomic islands of divergence. We report a suite of outlier single nucleotide polymorphisms within or closely located to genes associated with osmoregulation, as well as genes known to play important roles in the hydration and development of oocytes. These genes are likely to have key functions within a general osmoregulatory framework and are important for the survival of eggs and larvae, contributing to the buildup of reproductive isolation between the low-salinity adapted Baltic cod and the adjacent cod populations. Hence, our data suggest that adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to a strong and effective reproductive barrier, and that Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation. © The Author(s) 2015.

SP  - 259-265
AB  - Hot tropical environments constrain ectotherm mating opportunities when mate selection occurs on the surface. Thus, microhabitats and refugia can become a qualitative trait in mate selection. In fiddler crabs, the enlarged claw of males can act as a heat sink, which becomes advantageous when surface temperatures reach 50 °C during the day and crabs are actively seeking to mate. Uca mjoebergi females prefer male burrows found in the shade; therefore, we investigated the thermal constraints imposed on males and females in shaded and unshaded habitats. Crab surface activity decreased and body temperature increased as the day progressed, with more crabs active in shaded than sunny microhabitats. Body temperature was lower in male crabs found in burrows relative to crabs on the surface. Male claw size explained 10% of body temperature. Our results add further support to the hypothesis that thermal constraints imposed on males can be overcome by the large claw acting as a heat sink and the burrow acting as a refuge from heat. Classic sexually selected traits, including ornaments and behaviours, can have a secondary purpose in thermoregulation. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

TI  - Xanthate-functional temperature-responsive polymers as selective flocculants and collectors for fines recovery
VL  - 96
SP  - 73-82
AB  - A novel method to improve the recovery of fines in the flotation process involving the use of a temperature-responsive copolymer poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide-co-ethyl xanthate methacrylate) (PNEXMA) incorporating poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) and xanthate functionality has been investigated. Above a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), the polymer functions as both a collector and flocculant, forming hydrophobic aggregates of the valuable fines that are amenable to beneficiation by flotation. The viability of using PNEXMA for the flotation of sulfide fines has been evaluated based on initial screening with adsorption, contact angle and aggregation studies followed by flotation tests. The studies were conducted at both temperatures below and above the LCST, and the results were compared with an industrial collector, potassium amyl xanthate (PAX). Adsorption isotherms indicate a strong polymer affinity for chalcopyrite surfaces. The quartz contact angles were found to remain relatively hydrophilic and unchanged in the presence of the PNEXMA and PAX, while the chalcopyrite surface turned hydrophobic with contact angles above 60 degrees, comparable to PAX. Temperature-responsive reversible flocculation was also observed with the polymer on chalcopyrite, while no response was found with PAX or with quartz. Flotation studies with chalcopyrite confirmed that PNEXMA is able to act as a selective collector, with performances on par with PAX. However, no recovery improvement over PAX was observed in the -20 mu m fines fraction, which was attributed to the use of fully-liberated synthetic feed in the current work resulting in high fines recoveries with PAX not usually found in actual ground mineral ores.

AB  - Adaptation to sublethal stress can confer increased survival capability on foodborne pathogens. In this article, we report on the adaptive response of Cronobacter spp. to heat and compare the survival of heat adapted to unadapted Cronobacter spp. Five different isolates, representing at least three different Cronobacter spp., were adapted at 46°C for 30min and subjected to a lethal stress at 52°C. All showed increased survival upon adaptation. Survival was greater in milk-grown cells, but broth-grown cells showed a higher degree of adaptation. The survival potential acquired following adaptation was not transferred to survival in a dry environment or to survival during reconstitution of artificially contaminated milk powder by conventional or microwave heat. The ratio of membrane unsaturated to saturated fatty acids decreased, possibly resulting in a more rigid membrane in adapted cells. Heat-adapted cells showed increased survival potential to lethal heat stress, but not to dry stress. Alterations in the ratio of fatty acids in the membrane may explain this adaptation. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

VL  - 24

AB  - The microbiome can significantly impact host phenotypes and serve as an additional source of heritable genetic variation. While patterns across eukaryotes are consistent with a role for symbiotic microbes in host macroevolution, few studies have examined symbiont-driven host evolution or the ecological implications of a dynamic microbiome across temporal, spatial or ecological scales. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and its eight heritable bacterial endosymbionts have served as a model for studies on symbiosis and its potential contributions to host ecology and evolution. But we know little about the natural dynamics or ecological impacts of the heritable microbiome of this cosmopolitan insect pest. Here we report seasonal shifts in the frequencies of heritable defensive bacteria from natural pea aphid populations across two host races and geographic regions. Microbiome dynamics were consistent with symbiont responses to host-level selection and findings from one population suggested symbiont-driven adaptation to seasonally changing parasitoid pressures. Conversely, symbiont levels were negatively correlated with enemy-driven mortality when measured across host races, suggesting important ecological impacts of host race microbiome divergence. Rapid drops in symbiont frequencies following seasonal peaks suggest microbiome instability in several populations, with potentially large costs of 'superinfection' under certain environmental conditions. In summary, the realization of several laboratory-derived, a priori expectations suggests important natural impacts of defensive symbionts in host-enemy eco-evolutionary feedbacks. Yet negative findings and unanticipated correlations suggest complexities within this system may limit or obscure symbiont-driven contemporary evolution, a finding of broad significance given the widespread nature of defensive microbes across plants and animals. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Is sex a product of genes, the environment, or both? In this review, we describe the diversity of sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles, with a focus on systems that display geneenvironment interactions. We summarise the field and laboratory- based evidence for the occurrence of environmental sex reversal in reptiles and ask whether this is a widespread evolutionary mechanism affecting the evolution of sex chromosomes and speciation in vertebrates. Sex determination systems exist across a continuum of genetic and environmental influences, blurring the lines between what was once considered a strict dichotomy between genetic sex determination and temperature-dependent sex determination. Across this spectrum, we identify the potential for sex reversal in species with clearly differentiated heteromorphic sex chromosomes (Pogona vitticeps , Bassiana duperreyi , Eremias multiocellata, Gekko japonicus) , weakly differentiated homomorphic sex chromosomes (Niveoscincus ocellatus) , and species with only a weak heritable predisposition for sex (Emys orbicularis, Trachemys scripta) . We argue that sex reversal is widespread in reptiles (Testudines, Lacertidae, Agamidae, Scincidae, Gekkonidae) and has the potential to have an impact on individual fitness, resulting in reproductively, morphologically, and behaviourally unique phenotypes. Sex reversal is likely to be a powerful evolutionary force responsible for generating and maintaining lability and diversity in reptile sex-determining modes. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

VL  - 163

AB  - Hypoxia is a major stressor in coastal ecosystems, yet generalizing its impacts on fish and shellfish populations across hypoxic events is difficult due to variability among individuals in their history of exposure to hypoxia and related abiotic variables, and subsequent behavioral and survival responses. Although aquatic animals have diverse physiological responses to cope with hypoxia, we know little about how inter-individual variation in physiological state affects survival and behavioral decisions under hypoxic conditions. Laboratory experiments coupled with molecular techniques determined how extrinsic factors (e.g., water body and temperature) and respiratory physiology (hemocyanin concentration and structure) affected survival and behavior of adult blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) exposed to different levels of hypoxia over a 30-h time period. Nearly 100% of crabs survived the 1.3 mg dissolved oxygen (DO) l-1 treatment (18.4% air saturation), suggesting that adult blue crabs are tolerant of severe hypoxia. Probability of survival decreased with increasing hypoxic exposure time, lower DO, and increasing temperature. Individual-level differences in survival correlated with water body and crab size. Crabs collected from the oligo/mesohaline and hypoxic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA survived hypoxic exposures longer than crabs from the euhaline and normoxic Bogue and Back Sounds, North Carolina. Furthermore, small NRE crabs survived longer than large NRE crabs. Hemocyanin (Hcy) concentration did not explain these individual-level differences, however, hypoxia-tolerant crabs had Hcy structures indicative of a high-O2-affinity form of Hcy, suggesting Hcy "quality" (i.e., structure) may be more important for hypoxia survival than Hcy "quantity" (i.e., concentration). The geographic differences in survival we observed also highlight the importance of carefully selecting experimental animals when planning to extrapolate results to the population level. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - The geography of adaptive genetic variation is crucial to species conservation yet poorly understood in marine systems. We analyse the spatial scale of genetic variation in traits that broadly display adaptation throughout the range of a highly dispersive marine species. We conducted common garden experiments on the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia, from 39 locations along its 3000km range thereby mapping genetic variation for growth rate, vertebral number and sex determination. Each trait displayed unique clinal patterns, with significant differences (adaptive or not) occurring over very small distances. Breakpoints in the cline differed among traits, corresponding only partially with presumed eco-geographical boundaries. Because clinal patterns are unique to each selected character, neutral genes or those coding for a single character cannot serve as proxies for the genetic structure as a whole. Conservation plans designed to protect essential genetic subunits of a species will need to account for such complex spatial structures. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

VL  - 70

AB  - High levels of gene flow among partially isolated populations can overwhelm selection and limit local adaptation. This process, known as “gene swamping,” can homogenize genetic diversity among populations and reduce the capacity of a species to withstand rapid environmental change. We studied brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) distributed across seven islands in The Bahamas. We used microsatellite markers to estimate gene flow among islands and then examined the correlation between thermal performance and island temperature. The thermal optimum for sprint performance was correlated with both mean and maximum island temperature, whereas performance breadth was not correlated with any measure of temperature variation. Gene flow between islands decreased as the difference between mean island temperatures increased, even when those islands were adjacent to one another. These data suggest that phenotypic variation is the result of either (1) local genetic adaptation with selection against immigrants maintaining variation in the thermal optimum, (2) irreversible forms of adaptive plasticity such that immigrants have reduced fitness, or (3) an interaction between fixed genetic differences and plasticity. In general, the patterns of gene flow we observed suggest that local thermal environments represent important ecological filters that can mediate gene flow on relatively fine geographic scales. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Models of thermal adaptation assume that warmadapted and cold-adapted organisms can achieve the same fitness, yet recent comparative studies suggest that warm-adapted organisms outperform cold-adapted ones. We explored how this thermodynamic effect on performance might influence selective pressures on thermal physiology. In the absence of a thermodynamic effect, natural selection favors a thermal optimum for performance that closely matches the mean (or modal) body temperature. When warmadapted organisms outperform cold-adapted organisms, natural selection can favor a thermal optimum that exceeds the mean body temperature. The optimal mismatch between the thermal optimum and the mean temperature increases as does the variation in body temperature within generations. This result holds regardless of whether performance affects fitness through fecundity or survivorship. The selective pressures generated by a thermodynamic effect might explain the substantial mismatch between thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology that has been observed in some species. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 802
SP  - 99-103
AB  - The increasing interest in green energy storage materials for electrochemical devices with the development of polymer as electrolytes candidate has attracted great attention recently. It can offer a number of high-value opportunities, provided that lower costs can be obtained besides environmental friendly. Due to this attention, the development of biodegradable polymer electrolytes (BPEs) has been accomplished in this work by incorporating various composition of dodecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (DTAB) with carboxy methylcellulose (CMC) via solution casting method. The highest ionic conductivity of the BPEs obtained at room temperature is 7.72 × 10-4 S cm-1. The solid-state battery were fabricated with the configuration of Zn + ZnSO4.7H2O | BPEs | MnO2 for the highest conductivity. The open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the fabricated battery with the best performance is 1.33 V at ambient temperature. The performance of the battery at ambient and selected temperature is evaluated to ascertain the effective and viability of these BPEs in solid-state batteries. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Signals of selection on quantitative traits can be detected by the comparison between the genetic differentiation of molecular (neutral) markers and quantitative traits, by multivariate extensions of the same model and by the observation of the additive covariance among relatives. We studied, by three different tests, signals of occurrence of selection in Prosopis alba populations over 15 quantitative traits: three economically important life history traits: height, basal diameter and biomass, 11 leaf morphology traits that may be related with heat-tolerance and physiological responses and spine length that is very important from silvicultural purposes. We analyzed 172 G1-generation trees growing in a common garden belonging to 32 open pollinated families from eight sampling sites in Argentina. The multivariate phenotypes differ significantly among origins, and the highest differentiation corresponded to foliar traits. Molecular genetic markers (SSR) exhibited significant differentiation and allowed us to provide convincing evidence that natural selection is responsible for the patterns of morphological differentiation. The heterogeneous selection over phenotypic traits observed suggested different optima in each population and has important implications for gene resource management. The results suggest that the adaptive significance of traits should be considered together with population provenance in breeding program as a crucial point prior to any selecting program, especially in Prosopis where the first steps are under development. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - 1. In temperate climates, reptiles face constraining thermal conditions, and thus tradeoff predator avoidance against thermoregulatory requirements. 2. Selection of high thermal quality shelters can entail substantial fitness gains by enabling the selection of optimal body temperatures for physiological performance (e.g., high body temperature for digestion), whilst minimizing predation risk. 3. We studied two species of sympatric colubrid snakes (Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus) with contrasted thermal preferences in a forested area, offering a diversity of natural and anthropogenic shelters. Individuals were monitored using radiotelemetry. Physical models were used to assess operative environmental temperature. 4. The exploitation of particular artificial shelters, both during diurnal and nocturnal phases, entailed important thermal benefits to the snakes. 5. As predicted, the most thermophilic species, H. viridiflavus, used hot shelters more often than the less thermophilic species Z. longissimus. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Massive stocking with hatchery larvae may constrain natural recruitment of whitefish stocks and induce unwanted evolutionary changes
VL  - 63
SP  - 325-336
AB  - The stocking of hatchery-produced whitefish is a common practice in most countries of the species' natural range. Rigorous monitoring of the effects of stocking is less common, however, and possible negative impacts of stocking on the target population are rarely considered, even though supportive stocking might exert a series of negative effects. The present study discusses these potential impacts, taking Upper Lake Constance whitefish as an example. In 2003, a proportion of the larvae stocked into the lake were labelled with Alizarin Red S. The contribution made by stocking to virtual cohort size was estimated at 83%. Survival rates from egg or larval stages to adulthood for naturally produced fish and those incubated in hatcheries in 2003 were compared with those estimated from records pertaining to the cohorts of 1925-1939. Survival rates for lake-hatched larvae in 2003 fell between 1 and 10% of historic values. Several factors that may have contributed to this decline are discussed, of which the most potent seems to be the massive stocking of the lake with delayed hatchery larvae. Continued successful stocking will increase the contribution to the population of fish with partial or complete hatchery ancestry, and it may compromise the stock's ability to adapt to a changing environment through natural selection. © 2012 E.

VL  - 5

SP  - 163-166
AB  - Pacific salmon provide critical sustenance for millions of people worldwide and have far-reaching impacts on the productivity of ecosystems. Rising temperatures now threaten the persistence of these important fishes(1,2), yet it remains unknown whether populations can adapt. Here, we provide the first evidence that a Pacific salmon has both physiological and genetic capacities to increase its thermal tolerance in response to rising temperatures. In juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a 4 degrees C increase in developmental temperature was associated with a 2 degrees C increase in key measures of the thermal performance of cardiac function(3,4). Moreover, additive genetic effects significantly influenced several measures of cardiac capacity, indicative of heritable variation on which selection can act. However, a lack of both plasticity and genetic variation was found for the arrhythmic temperature of the heart, constraining this upper thermal limit to a maximum of 24.5 +/- 2.2 degrees C. Linking this constraint on thermal tolerance with present-day river temperatures and projected warming scenarios(5), we predict a 17% chance of catastrophic loss in the population by 2100 based on the average warming projection, with this chance increasing to 98% in the maximum warming scenario. Climate change mitigation is thus necessary to ensure the future viability of Pacific salmon populations.

AB  - Cross-national research on health system performance can yield important findings for public policy purposes. We seek to further this research by examining the problem of selection bias, an important methodological issue that investigators initially should consider. Because of the logistical difficulties and enormous expense involved in collecting voluminous data from many countries, researchers often must rely on information contained in data sets of international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Under the circumstances, the comparisons that researchers can make will depend to a great extent on the availability and richness of data for certain measures. This situation raises the potential for selection or experimenter bias. We use multivariate statistics to group countries with similar characteristics, an approach that we believe will mitigate the problem. We perform a cluster analysis of 186 countries using principal components derived from 7 demographic variables and 27 mortality and burden of disease variables. Our analysis produced six clusters that we believe represent suitable groupings for comparative purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - New age of coiled tubing CT oriented perforation - World first application for intelligent completion in hostile high-H2S well
VL  - 2016
AB  - Well completion and commissioning operations offshore present a variety of technical and operational challenges in the quest to maximize well productivity and optimize the economic value together with focus on safety. This is very relevant to perforation operations performed in hostile and high-pressure reservoir conditions encountered in a complex development project in the Caspian basin. The degree of complexity is increased due to required oriented perforation in a deviated intelligent completion well equipped with well monitoring system mounted on the outer side of the production liner. We describe the developed innovative technical solution for oriented perforation, challenges encountered, lessons learned, and results of this first-time-in-the-world implementation. To meet job objectives, we selected electric-line enabled (e-line enabled) coiled tubing (CT) for precise depth control, the latest-generation advanced gun deployment system (15,000-psi working pressure 5.12-in. ID H2S-rated) for conveyance of long gunstrings under pressure paired with specially developed hostile oriented gun system, and newly designed CT perforation string components, such as the perforation-shockresistant bottomhole assembly (BHA), two independent emergency disconnects, high-tensile CT logging head disconnect weak points, perforation passive casing orienting device, and tuned software to predict and evaluate shock load and dynamic underbalance. The oriented perforation job was successfully completed with this innovative oriented method for perforation applications-passive casing orienting device for deviated wells. This perforation technique proved capable of providing desired orientation accuracy and effectively minimized operational time and associated risks. Such approach allowed safe and efficient perforation in a controlled well environment and provided perforation in the desired direction away from downhole well monitoring equipment and with accurate depth control, and managed detonation shock load in overbalanced conditions, which avoided any well fluid influx or H2S release. The developed solution is a seamless integration of e-line enabled CT, the CT logging head, a gun deployment system for pressurized well conditions, and a set of wireline tools and specialized perforation equipment for passive orientation. This is the first time that the described oriented CT perforation operation using such innovative techniques has been performed in the world. The experience demonstrates a method to safely and efficiently facilitate challenging oriented perforation jobs in the future for intelligent completion applications and a great opportunity for well performance evaluation through distributed temperature-sensing analysis.

TI  - Ontogenetic variation in the thermal biology of Yarrow's spiny lizard, Sceloporus jarrovii
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering the way current species interact with their environment to satisfy life-history demands. In areas anticipated to experience extreme warming, rising temperatures are expected to diminish population growth, due either to environmental degradation, or the inability to tolerate novel temperature regimes. Determining how at risk ectotherms, and lizards in particular, are to changes in climate traditionally emphasizes the thermal ecology and thermal sensitivity of physiology of adult members of a population. In this study, we reveal ontogenetic differences in thermal physiological and ecological traits that have been used to anticipate how ectotherms will respond to climate change. We show that the thermal biological traits of juvenile Yarrow's Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) differ from the published estimates of the same traits for adult lizards. Juvenile S. jarrovii differ in their optimal performance temperature, field field-active body temperature, and critical thermal temperatures compared to adult S. jarrovii. Within juvenile S. jarrovii, males and females exhibit differences in field-active body temperature and desiccation tolerance. Given the observed age- and sex-related variation in thermal physiology, we argue that not including physiological differences in thermal biology throughout ontogeny may lead to misinterpretation of patterns of ecological or evolutionary change due to climate warming. Further characterizing the potential for ontogenetic changes in thermal biology would be useful for a more precise and accurate estimation of the role of thermal physiology in mediating population persistence in warmer environments. © 2016 Gilbert, Lattanzio.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - Forest mortality in high-elevation whitebark pine (pinus albicaulis) forests of eastern California, USA; influence of environmental context, bark beetles, climatic water deficit, and warming
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
SP  - 749-765
AB  - Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) in subalpine zones of eastern California experienced significant mortality from 2007 to 2010. Dying stands were dense (mean basal area 47.5 m(2)/ha), young (mean 176 years), and even-age; mean stand mortality was 70%. Stands were at low elevations (mean 2993 m), on northerly aspects, and experienced warmer, drier climates relative to the regional species distribution. White pine blister rust was not observed; mountain pine beetle infestations were extensive. Ring widths were negatively correlated with climatic water deficit and positively correlated with water-year precipitation. Although trees that survived had greater growth during the 20th century than trees that died, in the 19th century trees that eventually died grew better than trees that survived, suggesting selection for genetic adaptation to current climates as a result of differential tree mortality. Air surveys (2006-2010) in the Sierra Nevada, Mt. Shasta, and Warner Mountains showed similar trends to the intensive studies. Observed mortality from air surveys was highest in the Warner Mountains (38%) and lowest in the Sierra Nevada (5%); northern aspects at lower elevations within each mountain region had the highest probabilities of mortality and dying stands had higher climatic water deficit. Scenarios for the future of whitebark pine in California are discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a cold rotational forming process of manufacturing for drum clutch hub, the main part component of the automatic transmission. The cold rotational forming process were focused on this study in order to estimate the dimensional accuracy of the outer hub shape according to roller and mandrel shape variable. The shape parameters were determined by the Taguchi method. FE simulation was applied to analyze the deformation characteristics of the cold forming process and to determine the optimum parameter for selected conditions. Finally, an experiment on the whole drum clutch hub forming process was carried out to examine the validity of the analytical results and the chosen parameters. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

TI  - Water temperature manipulation can induce oocyte maturation and ovulation in the common Japanese conger, Conger myriaster
VL  - 392
SP  - 120-127
AB  - To develop seed production techniques for aquaculture of the common Japanese conger, Conger myriaster, we attempted to induce ovarian maturation and ovulation without exogenous hormone treatment and examined the changes in steroid hormones to understand the endocrine condition of the fish during their maturation process. Juveniles caught in November 2001 (20 to 30 cm in total length) were reared for 1.5 years in seawater at temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees C before the experiments. Then, 141 randomly selected female eels (58 to 82 cm in total length) were maintained at a water temperature of 6 degrees C from April 2003 to March 2004. The initial GSI values (5.0 to 12.0) and oocyte diameters (300 to 400 mu m) recorded in April 2003 had increased to maximum values of 30.0 and 650 mu m, respectively, at the end of experiment, in March 2004. In late December 2003, 12 fish with oocytes measuring over 600 mu m in diameter were selected and divided into an elevated temperature group from 6 to 10 degrees C and a control group of 6 degrees C for 43 days. The mean oocyte diameter in the elevated temperature group increased significantly, and one fish (estimated GSI, 47.0) ovulated eggs with an average diameter of 995 +/- 46 mu m on the 41st day at a water temperature of 10 degrees C, in contrast, the control group showed no significant changes in oocyte diameter, and no fish ovulated. Plasma T levels, examined via ELISA, increased with oocyte maturation, with the highest level detected at the migratory nucleus stage, and declined after ovulation. In contrast, plasma E2 was maintained at high levels during the vitellogenic stage, exhibiting the highest value after ovulation. The present study demonstrates that ovarian maturation and ovulation in the common Japanese conger could be achieved through water temperature manipulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

VL  - 8
IS  - 12
SP  - 3794-3805
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) have been recognized as potentially powerful drivers of genomic evolutionary change, but factors affecting their mobility and regulation remain poorly understood. Chaperones such as Hsp90 buffer environmental perturbations by regulating protein conformation, but are also part of the PIWI-interacting RNA pathway, which regulates genomic instability arising frommobile TEs in the germline. Stress-induced mutagenesis from TEmovement could thus arise from functional trade-offs in the dual roles of Hsp90. We examined the functional constraints of Hsp90 and its role as a regulator of TE mobility by exposing nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae) to environmental stress, with and without RNAi-induced silencing of Hsp90. TE excision frequency increased with environmental stress intensity at multiple loci in several strains of each species. These effectswere compounded by RNAi-induced knockdown of Hsp90. Mutation frequencies at the unc-22 marker gene in the offspring of animals exposed to environmental stress and Hsp90 RNAi mirrored excision frequency in response to these treatments. Our results support a role for Hsp90 in the suppression of TE mobility, and demonstrate that that the Hsp90 regulatory pathway can be overwhelmed with moderate environmental stress. By compromising genomic stability in germline cells, environmentally induced mutations arising from TEmobility and insertion can have permanent and heritable effects on both the phenotype and the genotype of subsequent generations. © The Author 2016.

TI  - Evolution of phenology in a Salmonid population: A potential adaptive response to climate change
VL  - 74
IS  - 10
SP  - 1519-1527
AB  - Accumulating evidence has indicated that many fish populations are responding to climate change through shifts in migration time, but genetic data identifying the role of evolution in these shifts are rare. One of the first demonstrations of evolution of migration time was produced by monitoring allozyme alleles that were experimentally manipulated to genetically mark late-migrating pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). Here, we extend that research by using observations of the marker alleles in fry to demonstrate that these changes in migration time were caused by directional selection against the late-migrating phenotype during the oceanic phase of the salmonid life cycle. The selective event, which appeared to be driven by early vernal warming of the nearshore marine environment and consequent decreased survival of late-migrating fry relative to earlymigrating fry, decreased the late-migrating phenotype from more than 50% to approximately 10% of the total fry abundance in only one generation. These demographic changes have persisted over the subsequent 13 generations and suggest that a larger trend toward earlier migration time in this population may reflect adaptation to warming sea-surface temperatures. © 2017 Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Adaptive capacity of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma to ocean change stressors: Responses from gamete performance to the juvenile
VL  - 556
SP  - 161-172
AB  - To predict impacts of ocean acidification and warming on the responses of marine populations, it is important to determine an organism's capacity for phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. We determined the effects of near-future acidification and warming across the life cycle of Heliocidaris erythrogramma from fertilisation to metamorphosis in the progeny of 16 sire-dam crosses. Sources of variation in tolerance to warming (+3°C) and acidification (-0.3 to-0.5 pH units) were investigated for fertilisation, larvae and juveniles. Across all life stages, maternal legacy was important, with dam identity significantly interacting with stressors. Across the genotypes tested, fertilisation was negatively affected by increased temperature, but not low pH. Larval development was compromised by low pH, but not increased temperature. By the juvenile stage, no impact of warming or acidification was evident, likely due to selective mortality of sensitive individuals, indicating the presence of a subset of resilient progeny. Across all treatments, the juveniles exhibited a similar ability to calcify. The impact of treatments on development was influenced by parental identity, with the offspring of some sire-dam pairs more sensitive than others. That the progeny of some sire-dam pairs showed high stress tolerance indicates the potential for selection of resistant genotypes and adaptation that could facilitate the persistence of H. erythrogramma populations. Performance of progeny was not consistent across development, with the impact of stressors differing depending on developmental stage. This shows the importance of assessing climatic change across multiple stages in the life cycle. © 2016 Inter-Research.

TI  - Red flour beetles balance thermoregulation and food acquisition via density-dependent habitat selection
VL  - 294
IS  - 3
SP  - 198-205
AB  - Theories of habitat selection assume that habitat selection patterns are based on the fitness consequences of selecting a particular habitat, and predict that individuals should be distributed between habitats so that each individual obtains the same fitness. The predictions are relatively simple when habitat suitability is based upon the quantity of depletable resources, such as food, in a habitat: individuals should be distributed between habitats in proportion to the depletable resources in those habitats. Yet, non-depletable resources can also be important in habitat selection. For example, ectotherms must obtain heat from the environment, which causes them to select habitats based, at least partly, upon thermal quality. Non-depletable resources can cause habitat selection that is independent of density and may modify the value of depletable resources. We used red flour beetles Tribolium castaneum to test the hypothesis that habitat selection by ectotherms depends upon both food abundance and temperature. We determined the thermal preference of red flour beetles. We then conducted habitat selection experiments with beetles when habitats were set at their preferred temperature and 10°C below their preferred temperature. We simultaneously manipulated food abundance in both habitats, and varied population density. We also examined the fitness effects of habitat selection by measuring oviposition rates of beetles. Beetles selected the habitat within their preferred temperature when food was equal between habitats and when food was higher in that habitat across all population densities. Beetles showed equal preference for high- and low-temperature habitats when food was higher in the low-temperature habitat across all population densities. Fecundity was always higher at the preferred temperature of beetles, regardless of food abundance or population density. Temperature is clearly an important factor in habitat selection of ectotherms and should be considered whenever thermal differences exist between habitats. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.

VL  - 163
IS  - 5
AB  - Sharks occupy high trophic levels in marine habitats and play a key role in the structure and function of marine communities. Their populations have been declining worldwide by ≥90 %, and their adaptive potential to future ocean conditions is believed to be limiting. Here we experimentally exposed recently hatched bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) to the combined effects of tropical ocean warming (+4; 30 °C) and acidification (ΔpH 0.5) and investigated the respiratory, neuronal and antioxidant enzymatic machinery responses. Thirty days post-hatching, juvenile sharks revealed a significant decrease in brain aerobic potential (citrate synthase activity), in opposition to the anaerobic capacity (lactate dehydrogenase). Also, an array of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase activity and catalase) acted in concert to detoxify ROS, but this significant upregulation was not enough to minimize the increase in brain’s peroxidative damage and cholinergic neurotransmission. We argue that the future conditions may elicit deleterious deficiencies in sharks’ critical biological processes which, at the long-term, may have detrimental cascading effects at population and ecosystem levels. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Field-measured heritability of the threshold for sex determination in a turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 75-90
AB  - Problem: For temperature-dependent sex determination to respond to selection, there should be genetic variance underlying the threshold that switches development from a male-producing program to a female-producing program. Genetic variance for this threshold in reptiles has never been estimated under field conditions. Methods: We estimated variance components of the thermal sensitivity of the sex determination threshold under field conditions for the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta, a species that has temperature-dependent sex determination. Multiple paternity within clutches was identified by genotyping females and their offspring. We endeavoured to statistically account for common nest and maternal effects and estimated the genetic variance underlying the sex determination threshold under field conditions by isolating the contribution of sires within a single clutch. Results: With 51 clutches containing 393 offspring, we estimated significant heritability for the sex determination threshold (h2 = 0.351, 95% CI = [0.164, 0.832]). Using a more restrictive dataset, which included only those clutches where each sire was represented by at least two offspring (34 nests, 273 hatchlings), heritability was not significantly different from zero (h 2 = 0.173, 95% CI = [0.000, 0.628]). Paternal siring success did not influence hatchling sex; thus, we have no evidence to support differential sex allocation across different sires within the same nest. Conclusion: We used a natural 'breeding design' under field conditions to show that the threshold of temperature-dependent sex determination may have a heritable genetic basis. © 2011.

AB  - The analysis of personal and published data on the frequency dynamics of chromosomal inversions within the range of Anopheles messeae obtained during the period from 1974 through 2014 is presented. The results showed that, in general, across the species range, during the 40 years of genetic monitoring, there was a steady (stationary) clinal distribution of inversions in the first decade (1974–1985). Then, over the period of five years (1986–1990), there was a considerable change in the inversion frequencies in favor of southwestern chromosomal variants (particularly strongly fixed in the Tomsk population), and from 1992 to the present time, these changes remained and were relatively stably reproduced in most parts of the range. It was noted that the jump in warming during the winter of 1981–1982 led to a correlated jump of the southwestern chromosomes in the Tomsk population. In connection with the general tendency toward the increase in average winter temperatures, a sharp decrease in the 2R1 chromosome frequency in the Siberian region and Syktyvkar in the period from 1992 to the present time was observed. There is reason to assume that, over the past decade, the northern boundary of the An. messeae range moved northward to the tundra zone. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

TI  - Fitness Effects of Thermal Stress Differ Between Outcrossing and Selfing Populations in Caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 44
IS  - 3
SP  - 356-364
AB  - The maintenance of males and outcrossing is widespread, despite considerable costs of males. By enabling recombination between distinct genotypes, outcrossing may be advantageous during adaptation to novel environments and if so, it should be selected for under environmental challenge. However, a given environmental change may influence fitness of male, female, and hermaphrodite or asexual individuals differently, and hence the relationship between reproductive system and dynamics of adaptation to novel conditions may not be driven solely by the level of outcrossing and recombination. This has important implications for studies investigating the evolution of reproductive modes in the context of environmental changes, and for the extent to which their findings can be generalized. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans—a free-living nematode species in which hermaphrodites (capable of selfing but not cross-fertilizing each other) coexist with males (capable of fertilizing hermaphrodites)—to investigate the response of wild type as well as obligatorily outcrossing and obligatorily selfing lines to stressfully increased ambient temperature. We found that thermal stress affects fitness of outcrossers much more drastically than that of selfers. This shows that apart from the potential for recombination, the selective pressures imposed by the same environmental change can differ between populations expressing different reproductive systems and affect their adaptive potential. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - A trial was conducted to determine the effects of dietary Vitamin C levels on hypothalamic-pituitaryinterrenal axis and physiological indices of juvenile hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatu♂×Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀) under acute low temperature stress. A basal diet was used as a control, and four other diets were prepared by supplementing 38, 76, 152, or 304 mg/kg Vitamin C. Triplicate groups of fish (initial body weight, 50 g) were fed one of test diets at ratio of 1.5% or 2% body weight for 12 weeks at 27-28 °C. Uniform sizes of fish were selected for acute low temperature stress (17 °C) at the end of rearing management. Some biochemical indices in their serum and corticotrophin-releasing factor content of brain were examined over 2 hours. Results showed that: Weight gain of the fish fed with D38 group was significantly higher than that of D152 and D304 groups. We found no significant difference in corticotropin releasing factor content (CRF), adrenocorticotropic hormone content (ACTH), epinephrine content (EPI) or cortisol content in juvenile hybrid grouper, among all treatment groups. After acute low temperature stress, CRF content was increased by increasing dietary Vitamin C levels. While ACTH and EPI content in serum showed a reverse trend, fish fed diets with Vitamin C 304 mg/kg was significantly lower than control diet. Cortisol was reduced significantly in fish fed diets 76 mg/kg to 304 mg/kg diets compared to control diet. Fish fed diets 152 mg/kg to 304 mg/kg dites T3 content were significantly higher than control diet. Whereas, after acute low temperature stress, fish fed diets 38 mg/kg to 304 mg/kg were significantly higher than control diet. There was no significant difference in T4 content in fish among different treatments. Fish fed diet 304 mg/kg diet showed significantly higher than other groups, whereas no difference was found among group D0 to D152. TSH content in D76 group exhibited obviously higher than D0, D38 or D304 groups. After acute low temperature stress, all diets containing Vitamin C significantly elevated TSH content in serum. Dietary Vitamin C levels had no strong effects on GCK and HK contents of liver. After acute low temperature stress, GCK content was negatively correlated with dietay Vitamin C, and reached lowest value in 304 mg/kg diet, and was significantly lower than other groups. HK content reached lowest value in 76 mg/kg diet, and was significantly lower than D0, D152, D304 groups. Significantly higher PEPCK value was found in fish fed 304 mg/kg Vitamin C compared to 0 mg/kg diet. After acute low temperature stress, PEPCK concentration was decreased significantly with increasing dietary Vitamin C levels. All those data reveal new insights into the funtion of Vitamin C that VC can modulate some biochemical indices of hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal axis, protect and regulate the thyroid of fish, and maintain the dynamic balance of fish body under acute low temperature stress.

VL  - 64

AB  - The katydid Neoconocephalus triops exhibits in North America substantial developmental plasticity of male mating calls. The AM rate of the summer calls is significantly faster than that of the winter calls at the same temperature. In the tropics, where N. triops originated, males express only the fast summer-call phenotype. We tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) call plasticity in the population from North America evolved in response to selection by female preference after N. triops colonized North America, or (2) call plasticity evolved before N. triops expanded into North America and its expression in the novel environment led to adaptive change of female preferences. First, we tested whether call plasticity was present in tropical populations of N. triops. Tropical males expressed the winter-call phenotype when reared under winter conditions, indicating that call plasticity did not evolve in response to temperate climates. Second, we compared female preferences among temperate and tropical populations. We found that the temperature dependence of preferred AM rate was significantly steeper in temperate N. triops than in a tropical population of N. triops. Third, we compared temperature dependence of female preference of the N. triops populations to three Neoconocephalus species without call plasticity. Only temperate N. triops had significantly steeper temperature dependence than the other species. This steeper temperature dependence matched female preference to the fast summer call at high temperatures and to the slow winter call at low temperatures in temperate populations. These results support the hypothesis that female preference changed in N. triops in North America to compensate for the plasticity of male calls. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Despite widespread distribution and occurrence in the global shark fin trade, information regarding fundamental biology of the silvertip shark, especially vertical and horizontal movement data, is sparse. Its habitat-faithful nature, confined geographical populations, and life history suggest silvertip sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation, particularly in heavily longlined regions with limited offshore management, such as the Fijian archipelago. Results: Satellite telemetry identified diel depth, temperature, and vertical habitat use differences, previously unreported, in a tracked individual. Although the individual occupied shallower mean depths at night, nighttime excursions below 200m were recorded. Net displacement from tagging location was estimated <18km. Conclusion: Diel depth differences and expanded daytime depth use could indicate foraging behavior, routine predator avoidance, or temperature selection. Typically, pelagic species are more heavily impacted by commercial longline fishing than reef-associated species, particularly in regions such as Fiji, where reefs are locally managed. The apparent mix of reef-associated and pelagic behaviors, coupled with high levels of commercial longlining in the region make the silvertip shark especially vulnerable to exploitation. Limited sample size prevented drawing any conclusions about the species, but these preliminary results suggest in order to be effectively managed the silvertip shark warrants additional movement studies and stock assessment surveys throughout it range. © 2015 Bond et al.

VL  - 27

SP  - 700-713
AB  - Sexual selection is responsible for the evolution of many elaborate traits, but sexual trait evolution could be influenced by opposing natural selection as well as genetic constraints. As such, the evolution of sexual traits could depend heavily on the environment if trait expression and attractiveness vary between environments. Here, male Drosophila simulans were reared across a range of diets and temperatures, and we examined differences between these environments in terms of (i) the expression of male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) and (ii) which male CHC profiles were most attractive to females. Temperature had a strong effect on male CHC expression, whereas the effect of diet was weaker. Male CHCs were subject to complex patterns of directional, quadratic and correlational sexual selection, and we found differences between environments in the combination of male CHCs that were most attractive to females, with clearer differences between diets than between temperatures. We also show that genetic covariance between environments is likely to cause a constraint on independent CHC evolution between environments. Our results demonstrate that even across the narrow range of environmental variation studied here, predicting the outcome of sexual selection can be extremely complicated, suggesting that studies ignoring multiple traits or environments may provide an over-simplified view of the evolution of sexual traits. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Leaf shape is spectacularly diverse. As a major component of plant architecture and an interface for light capture, gas exchange, and thermoregulation, the potential contributions of leaves to plant fitness are innumerable. Particularly because of their intimate association and interaction with the surrounding environment, both the plasticity of leaf shape during the lifetime of a plant and the evolution of leaf shape over geologic time are revealing with respect to leaf function. Leaf shapes arise within a developmental context that constrains both their evolution and environmental plasticity. Quantitative models capturing genetic diversity, developmental context, and environmental plasticity will be required to fully understand the evolution and development of leaf shape and its response to environmental pressures. In this review, we discuss recent literature demonstrating that distinct molecular pathways are modulated by specific environmental inputs, the output of which regulates leaf dissection. We propose a synthesis explaining both historical patterns in the paleorecord and conserved plastic responses in extant plants. Understanding the potential adaptive value of leaf shape, and how to molecularly manipulate it, will prove to be invaluable in designing crops optimized for future climates. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 75

SP  - 383-390
AB  - Fluoride, the smallest anion, is one of the most important anions in the human body which is involved in many diseases and many life activities can be displayed by its situation. It is necessary to detect fluoride ions and determine its concentration in organism. Compared to the traditional detection methods, fluorescence probes exhibit high sensitivity, high selectivity and potential for real-time detection. Because coumarin derivatives have strong emission in the visible region, high quantum yield, high photostability and excellent bioactivity, we choose them as fluorophore to prepare new fluorescent probes. Based on the mechanism of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), the fluorescent probes CS1, CS2 and CS3 that are coumarin-based derivatives were designed, synthesized and utilized in fluoride ions detection. Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR and HRMS. Meanwhile, the crystals of CS3 were obtained by slow evaporation of an ether solution at room temperature over a period of a few days. The detection limits of CS1, CS2 and CS3 for fluoride ions were respectively determined as 21.77, 3.52 and 1.99 μmol/L, indicating that probes have a good sensitivity to the detection of fluoride. The selectivity experiment results demonstrated that the three probes were highly selective for fluoride ions over other competitive. The recognition mechanism of the fluorescent response to fluoride ions was verified by HRMS and NMR experiment in this work. A lot of detailed experiment results indicated that the fluorescent response of probes to fluoride ions attributed to the specific fluoride promoted Si-O cleavage. The study of the effect of probes on viability of cells were carried out using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The experimental results indicated that the three probes had low cytotoxicity. Then the three probes were successfully used to fluorescent detect and image fluoride ions in MCF-7 cells by fluorescence spectrum and confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging, respectively. © 2017 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Transcriptome-based phylogeny of endemic Lake Baikal amphipod species flock: fast speciation accompanied by frequent episodes of positive selection
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 536-553
AB  - Endemic species flocks inhabiting ancient lakes, oceanic islands and other long-lived isolated habitats are often interpreted as adaptive radiations. Yet molecular evidence for directional selection during species flocks radiation is scarce. Using partial transcriptomes of 64 species of Lake Baikal (Siberia, Russia) endemic amphipods and two nonendemic outgroups, we report a revised phylogeny of this species flock and analyse evidence for positive selection within the endemic lineages. We confirm two independent invasions of amphipods into Baikal and demonstrate that several morphological features of Baikal amphipods, such as body armour and reduction in appendages and sensory organs, evolved in several lineages in parallel. Radiation of Baikal amphipods has been characterized by short phylogenetic branches and frequent episodes of positive selection which tended to be more frequent in the early phase of the second invasion of amphipods into Baikal when the most intensive diversification occurred. Notably, signatures of positive selection are frequent in genes encoding mitochondrial membrane proteins with electron transfer chain and ATP synthesis functionality. In particular, subunits of both the membrane and substrate-level ATP synthases show evidence of positive selection in the plankton species Macrohectopus branickii, possibly indicating adaptation to active plankton lifestyle and to survival under conditions of low temperature and high hydrostatic pressures known to affect membranes functioning. Other functional categories represented among genes likely to be under positive selection include Ca-binding muscle-related proteins, possibly indicating adaptation to Ca-deficient low mineralization Baikal waters. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 342

SP  - 207-213
AB  - Flexibility of gene expression in bacteria permits its survival in varied environments. The genetic adaptation of bacteria through systematized gene expression is not only important, but also clinically relevant in their ability to grow biofilms in stress environments. Stress responses enable their survival under more severe conditions, enhanced resistance and/or virulence. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), two of the possible important genes for biofilm growth are rpoS and bolA gene. RpoS is also called as a master regulator of general stress response. Even though many studies have revealed the importance of rpoS in planktonic cells, little is known about the functions of rpoS in biofilms. In contrast, bolA which is a morphogene in E. coli is overexpressed under stressed environments resulting in round morphology. The hypothesis is that bolA could be implicated in biofilm development. This study reviewed the literature with the aim of understanding the stress tolerance response of E. coli in relation with rpoS and bolA genes in different environmental conditions including heat shock, cold shock, and stress in response to oxidation, acidic condition and in presence of cadmium. Knowledge of the genetic regulation of biofilm formation may lead to the understanding of the factors that drive the bacteria to switch to the biofilm mode of growth. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - A genome-wide association study of heat stress-associated SNPs in catfish
VL  - 48

SP  - 233-236
AB  - Heat tolerance is a complex and economically important trait for catfish genetic breeding programs. With global climate change, it is becoming an increasingly important trait. To better understand the molecular basis of heat stress, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out using the 250 K catfish SNP array with interspecific backcross progenies, which derived from crossing female channel catfish with male F1 hybrid catfish (female channel catfish × male blue catfish). Three significant associated SNPs were detected by performing an EMMAX approach for GWAS. The SNP located on linkage group 14 explained 12.1% of phenotypical variation. The other two SNPs, located on linkage group 16, explained 11.3 and 11.5% of phenotypical variation respectively. A total of 14 genes with heat stress related functions were detected within the significant associated regions. Among them, five genes—TRAF2, FBXW5, ANAPC2, UBR1 and KLHL29— have known functions in the protein degradation process through the ubiquitination pathway. Other genes related to heat stress include genes involved in protein biosynthesis (PRPF4 and SYNCRIP), protein folding (DNAJC25), molecule and iron transport (SLC25A46 and CLIC5), cytoskeletal reorganization (COL12A1) and energy metabolism (COX7A2, PLCB1 and PLCB4) processes. The results provide fundamental information about genes and pathways that is useful for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of heat stress. The associated SNPs could be promising candidates for selecting heat-tolerant catfish lines after validating their effects on larger and various catfish populations. © 2016 Stichting International Foundation for Animal Genetics

TI  - Novel glass-like coatings for cardiovascular implant application: Preparation, characterization and cellular interaction
VL  - 58
SP  - 812-816
AB  - Glass coatings are of great interest for biomedical implant application due to their excellent properties.Nowadays they are used in different fields including drug delivery, for bone tissue regeneration or as implant. Nevertheless they can only be applied using high temperatures. Therefore their usage in the field of cardiovascular implant application is still restricted. Accordingly new developments in this field have been carried out to overcome this problem and to coat cardiovascular implants. Here, novel glass-like coatings have been developed and applied using sol-gel technique at moderate temperatures. The biocompatibility and selectivity have been analyzed using human endothelial cells. The obtained results clarify that the developed compositions can either promote or suppress endothelial cell growth only by altering the sintering atmosphere. A later application as thin layer on cardiovascular implants like stents is conceivable. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Environmental impact on ectocochleate cephalopod reproductive strategies and the evolutionary significance of cephalopod egg size
VL  - 88
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-93
AB  - Published data on initial chamber (protoconch) diameter in 507 species, and embryonic shell (ammonitella) diameter in 231 species of Ammonoidea, and embryonic shell (nauta) diameters for 132 species of coiled Nautiloidea, were used to examine evolutionary change in ectocochleate cephalopod reproductive strategies. Palaeotemperatures were found to be a key factor influencing historical changes in the evolution of egg size in ammonoids and nautiloids. A negative relationship was found between egg size and warming of the Earth's climate. Factors related to habitat were also important; in general egg size was larger in cold-water cephalopods. Egg size in Lytoceratina and Phylloceratina in the deep waters of the upper continental slope was much larger than in epipelagic Scaphitidae, as in modern fish and squids. Small eggs and high evolutionary rates helped ammonoids to colonise new habitats and develop high biological diversity, but involved them in planktonic food webs making them more vulnerable to abiotic variability (e. g., climatic changes), ultimately leading to their extinction. Large eggs helped nautiloids to persist through geological history, but at the cost of lower biological diversity, lower evolutionary rates and restricted options for colonising new habitats. Large-egged species such as nautiloids are more vulnerable to ecological, biotic disasters such as the appearance of new predators, including modern fishery. Independence from the planktonic food web is likely to be very important for a taxon's long-term survival over evolutionary history, as demonstrated also by Coelacanthiformes and Elasmobranchia.

TI  - Tripodal Lipoprotein Variants with C-Terminal Hydrophobic Residues Allosterically Modulate Activity of the DegP Protease
VL  - 429
IS  - 20
SP  - 3090-3101
AB  - DegP, a member of the highly conserved HtrA family of proteases, performs a regulated proteolysis of toxic misfolded proteins in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria. The allosteric switch between inactive and active conformations is a central mechanism to carefully control proteolytic activity of DegP and to maintain the optimal cellular fitness, but few other molecules than substrates are known to allosterically control DegP activity. Here, we demonstrate that a mutant variant of an outer-membrane lipoprotein, Lpp+ Leu, can function as a novel allosteric effector that changes the dynamic range of DegP activity. The three leucines at the C-termini of trimeric Lpp+ Leu are central components for activity modulation. Selection experiments with Lpp variant libraries show that Lpp variants with diverse sequences at or near C-termini, in particular those with hydrophobic residues at C-termini, function similarly to Lpp+ Leu. Interestingly, Lpp variants carrying different residues at C-terminal, penultimate, or antepenultimate positions display dramatically different patterns of activation and inhibition effects, suggesting that their interactions with DegP differentially stabilize distinct inactive or active conformations. We propose that the tripodal structure with three hydrophobic ends that mimics Lpp+ Leu is a novel platform for allosteric effectors, which may be useful in developing new antibiotics against DegP or homologous HtrA proteases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Preconditioning in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization in coral larvae under future climate change conditions
VL  - 218
IS  - 15
SP  - 2365-2372
AB  - Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatizationmechanisms. These rapidmechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9°C, 805 μatm PCO2) or ambient (26.5°C, 417 μatm PCO2) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for transgenerational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms. © 2015.

TI  - Long-term acclimation to different thermal regimes affects molecular responses to heat stress in a freshwater clam corbicula fluminea
VL  - 6
AB  - Global climate change (GCC) can negatively affect freshwater ecosystems. However, the degree to which freshwater populations can acclimate to long-term warming and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We used the cooling water discharge (CWD) area of a power plant as a model for long-term warming. Survival and molecular stress responses (expression of molecular chaperones, antioxidants, bioenergetic and protein synthesis biomarkers) to experimental warming (20-41 degrees C, + 1.5 degrees C per day) were assessed in invasive clams Corbicula fluminea from two pristine populations and a CWD population. CWD clams had considerably higher (by similar to 8-12 degrees C) lethal temperature thresholds than clams from the pristine areas. High thermal tolerance of CWD clams was associated with overexpression of heat shock proteins HSP70, HSP90 and HSP60 and activation of protein synthesis at 38 degrees C. Heat shock response was prioritized over the oxidative stress response resulting in accumulation of oxidative lesions and ubiquitinated proteins during heat stress in CWD clams. Future studies should determine whether the increase in thermal tolerance in CWD clams are due to genetic adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity. Overall, our findings indicate that C. fluminea has potential to survive and increase its invasive range during warming such as expected during GCC.

TI  - Reproductive mode evolution in lizards revisited: Updated analyses examining geographic, climatic and phylogenetic effects support the cold-climate hypothesis
VL  - 27
IS  - 12
SP  - 2767-2780
AB  - Viviparity, the bearing of live young, has evolved well over 100 times among squamate reptiles. This reproductive strategy is hypothesized to allow maternal control of the foetus' thermal environment and thereby to increase the fitness of the parents and offspring. Two hypotheses have been posited to explain this phenomenon: (i) the cold-climate hypothesis (CCH), which advocates low temperatures as the primary selective force; and (ii) the maternal manipulation hypothesis (MMH), which advocates temperature variability as the primary selective force. Here, we investigate whether climatic and geographic variables associated with the CCH vs. the MMH best explain the current geographical distributions of viviparity in lizards while incorporating recent advances in comparative methods, squamate phylogenetics and geospatial analysis. To do this, we compared nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic models predicting viviparity based on point-of-capture data from 20 994 museum specimens representing 215 lizard species in conjunction with spatially explicit bioclimatic and geographic (elevation and latitude) data layers. The database we analysed emphasized Nearctic lizards from three species-rich genera (Phrynosoma, Plestiodon and Sceloporus); however, we additionally analysed a less substantial, but worldwide sample of species to verify the universality of our Nearctic results. We found that maximum temperature of the warmest month (and, less commonly, elevation and maximum temperature of the driest quarter) was frequently the best predictor of viviparity and showed an association consistent with the CCH. Our results strongly favour the CCH over the MMH in explaining lizard reproductive mode evolution. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Grandparental effects in marine sticklebacks: Transgenerational plasticity across multiple generations
VL  - 27
IS  - 11
SP  - 2297-2307
AB  - Nongenetic inheritance mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (TGP) can buffer populations against rapid environmental change such as ocean warming. Yet, little is known about how long these effects persist and whether they are cumulative over generations. Here, we tested for adaptive TGP in response to simulated ocean warming across parental and grandparental generations of marine sticklebacks. Grandparents were acclimated for two months during reproductive conditioning, whereas parents experienced developmental acclimation, allowing us to compare the fitness consequences of short-term vs. prolonged exposure to elevated temperature across multiple generations. We found that reproductive output of F1 adults was primarily determined by maternal developmental temperature, but carry-over effects from grandparental acclimation environments resulted in cumulative negative effects of elevated temperature on hatching success. In very early stages of growth, F2 offspring reached larger sizes in their respective paternal and grandparental environment down the paternal line, suggesting that other factors than just the paternal genome may be transferred between generations. In later growth stages, maternal and maternal granddam environments strongly influenced offspring body size, but in opposing directions, indicating that the mechanism(s) underlying the transfer of environmental information may have differed between acute and developmental acclimation experienced by the two generations. Taken together, our results suggest that the fitness consequences of parental and grandparental TGP are highly context dependent, but will play an important role in mediating some of the impacts of rapid climate change in this system. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 82

SP  - 458-474
AB  - This study assesses for the first time the relationship between annual cycles of different biological indices with growth patterns of a marine pejerrey Odontesthes argentinensis population near its southern-distribution boundary in North Patagonia. The reproductive period is between September and November evidenced by an increase in the gonado-somatic index with a peak in October corresponding to spawning. The reproductive cycle was also coupled with metabolic processes related to energy allocation as shown by changes in the hepato-somatic index and body condition. Total length (LT) at maturity was 270 for females and 282 mm for males, whereas fecundity was estimated at mean ±s.d. = 9380 ± 1797 mature oocytes. Based on the marginal increment analysis, most of the scales showed a maximum value during summer, with a sharp decline thereafter during autumn and winter, indicating that scale rings are formed during the latter period and only once a year. Growth fitted by the von Bertalanffy model for both males and females did not show significant differences and showed a rapid growth during the first 2 years. The shorter reproductive period compared with that of the northern O. argentinensis populations inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas was interpreted as an adjustment to temperate environmental conditions. The larger maximum LT and LT at first maturity are in agreement with the counter-gradient hypothesis and could be related to the selective effects of low temperature and a shorter growing season. This latitude dependency argues strongly against the application of the same fishing regulations for different O. argentinensis populations as a whole and reinforces the need to assess basic biological features at a population scale to promote local sustainable fisheries management. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 30
SP  - 153-160
AB  - Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are widely used for the production of biotherapeutic recombinant proteins for a range of molecules including monoclonal antibodies and Fc-fusion proteins. Regulatory requirements for the final product include the removal of host cell proteins (HCPs) to acceptable amounts (<100. ppm). Recent research has begun to unravel the extent to which upstream process conditions and subsequent product recovery and purification processes impact upon the HCP profile. A number of upstream parameters, including the selection of the cell line, the culturing process (e.g. feeding regime, culture temperature), cell viability at time of harvest/culture duration and cell shear sensitivity can all influence the resulting HCP profile. Further, the molecule itself plays an important role in determining those HCPs that are retained throughout a bioprocess and HCPs can co-elute with the target product during purification. Measurement and monitoring of HCPs is usually undertaken using ELISA technology, however alternative approaches are also now emerging that complement ELISA and allow the detection, identification and monitoring of specific HCPs. Here we discuss our understanding of how the process itself influences those HCPs present throughout the production process and the challenges in their monitoring, measurement and removal. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Design of a cyclic steam stimulation pilot test for the orinoco oil belt. A new vision about steam injection flow rates
VL  - 2017
AB  - In some of the giant extra-heavy oil fields from the Orinoco Oil Belt (OOB), the challenge is to increase recovery over primary production by about 10%, to meet its ambitious development plan. To get this, it is necessary to apply EOR processes. It is visualized the integral design of a cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) pilot test, using a high steam injection rate. It is identified and quantified the main variables and operational parameters affecting the performance of CSS, for an oil field at OOB. The design of this pilot test covers the location of the area, visualization of thermal well, identification and quantification of the variables that potentially influence to a greater extent the performance of this technology, conceptual design of EOR surface facilities and a complete monitoring plan. A cluster with 10 long horizontal wells of different lengths is evaluated. The variables studied are: specific steam flowrate per unit length of well, well length, and well thermal insulation. We apply design of experiments to select the combinations of the values taken for the different variables. The duration of the different stages in every cycle is given by previous results applying optimization of CSS to sector modeling. The main constrains dictated for the thermal well are identified and taken into account to define the maximum steam injection and production rates for this test. The pilot test is simulated for three complete cycles, with two approaches: High (2.2 - 3 bbl/day*ft) and Low (1.5 bbl/day*ft) specific steam flowrates. Important production variables as drawdown, bottom-hole pressure, field average pressure, gas oil ratio and water cut have been evaluated. Results for the main operating parameters (High/Low approaches), and the economic evaluation, are shown. These results show once again that higher specific steam flow rates get higher recovery and are even more profitable. The study encourages a review of the paradigm that limits steam injection rates in high-productivity projects currently underway at OOB. Additionally, it is identified that at present is the thermal well and not the surface facilities, which limit the application of CSS at higher rates, needing an urgent improvement in its concept. The steam injection rate is conventionally expressed as daily rates (bbl/day), absolute amounts per unit thickness of formation (bbl/ft), etc. This practice creates misunderstandings, especially in the case of horizontal wells. The variable proposed in this study (specific steam flow rate per unit length of well) is valid for any type of well, and it has a physical significance related to well injectivity. Another novelty introduced in this study is a higher specific steam flow rate (2.2-3 bbl/day*ft), between 50% and 100% higher than references found in the literature (1.5-2 bbl/day*ft). © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Although temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) has been a 'hot topic' for well over 30 years, the discovery of TSD in viviparous taxa is recent. Viviparity and TSD was regarded unlikely on theoretical grounds as viviparity allows for high stable developmental temperatures through maternal basking. However, pregnant squamates of many species choose different body temperatures from non-pregnant females and males, and we now know that differential temperature selection by viviparous species with TSD allows for the production of sons or daughters. Three species of squamate reptiles (all are skinks) are now know to exhibit TSD. The physiological mechanism by which viviparous reptiles control the sex of their offspring is not understood, but exposure to different operational sex ratios in the adult population is a factor in some species. The functional role of sex steroid hormones in egg yolk and how the hormones are manipulated in utero is still an area requiring detailed investigation. Fast maturing squamate reptiles provide an excellent, but as yet underutilized, model system for studying the adaptive significance of TSD, and the occurrence of TSD in viviparous species requires substantially more work on a phylogenetically diverse range of species.

TI  - Intensive fish farming and the evolution of pathogen virulence: The case of columnaris disease in Finland
VL  - 277
IS  - 1681
SP  - 593-600
AB  - Ecological changes affect pathogen epidemiology and evolution and may trigger the emergence of novel diseases. Aquaculture radically alters the ecology of fish and their pathogens. Here we show an increase in the occurrence of the bacterial fish disease Flavobacterium columnare in salmon fingerlings at a fish farm in northern Finland over 23 years. We hypothesize that this emergence was owing to evolutionary changes in bacterial virulence. We base this argument on several observations. First, the emergence was associated with increased severity of symptoms. Second, F. columnare strains vary in virulence, with more lethal strains inducing more severe symptoms prior to death. Third, more virulent strains have greater infectivity, higher tissue-degrading capacity and higher growth rates. Fourth, pathogen strains co-occur, so that strains compete. Fifth, F. columnare can transmit efficiently from dead fish, and maintain infectivity in sterilized water for months, strongly reducing the fitness cost of host death likely experienced by the pathogen in nature. Moreover, this saprophytic infectiousness means that chemotherapy strongly select for strains that rapidly kill their hosts: dead fish remain infectious; treated fish do not. Finally, high stocking densities of homogeneous subsets of fish greatly enhance transmission opportunities. We suggest that fish farms provide an environment that promotes the circulation of more virulent strains of F. columnare. This effect is intensified by the recent increases in summer water temperature. More generally, we predict that intensive fish farming will lead to the evolution of more virulent pathogens. © 2009 The Royal Society.

TI  - Temperature dependence of soil nitrogen mineralization rate: Comparison of mathematical models, reference temperatures and origin of the soils
VL  - 157
IS  - 3
SP  - 97-108
AB  - Accurate prediction of soil nitrogen (N) mineralization in agricultural soils is of major concern because uncertainty in making fertilizer N recommendations can lead to economic losses and environmental pollution. This study examined the suitability of three temperature functions (Q(10), Arrhenius, Logistic) as predictors of the temperature dependence of soil N mineralization rate, k, in soil using previously published data sets. Each function fits k/k(0), where k(0) is the reference mineralization rate, against soil temperature T, where k/k(0) = 1 at the reference temperature, T-0. No single value of soil temperature was common to all data sets, and consequently a series of values of T-0 from 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C were tested. The influence of the temperature zone, land use and soil textural class of soils in the data set on the temperature response function was also tested. Despite the different mathematical forms of the functions evaluated, the fitted curves for each function were very similar and choice of temperature response function had a limited effect on prediction of soil N mineralization rate. An additional model, the Logistic(Fixed M) model, is proposed which fits the data sets as well as the previous models, but also takes into account the existence of optimal and maximal temperatures in a reasonable temperature range for biological organisms. In contrast, choice of To had a much more pronounced impact on the k/k(0) values, and thus on the predicted N mineralization rate, than choice of temperature model. A greater response of N mineralization rate (i.e. k/k(0)) to changes in temperature was observed in soils originating from colder climatic zones (mean annual temperature <2 degrees C) compared with warmer climate zones (mean annual temperature >6 degrees C). There was also a greater temperature response of soil N mineralization rate for agricultural compared with forested soils. Among agricultural soils, sand-loam soils had a greater temperature response compared with clay soils. Overall. selection of temperature response model did not appear to be critical to prediction of soil N mineralization rate, and consequently a form of the model which best represents the biological system is therefore preferable, whereas more attention should be given to the choice of the appropriate T-0 for field prediction of N mineralization.

TI  - Yolk-sac larval development of the substrate-brooding cichlid Archocentrus nigrofasciatus in relation to temperature
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
SP  - 497-504
AB  - In order to conserve and culture the cichlid fish Archocentrus nigrofasciatus, more information about its reproductive biology and its larval behavior and morphogenesis is necessary. Currently, temperatures ranging from 21 to 27 °C are used in ornamental aquaculture hatcheries. Lower temperatures are preferred to reduce the costs of water heating, and 23 °C is usually the selected temperature. However, there is limited information on culturing protocols for ornamental species and most of the information generated on this topic remains scarce. Thus, the present study examines the morphological development of Archocentrus nigrofasciatus during the yolk-sac period up to the age of 100 h post-hatching in relation to 2 temperature regimes used in ornamental aquaculture: a temperature of 27 °C (thermal optimum) and a decreased temperature of 23 °C (thermal tolerance). The results of this study suggest that the 27 °C temperature generates intense morphological changes in yolk-sac development in a shorter period. This has advantages as it reduces the time of yolk-sac larval development, and, thus, minimizes the transition phase to exogenous feeding and maximizes the efficiency at which yolk is converted into body tissues. The present paper provides necessary information to produce freshwater ornamental fish with better practices so as to increase larval survival and capitalize on time for growth. © 2015 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

TI  - Predicting the effects of climate change on natural enemies of agricultural pests
VL  - 52
IS  - 3
SP  - 296-306
AB  - Climate change can have diverse effects on natural enemies of pest species. Here we review these effects and their likely impacts on pest control. The fitness of natural enemies can be altered in response to changes in herbivore quality and size induced by temperature and CO2 effects on plants. The susceptibility of herbivores to predation and parasitism could be decreased through the production of additional plant foliage or altered timing of herbivore life cycles in response to plant phenological changes. The effectiveness of natural enemies in controlling pests will decrease if pest distributions shift into regions outside the distribution of their natural enemies, although a new community of enemies might then provide some level of control. As well as being affected by climate through host plants and associated herbivores, the abundance and activity of natural enemies will be altered through adaptive management strategies adopted by farmers to cope with climate change. These strategies may lead to a mismatch between pests and enemies in space and time, decreasing their effectiveness for biocontrol. Because of the diverse and often indirect effects of climate change on natural enemies, predictions will be difficult unless there is a good understanding of the way environmental effects impact on tritrophic interactions. In addition, evolutionary changes in both hosts and natural enemies might have unexpected consequences on levels of biocontrol exerted by enemies. We consider interactions between the pest light brown apple moth and its natural enemies to illustrate the type of data that needs to be collected to make useful predictions.

VL  - 68

SP  - 289-298
AB  - In many taxa of squamate reptiles, thermal conditions during incubation affect fitness-relevant phenotypic traits of the offspring. Therefore, a gravid female can enhance the fitness of her offspring by selecting appropriate thermal regimes. The maternal manipulation hypothesis (MMH) attributes phylogenetic shifts in a broad array of maternal traits (such as nest-site selection, prolonged uterine retention of eggs, and shivering thermogenesis) to selective advantages driven by embryonic developmental plasticity: mothers enhance the viability of their offspring by providing "better" incubation conditions. In Herpetologica 68:147-159, Schwarzkopf and Andrews (2012) pointed out an alternative possibility: that reproduction-induced shifts in maternal thermoregulatory tactics have evolved because they enhance maternal, not offspring, fitness. Although possible on logical grounds, this alternative hypothesis is inconsistent with available evidence on squamate biology, especially with the diversity of thermoregulatory modifications induced by reproduction. Most reproduction-associated shifts in maternal thermoregulation likely reflect benefits to offspring (as posited by the MMH), or are nonadaptive consequences of ecological shifts that are enforced by reproduction. © 2012 by The Herpetologists League, Inc.

TI  - Plasticity of life-cycle, physiological thermal traits and Hsp70 gene expression in an insect along the ontogeny: Effect of temperature variability
VL  - 36
IS  - 6
SP  - 355-362
AB  - It is considered that extreme environmental temperature, rather than mean temperatures exert a selective pressure in ectotherms. Consequently, it is important to understand how the predicted increase in temperature variance with a higher frequency of extreme events in climate change is likely to impact on organisms. Thermal tolerance traits (i.e. chill-coma, recovery time, Hsp70 expression) are directly linked with performance in ectotherms and have consequences in life-history traits. We examined the effects of temperature variability on thermal tolerance and life-history traits through ontogeny of an insect with a complex life-cycle: the yellow mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor. We established two common gardens with 100 recently ovoposited eggs each. Larvae were reared from hatching to adult on either a variable (mean=18 degrees C and a variance of 6.8 degrees C) or constant (18 +/- 1 degrees C) thermal environment. Development rate and growth rate were similar between thermal environments. Results indicate that larvae reared in a variable environment are more cold-tolerant than larvae of a constant environment. Interestingly, these results are reversed in the adult stage, outlining an inter-stage physiological cost. Gene expression pattern of an Hsp70 gene was well correlated with larval thermotolerance to cold in the variable environment but higher gene expression in adults is not correlated with individual's thermotolerance. We conclude that chill-coma, recovery time and Hsp70 gene expression are plastic in response to a thermal environment but also change significantly their responses depending on the ontogenetic stage, implying that the response of adult individuals is linked to early stages of the life-cycle.

AB  - The bioconversion conditions for the production of D-3-phenyllactic acid from phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) using whole cells of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pET-28a-ldhD were studied. Using Plackett-Burman design, buffer pH, substrate concentration and temperature were selected as the factors with significant influence on substrate conversion efficiency out of 6 factors. Subsequently, the optimization of the three factors was carried out using Box-Behnken design and response surface analysis. Results indicated that the optimal bioconversion conditions that provided the maximum molar conversion efficiency of PPA (65.32%) were buffer pH 7.0, substrate concentration 42 mmol/L, and temperature 38℃. Under these conditions, 119 mmol/L (19.75 g/L) of D-PLA with a productivity of 4.94 g/(L·h) was obtained after 4 h transformation with intermittent PPA feeding. © 2016, China Food Publishing Company.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the efficacy of heated humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHHFNC) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in preterm infants aged 26-31+6 weeks with respiratory distress syndrome after ventilator weaning. Methods: A total of 161 preterm infants were randomly divided into two groups after ventilator weaning: HHHFNC treatment (n=79) and nCPAP treatment (n=82). The two groups were subdivided into 26-28+6 weeks and 29-31+6 weeks groups according to the gestational age. The treatment failure rate, reintubation rate within 7 days after extubation, incidence of complications, and mortality during hospitalization were compared between the two groups. Results: The treatment failure rate and reintubation rate showed no significant differences between the HHHFNC and nCPAP groups. The preterm infants aged 26-28+6 weeks in the HHHFNC group had a significantly higher treatment failure rate than those in the nCPAP group (P<0.05), while the reintubation rate showed no significant difference. As for the preterm infants aged 29-31+6 weeks, the treatment failure rate and reintubation rate showed no significant differences between the two groups. The incidence of complications and mortality showed no significant differences between the HHHFNC and nCPAP groups. Conclusions: In preterm infants aged 29-31+6 weeks, HHHFNC has a similar efficacy as nCPAP after ventilator weaning, while in those aged less than 29 weeks, HHHFNC should be used with great caution if selected as the first-line noninvasive respiratory support.

TI  - Allelic variant in the anti-müllerian hormone gene leads to autosomal and temperature-dependent sex reversal in a selected nile tilapia line
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
AB  - Owing to the demand for sustainable sex-control protocols in aquaculture, research in tilapia sex determination is gaining momentum. The mutual influence of environmental and genetic factors hampers disentangling the complex sex determination mechanism in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Previous linkage analyses have demonstrated quantitative trait loci for the phenotypic sex on linkage groups 1, 3, and 23. Quantitative trait loci for temperature-dependent sex reversal similarly reside on linkage group 23. The anti-Müllerian hormone gene (amh), located in this genomic region, is important for sexual fate in higher vertebrates, and shows sexually dimorphic expression in Nile tilapia. Therefore this study aimed at detecting allelic variants and marker-sex associations in the amh gene. Sequencing identified six allelic variants. A significant effect on the phenotypic sex for SNP ss831884014 (p<0.0017) was found by stepwise logistic regression. The remaining variants were not significantly associated. Functional annotation of SNP ss831884014 revealed a non-synonymous amino acid substitution in the amh protein. Consequently, a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based genotyping assay was developed and validated with a representative sample of fish. A logistic linear model confirmed a highly significant effect of the treatment and genotype on the phenotypic sex, but not for the interaction term (treatment: p<0.0001; genotype: p<0.0025). An additive genetic model proved a linear allele substitution effect of 12% in individuals from controls and groups treated at high temperature, respectively. Moreover, the effect of the genotype on the male proportion was significantly higher in groups treated at high temperature, giving 31% more males on average of the three genotypes. In addition, the groups treated at high temperature showed a positive dominance deviation (+11.4% males). In summary, marker-assisted selection for amh variant ss831884014 seems to be highly beneficial to increase the male proportion in Nile tilapia, especially when applying temperature-induced sex reversal. © 2014 Wessels et al.

VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SP  - 74-83
AB  - Mutations or environmental factors that result in reversal of conspicuous left-right asymmetries provide an opportunity to study developmental mechanisms. They may also provide insight into evolutionary changes in asymmetry states within and between species. King crabs (family Lithodidae) have a larger right claw and females typically exhibit a dextrally offset abdomen. Nevertheless, I observed a high incidence of left handedness in laboratory reared box crabs (Lopholithodes foraminatus) and captured the first known egg-bearing female lithodid to exhibit reversed asymmetry. This provided a unique opportunity to characterize the reversed phenotype and to compare the incidence of reversed asymmetry in the offspring of normal and reversed females. Asymmetry of the chelae became apparent in the first postzoeal stage (glaucothoe) and handedness was maintained through subsequent instars. Females with larger left claws developed reversed abdominal asymmetry by the fourth crab stage. No reversed asymmetry was observed in the mandibles of zoea larvae or juveniles of either handedness. The incidence of reversed asymmetry in glaucothoe reared from one reversed and three normal females was high (between 20% and 30%), and independent of maternity (P=0.67). Removal of the right cheliped of fourth stage zoeae, and the major cheliped of glaucothoe, did not reverse the direction of asymmetry. Elevated larval rearing temperature also did not affect the frequency of reversed individuals. This lack of evidence for either heritability or induction of handedness is enigmatic. Further investigation of reversed asymmetry in lithodid crabs may provide valuable insights into the development and evolution of bilateral asymmetries. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Exploration of low temperature microRNA function in an anoxia tolerant vertebrate ectotherm, the red eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans)
VL  - 68
SP  - 139-146
AB  - As a model for vertebrate long-term survival in oxygen-restricted environments, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) can adapt at the biochemical level to survive in oxygen-free (anoxic) cold water ( < 10 degrees C). This impressive ability is enabled through a coordinated suppression of energy-expensive, nonessential, cell processes. This study explored the anoxia-responsive expression of several microRNA species (miR-1a, -133, -17, -107, -148a, -21, -103, -210, -20a, -365 and -29b) in adult turtles exposed to 5 h and 20 h anoxia (at 5 +/- 1 degrees C). Furthermore, since microRNA target binding is regularly defined only by microRNA-mRNA interactions at 37 degrees C, the possibility of unique low temperature-selective microRNA targeting interactions with mRNA was explored in this ectotherm. Approximately twice as many microRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted at 5 degrees C versus 37 degrees C with particular enrichment of mRNA targets involved in biological processes known to be part of the stress response. Hence, the results suggest that the influence of temperature should be considered for the prediction of microRNA targets (and their follow-up) in poikilothermic animals and that interacting effects of low body temperature and anoxia on microRNA expression could potentially be important to achieve the profound metabolic rate depression that characterizes turtle hibernation underwater during the winter.

AB  - The effects of internal friction (IF) on Zr65Cu35 metallic glass plasticity are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the Voronoi polyhedron < 0,3,6,3 > increases as IF increases, thereby effectively inhibiting localized deformation and improving metallic glass plasticity. The simulations allow reproduction of images of IF evolution in metallic glasses subjected to isothermal annealing at 730 K and 850 K respectively, which can help explain the experimental observations. IF could be adjusted by selecting suitable annealing temperatures and cooling rates. The results of this work provide a strong foundation for future metallic glass designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Maternal basking regime has complex implications for birthdate and offspring phenotype in a nocturnally foraging, viviparous gecko
VL  - 219
IS  - 18
SP  - 2934-2943
AB  - Maternal basking regime can affect gestation length in viviparous squamates, but effects on offspring phenotype in species with extended pregnancies and ability to delay the birth season are unclear. We investigated the effects of three maternal basking regimes on maternal thermoregulation, gestation length, pregnancy outcome and offspring phenotype in the gecko Woodworthia 'Otago/Southland'. This long-lived (30+ years), nocturnal forager has field pregnancies lasting up to 14 months, with fully developed offspring maintained in utero over winter. Within regimes, we also compared outcomes for spontaneous (early) deliveries with those from induced (late) deliveries to test the 'adaptive prolongation of pregnancy' hypothesis. Although a cool regime significantly extended gestation, the effect was reduced by increased maternal basking, and embryonic development under the cool regime was just as successful. Offspring from spontaneous births (but not induced births) were smaller and grew more slowly when from the cool regime. However, induced offspring did not differ in consistent ways from those delivered spontaneously and offspring from all groups had high viability, similar use of warm retreat sites and similar sprint speeds. Thus, consistent evidence for adaptive prolongation of pregnancy was lacking. Unusually for squamates, pregnant females can begin vitellogenesis before giving birth, and a profound drop in maternal body temperature near the end of pregnancy (6.3C, confirmed under the warm regime) may assist survival of embryos in utero. Female lizards that maintain fully developed embryos in utero have the potential to make complex trade-offs among birthdate, offspring phenotype and future reproduction. © 2016.

TI  - Reproductive investment in the North Sea haddock: Temporal and spatial variation
VL  - 432
SP  - 149-160
AB  - Maturation and fecundity have been examined since the 1970s in 2 putative sub-populations of North Sea haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus. Reproductive investment within the western North Sea haddock sub-population significantly increased between the 1970s and 2000s, as was evident from both a decline in maturation probability and an increase in fecundity with size. A decline in maturation probability was also evident in males from the east North Sea, although the length at 50% probability of maturing (Lp50) at the beginning and end of the study period was much higher than in the west North Sea. The changes in reproductive traits could not be explained as a compensatory response, since the trend for increasing reproductive investment was not reversed when the North Sea stock recovered over the past decade. Indeed increased reproductive investment was accompanied by a reduction in somatic growth rate. Temperature immediately prior to secondary gametogenesis could partially explain inter-annual variation in female maturation probability and may have influenced the difference in sub-population trends. However, declines in maturation probability with cohort were still highly significant after accounting for a temperature effect, and differences in potential fecundity could not be explained by changes in somatic condition. Overall, it appears that west North Sea haddock have increased their reproductive effort, following decades of high mortality, consistent with an evolutionary response. © Inter-Research 2011.

TI  - Pathogen-induced maternal effects result in enhanced immune responsiveness across generations
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
SP  - 2925-2935
AB  - Parental investment theory postulates that adults can accurately perceive cues from their surroundings, anticipate the needs of future offspring based on those cues, and selectively allocate nongenetic resources to their progeny. Such context-dependent parental contributions can result in phenotypically variable offspring. Consistent with these predictions, we show that bacterially exposed Manduca sexta mothers oviposited significantly more variable embryos (as measured by mass, volume, hatching time, and hatching success) relative to naïve and control mothers. By using an in vivo “clearance of infection” assay, we also show that challenged larvae born to heat-killed- or live-Serratia-injected mothers, supported lower microbial loads and cleared the infection faster than progeny of control mothers. Our data support the notion that mothers can anticipate the future pathogenic risks and immunological needs of their unborn offspring, providing progeny with enhanced immune protection likely through transgenerational immune priming. Although the inclusion of live Serratia into oocytes does not appear to be the mechanism by which mothers confer protection to their young, other mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications in the progeny due to maternal pathogenic stress, may be at play. The adaptive nature of maternal effects in the face of pathogenic stress provides insights into parental investment, resource allocation, and life-history theories and highlights the significant role that pathogen-induced maternal effects play as generators and modulators of evolutionary change. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Local genetic adaptation generates latitude-specific effects of warming on predator-prey interactions
VL  - 19
IS  - 3
SP  - 689-696
AB  - Temperature effects on predator-prey interactions are fundamental to better understand the effects of global warming. Previous studies never considered local adaptation of both predators and prey at different latitudes, and ignored the novel population combinations of the same predator-prey species system that may arise because of northward dispersal. We set up a common garden warming experiment to study predator-prey interactions between Ischnura elegans damselfly predators and Daphnia magna zooplankton prey from three source latitudes spanning >1500 km. Damselfly foraging rates showed thermal plasticity and strong latitudinal differences consistent with adaptation to local time constraints. Relative survival was higher at 24 °C than at 20 °C in southern Daphnia and higher at 20 °C than at 24 °C, in northern Daphnia indicating local thermal adaptation of the Daphnia prey. Yet, this thermal advantage disappeared when they were confronted with the damselfly predators of the same latitude, reflecting also a signal of local thermal adaptation in the damselfly predators. Our results further suggest the invasion success of northward moving predators as well as prey to be latitude-specific. We advocate the novel common garden experimental approach using predators and prey obtained from natural temperature gradients spanning the predicted temperature increase in the northern populations as a powerful approach to gain mechanistic insights into how community modules will be affected by global warming. It can be used as a space-for-time substitution to inform how predator-prey interaction may gradually evolve to long-term warming. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - To accurately predict the impact of environmental change, it is necessary to assay effects of key interacting stressors on vulnerable organisms, and the potential resiliency of their populations. Yet, for the most part, these critical data are missing. We examined the effects of two common abiotic stressors predicted to interact with climate change, salinity and temperature, on the embryonic survival and development of a model freshwater vertebrate, the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from different populations. We found that salinity and temperature significantly interacted to affect newt embryonic survival and development, with the negative effects of salinity most pronounced at temperature extremes. We also found significant variation among, and especially within, populations, with different females varying in the performance of their eggs at different salinity–temperature combinations, possibly providing the raw material for future natural selection. Our results highlight the complex nature of predicting responses to climate change in space and time, and provide critical data towards that aim. © 2017 The Authors.

SP  - 2433-2439
AB  - The present investigation was made with an attempt to manufacture banana based probiotic soy yoghurt with addition of probiotic culture and banana puree, were examined. Probiotic soy yoghurt samples were produced from soy milk fermented with yoghurt and probiotic culture i.e. Streptococcus thermophilus NCDC-074, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus NCDC-009, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC-15 and Bifidobacterium bifidum NCDC-235. The viability (SPC) of these four strains were analyzed during storage at refrigerated temperature with the selective media of MRS, ST, MRS-sorbitol and MRS-maltose agar. These counts generally decreased during the storage period. Supplementation of banana fortified soy yoghurts with 5, 10 and 15% of banana puree, improved the viability of probiotic bacteria during storage period. However, the yoghurt supplemented with banana puree, at 15% level, showed highest viability (10 6 cfu/g) among all treatment combinations up to four weeks of refrigerated storage.

AB  - Optimization of Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process in a fixed-bed reactor is carried out using non-uniform catalysts. The C5+ yield of the reactions is maximized utilizing a combination of non-uniform catalysts across the bed. A 1D heterogeneous model is developed to simulate the bed containing uniform and non-uniform catalysts. It is found that the egg-shell and surface-layered catalysts result in higher C5+ yield. Moreover, effects of cooling temperature are studied. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) methods are applied. Feed and cooling temperature are selected as decision variables together with distribution of non-uniform catalysts along the bed. The optimization result shows 14.47% increase in the C5+ yield with respect to the base condition. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

TI  - Cellular interfaces with hydrogen-bonded organic semiconductor hierarchical nanocrystals
VL  - 8

AB  - Successful formation of electronic interfaces between living cells and semiconductors hinges on being able to obtain an extremely close and high surface-area contact, which preserves both cell viability and semiconductor performance. To accomplish this, we introduce organic semiconductor assemblies consisting of a hierarchical arrangement of nanocrystals. These are synthesised via a colloidal chemical route that transforms the nontoxic commercial pigment quinacridone into various biomimetic three-dimensional arrangements of nanocrystals. Through a tuning of parameters such as precursor concentration, ligands and additives, we obtain complex size and shape control at room temperature. We elaborate hedgehog-shaped crystals comprising nanoscale needles or daggers that form intimate interfaces with the cell membrane, minimising the cleft with single cells without apparent detriment to viability. Excitation of such interfaces with light leads to effective cellular photostimulation. We find reversible light-induced conductance changes in ion-selective or temperature-gated channels. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Extinction risk and eco-evolutionary dynamics in a variable environment with increasing frequency of extreme events
VL  - 11
IS  - 97
AB  - One of the most dramatic consequences of climate change will be the intensification and increased frequency of extreme events. I used numerical simulations to understand and predict the consequences of directional trend (i.e. mean state) and increased variability of a climate variable (e.g. temperature), increased probability of occurrence of point extreme events (e.g. floods), selection pressure and effect size of mutations on a quantitative trait determining individual fitness, as well as the their effects on the population and genetic dynamics of a population of moderate size. The interaction among climate trend, variability and probability of point extremes had a minor effect on risk of extinction, time to extinction and distribution of the trait after accounting for their independent effects. The survival chances of a population strongly and linearly decreased with increasing strength of selection, as well as with increasing climate trend and variability. Mutation amplitude had no effects on extinction risk, time to extinction or genetic adaptation to the new climate. Climate trend and strength of selection largely determined the shift of the mean phenotype in the population. The extinction or persistence of the populations in an 'extinction window' of 10 years was well predicted by a simple model including mean population size and mean genetic variance over a 10-year time frame preceding the 'extinction window', although genetic variance had a smaller role than population size in predicting contemporary risk of extinction. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Exploring the antarctic soil metagenome as a source of novel cold-adapted enzymes and genetic mobile elements
VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 94-103
AB  - Metagenomic library PP1 was obtained from Antarctic soil samples. Both functional and genotypic metagenomic screening were used for the isolation of novel cold-adapted enzymes with potential applications, and for the detection of genetic elements associated with gene mobilization, respectively. Fourteen lipase/esterase-, 14 amylase-, 3 protease-, and 11 cellulase-producing clones were detected by activity-driven screening, with apparent maximum activities around 35 °C for both amylolytic and lipolytic enzymes, and 35-55 °C for cellulases, as observed for other cold-adapted enzymes. However, the behavior of at least one of the studied cellulases is more compatible to that observed for mesophilic enzymes. These enzymes are usually still active at temperatures above 60 °C, probably resulting in a psychrotolerant behavior in Antarctic soils. Metagenomics allows to access novel genes encoding for enzymatic and biophysic properties from almost every environment with potential benefits for biotechnological and industrial applications. Only intI- and tnp-like genes were detected by PCR, encoding for proteins with 58-86%, and 58-73% amino acid identity with known entries, respectively. Two clones, BAC 27A-9 and BAC 14A-5, seem to present unique syntenic organizations, suggesting the occurrence of gene rearrangements that were probably due to evolutionary divergences within the genus or facilitated by the association with transposable elements. The evidence for genetic elements related to recruitment and mobilization of genes (transposons/integrons) in an extreme environment like Antarctica reinforces the hypothesis of the origin of some of the genes disseminated by mobile elements among "human-associated" microorganisms.

TI  - Geochemistry of the Cretaceous Kaskanak Batholith and genesis of the Pebble porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, Southwest Alaska
VL  - 102
IS  - 8
SP  - 1597-1621
AB  - The key magmatic processes that lead to the formation of large magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry copper mineral deposits remain uncertain, and a particular question is why a few of these deposits, such as the Pebble porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, are strongly enriched in both gold and molybdenum. This study investigated the igneous rocks of the Pebble district and obtained major and trace element compositions, Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, and zircon age and trace element data to model the origin of the ore-forming magmas. The Pebble porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, one of the world's largest Cu-Au resources, formed during the final stages of regional Late Cretaceous arc magmatism (101-88 Ma) in the Southwest Alaska Range. Local pre-mineral intrusions (99-95 Ma) are dominated by alkaline compositions including monzodiorite stocks, shoshonite dikes, and monzonite porphyries, but also include lesser volumes of high-K calc-alkaline diorite and granodiorite sills. The occurrence of early alkaline magmas has been noted at other gold-rich porphyry systems, including Bingham and Kerr-Sulfurets-Mitchell. Mineralization at Pebble is associated with granodiorite to granite porphyry dikes related to the &gt;165 km2 high-K calc-alkaline Kaskanak granodiorite batholith (91-89 Ma). Over a period of 10 m.y., Late Cretaceous melts evolved from high temperatures (930-730°C) and modestly hydrous and oxidized conditions to relatively low temperatures (760-680°C) and very hydrous and oxidized conditions. Collectively, all Late Cretaceous igneous rocks at Pebble contain magnetite and little or no ilmenite, are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, and have typical arc trace element enrichments and depletions. They have moderate Sr/Y ratios (20-55) and gently sloped REE profiles (La/Yb = 5-20) that are not adakitic, which supports a source area lacking garnet that is consistent with a thin crust in southwest Alaska. Radiogenic isotopes for Late Cretaceous intrusions at Pebble have a restricted range of primitive Sr and Nd isotopic compositions (87Sr/86Sri = 0.70329-0.70424; ϵNdi = 4.9-6.1), which overlap with volcanic and plutonic basement rocks of the Jurassic Talkeetna Arc along the Alaska Peninsula. The Kaskanak batholith intrudes the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch, and mixing models using Sr and Nd isotopes indicate that the Kaskanak batholith assimilated ≤10 wt% Kahiltna flysch in amounts that did not likely affect magma fertility. Xenocrystic zircon samples are abundant in Cretaceous pre-mineral intrusions and have U-Pb ages similar to detrital zircon samples in the Kahiltna flysch. These data support some assimilation of upper crustal Kahiltna flysch, but the dominance of Devonian-Mississippian xenocrystic zircon populations in some intrusions suggests derivation from unexposed older basement. The extraordinary endowment of Cu and Au at Pebble is inferred to result from primitive calc-alkaline and alkaline arc magmas and the hydrous and strongly oxidized conditions that suppressed the formation and fractionation of Cu- and Au-enriched sulfide melts. Furthermore, differentiation to silicic compositions was a product of extensive crystal fractionation of parental melts accompanied by minor crustal assimilation. The trace element content of the intermediate composition intrusions indicates that both hornblende and titanite fractionation processes in the mid- to shallow-crust were both required to produce the more evolved granodiorite and granite porphyry compositions. Despite the apparent lack of Mo-enriched continental crust in the region, primitive hydrous melts were produced by protracted arc magmatism and were modified by minor crustal assimilation including early alkaline magmatism, periodic recharge of mafic hydrous basalts and hybrid andesites, and fractional crystallization, which was apparently sufficient to enrich Mo in late stage felsic melts. © 2017 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.

TI  - Future of beech in Southeast Europe from the perspective of evolutionary ecology
VL  - 6
SP  - 91-110
AB  - The aim of this study is to provide quantitative information on the effect of climatic change on the growth and vitality of European beech: although the species is considered in its optimum highly plastic and adaptable, it becomes climate-sensitive closer to its xeric (lower) distribution limits. The future of beech in Southeast Europe requires special attention because this region harbours significant populations living at or near their xeric distribution boundary. Even though the low elevation occurrences are uniquely vulnerable to climatic shifts, observations and modelling studies pertaining to this region are particularly scarce. Out of climatic factors determining the xeric distributional limits for beech, Ellenberg's drought index (EQ) appeared as the most influential. Growth response analyses in comparative tests have confirmed the existence of macroclimatic adaptation of beech and have proven that warming and more arid conditions lead to decline of growth and vitality, while no decline was observed if EQ changed in the opposite direction. The response to weather extremes was investigated in field plots. Recurrent summer droughts of 3 to 4 consecutive years, above mean EQ value 40-42 resulted in pest and disease attacks and mass mortality. The discussed approaches indicate consistently a high level of uncertainty regarding the future of beech at the xeric limit in Southeast Europe. According to field observations and bioclimatic data in Hungary, a large part of low-elevation beech forests presently in the zone of EQ index >20 might be threatened by the warming in the second half of the century, while higher-elevation occurrences may remain stable. The interpretation of the results bears some stipulations, such as the consequence of ecological and human interactions in influencing present distribution patterns, the unclear role of persistence, natural selection and plasticity and uncertainties of climate projections. Grim projections may probably be partly overwritten by the mentioned stipulations and by careful and prudent human support.

AB  - Ecological speciation is defined as the emergence of reproductive isolation as a direct or indirect consequence of divergent ecological adaptation. Several empirical examples of ecological speciation have been reported in the literature which very often involve adaptation to biotic resources. In this review, we investigate whether adaptation to different thermal habitats could also promote speciation and try to assess the importance of such processes in nature. Our survey of the literature identified 16 animal and plant systems where divergent thermal adaptation may underlie (partial) reproductive isolation between populations or may allow the stable coexistence of sibling taxa. In many of the systems, the differentially adapted populations have a parapatric distribution along an environmental gradient. Isolation often involves extrinsic selection against locally maladapted parental or hybrid genotypes, and additional pre- or postzygotic barriers may be important. Together, the identified examples strongly suggest that divergent selection between thermal environments is often strong enough to maintain a bimodal genotype distribution upon secondary contact. What is less clear from the available data is whether it can also be strong enough to allow ecological speciation in the face of gene flow through reinforcement-like processes. It is possible that intrinsic features of thermal gradients or the genetic basis of thermal adaptation make such reinforcement-like processes unlikely but it is equally possible that pertinent systems are understudied. Overall, our literature survey highlights (once again) the dearth of studies that investigate similar incipient species along the continuum from initial divergence to full reproductive isolation and studies that investigate all possible reproductive barriers in a given system. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Extending the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation: High-temperature environments
VL  - 177
IS  - 4
SP  - 452-461
AB  - The classic cost-benefit model of ectothermic thermoregulation compares energetic costs and benefits, providing a critical framework for understanding this process (Huey and Slatkin 1976). It considers the case where environmental temperature (Te) is less than the selected temperature of the organism (Tsel), and it predicts that, to minimize increasing energetic costs of thermoregulation as habitat thermal quality declines, thermoregulatory effort should decrease until the lizard thermoconforms. We extended this model to include the case where Te exceeds T sel, and we redefine costs and benefits in terms of fitness to include effects of body temperature (Tb) on performance and survival. Our extended model predicts that lizards will increase thermoregulatory effort as habitat thermal quality declines, gaining the fitness benefits of optimal Tb and maximizing the net benefit of activity. Further, to offset the disproportionately high fitness costs of high Te compared with low Te, we predicted that lizards would thermoregulate more effectively at high values of Te than at low ones. We tested our predictions on three sympatric skink species (Carlia rostralis, Carlia rubrigularis, and Carlia storri) in hot savanna woodlands and found that thermoregulatory effort increased as thermal quality declined and that lizards thermoregulated most effectively at high values of Te. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Stress tolerance profiling of a collection of extant salt-tolerant rice varieties and transgenic plants overexpressing abiotic stress tolerance genes
VL  - 56
IS  - 10
SP  - 1867-1876
AB  - Environmental stress tolerance is an important trait for crop improvement. In recent decades, numerous genes that confer tolerance to abiotic stress such as salinity were reported. However, the levels of salt tolerance differ greatly depending on growth conditions, and mechanisms underlying the complicated nature of stress tolerance are far from being fully understood. In this study, we investigated the profiles of stress tolerance of nine salt-tolerant rice varieties and transgenic rice lines carrying constitutively expressed genes that are potentially involved in salt tolerance, by evaluating their growth and viability under salt, heat, ionic and hyperosmotic stress conditions. Profiling of the extant varieties and selected chromosome segment substitution lines showed that salt tolerance in a greenhouse condition was more tightly correlated with ionic stress tolerance than osmotic stresses. In Nona Bokra, one of the most salt-tolerant varieties, the contribution of the previously identified sodium transporter HKT1;5 to salt tolerance was fairly limited. In addition, Nona Bokra exhibited high tolerance to all the stresses imposed. More surprisingly, comparative evaluation of 74 stress tolerance genes revealed that the most striking effect to enhance salt tolerance was conferred by overexpressing CYP94C2b, which promotes deactivation of jasmonate. In contrast, genes encoding ABA signaling factors conferred multiple stress tolerance. Genes conferring tolerance to both heat and hyperosmotic stresses were preferentially linked to functional categories related to heat shock proteins, scavenging of reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ signaling. These comparative profiling data provide a new basis for understanding the ability of plants to grow under harsh environmental conditions. © The Author 2015.

TI  - Effect of sulphur fertilization on the content of components influencing fodder quality in cocksfoot (Dactylis Glomerata L.)
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SP  - 945-955
AB  - The nutritional value of animal feed primarily depends on its chemical composition (content of crude protein, crude ash, crude fibre, crude fat and nitrogen-free extracts), which is to some extent determined by fertilization with sulphur. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of different sulphur application regimes on selected quality parameters of cocksfoot Dactylis glomerata L. A field experiment was conducted on brown eutrophic soil. Sulphur was applied in two doses: 10 kg S ha-1, and 20 kg S ha-1. In addition, each experimental treatment was fertilized with 120 kg N ha-1, 30 kg P ha-1, 100 kg K ha-1, and 15 kg Mg ha-1. During the growing period from March to September, air temperature and precipitation were monitored. Fertilization with sulphur was found to affect the content of crude fibre, crude ash, crude fat, cystine and methionine in cocksfoot, while no correlation was observed between the content of these chemical components and the weather conditions. The concentration of nitrogen-free extracts did not vary significantly in response to sulphur application, but the content of these compounds correlated with the average precipitation sum, air temperature, and Selyaninov’s coefficient. Sulphur application did not affect the crude protein content, which was significantly correlated with the temperature and Selyaninov’s coefficient during the growing season of cocksfoot. The results of the field experiment suggest that sulphur fertilization of cocksfoot increased the quality of the fodder. © 2017, Polish Society Magnesium Research. All rights reserved.

TI  - Holding our breath in our modern world: Will mitochondria keep the pace with climate changes?1
VL  - 92
IS  - 7
SP  - 591-601
AB  - Changes in environmental temperature can pose considerable challenges to animals and shifts in thermal habitat have been shown to be a major force driving species' adaptation. These adaptations have been the focus of major research efforts to determine the physiological or metabolic constraints related to temperature and to reveal the phenotypic characters that can or should adjust. Considering the current consensus on climate change, the focus of research will likely shift to questioning whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive future modifications of their thermal niches. Organisms can adjust to temperature changes through physiological plasticity (e.g., acclimation), genetic adaptation, or via dispersal to more suitable thermal habitats. Thus, it is important to understand what genetic and phenotypic attributes-at the individual, population, and species levels-could improve survival success. These issues are particularly important for ectotherms, which are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding environment. To start addressing these queries, we should consider what physiological or metabolic functions are responsible for the impact of temperature on organisms. Some recent developments indicate that mitochondria are key metabolic structures determining the thermal range that an organism can tolerate. The catalytic capacity of mitochondria is highly sensitive to thermal variation and therefore should partly dictate the temperature dependence of biological functions. Mitochondria contain a complex network of different enzymatic reaction pathways that interact synergistically. The precise regulation of both adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production depends on the integration of different enzymes and pathways. Here, we examine the temperature dependence of different parts of mitochondrial pathways and evaluate the evolutionary challenges that need to be overcome to ensure mitochondrial adaptations to new thermal environments. © 2013 Published by NRC Research Press.

TI  - Research on energy-saving scheduling of a forging stock charging furnace based on an improved SPEA2 algorithm
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
AB  - In order to help the forging enterprise realize energy conservation and emission reduction, the scheduling problem of furnace heating was improved in this paper. Aiming at the charging problem of continuous heating furnace, a multi-objective furnace charging model with minimum capacity difference and waiting time was established in this paper. An improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) algorithm was designed to solve this problem. The original fitness assignment strategy, crossover operator and population selection mechanism of SPEA2 are replaced with DOPGA (Domination Power of an Individual Genetic Algorithm), adaptive cross operator, and elitist strategy. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the improved SPEA2 was verified by actual arithmetic example. The comparison of results gained from three methods shows the superiority of the improved SPEA2 in solving this problem. Compared with strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) and SPEA2, the improved SPEA2 can get a better solution without increasing time complexity, the heating time is reduced by total 93 minutes, and can save 7533GJ energy. The research in this paper can help the forging enterprise improve furnace utilization, reduce heating time and unnecessary heating preservation time, as well as achieve sustainable energy savings and emissions reduction. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - The FRS Ion Catcher - A facility for high-precision experiments with stopped projectile and fission fragments
VL  - 317
SP  - 457-462
AB  - At the FRS Ion Catcher at GSI, projectile and fission fragments are produced at relativistic energies, separated in-flight, range-focused, slowed down and thermalized in a cryogenic stopping cell. A multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) is used to perform direct mass measurements and to provide an isobarically clean beam for further experiments, such as mass-selected decay spectroscopy. A versatile RF quadrupole transport and diagnostics unit guides the ions from the stopping cell to the MR-TOF-MS, provides differential pumping, ion identification and includes reference ion sources. The FRS Ion Catcher serves as a test facility for the Low-Energy Branch of the Super-FRS at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), where the cryogenic stopping cell and the MR-TOF-MS will be key devices for the research with stopped projectile and fission fragments that will be performed with the experiments MATS and LaSpec. Off-line tests of the stopping cell yield a combined ion survival and extraction efficiency for Rn-219 ions of about 30% and an extraction time of about 25 ms. The stopping cell and the MR-TOF-MS were commissioned on-line as part of the FRS Ion Catcher. For the first time, a stopping cell for exotic nuclei was operated on-line at cryogenic temperatures. Using a gas density almost two times higher than ever reached before for a stopping cell with RF ion repelling structures, various U-238 projectile fragments were thermalized and extracted with very high efficiency. Direct mass measurements of projectile fragments were performed with the MR-TOF-MS, among them the nuclide Rn-213 with a half-life of 19.5 ms only. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to greater leaf hydraulic tolerance in response to drought in warmer climates
VL  - 37
IS  - 5
SP  - 583-592
AB  - The ability of plants to maintain an intact water transport system in leaves under drought conditions is intimately linked to survival and can been be seen as adaptive in shaping species climatic limits. Large differences in leaf hydraulic vulnerability to drought are known among species from contrasting climates, yet whether this trait varies among populations within a single species and, furthermore, whether it is altered by changes in growth conditions, remain unclear. We examined intraspecific variation in both leaf water transport capacity (Kleaf) and leaf hydraulic vulnerability to drought (P50leaf) among eight populations of Corymbia calophylla (R. Br.) K.D. Hill &amp; L.A.S. Johnson (Myrtaceae) from both cool and warm climatic regions grown reciprocally under two temperature treatments representing the cool and warm edge of the species distribution. Kleaf did not vary between cool and warm-climate populations, nor was it affected by variable growth temperature. In contrast, population origin and growth temperature independently altered P50leaf. Using data pooled across growth temperatures, cool-climate populations showed significantly higher leaf hydraulic vulnerability (P50leaf = -3.55 ± 0.18 MPa) than warm-climate populations (P50leaf = -3.78 ± 0.08 MPa). Across populations, P50leaf decreased as population home-climate temperature increased, but was unrelated to rainfall and aridity. For populations from both cool and warm climatic regions, P50leaf was lower under the warmer growth conditions. These results provide evidence of trait plasticity in leaf hydraulic vulnerability to drought in response to variable growth temperature. Furthermore, they suggest that climate, and in particular temperature, may be a strong selective force in shaping intraspecific variation in leaf hydraulic vulnerability to drought. © 2016 The Author.

TI  - The roles of cell size and cell number in determining ovariole number in Drosophila
VL  - 363
IS  - 1
SP  - 279-289
AB  - All insect ovaries are composed of functional units called ovarioles, which contain sequentially developing egg chambers. The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. Ovariole number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been intensively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of ovariole number remains unknown. Ovariole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster by genetically altering cell size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in ovariole number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher ovariole number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher ovariole number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects ovariole number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in ovariole number was due to changes in cell-cell sorting during TF morphogenesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number. We have thus identified two distinct developmental processes that regulate ovariole number: establishment of total TFC number, and TFC sorting during TF morphogenesis. Our data suggest that the genetic changes underlying species-specific ovariole number may alter the total number of TFCs available to contribute to TF formation. This work provides for the first time specific and quantitative developmental tools to investigate the evolution of a highly conserved reproductive structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The adaptation of organisms to their environment has been a subject of study for a long time. One method to study adaptations in populations involves comparing contemporary populations of the same species under different selective regimes, in what is known as a 'local adaptation' study. A previous study of the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus plicatilis found high heritabilities for some lifehistory traits. Some of these life-history traits significantly differed among six populations from Eastern Spain and data suggested some traits to have higher evolutionary rates than neutral genetic markers. Here, by studying the same B. plicatilis populations, we examine the variation and possible local adaptation of their main life-history traits, closely related to fitness, in relation to habitat salinity and temperature. These environmental factors have been shown to play a key role in the ecological differentiation among co-generic species of B. plicatilis. The results obtained in this study show that: (1) the seasonality of rotifer populations from Eastern Spain has profoundly influenced sexual reproduction strategies; (2) salinity is probably a key factor in the ecological specialization of some populations; and (3) rotifer populations harbour high variability in their fitness components. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

SP  - 155-192
AB  - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season (C4), perennial grass that is native to the tall grass ecoregion of North America (Figure 7.1). Historically, switchgrass has been used for summer forage, hay, and ensiling or in conservation plantings. At the end of the twentieth century, switchgrass was designated as a bioenergy crop in the United States with the goal of converting the lignocellulosic portion to a renewable transportation fuel. Switchgrass has high biomass production potential, wide adaptability, and low fossil fuel energy requirements and is compatible with modern agriculture practices making it an ideal herbaceous energy crop. At present, significant research has been conducted on switchgrass to better understand switchgrass genetics and agronomic management and develop reliable supply chains for a mature bioenergy industry. Although maximizing biomass production is important, a holistic approach needs to be acknowledged to meet numerous ecosystem services for long-term sustainability and profitability. In this chapter, we identify best management practices to ensure switchgrass productivity and efficient logistics for an emerging bioenergy industry. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The effectiveness of insecticides differs with changes in temperature, but insecticide toxicities are determined at constant temperatures. Constant thermal conditions do not occur in the field, where insects can change their behaviors to achieve a preferred temperature. The aim of this study was to assess whether the choice of ambient temperature affects the mortality rate of intoxicated firebugs and Colorado potato beetles. The insects’ mortality following insecticide exposure was monitored at constant temperatures (15, 25, and 35 °C) as well as in a thermal gradient system, where the insects could freely select their preferred ambient temperature. Firebugs treated with oxadiazine showed 58% higher mortality when held at a constant temperature post-treatment compared to mortality levels seen when able to choose a preferred temperature in a thermal gradient. Similar results were seen in Colorado potato beetles treated with oxadiazine (15%–33% higher mortality in constant vs. preferred temperature) or organophosphate (36% higher mortality in constant vs. preferred temperature). The insects’ ability to mitigate the impacts of pesticide exposure by selecting more beneficial thermal conditions is an important consideration for pest management. Therefore, the application rates of insecticides used under field conditions should be additionally analyzed to take this factor into account. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The rate of migration and in situ genetic variation in forest trees may not be sufficient to compete with the current rapid rate of climate change. Ecophysiological adjustments of key traits, however, could complement these processes and allow sustained survival and growth across a wide range of climatic conditions. This was tested in Pinus halepensis Miller by examining seven physiological and phenological parameters in five provenances growing in three common garden plots along a climatic transect from meso-Mediterranean (MM) to thermo-Mediterranean (TM) and semi-arid (SA) climates. Differential responses to variations in ambient climatic conditions were observed in three key traits: (i) growing season length decreased with drying in all provenances examined (from 165 under TM climate to 100 days under SA climate, on average); (ii) water use efficiency (WUE) increased with drying, but to a different extent in different provenances, and on average from 80, to 95, to 110 μmol CO 2 mol-1 H2O under MM, TM and SA climates, respectively; (iii) xylem native embolism was stable across climates, but varied markedly among different provenances (percent loss of conductivity, was below 5% in two provenances and above 35% in others). The results indicated that changes in growing season length and WUE were important contributors to tree growth across climates, whereas xylem native embolism negatively correlated with tree survival. The results indicated that irrespective of slow processes (e.g., migration, genetic adaptation), the capacity for ecophysiological adjustments combined with existing variations among provenances could help sustain P. halepensis, a major Mediterranean tree species, under relatively extreme warming and drying climatic trends.© The Author 2012.

TI  - A population genetic assessment of coral recovery on highly disturbed reefs of the Keppel Island archipelago in the southern Great Barrier Reef
VL  - 2015
IS  - 7
AB  - Coral reefs surrounding the islands lying close to the coast are unique to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in that they are frequently exposed to disturbance events including floods caused by cyclonic rainfall, strong winds and occasional periods of prolonged above-average temperatures during summer. In one such group of islands in the southern GBR, the Keppel Island archipelago, climate-driven disturbances frequently result in major coral mortality. Whilst these island reefs have clearly survived such dramatic disturbances in the past, the consequences of extreme mortality events may include the loss of genetic diversity, and hence adaptive potential, and a reduction in fitness due to inbreeding, especially if new recruitment fromexternal sources is limited.Here we examined the level of isolation of the Keppel Island group as well as patterns of gene flow within the Keppel Islands using 10 microsatellite markers in nine populations of the coral, Acropora millepora. Bayesian cluster analysis and assignment tests indicated gene flow is restricted, but not absent, between the outer and inner Keppel Island groups, and that extensive gene flow exists within each of these island groups. Comparison of the Keppel Island data with results from a previous GBR-wide study that included a single Keppel Island population, confirmed that A. millepora in the Keppel Islands is genetically distinct from populations elsewhere on the GBR, with exception of the nearby inshore High Peak Reef just north of the Keppel Islands. We compared patterns of genetic diversity in the Keppel Island populations with those from other GBR populations and found themto be slightly, but significantly lower, consistent with the archipelago being geographically isolated, but there was no evidence for recent bottlenecks or deviation frommutation-drift equilibrium. A high incidence of private alleles in the Keppel Islands, particularly in the outer islands, supports their relative isolation and contributes to the conservation value of the archipelago. The lack of evidence for genetic erosion, in combination with our observation that the North Keppel Island population samples collected in 2002 and 2008, respectively, exhibited a pairwise genetic distance of zero, supports previous published work indicating that, following bleaching, Acropora corals in the Keppel Islands predominantly recover from regrowth of small amounts of remaining live tissue in apparently dead coral colonies. This is likely supplemented by recruitment of larvae from genetically similar, less disturbed populations at nearby reefs, particularly following extreme flood events. © 2015 van Oppen et al.

AB  - The synthesis of a polyacetal-block-polyurethane copolymer was achieved which possesses the ability to depolymerize both selectively and in response to orthogonal stimuli, heat and pH. To utilize heat as a stimulus, poly(phthalaldehyde) (PPA) was used as a block of the copolymer, while poly(benzyl-4-hydroxymethylphenylcarbamate) (PPC) end-capped with a tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group (Boc group) were explored for viability as a pH-responsive block. The stimulus-induced depolymerization was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). These techniques confirmed that the depolymerization event did not affect the nature of the neighboring polymeric block. Depolymerization kinetics were measured for various chain lengths of each block. The results are presented and discussed to explore the ability of these materials to depolymerize in a controlled manner depending on the magnitude of the stimulus, as well as the ability for the blocks to remain unaffected by the orthogonal stimulus. This work shows promise for the development of advanced coatings systems and drug delivery applications. © 2017 Materials Research Society.

TI  - Temperature observation time and type influence estimates of heat-related mortality in seven U.S. cities
VL  - 124
IS  - 6
SP  - 795-804
AB  - Background: Extreme heat is a leading weather-related cause of mortality in the United States, but little guidance is available regarding how temperature variable selection impacts heat–mortality relationships. Objectives: We examined how the strength of the relationship between daily heat-related mortality and temperature varies as a function of temperature observation time, lag, and calculation method. Methods: Long time series of daily mortality counts and hourly temperature for seven U.S. cities with different climates were examined using a generalized additive model. The temperature effect was modeled separately for each hour of the day (with up to 3-day lags) along with different methods of calculating daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperature. We estimated the temperature effect on mortality for each variable by comparing the 99th versus 85th temperature percentiles, as determined from the annual time series. Results: In three northern cities (Boston, MA; Philadelphia, PA; and Seattle, WA) that appeared to have the greatest sensitivity to heat, hourly estimates were consistent with a diurnal pattern in the heat-mortality response, with strongest associations for afternoon or maximum temperature at lag 0 (day of death) or afternoon and evening of lag 1 (day before death). In warmer, southern cities, stronger associations were found with morning temperatures, but overall the relationships were weaker. The strongest temperature–mortality relationships were associated with maximum temperature, although mean temperature results were comparable. Conclusions: There were systematic and substantial differences in the association between temperature and mortality based on the time and type of temperature observation. Because the strongest hourly temperature–mortality relationships were not always found at times typically associated with daily maximum temperatures, temperature variables should be selected independently for each study location. In general, heat-mortality was more closely coupled to afternoon and maximum temperatures in most cities we examined, particularly those typically prone to heat-related mortality. © 2016, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

TI  - Genetic Analysis of Yield and Yield-Attributing Traits for High Temperature Resistance in Tomato
VL  - 22
IS  - 6
SP  - 585-597
AB  - High temperatures can significantly reduce tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L) yield. A 5 × 5 diallel cross was used under high temperatures in a greenhouse to estimate combining ability and understand the genetic basis of tomato genotypes under heat stress. Additive gene action was predominant in governing most heat-tolerant morphological traits; yield was governed by nonadditive gene action. A cross involving high × high general combining ability (gca) or high × low gca had better specific combining ability (sca) effects. The genetic components and proportions studies showed heat tolerance was governed by nonadditive gene action and is a dominant trait. The parental variance (Vr) and parent–offspring covariance (Wr) relationship (Wr–Vr) indicated that heat tolerance traits were governed by overdominance. Significant correlation occurred between yield and yield-attributing traits. Heterosis was high for yield and most yield-attributing traits. Heterosis breeding involving crosses with high gca parents ‘CLN1621E × Nagcarlan’ and ‘BL1176 × Nagcarlan’ could be used to improve tomato for yield during heat stress. Selection for heat tolerance traits should be in early generations followed by selection for yield. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

VL  - 37
IS  - 6
SP  - 607-621
AB  - Lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson, are encountering increased abiotic stress and pest activity due to recent increases in temperature and changes in precipitation throughout their range. This tree species counters these threats by producing secondary metabolites, including phenolics and terpenoids. We examined foliar levels of lignin, soluble phenolics, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpenoids in 12 stands in British Columbia, Canada. We used these data to assess associations among foliar secondary metabolite levels and ecosystem, geographic, and climatic variables. Regressions were also performed to observe which combinations of variables best explained secondary metabolite variance. Stands of P. c. latifolia in the Coastal Western Hemlock and Interior Cedar/Hemlock biogeoclimatic zones had consistently greater foliar levels of almost all measured secondary metabolites than did other stands. Lignin was present in greater amounts in Boreal White/Black Spruce ecosystem (i. e., northern) stands than in southern stands, suggesting a role for this metabolite in pine survival in the boreal forest. Attempts to develop regression models with geographic and climatic variables to explain foliar secondary metabolite levels resulted in multiple models with similar predictive capability. Since foliar secondary metabolite levels appeared to vary most between stand ecosystem types and not as much due to geographic and climatic variables, metabolic profiles appeared best matched to the stress levels within local environments. It is unknown if differences in secondary metabolite levels are the result of genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, but results from this and other studies suggest that both are important. These results are interpreted in light of ongoing efforts to assist in the migration of certain populations of P. c. latifolia northward in an effort to counter predicted effects of climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).

TI  - Heat stress effects on farrowing rate in sows: Genetic parameter estimation using within-line and crossbred models
VL  - 90
IS  - 7
SP  - 2109-2119
AB  - The pork supply chain values steady and undisturbed piglet production. Fertilization and maintaining gestation in warm and hot climates is a challenge that can be potentially improved by selection. The objective of this study was to estimate 1) genetic variation for farrowing rate of sows in 2 dam lines and their reciprocal cross; 2) genetic variation for farrowing rate heat tolerance, which can be defined as the random regression slope of farrowing rate against increasing temperature at day of insemination, and the genetic correlation between farrowing rate and heat tolerance; 3) genetic correlation between farrowing rate in purebreds and crossbreds; and 4) genetic correlation between heat tolerance in purebreds and crossbreds. The estimates were based on 93,969 first insemination records per cycle from 24,456 sows inseminated between January 2003 and July 2008. These sows originated from a Dutch purebred Yorkshire dam line (D), an International purebred Large White dam line (ILW), and from their reciprocal crosses (RC) raised in Spain and Portugal. Within-line and crossbred models were used for variance component estimation. Heritability estimates for farrowing rate were 0.06, 0.07, and 0.02 using within-line models for D, ILW, and RC, respectively, and 0.07, 0.07, and 0.10 using the crossbred model, respectively. For farrowing rate, purebred-crossbred genetic correlations were 0.57 between D and RC and 0.50 between ILW and RC. When including heat tolerance in the within-line model, heritability estimates for farrowing rate were 0.05, 0.08, and 0.03 for D, ILW, and RC, respectively. Heritability for heat tolerance at 29.3°C was 0.04, 0.02, and 0.05 for D, ILW, and RC, respectively. Genetic correlations between farrowing rate and heat tolerance tended to be negative in crossbreds and ILW-line sows, implying selection for increased levels of production traits, such as growth and reproductive output, is likely to increase environmental sensitivity. This study shows that genetic selection for farrowing rate and heat tolerance is possible. However, when this selection is based solely on purebred information, the expected genetic progress on farrowing rate and heat tolerance in crossbreds (commercial animals) would be inconsequential. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

VL  - 80

SP  - 107-113
AB  - This study provides a descriptive analysis of the North Male, Maldives seven years after the 1998 bleaching disturbance to determine the state of the coral community composition, the recruitment community, evidence for recovery, and adaptation to thermal stress. Overall, hard coral cover recovered at a rate commonly reported in the literature but with high spatial variability and shifts in taxonomic composition. Massive Porites, Pavona, Synarea, and Goniopora were unusually common in both the recruit and adult communities. Coral recruitment was low and some coral taxa, namely Tubipora, Seriatopora, and Stylophora, were rarer than expected. A study of the bleaching response to a thermal anomaly in 2005 indicated that some taxa, including Leptoria, Platygyra, Favites, Fungia, Hydnophora, and Galaxea astreata, bleached as predicted while others, including Acropora, Pocillopora, branching Porites, Montipora, Stylophora, and Alveopora, bleached less than predicted. This indicates variable-adaptation potentials among the taxa and considerable potential for ecological reorganization of the coral community. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SP  - 537-542
AB  - The quality of the parts manufactured by selective laser melting is significantly influenced by the transient temperature distribution, which is associated with the process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, hatch distance and powder layer thickness. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the transient temperature distribution and analyze the effect of the laser power and scan speed on the depth of the melt pool. The modelling results show that the temperature becomes higher when the power increases and the higher scan speed leads to larger temperature gradient. In addition, the increasing trend of the depth becomes slow gradually with the ascending of the power and the depth decreases almost linearly after the laser scan speed is raised. © Copyright 2016 by Pro-AM 2016 Organizers.

TI  - Stimulating tight gas reservoirs: Hydro fracturing in offshore HPHT gas fields by GSPC, India
VL  - 1
SP  - 111-125
AB  - KG basin in the Eastern Offshore region of India is one of the most complex heterogeneous HPHT reservoirs in the world. Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) operator of the Deen Dayal West Field of KG Basin has successfully performed one of the first of its kind Hydraulic Fracturing (HF) job in world under hostile offshore environment and HPHT conditions in complex inter-bedded gas reservoir. The pressure ranged from 11000 psi to 12500 psi and the bottom hole temperature ranged from 350° F to 420° F. This paper deals with designing from scratch and executing hydraulic fracturing stimulation jobs in the said field by GSPC. It shares the results of the jobs and lessons learnt. The reservoir is sandstone with inter-bedded clay with many gas sands having close proximity to water sands. Petrophysical and reservoir data analysis indicated that the tight reservoir had to be stimulated by HF to optimise productivity. The design phase included comprehensive data gathering, log analysis, target zone selection, tailoring of HF design, finalization of specific fluid recipe for each target zone. Extensive petrophysical modelling was done to identify hydrocarbon bearing zones and underlying water bearing zones, thus the potential candidates for HF. The harsh offshore environment off the Eastern Coast of India, posed a huge logistic hurdle and the HPHT conditions led to various technological limitations in frac fluid selection, maintaining rheology at higher temperatures, proppant selection, constricting fluid damaging properties, pumping capability etc. The HF modelling efforts quantified the expected proppant distribution, propped width, individual fluid stage temperatures and the expected treatment pressure. The designs were developed to accommodate about 100 m of effectively propped fracture length (tip to tip). The stress profile and the proximity of the potential water zone around the gas zones were tested with frac design. Along with HF modelling, extensive lab evaluations of rock mechanics, geomechanics, mineralogy (XRD) as well as frac fluid stability and proppant pack conductivity at expected downhole temperature of 400° F were undertaken. Formation cores were extensively tested for core-frac fluid compatibility with regain gas permeability test, Brinell hardness test, etc. to optimise fluid composition. Rock - frac fluid - proppant interaction was studied to measure effect of frac fluid on proppant pack permeability and proppant embedment. The paper aims at providing an insight to the procedures practiced and the technology used for the stimulation of a tight gas offshore reservoir with HPHT conditions. The results and lessons learned from port frac study as shared in the paper would help the operators worldwide to plan and develop a complex offshore HPHT tight gas field.

VL  - 118
SP  - 60-71
AB  - Estuarine-resident fishes are highly susceptible to the effects of environmental and anthropogenic impacts on their assemblages and habitats. We investigated the distribution, movement and spawning behaviour of estuary perch, Macquaria colonorum, in response to selected environmental variables using an acoustic telemetry array in a large tidal river in south-eastern (SE) Australia. Adult M. colonorum were monitored for up to two years, covering two consecutive spawning periods between September 2007 and 2009. Salinity, water temperature and river flows all had a significant relationship with their estuarine distribution. In particular, large-scale movements were influenced by large freshwater inflow events and the resultant reduction in salinity levels, together with the seasonal cooling and warming trends in water temperatures associated with spawning behaviour. During the winter months, male and female M. colonorum migrated from their upper estuarine home ranges to the lower estuarine spawning grounds in synchrony, with numbers of individual visits by both sexes consistently higher in the 'wetter' winter/spring period of 2008. Location, arrival, departure and occupation time within the spawning grounds were similar between sexes and years. Both resident and migrating M. colonorum exhibited strong diel, and to a lesser extent, tidal behavioural patterns, with fish more likely to be detected at night and during the ebb tides. It is postulated that the effect of environmental fluctuations on the distribution and movement of M. colonorum is influenced by behavioural mechanisms in response to osmoregulatory stress, predator-prey interactions and reproductive activity. The results also demonstrate the importance of accounting for autocorrelation inherent in telemetry data, and for developing management strategies that are more robust to the effect of future climate trends on estuarine fish populations.

VL  - 84

AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization of peptides was investigated using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. In each experiment, a set of mass spectra was collected by repetitive irradiation of a spot on a sample. Even though shot-to-shot variation in spectral pattern was significant, it was reproducible for different spots and samples. Each spectrum was tagged with the temperature in the early plume (Tearly) estimated through kinetic analysis of the peptide ion survival probability. Tearly decreased as the shot continued because the thermal conduction got more efficient as the sample got thinner. From each spectral set collected under various experimental conditions, a spectrum tagged with a particular T early was selected. Then, patterns of the spectra thus selected were the same. The reaction quotient for the matrix-to-peptide proton transfer determined at a specified Tearly was independent of the sample composition, indicating quasi-thermal equilibrium for this reaction. Furthermore, the van't Hoff plots were linear, also indicating quasi-thermal equilibrium. This, together with the thermal kinetics for the fragmentation of peptide and matrix ions, is responsible for the reproducibility of the mass spectral pattern at a specified Tearly. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Thermoregulatory behavior and oxygen consumption of Octopus mimus paralarvae: The effect of age
VL  - 38
IS  - 2
SP  - 86-91
AB  - Octopus mimus is an important cephalopod species in the coastal zone of Peru and Chile that is exposed to temperature variations from time to time due to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes when surface temperatures can reach 24 degrees C, 6 degrees C above typical temperatures in their habitat. The relationships between temperature and food availability are important factors that determine the recruitment of juveniles into the O. mimus population. The present study was to evaluate the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and the age of paralarvae (summer population) to determine whether changes in this behavior occur during internal yolk consumption, making larvae more vulnerable to environmental temperature change. Oxygen consumption of paralarvae when 1-4 d old was determined to establish if respiration could be used to monitor the physiological changes that occur during yolk consumption. Horizontal thermal selection (17-30 degrees C), critical thermal maxima (CTMax), minima (CTMin), and oxygen consumption experiments were conducted with fasting paralarvae 1-4 d old at 20 degrees C. Preferred temperatures were dependent on the age of O. mimus paralarvae. One day old paralarvae selected a temperature 1.1 degrees C (23.4 degrees C) higher than 2 - 4 d old paralarvae (22.3 degrees C). The CTMax of paralarvae increased with age with values of 31.9 +/- 1.1 degrees C in 1-d-olds and 33.4 +/- 0.3 to 4-d-olds. CTMin also changed with age with low values in 2-d-old paralarvae (9.1 +/- 1.3 degrees C) and 11.9 +/- 0.9 degrees C in 4-d-old animals. The temperature tolerance range of paralarvae was age-dependent (TTD=difference between CTMax and CTMin) with higher values in 2 and 3 d old paralarvae (25-26 degrees C) as compared to 1 d old (23.1 degrees C) and 4 d old animals (22.7 degrees C). Oxygen consumption was not affected by the age of paralarvae, suggesting that mechanisms exist that compensate their metabloism until at least 4 d of age. The temperature tolerance range of a planktonic paralarvae of octopus species is presented for the first time. This range was dependent on the age of paralarvae, and so rendered the paralarvae more vunerable to a combination of high temperature and food deprivation during first days of life. Results in the present study provide evidence that O. mimus could be under ecological pressure if a climate change causes increased or decreased temperatures into their distribution range.

VL  - 51

AB  - Experiments were carried out to optimize the process parameters for production of papaya powder using foam-mat drying. Papaya pulp was foamed by incorporating methyl cellulose (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 %, w/w), glycerol-mono-stearate (1, 2, 3 and 4 %, w/w) and egg white (5, 10, 15 and 20 %, w/w) as foaming agents. The maximum stable foam formation was 72, 90 and 125% at 0.75 % methyl cellulose, 3 % glycerol-mono-stearate and 15 % egg white respectively with 9°Brix pulp and whipping time of 20 min. The foamed pulp was dried at air temperature of 60, 65 and 70 °C with foam thickness of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm in a batch type cabinet dryer. The drying time required for foamed papaya pulp was lower than non-foamed pulp at all selected temperatures. Biochemical analysis results showed a significant reduction in ascorbic acid, β-carotene and total sugars in the foamed papaya dried product at higher foam thickness (6, 8 and 10 mm) and temperature (65 and 70 °C due to destruction at higher drying temperature and increasing time. There was no significant change in other biochemical constituents such as pH and acidity. The organoleptic and sensory evaluation of the quality attributes of papaya powder obtained from the pulp of 9°Brix added with 3 % glycerol-mono-stearate, whipped for 20 min and dried with a foam thickness of 4 mm at a temperature of 60 °C was found to be optimum to produce the foam-mat dried papaya powder. © 2012, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 855-864
AB  - Noticeable changes in global temperatures, climate and ocean carbon chemistry are the result of carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphere. This increase has been mitigated by the oceans capacity to absorb one-fourth of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, although this CO2 intake affects oceans carbonate chemistry [i.e., ocean acidification—(OA)]. The detrimental effect of OA in the development and shell formation has been studied in several species of bivalves, although no information is available on the wedge shell Donaxtrunculus, a gastronomically appreciated species and an important economical resource in several southern European countries. We evaluated the effect of pCO2 increase on hatching and early life stages of D.trunculus, considering two ocean acidification scenarios (ΔpH −0.3 and ΔpH −0.6). Our results showed that elevated pCO2 caused a delay in hatching into D-larvae and reduced larvae survival. In the extreme scenario (ΔpH −0.6), some trochophore larvae persisted to day 9 of the experiment and more abnormal larvae were produced than in the ΔpH −0.3 and control treatments. At day 5, normal veligers under extreme acidification were smaller than in other treatments, but by day 9, these differences were attenuated and the average size of normal D-larvae varied inversely to the pH gradient. Possible underlying mechanisms for these complex response patterns are discussed, including the existence of phenotypic plasticity or genetic pre-adaptive capacity in this D.trunculus population to cope with future environmental changes. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Effects of diapause and cold acclimation on egg ultrastructure: New insights into the cold hardiness mechanisms of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 142-150
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae, SKUSE), is an important threat to public health due to its rapid spread and its potential as a vector. The eggs of Ae. albopictus are the most cold resistant life stage and thus, the cold hardiness of eggs is used to predict the future occurrence of the species in distribution models. However, the mechanism of cold hardiness has yet to be revealed. To address this question, we analyzed the layers of diapausing and cold acclimatized eggs of a temperate population of Ae. albopictus in a full factorial test design using transmission electron microscopy. We reviewed the hypotheses that a thickened wax layer or chorion is the cause of cold hardiness but found no evidence. As a result of the induced diapause, the thickness of the dark endochorion as a layer of high electron density and thus an assumed location for waxes was decreasing. We therefore hypothesized a qualitative alteration of the wax layer due to compaction. Cold acclimation was causing an increase in the thickness of the middle serosa cuticle indicating a detachment of serosa membrane from the endochorion as a potential adaptation strategy to isolate inoculating ice formations in the inter-membranous space. © 2016 The Society for Vector Ecology.

AB  - To select a most desired mix proportion that meets required performances according to the quality of recycled aggregate, a large number of experimental works must be carried out. This paper proposed a new design method for the mix proportion of recycled aggregate concrete to reduce the number of trial mixes. Genetic algorithm is adapted for the method, which has been an optimization technique to solve the multicriteria problem through the simulated biological evolutionary process. Fitness functions for the required properties of concrete such as slump, density, strength, elastic modulus, carbonation resistance, price and carbon dioxide emission were developed based on statistical analysis on conventional data or adapted from various early studies. Then these fitness functions were applied in the genetic algorithm. As a result, several optimum mix proportions for recycled aggregate concrete that meets required performances were obtained.

TI  - Repeatability and correlation of physiological traits: Do ectotherms have a “thermal type”?
VL  - 7
IS  - 2
SP  - 710-719
AB  - Across a range of taxa, individuals within a species differ in suites of correlated traits. These trait complexes, known as syndromes, can have dramatic evolutionary consequences as they do not evolve independently but rather as a unit. Current research focuses primarily on syndromes relating to aspects of behavior and life history. What is less clear is whether physiological traits also form a syndrome. We measured 10 thermal traits in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to test this idea. Repeatability was calculated and their across-context correlations evaluated. Our results were in alignment with our predictions in that individual thermal traits varied consistently and were structured into a physiological syndrome, which we are referring to as the thermal behavior syndrome (TBS). Within this syndrome, lizards exhibited a “thermal type” with each being ranked along a cold–hot continuum. Hot types had faster sprint speeds and higher preferred body temperatures, whereas the opposite was true for cold types. We conclude that physiological traits may evolve as a single unit driven by the need to maintain optimal temperatures that enable fitness-related behaviors to be maximized. � 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Portuguese native Artemia parthenogenetica and Artemia franciscana survival under different abiotic conditions
VL  - 440
SP  - 81-89
AB  - There are currently only two places in Portugal were native Artemia parthenogenetica can still be found. All other known populations have been eradicated by the invasive species Artemia franciscana, which has caused great losses of Artemia biodiversity in the Mediterranean region. The diploid strains found at the Portuguese salines are therefore of high conservation value. This study aims to assess the survival of these native A. parthenogenetica strains and of A. franciscana under a variety of environmental conditions. The effects of water temperature and salinity, of photoperiod and food supply (shortage) were studied in an experimental setup. The Portuguese parthenogenetic Artemia populations showed great variability in their physiological response to different abiotic conditions, suggesting possible local adaptations in response to different selective pressures experienced. For most of the conditions studied A. franciscana outcompeted the Artemia strain from Aveiro, whereas the strain from Rio Maior was more resistant than the A. franciscana under conditions that were similar to its local habitat. Strain-specific resistance to chemical conditions, related to pollution, are appointed as a potential cause why A. franciscana did not successfully invade Aveiro saline. The saline of Rio Maior has possibly not yet been invaded due to the fitness of its local Artemia strain in combination with its inland location. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mortality of two size classes (<35 and >35 mm) of eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica when exposed to combinations of low salinity (1, 2, 3, and 4) for extended periods (up to 30 days) at summer water temperatures typical of the Virginia Chesapeake Bay subestuaries was examined. A critical salinity-temperature combination of less than two at greater than 28 degrees C for more than 1 wk exposure for oyster mortality is suggested. A review of limited historical salinity-temperature tolerance data suggest selection of local populations of oysters having differing salinity tolerances. Such selection may prove critical to persistence of low-salinity populations in the Chesapeake Bay subestuaries with projected climate change.

TI  - Multiple physiological responses to multiple environmental challenges: An individual approach
VL  - 53

SP  - 660-670
AB  - The injection of anthropogenically-produced CO2 into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in temperature and a decrease in pH at the surface of the oceans by 2100. Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO2 is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO2. The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise. © 2013 The Author.

TI  - Thermal inactivation and sublethal injury kinetics of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes in broth versus agar surface
VL  - 243
SP  - 70-77
AB  - The objective of the present study was to compare the thermal inactivation and sublethal injury kinetics of Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes in broth (suspended cells) and on solid surface (agar-seeded cells). A 3-strain cocktail of S. enterica or L. monocytogenes inoculated in broth or on agar was subjected to heating in a water bath at various set temperatures (55.0, 57.5 and 60.0 °C for S. enterica and 60.0, 62.5 and 65 °C for L. monocytogenes). The occurrence of sublethally injured cells was determined by comparing enumerations on nonselective (TSAYE) and selective (XLD or ALOA) media. Results showed that the inactivation curves obtained from selective media were log-linear, and significant shoulders (p < 0.05) were observed on some of the inactivation curves from TSAYE media. The D-values derived from the total population were higher than those from the uninjured cells. Generally, cells on agar surface exhibited higher heat resistance than those in broth. For S. enterica, cell injury increased with the exposure time, no difference was observed when treated at temperatures from 55.0 to 60.0 °C, while for L. monocytogenes, cell injury increased significantly with heating time and treatment temperature (from 60.0 to 65 °C). Moreover, the degree of sublethal injury affected by thermal treatment in broth or on agar surface depended upon the target microorganism. Higher proportions of injured S. enterica cells were observed for treatment in broth than on agar surface, while the opposite was found for L. monocytogenes. The provided information may be used to assess the efficacy of thermal treatment processes on surfaces for inactivation of S. enterica and L. monocytogenes, and it provides insight into the sublethally injured survival state of S. enterica and L. monocytogenes treated in liquid or on solid food. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To determine the optimal concentration and processing time of EMS mutation for suspension cells from Pinellia ternata. Method: Under four EMS concentration gradients (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%) and three processing time gradients (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 h), the suspension cells of P. ternata were mutagenized. Result and Conclusion: The results showed that the survival rate was significantly different under the different concentrations of EMS and the different processing time. In the same processing time, the EMS concentrations were increased, but the suspension cells survival rate decreased gradually. The optimum EMS concentration for the mutagenesis was 0.4% and the best processing time was 1 hour.

TI  - Channel morphology response to selective wood removals in a sand-laden Wisconsin trout stream
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 776-790
AB  - Large sand bed loads in trout stream headwaters can limit salmonid spawning habitat and reproductive success. This phenomenon has been observed in many northern Wisconsin watersheds, where historic logging practices are the likely source of the sediment loading. Presently, sediment transport is limited by abundant woody debris, causing channels to aggrade and bury gravels. We evaluated the impacts of a wood debris and beaver dam removal remediation strategy on fine sediment transport and exposure of the underlying gravel and cobble substrates in a second-order Lake Superior tributary. A 300-m treatment reach received selective wood removals and was compared with both an upstream 300-m reference reach receiving no alteration and a downstream reach to monitor the effects of transferred fine sediment. Physical channel measurements were taken before the wood removal process, with repeat sampling at 10 and 12 months posttreatment. The wood removal treatment resulted in a significant 25% narrowing of mean stream widths, a 32% increase in mean flow velocities, a 58% reduction in the sand bed load, and a 400% increase in the available coarse substrate across the channel. Grain size distributions coarsened noticeably from pre- to posttreatment. Water depth and temperature were not altered by the treatment, and the reference station physical measures were relatively unchanged over the 12-month study period. Immediately after the wood removal there was an observable pulse of sediment traveling through the downstream reach that increased the sand bed load, increased stream widths, and filled pools. However, these impacts diminished with time, and near-preremoval conditions had returned after 12 months. The wood removal treatment caused a significant reduction in sand content and enhanced the availability of salmonid spawning substrates. © American Fisheries Society 2010.

VL  - 7

SP  - 495-499
AB  - An optimised solar still prototype suitable for alcoholic distillation was designed and tested. Its design is different from the single slope conventional solar still. It consists of two compartments which are in communication by a slit. One of the two compartments contains an absorber. In a previous work, the area S of the absorber was 0.29 m2 and the slit’s width e was experimentally optimised. As for the prototype studied in the work, it was realised with the optimal width found in the previous work and an absorber area S equal to 0.965 m2. The energy exchanges within the still were studied, mainly the heat transfers by convection, evaporation-condensation and radiation. Then an experimental testing of the solar still was performed, both for water and alcoholic distillation. In the case of the water distillation, two days were selected. The temperature measurements allowed the calculation of the heat exchanges. The experimental productivity of the still was determined, as well as its efficiency. As for the alcoholic distillation, two days were also selected. The productivity was determined for the two compartments. The evolution of the alcohol rate of the distillates was also studied. © 2015 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.

TI  - Decline of genetic diversity of sessile oak at the retracting (xeric) limits
VL  - 70
IS  - 8
SP  - 835-844
AB  - Context: Genetic diversity of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) populations in Hungary was assessed close to the retracting, low-elevation, low-latitude (xeric) distribution limits. Objective: We aimed at tracing an assumed effect of climatic factors on genetic diversity, particularly at the southern, low elevation limits of distribution. Methods: Genetic diversity at isozyme-coding loci was analysed in populations, and related to the climate of the sites where the populations grow. A locus-wise analysis proved to be essential to follow responses. Results: A climate-related cline was found at seven isoenzyme-coding gene loci. Declining allelic numbers and heterozygosity indicated lower diversity at warmer and drier sites. The majority of loci were responsive to precipitation factors, others to temperature. Genetic clustering was neither related to geographic distance nor to random or historic effects. Conclusions: The results suggest that climatic stress may elicit a genetic diversity loss in populations, which may reduce their plasticity and adaptive potential. The selective pressure may override historic effects and gene flow. With respect to expected climate change, the correlation of diversity with some climatic factors gains specific importance. If supported by further investigations, the results might be utilised for reconsidering conservation strategies and rules for use of forest reproductive material. © 2013 INRA and Springer-Verlag France.

VL  - 73
IS  - 2
SP  - 221-225
AB  - Yakutia is a part of eastern Siberia, located in north-eastern Russia. The climate of this area is very harsh even by Siberian standards, and is characterized by the absolute temperature minimum, which is below -64.4 degrees C, and a long period of low temperatures reaching to a range between -47 and -55 degrees C. Despite such a severe climate, the fauna and flora of Yakutia present a considerably rich biodiversity, suggesting a high adaptation potential of the organisms in this area. In this study, 30 local species of insects belonging to Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera were selected to investigate cold adaptation. The identification of the cold adaptation strategy was based on the measurement of the insect body supercooling point (SCP) and hemolymph ice-nucleating activity. According to the data collected, there is a high incidence of freeze tolerant species among the insects found in Yakutsk area (Yakutsk, 62 degrees latitude, 130 degrees longitude): 93.3% of them were freeze tolerant, and only 6.7% were freeze avoiding. It is suggested that the evolution of cold hardiness in this region preferably develops for the selection of the strong freeze tolerance that allow the insects to survive extreme cold conditions.

TI  - Adapt, move or die – how will tropical coral reef fishes cope with ocean warming?
VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 566-577
AB  - Previous studies hailed thermal tolerance and the capacity for organisms to acclimate and adapt as the primary pathways for species survival under climate change. Here we challenge this theory. Over the past decade, more than 365 tropical stenothermal fish species have been documented moving poleward, away from ocean warming hotspots where temperatures 2–3 °C above long-term annual means can compromise critical physiological processes. We examined the capacity of a model species – a thermally sensitive coral reef fish, Chromis viridis (Pomacentridae) – to use preference behaviour to regulate its body temperature. Movement could potentially circumvent the physiological stress response associated with elevated temperatures and may be a strategy relied upon before genetic adaptation can be effectuated. Individuals were maintained at one of six temperatures (23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 °C) for at least 6 weeks. We compared the relative importance of acclimation temperature to changes in upper critical thermal limits, aerobic metabolic scope and thermal preference. While acclimation temperature positively affected the upper critical thermal limit, neither aerobic metabolic scope nor thermal preference exhibited such plasticity. Importantly, when given the choice to stay in a habitat reflecting their acclimation temperatures or relocate, fish acclimated to end-of-century predicted temperatures (i.e. 31 or 33 °C) preferentially sought out cooler temperatures, those equivalent to long-term summer averages in their natural habitats (~29 °C). This was also the temperature providing the greatest aerobic metabolic scope and body condition across all treatments. Consequently, acclimation can confer plasticity in some performance traits, but may be an unreliable indicator of the ultimate survival and distribution of mobile stenothermal species under global warming. Conversely, thermal preference can arise long before, and remain long after, the harmful effects of elevated ocean temperatures take hold and may be the primary driver of the escalating poleward migration of species. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Plausible rice yield losses under future climate warming
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Rice is the staple food for more than 50% of the world's population 1-3. Reliable prediction of changes in rice yield is thus central for maintaining global food security. This is an extraordinary challenge. Here, we compare the sensitivity of rice yield to temperature increase derived from field warming experiments and three modelling approaches: statistical models, local crop models and global gridded crop models. Field warming experiments produce a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of -5.2 ± 1.4% K-1. Local crop models give a similar sensitivity (-6.3 ± 0.4% K-1), but statistical and global gridded crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (-0.8 ± 0.3% and -2.4 ± 3.7% K-1, respectively). Using data from field warming experiments, we further propose a conditional probability approach to constrain the large range of global gridded crop model results for the future yield changes in response to warming by the end of the century (from -1.3% to -9.3% K-1). The constraint implies a more negative response to warming (-8.3 ± 1.4% K-1) and reduces the spread of the model ensemble by 33%. This yield reduction exceeds that estimated by the International Food Policy Research Institute assessment (-4.2 to -6.4% K-1) (ref. 4). Our study suggests that without CO2 fertilization, effective adaptation and genetic improvement, severe rice yield losses are plausible under intensive climate warming scenarios. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - The normal development of Platynereis dumerilii (Nereididae, Annelida)
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: The polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii is an emerging model organism for the study of molecular developmental processes, evolution, neurobiology and marine biology. Annelids belong to the Lophotrochozoa, the so far understudied third major branch of bilaterian animals besides deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. P. dumerilii has proven highly relevant to explore ancient bilaterian conditions via comparison to the deuterostomes, because it has accumulated less evolutionary change than conventional ecdysozoan models. Previous staging was mainly referring to hours post fertilization but did not allow matching stages between studies performed at (even slightly) different temperatures. To overcome this, and to provide a first comprehensive description of P. dumerilii normal development, a temperature-independent staging system is needed.Results: Platynereis dumerilii normal development is subdivided into 16 stages, starting with the zygote and ending with the death of the mature worms after delivering their gametes. The stages described can be easily identified by conventional light microscopy or even by dissecting scope. Developmental landmarks such as the beginning of phototaxis, the visibility of the stomodeal opening and of the chaetae, the first occurrence of the ciliary bands, the formation of the parapodia, the extension of antennae and cirri, the onset of feeding and other characteristics are used to define different developmental stages. The morphology of all larval stages as well as of juveniles and adults is documented by light microscopy. We also provide an overview of important steps in the development of the nervous system and of the musculature, using fluorescent labeling techniques and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Timing of each developmental stage refers to hours post fertilization at 18 ± 0.1°C. For comparison, we determined the pace of development of larvae raised at 14°C, 16°C, 20°C, 25°C, 28°C and 30°C. A staging ontology representing the comprehensive list of developmental stages of P. dumerilii is available online.Conclusions: Our atlas of Platynereis dumerilii normal development represents an important resource for the growing Platynereis community and can also be applied to other nereidid annelids. © 2010 Fischer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Spatial variation in growth, maturation schedules and reproductive investment of female sole Solea solea in the Northeast Atlantic
VL  - 84
SP  - 109-121
AB  - Latitudinal variation in life-history traits is often explained by phenotypically plastic responses or local adaptations to different thermal regimes. We compared growth, maturation schedules and reproductive investment of female sole Solea solea between 8 populations, covering much of the species' distribution in northern Europe, with respect to thermal gradients. An energy allocation model was fitted to size-age data, and probabilistic maturation reaction norms were estimated from size-age-maturity data. We found that northern populations from colder environments had higher rates of energy acquisition and reproductive investment, an intrinsic tendency to mature earlier, and had smaller asymptotic sizes than southern populations from warmer environments. Consequently, growth rate was higher before maturation but lower after maturation in the north compared to the south. This is opposite to Bergmann's rule according to which slower growth, delayed maturation and larger asymptotic sizes are usually observed at lower temperatures. The observed patterns could indicate strong countergradient thermal adaptation for rapid growth and development as well as sustained fecundity in the north, or indicate a response to other selection pressures correlated with the thermal gradient. Potentially higher mortality in northern populations during cold winters might be one of the key drivers of the observed geographical variation in growth and maturation of sole.

VL  - 17

AB  - Experimental animal research has been pivotal in the development of clinical liver transplantation (LTx). Results obtained in these experiments have been applied in clinic and clinical challenges have been scrutinized in animal laboratories. Porcine model is an optimal model in the field of experimental LTx research. Here, we present the various techniques of experimental LTx in the porcine model in detail. Different methods and modifications have been described. The following major steps have been discussed in detail: donor liver preparation, recipient operation including recipient hepatectomy, and reconstruction phase, including the reconstruction of suprahepatic inferior vena cava (SHIVC), portal vein (PV), infrahepatic inferior vena cava (IHIVC), hepatic artery (HA) and bile duct (BD). IHIVC and SHIVC are anastomosed end to end directly or with the use of prosthesis anastomosed side to side. The PV anastomosis is performed end to end between donor and recipient PV, Cuff method or Stump method. Arterialization has been accomplished via carrel patch or donor HA end to end with recipient HA. There are three major methods for reconstruction of BD: end to end or end to side choledochocholedochostomy or choledojejunostomy with Roux-en-Y jejunal loop. Each method has advantages and disadvantages regarding the objectives of the study; the most physiological techniques may be preferred for long-term survival studies, while the faster techniques may be selected for experimentations aiming the direct postoperative phase. © Ann Transplant, 2012.

AB  - Rolling bearings play an important role in the design of gear transmissions. For a successful process, the best type and size of the rolling bearings has to be defined in an early stage of development. H owever, high operational reliability and economic viability depends on durability, as well as on the frictional and temperature behavior of the rolling bearings. Practical methods to calculate the loss torque of rolling bearings according to the state of the art partly show significant differences among each other. In addition, the calculated loss torques frequently show high deviations compared to measured values in practice. Thus, comprehensive experimental investigations at the FZG bearing power loss test rig have been carried out in a collective FVA research project investigating the losses and temperatures of rolling bearings. In this paper, the principle of the FZG bearing power loss test rig is shown and selected results of the experimental investigations are compared to the calculation methods according to state of the art. Finally, measures for an improved estimation of the loss torque of rolling bearings are given. © VDI Verlag GmbH Düsseldorf 2017.

VL  - 199

SP  - 793-807
AB  - Understanding adaptive genetic responses to climate change is a main challenge for preserving biological diversity. Successful predictive models for climate-driven range shifts of species depend on the integration of information on adaptation, including that derived from genomic studies. Long-lived forest trees can experience substantial environmental change across generations, which results in a much more prominent adaptation lag than in annual species. Here, we show that candidate-gene SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) can be used as predictors of maladaptation to climate in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Aiton), an outcrossing long-lived keystone tree. A set of 18 SNPs potentially associated with climate, 5 of them involving amino acid-changing variants, were retained after performing logistic regression, latent factor mixed models, and Bayesian analyses of SNP–climate correlations. These relationships identified temperature as an important adaptive driver in maritime pine and highlighted that selective forces are operating differentially in geographically discrete gene pools. The frequency of the locally advantageous alleles at these selected loci was strongly correlated with survival in a common garden under extreme (hot and dry) climate conditions, which suggests that candidate-gene SNPs can be used to forecast the likely destiny of natural forest ecosystems under climate change scenarios. Differential levels of forest decline are anticipated for distinct maritime pine gene pools. Geographically defined molecular proxies for climate adaptation will thus critically enhance the predictive power of range-shift models and help establish mitigation measures for long-lived keystone forest trees in the face of impending climate change. © 2015 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - Fingerling Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus were held in water recirculating systems for 4–5 weeks under selected combinations of temperature and salinity: 30°C and 35‰ (reference environment), 34°C and 45‰, or 34°C and 55‰. At the end of the culture period, condition factor, hematocrit, plasma osmolality, plasma lactate concentration, plasma glucose concentration, and liver glycogen content were determined. Responses of fish in the warm, hypersaline treatments did not differ significantly from fish in the reference treatment. Based on the results of this study, juvenile Red Drum can tolerate warm, hypersaline conditions for several weeks with no apparent detrimental effects if slowly acclimated to environmental temperature and salinity as long as food is not limiting and other water quality characteristics are acceptable.

VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SP  - 895-907
AB  - The spatial and seasonal alteration in a battery of biomarkers responses (enzymatic activity of glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidation) were investigated to assess the metal derived effects in clam (Ruditapes decussatus) gills, collected from Tunis lagoon (Tunisia). Trace metals (Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) concentrations were assessed seasonally in sediments and tissues of R. decussatus from three different sites (S1, S2 and S3). Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) analysis showed a spatio-temporal variation of metal uptake rates in clams through sediments. Likewise, the multibiomarker approach enabled a time-site trend differentiation between sites with distinctive degrees of anthropogenic contamination. Site S2 was identified as the most impacted region due to the presence of different contamination sources (shipping and industrial activities). The results suggest that biomarker's seasonal variation arises from a complex interaction between environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity) and probably biological factors (mainly the reproduction process) along with anthropogenic pressure. The general biological response measured with the IBR index at all the sampling sites revealed the highest metabolic stress in summer. The combined effects of metal contamination and increased temperature and salinity in summer appear to induce the highest metabolic adaptation response. The selected biomarkers provided an integrated response, which is useful for the assessment of the combined effects of metal contamination and abiotic parameters in clams and the environmental status of coastal lagoon ecosystem. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Survivability of bacteria Salmonella Enteritidis in surface water
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
SP  - 2738-2749
AB  - The most frequent cause of salmonelloses are food poisonings. However, many studies prove the occurrence and possibility of survival of rods of the genus Salmonella in lakes. The bacteria are often isolated from water sources, which act as a bacterial reservoir. Rods of Salmonella are constantly released to the environment, which results in infections of people and animals. In comparison with other microorganisms, bacteria of the genus Salmonella are characterized by a high survival rate in water environments, particularly in waters of highly eutrophicated lakes. Temperature, the shortage of nutrients, osmotic stress and light has the most negative effect on their survival. Due to its common accessibility, water is an environment which plays an essential role in spread of diseases. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of selected temperatures on the survival rate of bacilli Salmonella Enteritidis, and the dynamics of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time in bathing waters used for recreation, tested under laboratory conditions. As well as to determine the dynamic of quantitative changes of the bacteria in time under laboratory conditions. The samples for the study were collected from a lake in the Bydgoszcz district. In the conducted experiment it was indicated that Salmonella Enteritidis survived longer in water at 4 degrees C (51 days), as compared with 20 degrees C (39 days). In the present study the elimination rate of bacteria population, according to the analysis of regression, amounted to 0.16 log daily at 4 degrees C, whereas at 20 degrees C it assumed a value of 0.15 log daily. Consequently, it may be concluded that a lower temperature has a more stabilizing effect on rods of the genus Salmonella.

TI  - Bacterial growth at the high concentrations of magnesium sulfate found in martian soils
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SP  - 98-106
AB  - The martian surface environment exhibits extremes of salinity, temperature, desiccation, and radiation that would make it difficult for terrestrial microbes to survive. Recent evidence suggests that martian soils contain high concentrations of MgSO 4 minerals. Through warming of the soils, meltwater derived from subterranean ice-rich regolith may exist for an extended period of time and thus allow the propagation of terrestrial microbes and create significant bioburden at the near surface of Mars. The current report demonstrates that halotolerant bacteria from the Great Salt Plains (GSP) of Oklahoma are capable of growing at high concentrations of MgSO 4 in the form of 2 M solutions of epsomite. The epsotolerance of isolates in the GSP bacterial collection was determined, with 35% growing at 2 M MgSO 4. There was a complex physiological response to mixtures of MgSO 4 and NaCl coupled with other environmental stressors. Growth also was measured at 1 M concentrations of other magnesium and sulfate salts. The complex responses may be partially explained by the pattern of chaotropicity observed for high-salt solutions as measured by agar gelation temperature. Select isolates could grow at the high salt concentrations and low temperatures found on Mars. Survival during repetitive freeze-thaw or drying-rewetting cycles was used as other measures of potential success on the martian surface. Our results indicate that terrestrial microbes might survive under the high-salt, low-temperature, anaerobic conditions on Mars and present significant potential for forward contamination. Stringent planetary protection requirements are needed for future life-detection missions to Mars. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

TI  - Long-term variations in body length and age at maturity of the small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis Bleeker, 1877) in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, China
VL  - 110
IS  - 1
SP  - 67-74
AB  - This study focused on changes in the maturation schedules, as depicted in maturity ogives, of female small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea during the 1960-2010 spawning seasons. The two stocks studied were the northern Yellow Sea-Bohai Sea stock (the NYBS, n = 1283) and the southern Yellow Sea stock (the SYS, n=2024). Body length (L-50) and age at median sexual maturity (A(50)) were estimated by an arcsin-square-root (ASR) transformative logistic model and an inverse von Bertalanffy growth function, respectively. The results show that L-50 decreased from 152.8 mm to 105.3 mm between 1960 and 2003-2005 in the NYBS and from 184.4 mm to 110.1 mm between 1960 and 2010 in the SYS. Over the same period, A(50) decreased from approximately 1.5 years in the NYBS and 2.4 years in the SYS to about 1 year in both stocks. Significant intrastock changes (P < 0.01) in length-maturation curves were found in both stocks over long time periods (>= 4 years); however, there were no significant changes (P > 0.05) over short time intervals (<4 years). Significant interstock changes (P < 0.01) were observed in length-maturation curves in corresponding sampling years. Significant positive correlations were found between the instantaneous rate of maturation (delta) and the growth potential index (omega) in the NYBS and between L-50 and asymptotic body length (L-infinity) in the SYS. Significant negative correlations were found between L-50 and the sea surface temperature (SST) daily rise rate in the NYBS and between delta and the mean monthly SST in the SYS. These correlations suggest that declines in length and age at maturation primarily reflect changes in growth associated with overfishing and rising SST. Additionally, a fisheries-induced evolutionary response has contributed to changes in maturation schedules in both stocks. The principal pressures are the stress of continuously higher fishing intensity and an increasing proportion of yearling fish in the catches over time. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 36

SP  - 1881-1889
AB  - The rice leaf roller Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) is one of the most serious pests ofrice production in Asia.The speciesis a high-altitude nocturnal windborne migrant. The mothsmigrateannually from southern to northern China in spring and summer, and then return to southern China in the fall. The migration involves a series of nighttime flights rather than one continuous flight. Mothsusually land at dawn and take-off againthe following evening. Our previous studyreported their considerablecapacity to re-emigrate. However, the response of re-emigrating moths to ambient temperaturesremains unclear. The flight and re-emigration performance of C. medinalis in relation to temperature and their sex were examined in this studyby tethered flight with computer-based flight mills at different temperatures (20-29°C) in 2-d-old virgin females and males when take-off behavior occurred for the first time.The selection and adaptability of the flight process to temperature can help reveal the dynamic distribution and flight behavioral mechanisms of aerial migratory insects. The results showed that ambient temperature significantly influenced the re-emigratory flight performance of C. medinalis, although flight activities were normal between 20°C and 29°C.Not all the measured flight parameters were significantly different between females and males at the same temperatures. The longest flight duration, fastest flight speed, greatest flight distance, and highest take-off proportion and re-emigration times were recorded at 26°C. Adults could fly for 3.42 successive nights on average, andthe maximum flight duration of six nights was observed at 26°C. However, most individuals could only complete a continuous flight for one night and could not take off for the second night at theother three temperatures. Although the re-emigration performance at 20°C or 23°C was similar to that at 29°C, different effects on the flight behavior were observed. The flight velocity was greatly reduced at low temperatures, which shortened the total flight distance. The mortality rate of moths after successive passive flights was significantly higher at 29°C than at the other temperatures, thereby showing that high temperatures had a greater influence on the survival rate of moths engaging in long-duration flights than low temperatures. Active selection behavior for optimal flight temperature (i.e. the flight altitude) was exhibited by the airborne migrants to avoid or reduce unnecessary energy costsduring migration wheneverpossible. We suggest that re-emigration flight can be momentarily terminated if the environmental temperature is significantly lower than the optimal flight temperature for C. medinalis. Airborne migrants may choose the most optimal flight altitudefor different migration seasons, according to the weather system on a small or moderate scale. © 2016, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - We have characterised a small, high-efficiency diesel generator selected to power remote experiments on the Antarctic plateau at altitudes of up to 5000 m. We describe the design of an environmental chamber to simulate these high altitudes and present an experimental investigation of the engine operation at high altitude on Jet A-I. comparing this to the engine's performance at sea level. Although attention must be paid to the provision of adequate cooling, no modification to the engine itself is required. Our final system provides very high reliability and produces 1500 W of electrical power with a fuel consumption of 280 g k Wh(-1). A bank of ultracapacitors is used to start the engine in the cold environment of Antarctica. We describe the low-temperature operation and survival tests that we performed on the ultracapacitors and the engine. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VL  - 19

SP  - 386-395
AB  - Aim: Climate and habitat management are two key drivers for patterns of biodiversity, but little is known about relative importance, interactions and nonlinear effects of climate and management on species richness and trait variation of plants. Location: Alps (Germany). Methods: We studied patterns of species richness and pollination types in 34 alpine grasslands along an altitudinal climatic gradient comparing grazed, mown and non-managed grasslands. Two vegetation assessments were conducted in 2009 on ten 4-m2 plots per study site and per survey. Results: In total, 484 vascular plant species were recorded. Species richness peaked at intermediate temperatures and was highest in grazed grasslands compared with mown and non-managed grasslands. No significant interaction between management effects and climate was found. Species richness of insect-pollinated plants peaked at lower temperatures (higher altitudes) than species richness of wind-pollinated plant species. The proportion of wind-pollinated plants decreased with decreasing temperature, but the vegetation cover of wind-pollinated plants increased with decreasing temperature. Main conclusions: Our results indicate that managing alpine grasslands by extensive grazing maintains high plant diversity over the full subalpine gradient. Rising temperatures with climate change and an upward shift of the diversity peak of plants might result not only in reduced overall diversity because of reduced grassland area at higher altitudes but also in changed species composition and adaptive potential of pollination types. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Arthropod development’s response to temperature: A review and new software for modeling
VL  - 110
IS  - 6
SP  - 507-520
AB  - Among environmental factors, temperature has a direct and crucial influence on the key life processes of survival, development, reproduction, and movement of poikilothermic animals and hence their population dynamics. The lower and upper temperature thresholds and optimal temperature have ramifications for all major life processes, where within a specific range, a temperature change results in a proportional rise or fall of the rate of any given process. There are some basic approaches for modeling development response to temperature in arthropods. The oldest and most widely used model is a simple linear description of arthropod development in relation to temperature.The linear model forms the basis of the well-known thermal summation or degree-day (DD) approach to timing prediction. The second approach for predicting arthropod development rate is nonlinear mathematical models. However, given the fundamental role of thermal models in forecasting and integrated pest management programs, the main purpose of this paper was to facilitate the use of thermal models to estimate the developmental response of arthropods to temperature and select the appropriate model with a view to goodness-of-fit and generalizability by designing a user-friendly software. In this paper, the linear and most common nonlinear thermal models and the main criteria for selecting appropriate models are also reviewed. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Food processing is costly, potentially limiting the energy and time devoted to other essential functions such as locomotion or reproduction. In ectotherms, post-prandial thermophily, the selection of a warm environmental temperature after feeding, may be advantageous in minimizing the duration of this elevated cost. Although present in many vertebrate taxa, this behaviour had not previously been observed in invertebrates. Sanguivorous leeches ingest large blood meals that are costly to process and limit mobility until excess fluid can actively be expelled to reduce body volume. When presented with a temperature gradient from 10°C to 30°C, leeches select a temperature that is significantly warmer (24.3±0.9°C, n 5 6) than their acclimation temperature (Ta, 21°C). Unfed leeches preferred temperatures that were significantly cooler than ambient (12.8±0.9°C, n 5 6). This behavioural strategy is consistent with minimizing the time course of elevated post-feeding energy costs and reducing energy expenditure during fasting. Our observations raise the possibility that thermoregulatory behaviour of this type is an unrecognized feature of other invertebrate taxa. This journal is © 2011 The Royal Society.

VL  - 8

SP  - 9217-9225
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, a commonly found pathogen, can cause food poisoning and infections. Thus, it is necessary to develop analytical methods for the rapid screening of S. aureus in suspicious samples. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are widely used as affinity probes to selectively enrich target species from complex samples because of their high specific surface area and magnetic properties. The MNP surface should be functionalized to have the capability to target specific species. We herein propose a straightforward method to functionalize aluminum oxide-coated iron oxide (Fe3O4@Al2O3) MNPs with the peptide HHHHHHDEEGLFVD (D). The peptide D was comprised of three domains: polyhistidine (H6) used as the linker, DEE added as the spacer, and GLFVD used for targeting S. aureus. D was immobilized on the surface of Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs through H6-Al chelation. Our results showed that the D-functionalized Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs (D-Fe3O4 MNPs) possess the capability to target S. aureus. The selective trapping experiments were conducted under microwave-heating for only 60 s, and sufficient bacterial cells were trapped by the MNPs to be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). We demonstrated that the D-Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs combined with MALDI-MS can be used to rapidly characterize trace amounts of S. aureus in complex juice and egg samples. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Developing an applied extreme heat vulnerability index utilizing socioeconomic and environmental data
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-31
AB  - Extreme heat is a leading cause of weather-related fatalities worldwide. Emphasis is currently being placed on the development of spatially specific vulnerability models, which are useful for decision support during extreme heat events (EHE). Research results concerning such spatially-explicit models lead efforts in preparation and mitigation of heat-related vulnerability and potential adaptation. The presented research analyzes the 1995 Chicago EHE in the context of a socio-environmental hazards approach, and fosters the development of an extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI). The EHVI is a fused dataset consisting of census data and remotely sensed variables, which are examined in relation to geocoded mortality data. The presented analysis combines 25 well-known indicators of extreme risk into an applied index utilizing a principal components analysis. The developed EHVI presented a trend of higher rates of death in the highest risk zones to lower rates in lower zones of risk. The model explains nearly 80% of the total variance in the heat-health vulnerability variables utilized. This index could be utilized by city officials to assist in the mitigation of extreme heat events and is a further evolution of previously developed efforts. Our findings indicate extreme heat vulnerability models should likely be developed on a local level for a specific location, taking into account local variations in social and environmental vulnerability.

VL  - 157
IS  - 6
SP  - 1259-1269
AB  - Animals inhabiting hydrothermal vents and cold seeps face conditions that are challenging for survival. In particular, these two habitats are characterized by chronic hypoxia, sometimes reaching complete anoxia. The characteristics of the scaphognathite and gills were studied in four species of shrimp and three species of crabs from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, in order to highlight potential adaptations that could enhance oxygen acquisition in comparison with shallow-water relatives. All the vent and seep species studied here exhibit significantly larger scaphognathites, likely allowing more water to flow over their gills per stroke of this appendage. This is probably more energetically efficient that prolonged hyperventilation. In contrast to annelids, vent and seep decapods usually do not possess enlarged gills, a phenomenon likely due to the physical limitations imposed by the size of the gill chamber. In the vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata and the vent crab Bythograea thermydron, however, there is a significantly higher specific gill surface area linked to a higher number of lamellae per gram of gill. Again in contrast to annelids, the diffusion distance through the gills is not strikingly different between the vent shrimp Alvinocaris komaii and the shallow-water species Palaemon spp. This may indicate that the epithelium and cuticle of the decapod gills are already optimized for oxygen uptake and that reducing the thickness of these compartments is not physically possible without affecting the physical integrity of the gills. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 35
IS  - 3
SP  - 294-299
AB  - Refuges provide shelter from predators, and protection from exposure to the elements, as well as other fitness benefits to animals that use them. In ectotherms, thermal benefits may be a critical aspect of refuges. We investigated microhabitat characteristics of refuges selected by a heliothermic scincid lizard, Carlia rubrigularis, which uses rainforest edges as habitat. We approached lizards in the field, simulating a predator attack, and quantified the refuge type used, and effect of environmental temperatures (air temperature, substrate temperature and refuge substrate temperature) on the amount of time skinks remained in refuges after hiding (emergence time). In respone to our approach, lizards were most likely to flee into leaf litter, rather than into rocks or woody debris, and emergence time was dependent on refuge substrate temperature, and on refuge substrate temperature relative to substrate temperature outside the refuge. Lizards remained for longer periods in warmer refuges, and in refuges that were similar in temperature to outside. We examined lizard refuge choice in response to temperature and substrate type in large, semi-natural outdoor enclosures. We experimentally manipulated refuge habitat temperature available to lizards, and offered them equal areas of leaf litter, woody debris and rocks. When refuge habitat temperature was unmanipulated, lizards (85%) preferred leaf litter, as they did in the field. However, when we experimentally manipulated the temperature of the leaf litter by shading, most skinks (75%) changed their preferred refuge habitat from leaf litter to woody debris or rocks. These results suggest that temperature is a critical determinant of refuge habitat choice for these diurnal ectotherms, both when fleeing from predators and when selecting daytime retreats. © 2009 The Authors.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent respiratory toxicant that is lethal to most metazoans (including fishes) in micromolar concentrations, as demonstrated by mass kills following environmental spills. Nevertheless, a number of teleosts have adapted to, and thrive in, habitats with high ambient H2S concentrations as found, for example, at marine hydrothermal vents ("black smokers"), cold seeps, or in freshwater sulfide springs. Livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae) dominate amongst freshwater fishes inhabiting sulfide spring in the New World and are the most studied group of freshwater sulfide-dwellers. In this chapter, we identify targets of directional selection in sulfidic habitats and demonstrate how these affect different levels of biological organization (e.g., cellular functioning and molecular evolution, morphology and organ evolution, whole body performance and eco-physiological traits, life histories). We highlight multifarious selective regimes arising from correlated abiotic stressors (like hypoxia) and altered ecological parameters (like truncated ecological communities and altered predatory regimes). Finally, we discuss the evidence for replicated ecological speciation as a result of independent evolutionary transitions in different lineages of poeciliids into sulfide waters, and we summarize studies examining the question of how local adaptation translates into the emergence of reproductive isolation due to selection against non-adapted individuals migrating between habitat types. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a respiratory toxicant that creates extreme environments tolerated by few organisms. H2S is also produced endogenously by metazoans and plays a role in cell signaling. The mechanisms of H2S toxicity and its physiological functions serve as a basis to discuss the multifarious strategies that allow animals to survive in H2S-rich environments. Despite their toxicity, H2S-rich environments also provide ecological opportunities, and complex selective regimes of covarying abiotic and biotic factors drive trait evolution in organisms inhabiting H2S-rich environments. Furthermore, adaptation to H2S-rich environments can drive speciation, giving rise to biodiversity hot spots with high levels of endemism in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and freshwater sulfide springs. The diversity of H2S-rich environments and their inhabitants provides ideal systems for comparative studies of the effects of a clear-cut source of selection across vast geographic and phylogenetic scales, ultimately informing our understanding of how environmental stressors affect ecological and evolutionary processes. © 2016 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - A commercial silica water selective membrane was evaluated experimentally. Additionally, its potential application in the synthesis of 1,1-diethoxybutane was studied from the process intensification point of view. The membrane performance was evaluated experimentally, at different compositions and temperatures, by measuring the flux and permeate composition of binary and ternary mixtures. The effect of composition and temperature on the species permeances was also studied. For ethanol and butyraldehyde the permeances depend only on the temperature, following an Arrhenius equation; while for the water, its permeance depends on both temperature and composition, following a modified Arrhenius equation. Altogether, the permeation data obtained in the present work combined with reaction and adsorption data from previous works allowed a comparison, by simulation, between the PermSMBR and simulated moving bed reactor (SMBR) for the synthesis of 1,1-diethoxybutane. Results showed that the PermSMBR, operating at 50°C, presents an improvement of about 7% in both productivity (34.3 kgDEB/(day.Lcatalyst)) and desorbent consumption (1.73 LEth/kgDEB). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 408

SP  - 6517-6536
AB  - The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest technical vehicle ever built by mankind. It provides a living area for six astronauts and also represents a laboratory in which scientific experiments are conducted in an extraordinary environment. The deployed sensor technology contributes significantly to the operational and scientific success of the station. The sensors on board the ISS can be thereby classified into two categories which differ significantly in their key features: (1) sensors related to crew and station health, and (2) sensors to provide specific measurements in research facilities. The operation of the station requires robust, long-term stable and reliable sensors, since they assure the survival of the astronauts and the intactness of the station. Recently, a wireless sensor network for measuring environmental parameters like temperature, pressure, and humidity was established and its function could be successfully verified over several months. Such a network enhances the operational reliability and stability for monitoring these critical parameters compared to single sensors. The sensors which are implemented into the research facilities have to fulfil other objectives. The high performance of the scientific experiments that are conducted in different research facilities on-board demands the perfect embedding of the sensor in the respective instrumental setup which forms the complete measurement chain. It is shown that the performance of the single sensor alone does not determine the success of the measurement task; moreover, the synergy between different sensors and actuators as well as appropriate sample taking, followed by an appropriate sample preparation play an essential role. The application in a space environment adds additional challenges to the sensor technology, for example the necessity for miniaturisation, automation, reliability, and long-term operation. An alternative is the repetitive calibration of the sensors. This approach, however, increases the operational overhead significantly. But meeting especially these requirements offers unique opportunities for testing these sensor technologies in harsh and dedicated environments which are not available on Earth, therefore pushing the related technologies and methodologies to their limits. The scientific objectives for selected experiments, representing a wide range of research fields, are presented, including the instrument setups and the implemented sensor technologies, and where available, the first scientific results are presented. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - CO2 capture in a continuous gas-solid trickle flow reactor
VL  - 289
SP  - 191-202
AB  - This paper describes the selection, design and experimental validation of a gas-solid trickle flow adsorber for post-combustion CO2 capture using a supported amine sorbents (Lewatit (R) VP OC 1065). The experimental work presented here summarizes over 300 h of operating experience, which is equivalent to approximately 350 adsorption desorption cycles. We measured the effect of process parameters like gas velocity, solid flux and CO2 inlet concentration on adsorber performance in terms of the capture efficiency, productivity and working capacity. The performance of the trickle flow adsorber was adequately described by a 1-D plug-flow model. This model was used to design an adsorber to capture 90% of the CO2 emitted by a 500 MWe coal fired power plant. Model predictions have indicated that the trickle flow adsorber outperforms the scrubber in the conventional MEA based process in terms of productivity; 1.1 compared to 0.6 mol/m(3)/s in the MEA based process. Finally, the energy demand of the lab scale capture facility was measured. The energy associated with heating of the sorbent particles and desorption was 141 kJ/mol or 3.2 GJ/t at a working capacity of 1.2 mol/kg. At worldng capacities of 2.7 mol/kg the heat demand was reduced to values below 2 GJ/t. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The capacity of populations to respond adaptively to environmental change is essential for their persistence. Isolated populations often harbour reduced genetic variation, which is predicted to decrease adaptive potential, and can be detrimental under the current scenarios of global change. In this study, we examined climatic adaptation in larval life history traits in the pool frog Rana lessonae along a latitudinal gradient across the northern distribution area of the species, paying special attention to the isolated and genetically impoverished fringe populations in central Sweden. Larvae from eight populations within three geographic areas (Poland, Latvia and Sweden) were reared under three temperatures (19, 22 and 26°C) in a common garden laboratory experiment. We found clear evidence for latitudinal adaptation in R. lessonae populations, larvae from higher latitudes growing and developing faster than low-latitude ones. Larvae from the Swedish populations were able to compensate for the effects of cooler temperatures and a shorter growth season with genetically higher growth and development rates (i.e. countergradient variation) in the two higher temperature treatments, but there was no difference among the populations at the lowest temperature treatment, which is likely to be close to the temperature limiting growth in R. lessonae. Our results demonstrate that isolated and genetically impoverished populations can be locally adapted, and identify the Swedish fringe populations as a significant conservation unit adapted to the northern environmental conditions. © 2010 The Authors.

VL  - 10

AB  - The consequences of emerging marine diseases on the evolutionary trajectories of affected host populations in the marine realm are largely unexplored. Evolution in response to natural selection depends on the genetic variation of the traits under selection and the interaction of these traits with the environment (GxE). However, in the case of diseases, pathogen genotypes add another dimension to this interaction. Therefore, the study of disease resistance needs to be extended to the interaction of host genotype, pathogen genotype and environment (GxGxE). In this study, we used a full-sib breeding design crossing two genetically differentiated populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg, 1793), to determine the influence of host genotype, pathogen genotype and temperature on disease resistance. Based on a controlled infection experiment on two early life stages, that is, D-larvae and Pediveliger larvae at elevated and ambient water temperatures, we estimated disease resistance to allopatric and sympatric Vibrio sp. by measuring survival and growth within and between genetically differentiated oyster populations. In both populations, survival was higher upon infection with sympatric Vibrio sp., indicating that disease resistance has a genetic basis and is dependent on host genotype. In addition, we observed a significant GxGxE effect in D-larvae, where contrary to expectations, disease resistance was higher at warm than at cold temperatures. Using thermal reaction norms, we could further show that disease resistance is an environment dependent trait with high plasticity, which indicates the potential for a fast acclimatization to changing environmental conditions. These population-specific reaction norms disappeared in hybrid crosses between both populations which demonstrates that admixture between genetically differentiated populations can influence GxGxE interactions on larger scales. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Subjective experiment on causal relationship between indoor temperature and occupants’ performance mediated by arousal state
VL  - 2015
AB  - In the present study, a subjective experiment was done to validate the causal relationship between indoor environment and occupants’ performance mediated by their arousal state. Indoor temperature was selected as the environmental parameter, and controlled at three levels (22, 25, 28oC). The subjects’ performance was evaluated with three types of tasks (detecting wrong pairs of numbers, inputting numbers, and Sudoku). The results were obviously dependent on the tasks. When subjects engaged in either detecting wrong pairs of numbers or inputting numbers, there were almost no differences in both arousal state and performance among three indoor temperatures. However, in the case of Sudoku, the EA at 22oC was significantly higher than 28oC (p&lt;0.05) and the TA at 22oC was significantly lower than 28oC (p&lt;0.05). A difference in performance on Sudoku was also found between 22oC and 28oC at the ending of the session (p&lt;0.1). As the reason of the dependence on the tasks, it was considered that both EA and TA subsided due to the simplicity and monotony of the tasks except for Sudoku. Thus the EA and TA became lower regardless of the indoor temperature and no differences were caused in the performance. © 2015 International Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate.

AB  - Since the growing interest in the manufacture and environmental applications of nanocomposites consisting of CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), related toxicological effect and interaction with cellular structures for these newly developed materials are still unknown. Recent literature reveals that nanosized CuO and TiO2 particles have cytotoxicity risks and ability to cause oxidative stress on health. This work considers the CuO doped TiO2 nanocomposite particles were synthesized via a coprecipitation method with aqueous solutions as precursors of copper nitrate and titanium dioxide. Moreover, the nanocomposite particles were characterized using TGA-DTA, UV-Vis and TEM measurements. The calcination temperature was selected at 873 K. The nanocomposite particles were characterized by TEM, as the primary particles, aggregates ranged from 30 to 100 nm and have a good dispersion character. Cell cytotoxicity assessment and the percentage cell survival was determined by using 3 - (4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) - 5 (3-carboxymethoxyphenol) -2 - (4-sulfophenyl) - 2H - tetrazoli um (MTS) assay on human fetal lung tissue cell (MRC-5). The experimental results show that the CuO doped TiO2 nanocomposite particles cause potential cytotoxicity effect in cultured human cells. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

AB  - The technical state of buildings and the quality of the indoor environment depend on the quality of the waterproofing course and on the properties of the insulating materials that are applied, in particular on their durability, long-term functional reliability and resistance to corrosive effects of the subsoil. Underground water chemistry and soil bacteria are well-known corrosive agents. Our investigations indicate that the ageing process of waterproof materials can be significantly accelerated by alpha particles emitted by radon and radon progenies which are present in soil gas. Materials commonly available on the building market, e.g. LDPE and HDPE of various densities, PVC, TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin), PP (polypropylene) and EPDM were selected for our experimental study. The preliminary results for 3-year exposure to radon gas show a decrease in tensile strength to 60%, elongation to 80% and hardness to 95% for samples based on PE. The diffusion coefficient of radon for samples based on PVC decreased to 20% of the initial value after 1-year exposure to radon and soil bacteria. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many Thai plant species shows the responsible for controlling insects from the host plants. To avoid potential toxic pollutant contaminating aquatic ecosystems, this present study was investigated for acute toxicity from Amaranthus viridis to Guppy fish (Poecilia reticulata) were selected for the bioassay experiments. The experiments were repeated 5 times and the 1-, 3- and 24-h LC50 was determined for the guppies. The acute toxicity experiments were carried out by static method and behavioral changes in guppies were determined for Amaranthus viridis concentration extract which extracted by Soxhlet's extraction method with ethanol as solvent. Water temperature was regulated at 20 +/- 1 degrees C. Data obtained from the acute toxicity tests were evaluated using the Probit analysis statistical method. The 24-h LC50 value for guppy was estimated as ca. 947 mg L(-1) (r2 = 0.95). However, in this concentration, no mortality was observed at higher concentration for 30 second.

VL  - 10
SP  - 93-102
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation have caused population decline across taxa through impacts on life history diversity, dispersal patterns, and gene flow. Yet, intentional isolation of native fish populations is a frequently used management strategy to protect against negative interactions with invasive fish species. We evaluated the population viability and genetic diversity of 12 isolated populations of Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, USA. Length-structured integral projection models (IPMs) were used to project population growth rate (lambda) and its sensitivity to underlying vital rates and parameters. We examined relationships between lambda, genetic diversity, and habitat size and quality. Lambda ranged from 0.68 to 1.1 with 10 of 12 populations projected to be in decline. A sensitivity analysis of lambda with respect to projection matrix elements indicated that lambda was generally sensitive to changes in early life history stages (survival/growth), but patterns differed among populations. Another sensitivity analysis with respect to underlying model parameters showed highly consistent pattern across populations, with lambda being most sensitive to the slope of probability of maturity (estimated from published literature), generally followed by adult survival, and the slope of somatic growth rate (directly measured from each population). Lambda was not correlated with genetic diversity. For populations residing in small isolated streams (<= 5 km of occupied habitat), lambda significantly increased with base flow discharge (r(2) = 0.50, p < 0.02). Our results highlight the potential importance of local adaptation for persistence of small, isolated populations. Specifically we saw evidence for higher probability of maturity at smaller sizes in the smallest, coldest isolated systems, increasing probability of persistence for these populations. Climate change threatens tofurther fragment populations of aquatic organisms and reduce summertime base flows in much of western North America. Insights from studies such as ours will inform management strategies for long-term persistence of species facing these challenges. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 278

SP  - 2628-2637
AB  - Ecological factors are known to cause evolutionary diversification. Recent work has shown that evolution in strongly interacting predator species has reciprocal impacts on ecosystems. These divergent impacts of predators may alter the selective landscape and cause the evolution of prey. Yet, this link between intraspecific variation and evolution is unexplored. We compared the life history of a species of zooplankton (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in New England in which the dominant planktivorous predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), differs in feeding traits and migratory behaviour. Anadromous alewife (seasonal migrants) exhibit larger gapes, gill-raker spacing and target larger prey than landlocked alewife (yearround freshwater resident). In 'anadromous' lakes, Daphnia are abundant in the spring but extirpated by alewife predation in summer. Daphnia are rare year-round in 'landlocked' lakes.We show that Daphnia from lakes with anadromous alewife grew faster, matured earlier but at the same size and produced more offspring than Daphnia from lakes with landlocked or no alewife across multiple temperature and resource treatments. Our results are inconsistent with a response to size-selective predation but are better explained as an adaptation to colder temperatures and shorter periods of development (countergradient variation) mediated by seasonal alewife predation. © 2011 The Royal Society.

TI  - RNA directed modulation of phenotypic plasticity in human cells
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
AB  - Natural selective processes have been known to drive phenotypic plasticity, which is the emergence of different phenotypes from one genome following environmental stimulation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been observed to modulate transcriptional and epigenetic states of genes in human cells. We surmised that lncRNAs are governors of phenotypic plasticity and drive natural selective processes through epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Using heat shocked human cells as a model we find several differentially expressed transcripts with the top candidates being lncRNAs derived from retro-elements. One particular retro-element derived transcripts, Retro-EIF2S2, was found to be abundantly over-expressed in heat shocked cells. Over-expression of Retro-EIF2S2 significantly enhanced cell viability and modulated a predisposition for an adherent cellular phenotype upon heat shock. Mechanistically, we find that this retro-element derived transcript interacts directly with a network of proteins including 40S ribosomal protein S30 (FAU), Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A), and Ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40 (UBA52) to affect protein modulated cell adhesion pathways. We find one motif in Retro-EIF2S2 that exhibits binding to FAU and modulates phenotypic cell transitions from adherent to suspension states. The observations presented here suggest that retroviral derived transcripts actively modulate phenotypic plasticity in human cells in response to environmental selective pressures and suggest that natural selection may play out through the action of retro-elements in human cells. © 2016 Trakman et al.

VL  - 1527
SP  - 208-211
AB  - The goal of this work is to summarize the viability of several atmospheric chemical systems to generate atmospheric nanoparticles using accurate thermodynamic stabilities of molecular clusters. Positive ion, negative ion, and neutral cluster systems comprised of sulfuric acid and water, with and without ammonia, are considered. Step-wise association reaction energies are determined starting from bare monomers and continuing up through stable nanoparticles. For the smallest clusters, where thermodynamics most strongly influence the nucleation potential, association reaction energies are determined using experimental measurements and selected quantum chemical calculations from literature. Large, bulk-like nanoparticle energies are calculated using classical theory. Energies for the intermediate transitional clusters are determined by connecting the two approaches with globally consistent functions. The growth of molecular clusters into nanoparticles becomes thermodynamically favorable when the free energy surface contains a growth trajectory that has little or no uphill step, i.e., no energetic barrier to nucleation. Barrier heights, critical cluster compositions, and the overall potential for nucleation vary enormously between systems and as a function of precursor concentrations and temperature. Most of the binary and ternary mechanisms considered here achieve barrierless growth under conditions relevant to some region of the troposphere. Gaps and uncertainties in the thermodynamic database are addressed, and the need for future experimental and theoretical studies is discussed. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

TI  - Dynamic switching between escape and avoidance regimes reduces Caenorhabditis elegans exposure to noxious heat
VL  - 4
AB  - To survive, animals need to minimize exposure to damaging agents. They can either stay away from noxious stimuli (defined as avoidance), requiring the detection of remote warning cues, or run away upon exposure to noxious stimuli (defined as escape). Here we combine behavioural quantitative analyses, simulations and genetics to determine how Caenorhabditis elegans minimizes exposure to noxious heat when navigating in thermogradients. We find that worms use both escape and avoidance strategies, each involving the modulation of multiple parameters like speed and the frequency of steering and withdrawal behaviours. As some behavioural parameters promote escape while impairing avoidance, and vice versa, worms need to dynamically tune those parameters according to temperature. Furthermore, selectively disrupting avoidance or escape, through mutations affecting neuropeptide or TRPV channel signalling, increases exposure to heat. We conclude that dynamically switching between avoidance and escape regimes along the innocuous-noxious temperature continuum efficiently minimizes exposure to noxious heat. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Contaminated site assessment and monitoring requires efficient risk-management tools including innovative environmental toxicity tests. The first application of microcalorimetry for toxicity testing draw the attention to a possible new tool to increase sensitivity, to eliminate matrix effect and to study effect-mechanism. A Thermal Activity Monitor (TAM) microcalorimeter was used for measuring the heat production of various test organisms when getting in contact with sterile toxic soils. Well known bacterial (Azomonas agilis), animal (Folsomia candida) and plant test organisms (Sinapis alba) were tested for heat production. The heat response of selected testorganisms was measured in case of metal (Cu and Zn) and organic pollutant (Diesel oil, DBNPA and PCP) contaminated soils. In addition to the quantitative determination of the heat production, the mechanism of the toxic effect can be characterized from the shape of the power-time curve (slope of the curve, height and time of the maximum). In certain concentration ranges the higher the pollutant concentration of the soil the lower the maximum of the time-heat curve. At low pollutant concentrations an increased heat production was measured in case of A. agile and 20 and 200 mg Zn kg-1 soil. The microcalorimetric testing was more sensitive in all cases than the traditional test methods. Our results showed that the microcalorimetric test method offers a new and sensitive option in environmental toxicology, both for research and routine testing. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Increased exposure to acute thermal stress is associated with a non-linear increase in recombination frequency and an independent linear decrease in fitness in Drosophila
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Meiotic recombination rate has long been known to be phenotypically plastic. How plastic recombination evolves and is maintained remains controversial; though a leading model for the evolution of plastic recombination rests on the tenet that organismal fitness and recombination frequency are negatively correlated. Motivated by the mounting evidence that meiotic recombination frequencies increase in response to stress, here we test for a negative correlation between fitness and recombination frequency. Specifically, the fitness-associated recombination model (FAR) predicts that if stress increases meiotic recombination frequency, then increasing exposure to stressful conditions will yield an increasing magnitude of the recombinational response, while concomitantly decreasing fitness. Results: We use heat shock as a stressor to test this prediction in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that increased exposure to heat shock conditions is associated with a non-linear increase in meiotic recombination frequency. We also find an independent effect of heat shock on organismal fitness, with fitness decreasing with increased duration of thermal stress. Conclusions: Our results thus support the foundation of the FAR model for the evolution of plastic recombination. Our data also suggest that modulating recombination frequency is one mechanism by which organisms can rapidly respond to environmental cues and confer increased adaptive potential to their offspring. © 2015 Jackson et al.

VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 505-519
AB  - Stress resistance characters are valuable tools for the study of acclimation potential, adaptive strategies and biogeographic patterns in species exposed to environmental variability. Water stress is a challenge to terrestrial arthropods because of their small size and relatively high area: volume ratio. Fruit flies have been investigated to record adaptive morphological and physiological traits, as well as to test their responses to stressful factors. In this study, we investigate the ability to cope with water stress, by examining variation in desiccation resistance in a species that lives mainly in desert lands. Specifically, we explored the genetic and ecological basis of desiccation resistance in populations of Drosophila buzzatii from Northern Argentina. We used a common garden experiment with desiccation treatments on a number of isofemale lines from four populations along an aridity gradient. Our results revealed significant among-population differentiation and substantial amounts of genetic variation for desiccation resistance. We also detected significant genotype-by-environment and genotype-by-sex interactions indicative that desiccation resistance responses of the lines assayed were environment- and sex-specific. In addition, we observed clinal variation in female desiccation resistance along gradients of altitude, temperature and humidity; that desiccation resistance is a sexually dimorphic trait, and that sexual dimorphism increased along the aridity and altitudinal gradients. Based on current evidence, we propose that the observed sex-specific responses may reflect different life history traits, and survival and reproductive strategies in different ecological scenarios. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 2016
SP  - 88-94
AB  - Conventional flip chip technologies such as the mass reflow (MR) process and the thermal compression bonding (TCB) process are commonly used technologies in the micro assembly field. However, there is a continuous need for next generation interconnection technology to achieve a low form factor with increasing die and substrate complexities. Moreover, very thin 3D integrated packages and 2.5D packages with thin interposer die promise advanced interconnection technologies for mobile and wearable applications. With this point of view, the most important factor in interconnection is optimal thermal energy control for soldering. However, a conventional MR process cannot provide any selectivity and controlled thermal energy transferring with the traditional convection reflow. Its high thermal budget makes warpage an issue, aside from other side effects. To overcome the MR process problems, recent researches and industries have focused on developing a TCB process with non-conductive paste (NCP) or non-conductive film (NCF) due to TCB's unique advantages of low mechanical and thermal stress. However, the productivity of the TCB process is not comparably to the conventional process. Laser-Assisted bonding (LAB) with beam homogenizer is considered to be the next generation interconnection technology due to its excellent thermal selectivity, extremely fast ramping up speed with purely controlled wavelength. This LAB process offers a very stable interconnection quality as well as robust functional and reliability result. Interestingly, it also achieves excellent results with thin coreless substrate due to its selective heating area availability. This paper will discuss the laser heating mechanism, multi-chip & component bonding availability and advantage of LAB from an assembly industrial perspective. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The effect of high temperature on survival and longevity of Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) female adults was studied in the laboratory by daily exposure of the beetles to 35A degrees C (mean r.h. 52%) combined with 1-, 2- and 3-h intervals of thermal treatment at 38, 40, 42 and 44A degrees C (r.h. 46-48%). Fifty percent of females survived until the 12th-13th day of the thermal treatment at 38A degrees C (depending on the exposure time), the 2nd-10th day at 40A degrees C for 1-2 h exposure and the 4th-5th day at 42A degrees C for 1 h exposure. Survival was 25-38% on the 1st-2nd day of the thermal treatment at 40, 42 and 44A degrees C for 3, 2 and 1 h of exposure, respectively. Three hours of exposure of female C. montrouzieri at 42A degrees C and 2 h exposure at 44A degrees C were lethal for the beetles. Mean longevity of the predator was 33.13 A +/- 1.22 days at 35A degrees C and was significantly shorter as the temperature of the thermal treatments increased from 38(o) to 44A degrees C. These results suggest that daily temperature regimes of 35A degrees C combined with 38-40A degrees C for 1-3 h are marginal for the survival and longevity of the C. montrouzieri, whereas temperatures above 42A degrees C are lethal even at short exposure. These results can partly justify the inability of C. montrouzieri to be permanently established in Pakistan environments and could contribute to a pre-evaluation assay of its potential adaptability in such environmental systems.

VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (pCO2) are projected to contribute to a 1.1-6.4°C rise in global average surface temperatures and a 0.14-0.35 reduction in the average pH of the global surface ocean by 2100. If realized, these changes are expected to have negative consequences for reef-building corals including increased frequency and severity of coral bleaching and reduced rates of calcification and reef accretion. Much less is known regarding the independent and combined effects of temperature and pCO2 on critical early life history processes such as fertilization. Here we show that increases in temperature (+3°C) and pCO2 (+400 μatm) projected for this century negatively impact fertilization success of a common Indo-Pacific coral species, Acropora tenuis. While maximum fertilization did not differ among treatments, the sperm concentration required to obtain 50% of maximum fertilization increased 6- to 8- fold with the addition of a single factor (temperature or CO2) and nearly 50- fold when both factors interact. Our results indicate that near-future changes in temperature and pCO2 narrow the range of sperm concentrations that are capable of yielding high fertilization success in A. tenuis. Increased sperm limitation, in conjunction with adult population decline, may have severe consequences for coral reproductive success. Impaired sexual reproduction will further challenge corals by inhibiting population recovery and adaptation potential. © 2013 Albright, Mason.

VL  - 82

SP  - 1159-1176
AB  - Differences in thermal tolerance during embryonic development in Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were examined among nine populations in a controlled common-garden incubation experiment. Forcing embryonic development at an extreme temperature (relative to current values) of 16 degrees C, representing a future climate change scenario, significantly reduced survival compared to the more ecologically moderate temperature of 10 degrees C (55% v. 93%). Survival at 14 degrees C was intermediate between the other two temperatures (85%). More importantly, this survival response varied by provenance within and between temperature treatments. Thermal reaction norms showed an interacting response of genotype and environment (temperature), suggesting that populations of O. nerka may have adapted differentially to elevated temperatures during incubation and early development. Moreover, populations that historically experience warmer incubation temperatures at early development displayed a higher tolerance for warm temperatures. In contrast, thermal tolerance does not appear to transcend life stages as adult migration temperatures were not related to embryo thermal tolerance. The intra-population variation implies potential for thermal tolerance at the species level. The differential inter-population variation in thermal tolerance that was observed suggests, however, limited adaptive potential to thermal shifts for some populations. This infers that the intergenerational effects of increasing water temperatures may affect populations differentially, and that such thermally mediated adaptive selection may drive population, and therefore species, persistence.

TI  - Genetic divergence in forest trees: Understanding the consequences of climate change
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 22-36
AB  - Predicted climate change is heading in many respects into untested environmental conditions for trees and to the reshuffling of species distributions. We explore the consequences that these changes are likely to have on population differentiation of adaptive traits. Superimposed on the spatial redistribution of the species, will there be a redistribution of their genetic variation? We base our predictions on a conceptual framework, whose elements are the extant differentiation, and the predicted divergent evolution of populations along purposely chosen altitudinal/latitudinal gradients. We consider simultaneously phenotypic and genetic divergence, but emphasize genetically driven population differentiation. We illustrate phenotypic and genetic patterns of variation with examples from well-studied northern and southern hemisphere tree genera Quercus and Eucalyptus. Most phenotypic traits show very large in situ clinal variation with variation in altitude or latitude. Genetic clines detected in common gardens usually follow the observed in situ phenotypic clines, reflecting cogradient variation. Rare counter gradients have also been detected, where phenotypic and genetic clines exhibit opposing signs. These patterns suggest that plasticity and selection contributed in most cases synergistically to the extant differentiation. We anticipate that microevolutionary processes will be different along environmental gradients. At the leading edge, availability of newly suitable habitats will trigger migration favouring genotypes equipped with colonists attributes. At the rear edges of the distribution, populations will be submitted to strong selective pressures favouring genotypes capable of withstanding drought and heat stress. Central populations will benefit from the plastic response of trees that will temporarily compensate for the maladaptation, until genetic adaptive variation will be restored by gene flow, mutation or recombination. We make predictions about future differentiation along environmental gradients, by highlighting traits that are likely to diverge, the rate at which differentiation will take place, and the role of gene flow and hybridization. We envisage that parallel selection may maintain differentiation at extant levels, whereas divergent selection will promote substantial differentiation for traits facilitating adaptation to contrasting conditions along the environmental gradient. We anticipate that genetic divergence may occur very rapidly and will be enhanced by the multilocus architecture of most adaptive traits. © 2013 The Authors.

VL  - 22

SP  - 337-367
AB  - Recent and projected future changes in the temperature and chemistry of marine waters around the UK and Ireland are having, and will in the future have, effects on the phenology, productivity and distribution of marine fish and shellfish. However, the overall consequences are still hard to predict because behaviour, genetic adaptation, habitat dependency and the impacts of fishing on species, result in complex species' responses that may be only partially explained by simple climate envelope predictions. There is a broad body of evidence that climatic fluctuations are playing an important role in changing fish distributions and abundances, which is discernible against the background of trends in abundance due to fishing. During warm periods, southern species have tended to become more prominent and northern species less abundant. However, the changes in distribution are often more complicated than might be expected from a simple climate envelope approach, partly due to ocean circulation patterns which create invasion routes for southern water species into the North Sea from the south and from the north via the continental shelf west of Britain and Ireland. The eventual population-scale impacts of ocean acidification on fish and shellfish are currently very difficult to predict. However, the scant evidence suggests that indirect food web effects arising from the enhanced sensitivity of calcifying planktonic organisms may be important, and the direct effect on fish sensory systems leading to subtle influences on behaviour with possible population-level implications are possible. In British waters, the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is identified as being at particular risk from climate change. Owing to its strict association with coarse sandy sediments it is unable to adapt its distribution to compensate for warming sea temperatures. Sandeels are a key link in the food web, linking primary and zooplankton production to top predators. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VL  - 5

SP  - 6054-6063
AB  - In order to overcome the drawbacks of conventional heating for performing surface modification process, such as long synthesis time, low ef ciency, and adsorption capacity, we reported a novel approach by introducing a microwave (MW) assisted method to prepare a thio-functionalized fibrous adsorbent (PANMW-Thio) for the enhanced and selective removal of Hg2+ and Cd2+ from water in this study. The properties and morphologies of the adsorbent prepared by the MW-assisted method and conventional heating were compared through FTIR, XRD, SEM characterization, and mechanical tests, and the results revealed that the MW assisted method is a satisfactory technology to enable a higher sulfur content and reinforced mechanical property for the adsorbent. The selective adsorption experiment indicated that PANMW-Thio fibers possess higher affinity toward both Hg2+ and Cd2+ in the mixed solution with Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. The optimum pH value for the adsorption of Hg2+ and Cd2+ was found to be 7 with maximum adsorption capacities of 322.8 mg·g-1 and 350.6 mg·g-1, respectively. The pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model have revealed good fitness with the experimental data. The XPS analysis of the PANMW-Thio fibers before and after metal adsorption demonstrated the chelation adsorption mechanism between metal ions and sulfur, and parts of the metals were believed to be converted to metallic sulfate or sulfides on the surface of the fibrous adsorbent. This fibrous adsorbent could still retain more than 80% of its original adsorption capacity when regenerated by HCl solution. The facile and rapid preparation protocol, high adsorption capacity and highly retained mechanical property of PANMW-Thio indicates its possible application in selective removal of Hg2+ and Cd2+ ions from water. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Quality and stability of eggs from laying hens fed with organic minerals and lycopene
VL  - 46
IS  - 1
SP  - 157-162
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of using lycopene and organic minerals in diets for laying hens on the egg quality and stability of eggs stored for 30 days under different storage environments. An entirely randomized design was adopted in 2x3x3 factorial scheme (mineral sources x lycopene levels x storage periods) with six replicates of eight hens per experimental unit. The experimental diets were: feed containing inorganic minerals (IM) without added lycopene; IM with added lycopene (400mg kg-1); IM with added lycopene (800mg kg-1); organic minerals (OM) without added lycopene; OM with added lycopene (400mg kg-1); OM with added lycopene (800mg kg-1). After 112 days of feeding experimental diets, it was selected 60 eggs treatment-1, which were later labeled, stored in room and refrigerated temperature, and subjected to different storage periods (0, 15 and 30 days). Variables analyzed were: Haugh unit, yolk index, yolk color, albumen and yolk pH, and lipid oxidation (TBARS). Stability of eggs is not altered as a function of mineral sources and levels of lycopene studied. However, increasing storage time affects the quality of the eggs of laying hens at both storage conditions. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phase relations in the ZrO2-Nd2O3-Y 2O3 system: Experimental study and CALPHAD assessment
VL  - 101
IS  - 11
SP  - 1354-1360
AB  - The thermodynamic parameters of the Nd2O3-Y 2O3 system were re-assessed for better reproduction of experimental data. The thermodynamic parameters were combined from binary descriptions to calculate phase diagrams for the ternary system ZrO 2-Nd2O3-Y2O3. The calculated phase diagrams were used to select compositions for the experimental studies at 1 250, 1400 and 1 6008C. The samples were synthesised by co-precipitation and heat treated at 1 250-1 600 8C, investigated by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy. It was found that solubility of the Y2O 3 in the pyrochlore phase exceeds 10 mol.%. The experimental data obtained for phase equilibra were used to derive thermodynamic parameters for fluorite, Y2O3 cubic phase C, monoclinic B and Nd 2O3 hexagonal A phases by CALPHAD method. The isothermal sections and liquidus surface were calculated for the ZrO2-Nd 2O3-Y2O3 system. © Carl Hanser Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KG.

TI  - Morphological and molecular based characterization of different thermo-sensitive genetic male sterile (TGMS) lines in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
VL  - 29

SP  - 53-62
AB  - The present investigation was carried out at the Norman E. Borlaug Crop Research Center of Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, Pantnagar, Uttarakhand (India) during 2013 and 2014. The eighteen TGMS lines were characterized based on molecular and morphological data. Result on morphological and molecular characterization of TGMS lines showed that, not a single line was observed good for all the traits, different lines good for different traits. Among the eighteen TGMS lines ten lines viz, TGMS-2, TGMS-3, TGMS-4, TGMS-5, TGMS-7, TGMS-8, TGMS-10, TGMS-11, TGMS-14 and TGMS-15 showed complete sterility at average temperature 28.53 to 28.92°C. Based on the molecular genetic diversity data indicated that total of 47 alleles were amplified using sixteen SSR markers in the present study of eighteen TGMS lines all were found polymorphic except for one marker. The range of alleles was 2 - 5, while the average number of alleles per primer was 2.93 and thirteen rare alleles found in different lines. The polymorphic information content (PIC) for these sixteen SSR markers ranged from 0.1780 to 0.3750 with mean value 0.2543. The range of Jaccard’s similarity coefficient was found to vary from 0.46 (TGMS-7 and TGMS-16) to 0.97 (TGMS-11 and TGMS-12). The UPGMA based dendogram constructed using Jaccard’s similarity coefficient of SSR marker data divided eighteen lines into three clusters. Association study between the banding pattern of different markers and spikeletes fertility/sterility of TGMS lines showed that four lines out of eighteen were fertile. These fertile lines separated to other sterile lines by three markers with unique bands. TGMS-6 and TGMS- 9 showed 200bp specific band by RM 324 marker, TGMS-1 and TGMS-18 showed 180bp and 200bp unique bands and in TGMS-1 also showed 180bp unique band with RM 254 marker, it indicated that the unique bands 180bp and 200bp generated by different markers in different lines responsible for fertility. This molecular diversity analysis may be useful for identification of TGMS lines or may be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) for two line hybrid development. © 2016, SciTechnol, All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Long-term growth performance and productivity of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations
VL  - 86
IS  - 1
AB  - The phenotypic differentiation of 16 provenances of Scots pine originating from a wide variety of habitats that range from lowland to southern highland locations in Poland was assessed during 47 years of their growth and development in the Carpathian Mountains. The traits, including height, diameter at breast height, stem straightness, and crown width, were used to evaluate the differentiation of the provenances in their juvenile period and at maturity and were examined for patterns of local adaptation. The populations from northern Poland were characterized by the best growth and productivity, whereas provenances from central Poland had the best stem quality. There were some changes in growth between provenances observed during the experiment, but the stand volume (m(3)/ha) in juvenile trees was closely correlated with that in mature trees (r = 0.979). There was a positive relationship between the productivity and the environmental conditions of the geographical origin of provenances with increasing values for the trees' productivity from south to north. Additionally, the elevation above sea level of the original populations was inversely correlated with the growth achieved by the progeny. In general, most populations from the species distribution range in Poland tested in the severe climate conditions of the Carpathian Mountains showed good growth performance under that environment, characterized by low temperatures and short growing periods. Provenances from climatic zones outside mountain regions demonstrated great growth and productivity, which proved to be the most important for competitively outperforming the local populations. Our study demonstrates good adaptive potential of the tested provenances, as selection will favor fast-growing genotypes under the predicted environmental change scenario.

TI  - Wild Relatives for the Crop Improvement Challenges of Climate Change: The Adaptation Range of Crops
SP  - 61-79
AB  - This chapter outlines the current distribution of major and significant minor crops and compares these with the ecogeographical range of wild relatives with a presumed genetic basis for such adaptations. There are challenges in the transfer of desirable traits from wild relatives to crops, particularly, separation of close linked traits that favor survival in the wild rather than enhance realization of harvestable yield. The chapter is directed at the potential genetic adjustments which is the diversity within the domestic genepools and introgression from wild relatives. The wider genetic variance in most crop wild relative gene pools may retain greater potential than the domestic to adapt to wider extremes of temperature and drought. Thus the wild relatives differ as per their respective crops in their diversity of ecographical range and the potential tolerances of climatic and soil stresses that they may offer to the domestic genepool. © 2015 Wiley-Blackwell.

TI  - The role of ultrasonic treatment in refining the as-cast grain structure during the solidification of an Al-2Cu alloy
VL  - 408
IS  - 1
SP  - 119-124
AB  - The effect of Ultrasonic Treatment (UT) over selected temperature ranges during cooling and solidification of an Al-2Cu alloy melt on the grain structure and cooling behaviour of the alloy has been investigated using a molybdenum sonotrode introduced without preheating. UT was applied over various temperature ranges before, during and after the nucleation of primary aluminium grains. It was found that ultrasonic grain refinement was achieved only when UT was applied from more than 20 °C above the liquidus temperature until below the liquidus temperature after nucleation has occurred. Applying UT from 40 °C or 60 °C above the liquidus to just above the liquidus brings the melt to a condition that favours nucleation, survival of the nucleated grains and their subsequent transport throughout the melt. Continuing to apply UT beyond the liquidus for a short time enhances both nucleation and convection thereby ensuring the formation of a fine, uniform equiaxed grain size throughout the casting. The lack of grain refinement when UT was applied from 20 °C above the liquidus temperature or from temperatures below the liquidus temperature is attributed to the formation of a strong solidified layer on the sonotrode which hinders the effective transmission of ultrasonic irradiation into the liquid metal. The application of a preheated sonotrode showed that formation of a solid layer can be prevented by preheating the sonotrode to 285 °C. Thus, an appropriate amount of superheat of the liquid metal or sufficient preheating of the sonotrode is necessary for ultrasonic grain refinement when a sonotrode is introduced into the melt. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Changes in the life history traits of the European Map butterfly, Araschnia levana (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) with increase in altitude
VL  - 108
IS  - 3
SP  - 447-452
AB  - Climatic conditions can modify the life history traits, population dynamics and biotic interactions of species. Therefore, adaptations to environmental factors such as temperature are crucial for species survival at different altitudes. These adaptive responses, genetically fixed or plastic (phenotypic plasticity), can be determined by physiological thresholds and might vary between sexes. The objective of this study was to determine whether the life history traits of the European Map butterfly (Araschnia levana) differ at different altitudes. A field experiment was carried out along an altitudinal gradient from 350 to 1010 m a.s.l. in a low mountainous region (Bavaria, Germany). 540 butterfly larvae were placed at different altitudes in 18 planted plots of their larval host plant, the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). After three weeks the larvae were collected and reared under laboratory conditions. Developmental traits of the butterflies, mortality and percentage parasitism were measured. Larval development was generally slower at higher altitudes and lower temperatures and larval weight decreased with increasing altitude and decreasing temperature. However, there were no significant differences in pupation, adult lifespan and percentage mortality at the different altitudes and temperatures. Female larvae were heavier than those of males, and the pupal and adult lifespans were longer in females than in males. However, male and female butterflies reacted similarly to altitude and temperature (no significant interactions). None of the 188 larvae collected were parasitized. In conclusion, the phenotypic plasticity of European Map butterfly has enabled it to adapt to different temperatures, but the strategies of the sexes did not differ.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 50-57
AB  - The effect of heat stress on celomocytes (leukocytes) from Eisenia hortensis was investigated by measuring the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). After culturing celomocytes at temperatures ranging from 4 °C (control) to 44 °C for 3-16 h, ROS levels were measured using a flow cytometric method employing dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123) for ROS detection and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) as a viability stain. Reproducibly we observed significant (p < 0.05) increases in ROS production and decreases in cell viability at temperatures of 28 °C and above. We then examined the effect of heat stress on histone phosphorylation employing antibodies specific for γH2AX as an indicator of histone modification. Celomocytes were incubated at temperatures ranging between 20 °C to 35 °C for 16 h and antibodies specific for phosphorylated serines in H2AX histones were employed through flow cytometric analysis. Comparing controls to heat-stressed samples using three separate assays reproducibly confirmed significant H2AX phosphorylation (p < 0.05). Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate temperatures for rearing invertebrates in laboratory-based habitats and for culturing invertebrate cells when conducting in vitro assays in order to minimize oxidative stress. The possible cellular effects of heat stress in soil ecosystems associated with global warming events is also considered. © 2011, Universita degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia.

TI  - Survival of Norway spruce remains higher in mixed stands under a dryer and warmer climate
VL  - 21

SP  - 935-946
AB  - Shifts in tree species distributions caused by climatic change are expected to cause severe losses in the economic value of European forestland. However, this projection disregards potential adaptation options such as tree species conversion, shorter production periods, or establishment of mixed species forests. The effect of tree species mixture has, as yet, not been quantitatively investigated for its potential to mitigate future increases in production risks. For the first time, we use survival time analysis to assess the effects of climate, species mixture and soil condition on survival probabilities for Norway spruce and European beech. Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models based on an extensive dataset of almost 65 000 trees from the European Forest Damage Survey (FDS) - part of the European-wide Level I monitoring network - predicted a 24% decrease in survival probability for Norway spruce in pure stands at age 120 when unfavorable changes in climate conditions were assumed. Increasing species admixture greatly reduced the negative effects of unfavorable climate conditions, resulting in a decline in survival probabilities of only 7%. We conclude that future studies of forest management under climate change as well as forest policy measures need to take this, as yet unconsidered, strongly advantageous effect of tree species mixture into account. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - The impact of horizontal gene transfer on the adaptive ability of the human oral microbiome
VL  - 4
AB  - The oral microbiome is composed of a multitude of different species of bacteria, each capable of occupying one or more of the many different niches found within the human oral cavity. This community exhibits many types of complex interactions which enable it to colonize and rapidly respond to changes in the environment in which they live. One of these interactions is the transfer, or acquisition, of DNA within this environment, either from co-resident bacterial species or from exogenous sources. Horizontal gene transfer in the oral cavity gives some of the resident bacteria the opportunity to sample a truly enormous metagenome affording them considerable adaptive potential which may be key to survival in such a varying environment. In this review the underlying mechanisms of HGT are discussed in relation to the oral microbiome with numerous examples described where the direct acquisition of exogenous DNA has contributed to the fitness of the bacterial host within the human oral cavity. © 2014 Roberts and Kreth.

TI  - The effect of skin reflectance on thermal traits in a small heliothermic ectotherm
VL  - 60
SP  - 109-124
AB  - Variation in colour patterning is prevalent among and within species. A number of theories have been proposed in explaining its evolution. Because solar radiation interacts with the pigmentation of the integument causing light to either be reflected or absorbed into the body, thermoregulation has been considered to be a primary selective agent, particularly among ectotherms. Accordingly, the colour-mediated thermoregulatory hypothesis states that darker individuals will heat faster and reach higher thermal equilibria while paler individuals will have the opposite traits. It was further predicted that dark colouration would promote slower cooling rates and higher thermal performance temperatures. To test these hypotheses we quantified the reflectance, selected body temperatures, performance optima, as well as heating and cooling rates of an ectothermic vertebrate, Lampropholis delicata. Our results indicated that colour had no influence on thermal physiology, as all thermal traits were uncorrelated with reflectance. We suggest that crypsis may instead be the stronger selective agent as it may have a more direct impact on fitness. Our study has improved our knowledge of the functional differences among individuals with different colour patterns, and the evolutionary significance of morphological variation within species.

TI  - Dehydrin expression as a potential diagnostic tool for cold stress in white clover
VL  - 78
SP  - 43-48
AB  - Cold acclimation is important for crop survival in environments undergoing seasonal low temperatures. It involves the induction of defensive mechanisms including the accumulation of different cryoprotective molecules among which are dehydrins (DHN). Recently several sequences coding for dehydrins were identified in white clover (Trifolium repens). This work aimed to select the most responsive to cold stress DHN analogues in search for cold stress diagnostic markers. The assessment of dehydrin transcript accumulation via RT-PCR and immunodetection performed with three antibodies against the conserved K-, Y-, and S-segment allowed to outline different dehydrin types presented in the tested samples. Both analyses confirmed that YnKn dehydrins were underrepresented in the controls but exposure to low temperature specifically induced their accumulation. Strong immunosignals corresponding to 37-40 kDa with antibodies against Y- and K-segment were revealed in cold-stressed leaves. Another 'cold-specific' band at position 52-55 kDa was documented on membranes probed with antibodies against K-segment. Real time RT-qPCR confirmed that low temperatures induced the accumulation of SKn and YnSKn, transcripts in leaves and reduced their expression in roots. Results suggest that a YnKn dehydrin transcript with GenBank ID: KC247805 and the immunosignal at 37-40 kDa, obtained with antibodies against Y- and K-segment are reliable markers for cold stress in white clover. The assessment of SKn (GenBank ID: EU846208) and YnSKn (GenBank ID: KC247804) transcript levels in leaves could serve as additional diagnostic tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Positive interactions in plant communities
VL  - 30
IS  - 19
SP  - 5371-5380
AB  - Interactions among species are central to the study of plant communities and ecological theory. Until recently, ecologists have focused on competition as the most important interaction among plant species. During the last two decades, however, evidence for the importance of positive interactions (facilitation) among plants in many plant communities has accumulated. Positive interactions among plants occur when the presence of one plant enhances the growth, survival, or reproduction of a neighbor. Such interactions can be considered mutualistic when both species derive benefit from the interaction. Some cases of facilitation may be better described as commensalism in which one species benefits from another, but the other is not affected. Often, positive interactions reduce the negative effects of competition, so the net effect of neighbors is still negative. Positive interactions occur when one organism makes the local environment more favorable for another either directly (such as by ameliorating harsh environmental characteristics, altering substrate characteristics, or increasing the availability of a resource), or indirectly (such as by removing potential competitors, introducing other beneficial organisms or protecting their neighbors from herbivores or parasites). The net effect of plant interactions is frequently measured as the ratio of some measure of performance, usually biomass, of individuals with neighbors removed to that of control plants with neighbors left intact. It is difficult to distinguish positive interactions from negative interactions because both effects operate simultaneously, and we can only observe the net effect of plant interactions. Several indices have been used over the years to explore the net effect of plant interactions. The relative interaction intensity (RII) in plants has been proposed because it has useful mathematical and statistical properties, thus avoiding many of the problems associated with other frequently used indices. In addition, RII can be used to measure multispecies interactions at the community level. Certain ecological models (e. g. individual-based modelling) incorporating plant facilitation provide useful tools for exploring some of the fundamental processes within plant communities (e. g. species distributions along environmental gradients, biomass-density relationships and size inequality in plant populations). The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with competitive interactions being most important when abiotic stress does not strongly limit the ability of plants to acquire and exploit resources, and facilitative interactions being more important when abiotic stress is high or when consumer pressure is intense. The SGH has been supported by numerous studies in many ecosystems, and has provided a foundation for studying the balance between facilitation and competition in plant communities. A growing number of empirical studies do not support the SGH, however, It may be possible to refine specific predictions relevant to the SGH by explicitly considering the life history of the interacting species (relative tolerance to stress versus competitive ability) and the characteristics of the stress factor (resource versus non-resource) over wider stress gradients. In addition, inclusion of consumer-incurred biotic stress can alter the predicted outcome of interactions along resource- and non-resource-based stress gradients for both benefactors and beneficiaries. Positive interactions may influence community spatial patterns, permit coexistence, enhance diversity and productivity, and drive community dynamics. Inclusion of facilitation into the theory, models and paradigms of population and community ecology may alter many basic predictions. We also consider future directions for research on facilitation, emphasizing the need to increase our understanding of (1) the balance between positive and negative interactions and their effects on community organization, (2) positive interactions in the context of global warming, (3) integrating positive interaction with evolution, and (4) the potential role of positive interactions in ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Thermal tolerance of potential Trichogramma strains for mass-production and paddy field release in the Greater Mekong Subregion
VL  - 62
IS  - 6
SP  - 731-740
AB  - In order to identify suitable Trichogramma strains for mass production and successful control of key lepidopteran pests in paddy fields in the Greater Mekong Subregion, the effects of high temperatures on wasp life history traits were compared among three strains of Trichogramma chilonis Ishii and two strains of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, collected from paddy fields in the region. At a rearing temperature of 25 °C, life history traits differed significantly among the five strains tested and the three T. chilonis strains and a T. ostriniae strain were of high performance. When female wasps were exposed to higher temperatures commonly encountered in the region, negative effects were observed on key life history parameters of adult females and their offspring at 34 °C, which became even more serious at 37 °C. In particular, the two T. ostriniae strains were not able to successfully develop to adulthood at all at 37 °C while for the T. chilonis strains adult emergence was significantly reduced. In addition, the emerged offspring females lived only around one day and no parasitism was observed. When the three T. chilonis strains were exposed to 37 °C for 4 to 12 h at prepupal and pupal stages, reflecting heat shocks that the released Trichogramma may experience in the field, adult emergence was significantly reduced after an exposure time of 12 h. In summary, the three T. chilonis strains show a relatively high potential for incorporation in a biological control program in the target region. Our results also highlight that tests at both rearing and field temperatures are necessary in selection of potential Trichogramma strains for an inundative release program where there is significant difference between rearing and field temperatures. © 2017, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).

TI  - Evolution of reptilian viviparity: a test of the maternal manipulation hypothesis in a temperate snake, Gloydius brevicaudus (Viperidae)
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 248-255
AB  - We kept 48 gravid short-tailed pit vipers (Gloydius brevicaudus) under four laboratory thermal conditions during gestation and collected 10 females from the field soon before they gave birth to test whether Shine's (1995) maternal manipulation hypothesis applies to temperate reptiles. Females thermoregulated more precisely but did not shift their selected body temperatures during pregnancy, with females at high body temperatures giving birth early in the breeding season. The lowest (22 degrees C) and highest (32 degrees C) temperature treatments Increased maternal mortality and resulted in production of offspring with smaller body dimensions. More deformed offspring were produced at 32 degrees C, and more poorly performing offspring were produced at 22 degrees C. In the field, air temperatures lower than 22 degrees C and higher than 32 degrees C accounted for about 9% and 33% of total temperature readings, respectively. However, offspring produced by field-caught females did not differ from those produced by laboratory-kept females with body temperatures optimal for embryonic development in nearly all traits examined. This suggests that in nature, gravid females avoid exposure of their embryos to temperature extremes through thermoregulation. Our study validates the key prediction of the maternal manipulation hypothesis that maternal thermoregulation should enhance fitness-related offspring traits, and demonstrates that viviparity evolves in temperate reptiles because internal development shields offspring from temperature extremes.

SP  - 1034-1048
AB  - (Table presented.). Summary: As temperatures warm and precipitation patterns shift as a result of climate change, interest in the identification of tree genotypes that will thrive under more arid conditions has grown. In this review, we discuss the multiple definitions of ‘drought tolerance’ and the biological processes involved in drought responses. We describe the three major approaches taken in the study of genetic variation in drought responses, the advantages and shortcomings of each, and what each of these approaches has revealed about the genetic basis of adaptation to drought in conifers. Finally, we discuss how a greater knowledge of the genetics of drought tolerance may aid forest management, and provide recommendations for how future studies may overcome the limitations of past approaches. In particular, we urge a more direct focus on survival, growth and the traits that directly predict them (rather than on proxies, such as water use efficiency), combining research approaches with complementary strengths and weaknesses, and the inclusion of a wider range of taxa and life stages. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Evolutionary responses of invertebrates to global climate change: The role of life-history trade-offs and multidecadal climate shifts
SP  - 319-348
AB  - Life-history trade-offs will likely constrain the simultaneous optimisation of correlated suites of traits as invertebrates respond to global climate change. Therefore, a synthetic description of the fundamental trade-offs driving invertebrate evolutionary responses to global warming is needed. Here, five complementary trade-offs are described, including pleiotropic effects of endocrine hormonal signalling pathways, resource allocation, enzyme multi-functionality, thermal stability-kinetic efficiency, and various forms of water loss trade-offs. We also identify a gap in the study of the evolutionary responses of invertebrates to global warming: the examination of multidecadal climate dynamics and the emergence of non-analogous climates. The available evidence supports that different functional haplotypes effectively track decadal climate variability, creating newgenetic landscapes that may contingently determine the adaptive capacity of species. The development of methods to extract DNA from ancient and historical samples now allows the study of historical biogeographical patterns of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs). When coupled with multidecadal information on climatic variability, it allows the study ofmultidecadal evolutionary responses of invertebrates to global warming and to abrupt shifts in drought regimes. This research is, in turn, facilitated by emerging modelling approaches that can effectively integrate genotype-phenotype-environment associations. Ultimately, this permits landscape studies of turnover in polymorphic candidate genes and the characterisation of non-linear threshold responses to drought and climatic variables. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Metabolic responses of the Nereid polychaete, Alitta succinea, to hypoxia at two different temperatures
VL  - 473
SP  - 161-168
AB  - Coastal hypoxia has detrimental effects to community ecology, degrading community structure and diminishing benthic function. Benthic function is largely driven by infauna bioturbation, which facilitates life-supporting processes by increasing the quality of marine sediments for nearly all biota. These infauna-mediated processes are diminished by coastal hypoxia. However, some infauna have been documented to exhibit metabolic plasticity to low oxygen allowing them to maintain some form of benthic function. Of particular interest to this study is the Nereid polychaete Alitta succinea. Stopflow respirometry was used to assess the hypoxic tolerance of A. succinea, by quantifying resting metabolic rate (V-O2), critical oxygen saturation (i.e. the oxygen level below which worms could not maintain aerobic metabolism), and the oxyregulation ability at an acclimation temperature (25 degrees C) and after an acute temperature increase (to 30 degrees C). The acute Q(10) during normoxia was 4.6, though this effect of temperature on V-O2, was completely muted during hypoxia with a Q(10) of 1. Compared among other polychaetes, A. succinea was the most efficient at oxyregulation, resulting in low critical oxygen saturation levels of 16% and 10% at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Finally, there was a significant effect of hypoxia on the mass metabolism relationship of A. succinea. Oxygen consumption rates were significantly higher during hypoxia only for smaller A. succinea, suggesting a physiological size selection for hypoxia response. These findings demonstrate the significant effect of hypoxia on A. succinea metabolism, but also provide the metabolic justification for survival of this infaunal worm during severe hypoxia.

SP  - 7357-7367
AB  - Molecular dynamics simulations using fully atomistic models were conducted to investigate gas transport mechanism and its connection to the free volume distribution and morphology in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in PVC modified with 4-fluorothiophenol. The influence of both, modification degree and temperature on diffusion mechanism was thoroughly studied. The diffusion coefficients of O2 and N2 were determined via molecular dynamics simulation using the COMPASS forcefield over a range of temperatures (375, 400, 425, and 450 K) using up to 200 ns simulation time. The introduction of pendant bulky groups along the polymer backbone results in a less ordered polymer matrix increasing the free volume available and consequently the diffusion coefficients of both gases, O2 and N2. Additionally, the temperature range selected in this work allows us to investigate the crossover from a solid-like diffusion mechanism (at low temperatures) to a liquid-like mechanism that takes place at higher temperatures. The gas transport coefficients of these polymers obtained from MD simulations were compared with previously reported values in literature based on both experimental and simulation studies, and the results obtained were within the expectations indicating the viability of the approach. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Transcriptional response of selected genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium biofilm cells during inactivation by superheated steam
VL  - 192
SP  - 117-123
AB  - Superheated steam (SHS), produced by the addition of heat to saturated steam (SS) at the same pressure, has great advantages over conventional heat sterilization due to its high temperature and accelerated drying rate. We previously demonstrated that treatment with SHS at 200 degrees C for 10 sec inactivated Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes biofilm cells on the surface of stainless steel to below the detection limit. However, bacteria withstanding heat stress become more resistant to other stress conditions, and may be more virulent when consumed by a host. Herein, we studied the transcriptional regulation of genes important for stress resistance and virulence in Salmonella biofilms after SHS treatments. Genes encoding heat shock proteins and general stress resistance proteins showed transcriptional surges after 1 sec of SHS treatment at 200 degrees C, with parallel induction of stress-related regulator genes including rpoE, rpoS, and rpoH, Interestingly, Salmonella biofilm cells exposed to SHS showed decreased transcription of flagella and Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (SPI-1) genes required for motility and invasion of host cells, respectively, whereas increased transcription of SPI-2 genes, important for bacterial survival and replication inside host cells, was detected. When the transcriptional response was compared between cells treated with SHS (200 degrees C) and SS (100 degrees C), SHS caused immediate changes in gene expression by shorter treatments. Understanding the status of Salmonella virulence and stress resistance induced by SHS treatments is important for wider application of SHS in controlling Salmonella biofilm formation during food production.

TI  - The effect of sintering temperature to the quality of hydroxyapatite coating on cobalt alloys as the candidate of bone implant prosthesis
VL  - 32
SP  - 59-68
AB  - Total hip replacement (THR) that is widely used today is the cemented type, which its application will lead to aseptic loosening. To avoid the occurrence of aseptic loosening, THR coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) is required because HA is osteoconductive which can stimulate the growth of osteoblasts. This study aims to determine the optimum sinter temperature which produce HA coating suitable as implant material. To achieve these objectives, the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) conducted coating method at concentrations of HA 1, 0M, voltage of 100V for 30 minutes and then sintered at temperatures are 550°C, 700°C and 900°C respectively detention for 10 minutes. The results showed that the treatment of sintering after the coating process through the EPD method affect the characteristics of the layer thus formed. Sintering process affects the crystallinity of the HA layer. The higher the sintering temperature the higher its crystallinity. The higher the crystallinity the stronger the HA layer attached to the substrate cobalt alloy. Based on this research, the selected sintering temperature was 900 °C for 10 minutes which produced a layer of HA with the best characteristics that meet the standard of implant prosthesis, the crystallinity of 89.4%, thick layer of 70.80 ± 4.18 μm, adhesion strength of 21.87 ± 0.23 MPa, the corrosion rate of 0.025 mpy and 70.3% cell viability. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Copoly(ether imide)s formed by the reaction of an aromatic dianhydride (BPDA), an aromatic diamine (ODA or BNZ), and α,ω-bis(2-aminopropyl polypropylene oxide)s with molecular weights of 2000 and 4000 g/mol were obtained, characterized, and studied as gas separation membranes. All of the copoly(ether imide)s studied showed a low imidization temperature, well below 200 C. They also underwent a phase segregation process, as confirmed by SAXS, when they were thermally treated. The segregation was found to increase permeability without any significant decrease of selectivity for almost all of the gas pairs studied (O2/N2, CO2/CH 4, and CO2/N2). For the CH4/N 2 pair, a strong increase in selectivity was obtained upon segregation, along with a rising permeability. This excellent gas productivity for the mixture CH4/N2 is probably due to a combined effect of a specific interaction and an increase in solubility of CH4 in the soft segregated domains of the copolymer. Methane permeabilities over 20 barrer and CH4/N2 selectivities close to 4.2 for an applied pressure of 1 bar were attained. The changes in permselectivity with permeation temperature were observed to follow an Arrhenius correlation, which adds a certain tunable permeability versus selectivity to these materials. Thus, it is possible to attain high selectivities (for relatively low temperatures) or high permeabilities (for comparatively high temperatures). The proportion of PPO in the final polymer has a significant influence on the segregation extent and domains, so that both the selectivity and permeability improved when the proportion of polyether in the final polymer was high. The mechanical properties were good for all of the proportions and/or densities tested. All of the copolymers studied showed a high resistance to plasticization and to the action of solvents and aggressive media. The high permselectivities and resistance to plasticization and solvents suggest that the membranes obtained could be advantageously used in natural gas extraction and purification. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Environmental constraints on oviposition of aquatic invertebrates with contrasting life cycles in two human-modified streams
VL  - 58
IS  - 9
SP  - 1932-1945
AB  - Many streams today have modified channels, substratum composition, flows and temperature regimes. Understanding how these potential stressors affect key processes governing populations is crucial towards counteracting species decline and loss. For aquatic organisms with complex life cycles that include a terrestrial adult stage, successful reproduction involving a transition from the terrestrial to aquatic environment for oviposition can be an important constraint. Our main goal was to test for the effects of local stream degradation on egg mass densities of macroinvertebrates with different requirements for oviposition habitat. We experimentally manipulated oviposition substrate availability in two Swiss gravel-bed rivers by adding bricks to stream beds of channelised, restored and near natural reaches differing in their depth profile and availability of large rocks. We followed oviposition on bricks and natural rocks between May and October 2008 and quantified egg mass densities of two aquatic insects with a terrestrial stage (Baetis spp. and Hydropsyche spp.) and an entirely aquatic leech Erpobdella octoculata. Individual and interactive effects of mean water depth fluctuations, depth variability, frequency of large rocks and temperature on egg mass densities were evaluated using a model selection approach. Response to our manipulation in terms of relative use of bricks for oviposition was strongest in the two insect taxa, whose egg mass densities responded to the presence of large substrata in study reaches. We also found evidence for a weak water level effect on egg mass densities of Baetis, a mayfly that uses protruding rocks for oviposition, in contrast to Hydropsyche, which apparently is capable of diving. While no clear response to our manipulation was found in Erpobdella octoculata, its overall cocoon densities were influenced by the variability of depth profile and increased in reaches with lower streambed heterogeneity. Our results suggest that stream degradation has high potential to constrain reproduction of many species, in particular those with complex life cycles such as aquatic insects. Investigation in modified riverscapes of the specific effects of different constraints to recruitment processes is a prerequisite for successful management and conservation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Giving offspring a head start in life: Field and experimental evidence for selection on maternal basking behaviour in lizards
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
SP  - 651-657
AB  - The timing of birth is often correlated with offspring fitness in animals, but experimental studies that disentangle direct effects of parturition date and indirect effects mediated via variation in female traits are rare. In viviparous ectotherms, parturition date is largely driven by female thermal conditions, particularly maternal basking strategies. Our field and laboratory studies of a viviparous lizard (Niveoscincus ocellatus) show that earlier-born offspring are more likely to survive through their first winter and are larger following that winter, than are later-born conspecifics. Thus, the association between parturition date and offspring fitness is causal, rather than reflecting an underlying correlation between parturition date and maternal attributes. Survival selection on offspring confers a significant advantage for increased maternal basking in this species, mediated through fitness advantages of earlier parturition. We discuss the roles of environmentally imposed constraints and parent-offspring conflict in the evolution of maternal effects on parturition date. © 2009 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal physiology: A new dimension of the pace-of-life syndrome
VL  - 86
IS  - 5
SP  - 1269-1280
AB  - Current syndrome research focuses primarily on behaviour with few incorporating components of physiology. One such syndrome is the pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) which describes covariation between behaviour, metabolism, immunity, hormonal response, and life-history traits. Despite the strong effect temperature has on behaviour, thermal physiology has yet to be considered within this syndrome framework. We proposed the POLS to be extended to include a new dimension, the cold–hot axis. Under this premise, it is predicted that thermal physiology and behaviour would covary, whereby individual positioning along the thermal continuum would coincide with that of the behavioural continuum. This hypothesis was tested by measuring thermal traits of delicate skinks (Lampropholis delicata) and linking it to their behaviour. Principal components analysis and structural equation modelling were used to determine if traits were structured within the POLS and to characterize the direction of their interactions. Model results supported the inclusion of the cold–hot axis into the POLS and indicated that thermal physiology was the driver of this relationship, in that thermal traits either constrained or promoted activity, exploration, boldness and social behaviour. This study highlights the need to integrate thermal physiology within a syndrome framework. © 2017 The Authors. Journal of Animal Ecology © 2017 British Ecological Society

TI  - Survivorship of ploidy-variable unisexual ambystoma salamanders across developmental stages
VL  - 71
IS  - 2
SP  - 81-87
AB  - Populations of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders typically consist of ploidy-variable individuals (diploid through pentaploid) that differ in their proportional representation within the populations. These salamanders reproduce using a method that has been termed kleptogenesis: stealing genetic material from males of compatible bisexual Ambystoma species (e.g., Jefferson Salamanders A. jeffersonianum and Blue-spotted Salamanders A. laterale). Kleptogenesis can result in ploidy-variable embryos within an egg mass because the unisexual female might or might not incorporate the male genome. Little is known about the survivorship of individuals having different ploidy levels. Triploid individuals are most abundant, indicating that higher ploidy individuals (tetraploids and pentaploids) are either produced more rarely, or suffer higher mortality than triploids. We assessed the frequency of ploidy levels (determined by microsatellite analysis) across four life-history stages over 2 yr: adults, early larvae, late larvae, and metamorphosed juveniles. We found that warmer breeding-season temperatures were correlated with an increased frequency of high-ploidy individuals being produced. In addition, there was a gradual decline in tetraploids across all stages as the larvae developed into adults. Breeding season temperature and selection against certain ploidy levels both appear to be important drivers of unisexual salamander population composition at our study site. © 2015 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is one of the most ecologically and economically important forest-forming tree species in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of value, numerous genetic studies have been conducted since the 19th century to develop or improve the breeding and conservation programs of the species. Current studies are motivated by growing concerns about the survival and productivity of Scots pine populations, especially in the face of long-term environmental change predictions. In this article, we review major questions in the population genetics of Scots pine and show how previous studies advance current research approaches. We refer to major outcomes of the research describing the genetic variation and postglacial history of Scots pine compared with those of other cold-tolerant tree species such as Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver birch (Betula pendula). We present results from studies of quantitative trait variation and local adaptation across the Scots pine distribution. We focus on the main research directions in dissection of the genetic basis of adaptive traits and the search for signatures of selection using quantitative trait locus mapping, candidate genes, association genetics, and genome scanning approaches. Finally, we highlight novel approaches in molecular breeding and point out new research prospects in genomic studies of Scots pine and other forest tree species in the face of rapid developments in next-generation sequencing and genotyping methods. © 2016 Society of American Foresters.

VL  - 4
IS  - 3
SP  - 627-655
AB  - As a new class of materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been continuing fascinating the community with properties that can be seen from neither bulk graphite nor diamond. Although the physics and chemistry of these carbon allotropes have been intensively investigated from various perspectives, the laws governing the fascinations and their interdependence remain as yet undetermined. From the perspectives of bond and nonbond formation, dissociation, relaxation, vibration, and the associated energetics and dynamics of charge repopulation, polarization, densification, and localization, this article aims to show that the broken-bond-induced local bond contraction and bond strength gain, quantum entrapment and densification of charge and energy, polarization of the unpaired edge dangling σ-bond electrons, and the formation of the pseudo-π-bond between the dangling σ-bond electrons along the edges are responsible for the anomalies. Theoretical reproduction of the experimentally observed elastic modulus enhancement, melting point depression, layer-number, strain, pressure and temperature induced Raman shift, C 1s core-level positive shift, work function reduction, band gap expansion, edge and defect selective generation of the Dirac-Fermi polarons and the associated magnetism consistently confirmed that the shorter and stronger bonds between undercoordinated carbon atoms modulate locally the atomic cohesive energy, the Hamiltonian, and hence the detectable bulk properties. The polarization of the unpaired dangling σ-bond electrons by the densely, deeply, and locally entrapped core and bonding electrons generates the massless, magnetic and mobile Dirac-Fermi polarons at sites surrounding vacancies and zigzag-GNR edges. The pseudo-π-bond formation between the nearest dangling σ-bond electrons along the armchair-GNR and the reconstructed zigzag-GNR edges discriminates them from the zigzag-GNR edges or vacancies in the electronic and magnetic properties. Consistency between predictions and observations confirmed that the C-C bond contracts by up to 30% with a 152% bond strength gain at the edges with respect to those in the bulk diamond. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

VL  - 296

SP  - 347-353
AB  - The future supplies and usage of glycerol are expected to increase as biodiesel plants increase production, and the output will greatly outpace demand. Biodiesel production has already had a significant impact on the price of refined glycerol. A major concern of glycerol producers is the reduced price of glycerol resulting from the increased production of biodiesel. Some alternative uses for this glycerol that have been investigated are substrates for fermentation process or the production of biosurfactants, fatty acids, biopolymers, and others products. This work had as objective to evaluate two strains of Xanthomonas sp isolate from Brazil for xanthan gum in orbital agitator, analizing the apparent viscosity of aqueous solutions and selecting viscosity. The experiments of xanthan gum production were realized in orbital agitator with 120 rpm agitation, for cells production, and 180rpm, for biopolymer production, under a 28 °C temperature. The rheology of the fermentation broth was analyzed by apparent viscosity and the polymer was recovered with ethanol (1:3, v/v). After its recovery, the productivity evaluation was performed. The productivity were 0.157 and 0.363 gL-1 for C1 and 0.186 and 0.363 gL-1 for C9 to media glycerol or glycerol and sucrose, respectively. The viscosity analysis was performed for aqueous solutions 3%, at 25 °C, the best apparent viscosity was obtained using gum synthesized with glycerol and sucrose (50:50) at 25 °C, 143 mPa.s -1 from Xanthomonas sp C1.

TI  - Evaluating within-population variability in behavior and demography for the adaptive potential of a dispersal-limited species to climate change
VL  - 6
IS  - 24
SP  - 8740-8755
AB  - Multiple pathways exist for species to respond to changing climates. However, responses of dispersal-limited species will be more strongly tied to ability to adapt within existing populations as rates of environmental change will likely exceed movement rates. Here, we assess adaptive capacity in Plethodon cinereus, a dispersal-limited woodland salamander. We quantify plasticity in behavior and variation in demography to observed variation in environmental variables over a 5-year period. We found strong evidence that temperature and rainfall influence P. cinereus surface presence, indicating changes in climate are likely to affect seasonal activity patterns. We also found that warmer summer temperatures reduced individual growth rates into the autumn, which is likely to have negative demographic consequences. Reduced growth rates may delay reproductive maturity and lead to reductions in size-specific fecundity, potentially reducing population-level persistence. To better understand within-population variability in responses, we examined differences between two common color morphs. Previous evidence suggests that the color polymorphism may be linked to physiological differences in heat and moisture tolerance. We found only moderate support for morph-specific differences for the relationship between individual growth and temperature. Measuring environmental sensitivity to climatic variability is the first step in predicting species' responses to climate change. Our results suggest phenological shifts and changes in growth rates are likely responses under scenarios where further warming occurs, and we discuss possible adaptive strategies for resulting selective pressures. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Thermotolerance of human myometrium: Implications for minimally invasive uterine therapies
VL  - 8584
AB  - Endometrial ablation has gained significant clinical acceptance over the last decade as a minimally invasive treatment for abnormal uterine bleeding. To improve upon current thermal injury modeling, it is important to better characterize the myometrium's thermotolerance. The extent of myometrial thermal injury was determined across a spectrum of thermal histories/doses (time-temperature combinations). Fresh extirpated human myometrium was obtained from 13 subjects who underwent a previous scheduled benign hysterectomy. Within two hours of hysterectomy, the unfixed myometrium was treated in a stabilized saline bath with temperatures ranging from 45-70°C and time intervals from 30- 150 seconds. The time-temperature combinations were selected to simulate treatment times under 2.5 minutes. A total of six such thermal matrices, each comprised of 45 time-temperature combinations, were prepared for evaluation. The treated myometrium was cryosectioned for nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) staining to assess for thermal respiratory enzyme inactivation. Image analysis was subsequently used to quantitatively assess the stained myometrium's capacity to metabolize the tetrazolium at each time-temperature combination. This colorimetric data was then used as marker of cellular viability and determine survival parameters with implications for developing minimally invasive uterine therapies. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

TI  - Ancient DNA from Coral-Hosted Symbiodinium Reveal a Static Mutualism over the Last 172 Years
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - Ancient DNA (aDNA) provides powerful evidence for detecting the genetic basis for adaptation to environmental change in many taxa. Among the greatest of changes in our biosphere within the last century is rapid anthropogenic ocean warming. This phenomenon threatens corals with extinction, evidenced by the increasing observation of widespread mortality following mass bleaching events. There is some evidence and conjecture that coral-dinoflagellate symbioses change partnerships in response to changing external conditions over ecological and evolutionary timescales. Until now, we have been unable to ascertain the genetic identity of Symbiodinium hosted by corals prior to the rapid global change of the last century. Here, we show that Symbiodinium cells recovered from dry, century old specimens of 6 host species of octocorals contain sufficient DNA for amplification of the ITS2 subregion of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, commonly used for genotyping within this genus. Through comparisons with modern specimens sampled from similar locales we show that symbiotic associations among several species have been static over the last century, thereby suggesting that adaptive shifts to novel symbiont types is not common among these gorgonians, and perhaps, symbiotic corals in general. © 2013 Baker et al.

TI  - Agroecological zones simulator (AZS): A component based, open-access, transparent platform for climate change - Crop productivity impact assessment in Latin America
SP  - 901-908
AB  - The Agro-ecological Zones Simulator (AZS) is a platform for data and models sharing for scientists and policy makers, facilitating the analysis of climate change impacts and the identification of possible response strategies through a comprehensive regional-level analysis comprised of: (i) Geo-referenced climate, soil and terrain data, combined into a land resources database;(ii) Crop suitability assessment and land productivity of cropping systems; (iii) Procedures for calculating the potential agronomically attainable yield; (iv) Procedures for computing actual yields as limited by water availability and management, biotic and abiotic factors; and (v) Selected agricultural production systems with defined input and management relationships, crop-specific environmental requirements and adaptability characteristics. The software core of the platform is given by an instance of the BioMA platform. The platform facilitates the evaluation of the impacts of projected changes in temperature, precipitation and evaporative demands on crop growth and function, including investigations of adaptation potentials by means of management optimization and use of available or improved crop varieties. Simulations are performed using modelling solutions based on extensible, multi-model components for crop growth and development, soil water dynamics, biotic (e.g., diseases) and abiotic (e.g., ozone concentration, frost events) stressors, hourly and daily weather variable generation, automatic management practices, and with a generic component implementing different approaches for crop suitability. The inclusion of biotic and abiotic factors in modelling solutions allows for explicit computations of changing pressures on crops under a changing climate, increasing the realism of the modeled systems. AZS is currently operational for Latin America and Caribe; it was recently used by the World Bank's Agriculture and Rural Development of Latin America for the analysis of climate change impacts on four major crops: wheat, maize, rice and soybean. The results of those simulations and analysis are presented as a first application of the AZS platform.,.

VL  - 40

SP  - 34-38
AB  - We characterize, in both the laboratory and the field, the preferential thermal microenvironments of Paraphysa parvula (Pocock 1903) (Araneae: Theraphosidae), a mygalomorph spider that successfully inhabits the high elevation environments of the Chilean Andes. We studied 116 spiders. Their average body temperature in the field was 31.02 ± 2.74°C, similar to the laboratory preferred temperature of 31.7 ± 2.31°C, and higher than the ideal temperature of reproductive females, 29.34 ± 2.81°C. In non-reproductive spiders, we found significant associations between body temperature and the temperatures of the air, substrate and rocks; however, the strongest association was between body and rock temperatures. Similar results were obtained in reproductive females, but there the best predictor of the body temperature was air temperature in the shelter. In both cases, the air temperature remained below body temperature and well below the temperature of the rocks and stones. Both situations show the importance of behavioral thermoregulation and the mechanisms of heat transfer into the microenvironment in the body temperature regulation of spiders. Conduction from the environment, heat transfer by small convection currents, and radiation from the hot stones constitute small environmental cues that allow these spiders to maintain an optimal temperature. The selection of shelters meeting specific temperature regimes appears to be a key condition for the optimization of female reproductive success and survival of females and juveniles in a high elevation environment. © 2012 The American Arachnological Society.

TI  - Physiological stress and the fitness effects of Mpi genotypes in the acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides
VL  - 404
SP  - 139-149
AB  - Balancing selection has been invoked to explain the apparent maintenance of polymorphisms at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi) loci in a diverse array of organisms. However, in many cases the agents of selective stress and the grain size of environmental heterogeneity necessary to preserve genetic variation remain uncertain. In the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides, differing selection regimes have been proposed across the species' range. To test whether or not fitness differences segregate with Mpi and Gpi polymorphisms near the southern range limit, barnacles from Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, were subjected to physiological challenges in the laboratory. Survivorship was measured in barnacles exposed to an orthogonal combination of salinity, thermal and dietary stresses. Cirral length and genotype frequency shifts at Mpi and Gpi were assessed in low salinity treatments. Mortality from thermal stress was greatly enhanced under low salinity. Across all low salinity treatments there was a nonsignificant trend of decreased fitness associated with the Mpi-SS genotype. Cirral length variation was significantly correlated with Mpi genotypes in a pattern consistent with survivorship data. © Inter-Research 2010.

TI  - Differential fitness in field and forest explains density-independent habitat selection by gartersnakes
VL  - 181
IS  - 3
SP  - 841-851
AB  - The ideal free distribution concept predicts that organisms will distribute themselves between habitats in a density-dependent manner so that individuals, on average, achieve the same fitness in each habitat. In ectotherms, environmental temperature has a strong impact on fitness, but temperature is not depletable and thus not density dependent. Can density-dependent habitat selection occur in ectotherms when habitats differ in thermal quality? We used an observational study of habitat selection by small snakes in field and forest, followed by manipulative habitat selection and fitness experiments with common gartersnakes in enclosures in field and forest to test this hypothesis. Snakes were much more abundant in the field, the habitat with superior thermal quality, than in the forest. Gartersnakes in our controlled experiment only used the forest habitat when snake density was highest and when food was more abundant in the forest; habitat selection was largely density independent, although there was weak evidence of density dependence. No female gartersnake gave birth in the forest enclosures, whereas half of the females gave birth in the field enclosures. Growth rates of females were higher in field than in forest enclosures. Overall, our data indicate that temperature appears to be the most important factor driving the habitat selection of gartersnakes, likely because temperature was more limiting than food in our study system. Snakes, or at least temperate snakes, may naturally exist at population densities low enough that they do not exhibit density-dependent habitat selection. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Effects of rearing conditions, geographical origin, and selection on larval diapause in the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella
VL  - 12
AB  - The Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is a serious insect pest of stored products, and its late-instar larvae diapause as pre-pupae. Diapause induction in P. interpunctella was investigated for four populations obtained from Modesto, California, U.S.A.; Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and two locations from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Insects were reared at 25°C and 16:8 L:D for 9 days. The larvae were then either continuously maintained under those conditions or transferred to 25°C 8:16 L:D, 20°C 16:8 L:D, or 20°C 8:16 L:D, and the percent diapause was recorded. In the experiment with four populations, the highest diapause frequency was observed at 20°C 8:16 L:D. The two Winnipeg populations had significantly higher frequency of diapause than the California populations, indicating the increased frequency of diapause in populations from higher latitudes. In a second experiment, the Vancouver population was selected for diapause. Larvae were reared at 25°C 16:8 L:D for 9 days, then placed at 20°C 8:16 L:D for the rest of their development, and percent diapause was determined. Eggs laid by moths that completed diapause in this first (parental) generation were used to obtain a second generation (F1), and the experiment was repeated as in the first generation. Selection increased the frequency of diapause to 91%, compared to 26% in the unselected population, after selecting over two generations. The narrow sense heritability of selection in P. interpunctella was 0.39 in the first selection, and 0.82 in the second. This study has shown that both low temperature and short photoperiod are required to induce diapause in North American populations of P. interpunctella, and that selection can increase diapause in a few generations.

TI  - Competitiveness of Indian steel industry through cost efficiency and innovation
VL  - 91
SP  - 8-28
AB  - There have been revolutionary changes in the global steel scene with fierce competitive pressures on performance, productivity, price reduction and customer satisfaction. National boundaries have melted to encompass an ever increasing world market. Trade in steel products has been on the upswing with the production facilities of both the developed and the developing countries complementing each other in the making of steel of different grades and specialty for the world market. Innovation and reduction in cost are keys to achieve a competitive edge in the international market. Innovation in its broadest sense includes new technologies, new ways of managing or discovering new market segments. Technology influences cost competencies in the long term which in turn generates price competition in the market. However, in the short term prices are also influenced by capacity utilisation through better efficiency. Innovation results in continuous development of cutting edge solutions in technology, processes and products. Achieving this calls for substantial efforts in R&D, for which, to stay ahead in the competitive world. Competition between steel makers promotes innovation and efficiency. It promotes the growth in steel use and serves steel's customer and society as a whole. Post-liberalisation, Indian firms have been under tremendous pressure to improve their competitiveness. The removal of physical restrictions on imports and the lowering of customs duties implied that Indian firms had to be as good (or nearly as good) as their international competitors in order to survive. This accelerated the process of technological absorption. Several companies also pushed ahead in improving production and improving their products so as to be able to add value to their products and improve profitability. The steelmaking and processing technologies have undergone significant changes in the last few decades, in order to make steel more cost competitive and also enhance the performance capability of steel to meet the increasing needs and expectations of market and society. New processing technologies, such as, continuous casting, ladle refining, thermo-mechanical controlled processing, continuous annealing and processing line, endless hot rolling, etc have dramatically improved material property and performance. The steel industry is continuously striving to make its product lighter, stronger and cheaper than ever before. In addition to new technologies, new concepts have been introduced which has led to significant improvement in product property and capability. Ultra low carbon Bainitic steels have fulfilled the long felt need for higher strength level without sacrificing low temperature toughness and weldability properties. Recent development of interstitial free (IF) steel for the auto segment has completely eliminated presence of cementite from microstructure of cold rolled steel sheets and has made it amenable for press forming of complex shaped auto components. Ultra fine grained (1μm - 3μm) steels have been successfully made in laboratory scale, which has led to high strength levels (YS-800MPa) with excellent impact toughness combination. The paper throws light on global steel scenario and structure of Indian steel industry. A detailed SWOT analysis of Indian steel industry presents various opportunities and impediments in front of the industry during the next few years. Competitiveness of Indian steel industry has been analysed with other global players with the help of various parameters and finally some ways have been suggested. Apart from new concepts and technologies, a number of other measures have been taken up by the Indian steel industry to improve its competitiveness. Such measures include enhancing volume of value added products, reduction in dependence on imported coking coal, creation of infrastructure to sustain 160Mt production by 2020, quality assurance, improved IT strategy, etc. Innovation and cost efficiency keep hand in hand. Innovation not only in product development, but in process, business strategy, marketing strategy, HR policy leads to cost efficiency. This paper provides a detailed overview of the steps to enhance competitiveness of the Indian steel industry through cost efficiency, innovative concepts and new technologies.

TI  - Shared and unique patterns of phenotypic diversification along a stream gradient in two congeneric species
VL  - 6
AB  - Stream ecosystems show gradual variation of various selection factors, which can result in a zonation of species distributions and gradient evolution of morphological and life-history traits within species. Identifying the selective agents underlying such phenotypic evolution is challenging as different species could show shared and/or unique (species-specific) responses to components of the river gradient. We studied a stream gradient inhabited by two mosquitofishes (genus Gambusia) in the Rió Grijalva basin in southern Mexico and found a patchy distribution pattern of both congeners along a stretch of 100 km, whereby one species was usually dominant at a given site. We uncovered both shared and unique patterns of diversification: some components of the stream gradient, including differences in piscine predation pressure, drove shared patterns of phenotypic divergence, especially in females. Other components of the gradient, particularly abiotic factors (max. annual temperature and temperature range) resulted in unique patterns of divergence, especially in males. Our study highlights the complexity of selective regimes in stream ecosystems. It exemplifies that even closely related, congeneric species can respond in unique ways to the same components of the river gradient and shows how both sexes can exhibit quite different patterns of divergence in multivariate phenotypic character suites. © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Mating does not influence reproductive investment, in a viviparous lizard
VL  - 315
IS  - 8
SP  - 458-464
AB  - Mating is crucial for females that reproduce exclusively sexually and should influence their investment into reproduction. Although reproductive adjustments in response to mate quality have been tested in a wide range of species, the effect of exposure to males and mating per se has seldom been studied. Compensatory mechanisms against the absence of mating may evolve more frequently in viviparous females, which pay higher direct costs of reproduction, due to gestation, than oviparous females. To test the existence of such mechanisms in a viviparous species, we experimentally manipulated the mating opportunity of viviparous female lizard, Lacerta (Zootoca) vivipara. We assessed the effect of mating on ovulation, postpartum body condition and parturition date, as well as on changes in locomotor performances and body temperatures during the breeding cycle. Female lizards ovulated spontaneously and mating had no influence on litter size, locomotor impairment or on selected body temperature. However, offspring production induced a more pronounced locomotor impairment and physical burden than the production of undeveloped eggs. Postpartum body condition and parturition dates were not different among females. This result suggests that gestation length is not determined by an embryonic signal. In the common lizard, viviparity is not associated with facultative ovulation and a control of litter size after ovulation, in response to the absence of mating. J. Exp. Zool. 315:458-464, 2011.

TI  - The effect of water temperature on routine swimming behaviour of new born guppies (Poecilia reticulata)
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 547-552
AB  - Guppies have successfully established populations in places with thermal regimes very different from the Tropical conditions in their native range. This indicates a remarkable capacity for thermal adaptation. Given their vulnerability to predation as juveniles, acute changes in temperature, which can alter predator-prey relationships, can impact juvenile survival and have amplified consequences at the population level. To understand how temperature may impact juvenile survival and gain insight into their success as an invasive species, we researched the effect of acute temperature changes on the routine swimming behaviour of juvenile guppies. Using a novel 3-dimensional tracking technique, we calculated 4 routine swimming parameters, speed, depth, and variation in speed or depth, at 6 different test temperatures (17, 20, 23, 26, 29, or 32°C). These temperatures cover their natural thermal range and also extended past it in order to include upper and lower thermal limits. Using model selection, we found that body length and temperature had a significant positive relationship with speed. Variation in speed decreased with rising temperatures and fish swam slightly closer to the bottom at higher temperatures. All juveniles increased variation in depth at higher temperatures, though larger individuals maintained slightly more consistent depths. Our results indicate that guppies have a large thermal range and show substantial plasticity in routine swimming behaviours, which may account for their success as an invasive species. © 2015.

TI  - Sex determination in bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus: Effect of temperature on sex ratio of four geographic strains
VL  - 230
IS  - 3
SP  - 197-208
AB  - There is increasing evidence that temperature effects on sex ratio in fish species are ubiquitous. Temperature effects on sex ratio could be influenced by parent, strain, and population, whether in fish species with temperature-dependent sex determination or genetic sex determination plus temperature effects. In the present study, effects of genotype-temperature interactions on sex determination in bluegill sunfish were further investigated, based on our previous results, using four geographic strains: Hebron, Jones, Hocking, and Missouri. In the Hebron strain, the two higher-temperature treatment groups (24 °C and 32 °C) produced more males than the low-temperature treatment group (17 °C) from 6 days post-hatching (dph) to 90 dph. In contrast, the low-temperature treatment produced more males than the other two higher-temperature treatments in the Jones strain. No significant effects of temperature on sex ratio were detected in the other two strains. Our results from sex ratio variance in different treatment times suggest that the thermosensitive period of sex differentiation occurs prior to 40 dph. Our results further confirmed that genotypetemperature interactions influence sex determination in bluegill. Therefore, to significantly increase the proportion of males, which grow faster and larger than females, a consumer- and environment-friendly approach may be achieved through selection of temperature sensitivity in bluegill. © 2016 Marine Biological Laboratory.

VL  - 4

SP  - 498-502
AB  - Climate change will alter many aspects of the ecology of organisms, including dispersal patterns and population connectivity. Understanding these changes is essential to predict future species distributions, estimate potential for adaptation, and design effective networks of protected areas. In marine environments, dispersal is often accomplished by larvae. At higher temperatures, larvae develop faster, but suffer higher mortality, making the effect of temperature on dispersal difficult to predict. Here, we experimentally calibrate the effect of temperature on larval survival and settlement in a dynamic model of coral dispersal. Our findings imply that most reefs globally will experience several-fold increases in local retention of larvae due to ocean warming. This increase will be particularly pronounced for reefs with mean water residence times comparable to the time required for species to become competent to settle. Higher local retention rates strengthen the link between abundance and recruitment at the reef scale, suggesting that populations will be more responsive to local conservation actions. Higher rates of local retention and mortality will weaken connectivity between populations, and thus potentially retard recovery following severe disturbances that substantially deplete local populations. Conversely, on isolated reefs that are dependent on replenishment from local broodstock, increases in local retention may hasten recovery. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Temperature influences selective mortality during the early life stages of a coral reef fish
VL  - 6
IS  - 5
AB  - For organisms with complex life cycles, processes occurring at the interface between life stages can disproportionately impact survival and population dynamics. Temperature is an important factor influencing growth in poikilotherms, and growth-related processes are frequently correlated with survival. We examined the influence of water temperature on growth-related early life history traits (ELHTs) and differential mortality during the transition from larval to early juvenile stage in sixteen monthly cohorts of bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus, sampled on reefs of the upper Florida Keys, USA over 6 years. Otolith analysis of settlers and juveniles coupled with environmental data revealed that mean near-reef water temperature explained a significant proportion of variation in pelagic larval duration (PLD), early larval growth, size-at-settlement, and growth during early juvenile life. Among all cohorts, surviving juveniles were consistently larger at settlement, but grew more slowly during the first 6 d post-settlement. For the other ELHTs, selective mortality varied seasonally: during winter and spring months, survivors exhibited faster larval growth and shorter PLDs, whereas during warmer summer months, selection on PLD reversed and selection on larval growth became non-linear. Our results demonstrate that temperature not only shapes growth-related traits, but can also influence the direction and intensity of selective mortality. © 2011 Rankin, Sponaugle.

TI  - Are mountain habitats becoming more suitable for generalist than cold-adapted lizards thermoregulation?
VL  - 2016
IS  - 31
AB  - Mountain lizards are highly vulnerable to climate change, and the continuous warming of their habitats could be seriously threatening their survival. We aim to compare the thermal ecology and microhabitat selection of a mountain lizard, Iberolacerta galani, and a widely distributed lizard, Podarcis bocagei, in a montane area. Both species are currently in close syntopy in the study area, at 1,400 m above the sea level. We determined the precision, accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation, and the thermal quality of habitat for both species. We also compared the selection of thermal microhabitats between both species. Results show that I. galani is a cold-adapted thermal specialist with a preferred temperature range of 27.9-29.7 ï¿½C, while P. bocagei would be a thermal generalist, with a broader and higher preferred temperature range (30.1-34.5 ï¿½C). In addition, I. galani selects rocky substrates while P. bocagei selects warmer soil and leaf litter substrates. The thermal quality of the habitat is higher for P. bocagei than for I. galani. Finally, P. bocagei achieves a significantly higher effectiveness of thermoregulation (0.87) than I. galani (0.80). Therefore, these mountain habitat conditions seem currently more suitable for performance of thermophilic generalist lizards than for cold-specialist lizards. ï¿½ 2016 Ortega et al.

VL  - 34

AB  - Twenty five rhizobial isolates were obtained from root nodules of Medicago sativa inoculated with soil samples collected from the Sapporo region and Ishigaki Island in Japan. To study their diversity and characterize them in relation to the climatic conditions of their soils of origin, a polyphasic approach analyzing stress tolerance, symbiotic and genetic properties was used. Stress tolerance assays revealed marked variations in salinity, pH and temperature tolerance. Isolates originating from a sub-tropical climate in alkaline soil (Ishigaki Island) tolerated high temperature, salinity and pH levels. Moreover, isolates recovered from a temperate climate in acidic soil (Sapporo) were sensitive to high temperature and salinity, and tolerated acidic pH. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved 16S rRNA and recA genes, and symbiotic nodA and nifDK revealed 25 isolates to be closely related to Ensifer meliloti. Furthermore, the branch patterns of phylogenetic trees constructed from different genes revealed the existence of at least two E. meliloti types in the soils studied. These results may be relevant to programs directed towards improving crop productivity through biofertilization with locally adapted and genetically defined strains. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Population and life-stage specific sensitivities to temperature and salinity stress in barnacles
VL  - 6
AB  - Temperature and salinity shape the distribution and genetic structure of marine communities. Future warming and freshening will exert an additional stress to coastal marine systems. The extent to which organisms respond to these shifts will, however, be mediated by the tolerances of all life-stages and populations of species and their potential to adapt. We investigated nauplius and cypris larvae of the barnacle Balanus (Amphibalanus) improvisus from the Swedish west coast with respect to temperature (12, 20, and 28 degrees C) and salinity (5, 15, and 30) tolerances. Warming accelerated larval development and increased overall survival and subsequent settlement success. Nauplii developed and metamorphosed best at intermediate salinity. This was also observed in cypris larvae when the preceding nauplii stages had been reared at a salinity of 30. Direct comparisons of the present findings with those on a population from the more brackish Baltic Sea demonstrate contrasting patterns. We conclude that i) B. improvisus larvae within the Baltic region will be favoured by near-future seawater warming and freshening, that ii) salinity tolerances of larvae from the two different populations reflect salinities in their native habitats, but are nonetheless suboptimal and that iii) this species is generally highly plastic with regard to salinity.

TI  - Thermoregulation in the lizard Psammodromus algirus along a 2200-m elevational gradient in Sierra Nevada (Spain)
VL  - 60
IS  - 5
SP  - 687-697
AB  - Achieving optimal body temperature maximizes animal fitness. Since ambient temperature may limit ectotherm thermal performance, it can be constrained in too cold or hot environments. In this sense, elevational gradients encompass contrasting thermal environments. In thermally pauperized elevations, ectotherms may either show adaptations or suboptimal body temperatures. Also, reproductive condition may affect thermal needs. Herein, we examined different thermal ecology and physiology capabilities of the lizard Psammodromus algirus along a 2200-m elevational gradient. We measured field (T-b) and laboratory-preferred (T-pref) body temperatures of lizards with different reproductive conditions, as well as ambient (T-a) and copper-model operative temperature (T-e), which we used to determine thermal quality of the habitat (d(e)), accuracy (d(b)), and effectiveness of thermoregulation (d(e)-d(b)) indexes. We detected no T-b trend in elevation, while T-a constrained T-b only at high elevations. Moreover, while T-a decreased more than 7 A degrees C with elevation, T-pref dropped only 0.6 A degrees C, although significantly. Notably, low-elevation lizards faced excess temperature (T-e > T-pref). Notably, d(e) was best at middle elevations, followed by high elevations, and poorest at low elevations. Nonetheless, regarding microhabitat, high-elevation d(e) was more suitable in sun-exposed microhabitats, which may increase exposition to predators, and at midday, which may limit daily activity. As for gender, d(b) and d(e)-d(b) were better in females than in males. In conclusion, P. algirus seems capable to face a wide thermal range, which probably contributes to its extensive corology and makes it adaptable to climate changes.

VL  - 5
IS  - 5
SP  - 651-657
AB  - Robustness in farm animals was defined by Knap as the ability to combine a high production potential with resilience to stressors, allowing for unproblematic expression of a high production potential in a wide variety of environmental conditions. The importance of robustness-related traits in breeding objectives is progressively increasing towards the production of animals with a high production level in a wide range of climatic conditions and production systems, together with a high level of animal welfare. Current strategies to increase robustness include selection for 'functional traits', such as skeletal and cardiovascular integrity, disease resistance and mortality in various stages. It is also possible to use global evaluation of sensitivity to the environment (e.g. reaction norm analysis or canalization), but these techniques are difficult to implement in practice. The hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenocortical (HPA) axis is the most important stress-responsive neuroendocrine system. Cortisol (or corticosterone) released by the adrenal cortices exerts a large range of effects on metabolism, the immune system, inflammatory processes and brain function, for example. Large individual variations have been described in the HPA axis activity with important physiopathological consequences. In terms of animal production, higher cortisol levels have negative effects on growth rate and feed efficiency and increase the fat/lean ratio of carcasses. On the contrary, cortisol has positive effects on traits related to robustness and adaptation. For instance, newborn survival was shown to be directly related to plasma cortisol levels at birth, resistance to bacteria and parasites are increased in animals selected for a higher HPA axis response to stress, and tolerance to heat stress is better in those animals that are able to mount a strong stress response. Intense selection for lean tissue growth during the last decades has concomitantly reduced cortisol production, which may be responsible for the negative effects of selection on piglet survival. One strategy to improve robustness is to select animals with higher HPA axis activity. Several sources of genetic polymorphism have been described in the HPA axis. Hormone production by the adrenal cortices under stimulation by adrenocorticotropin hormone is a major source of individual differences. Several candidate genes have been identified by genomic studies and are currently under investigation. Bioavailability of hormones as well as receptor and post-receptor mechanisms are also subject to individual variation. Integration of these different sources of genetic variability will allow the development of a model for marker-assisted selection to improve animal robustness without negative side effects on production traits.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Mapping of Heat Health Risk Utilizing Environmental and Socioeconomic Data
VL  - 51
IS  - 3
SP  - 1498-1507
AB  - Extreme heat events, a leading cause of weather-related fatality worldwide, are expected to intensify, last longer, and occur more frequently in the near future. In heat health risk assessments, a spatiotemporal mismatch usually exists between hazard (heat stress) data and exposure (population distribution) data. Such mismatch is present because demographic data are generally updated every couple of years and unavailable at the subcensus unit level, which hinders the ability to diagnose human risks. In the present work, a human settlement index based on multisensor remote sensing data, including nighttime light, vegetation index, and digital elevation model data, was used for heat exposure assessment on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, the nighttime urban heat island effect was considered in heat hazard assessment. The heat-related health risk was spatially explicitly assessed and mapped at the 250 m × 250 m pixel level across Zhejiang Province in eastern China. The results showed that the accumulated heat risk estimates and the heat-related deaths were significantly correlated at the county level (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.76, P ≤ 0.01). Our analysis introduced a spatially specific methodology for the risk mapping of heat-related health outcomes, which is useful for decision support in preparation and mitigation of heat-related risk and potential adaptation. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 29

SP  - 1100-1109
AB  - Thermal alteration is associated with ecological change in freshwater systems. Global climate change is likely to amplify thermal stresses on aquatic systems. We used cumulative daily heat units to examine potential impacts of temperature changes on selected aquatic organisms using scenario analyses. We selected two species of aquatic macroinvertebrates to test our hypotheses of thermal effects on life history pattern, viz. a univoltine stenothermic ephemeropteran species of conservation importance, and a multivoltine dipteran pest species. A combination of spreadsheet probability and logistic regression models was used to model probabilities of hatching and breeding success, plus population sizes and generation numbers per month, under current and projected 2 degrees C warmer water temperature scenarios. We propose that cold-adapted Gondwanaland relic species are likely to become increasingly vulnerable and range limited, whereas multivoltine pest species are likely to become more abundant under scenarios of increased water temperatures. We propose management options that include maintaining river connectivity and dam re-operation as potential mitigation measures. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Traditional approach of studying the influence of one factor at time on nanofiber diameter does not give a complete picture of the process, where many interacting process parameters are being neglected. This paper reports a melt spinning process to increase the production rate of nanofiber materials. An additional attachment was fixed below the filament extruder of a melt spinning line. This attachment with controlled heated airflow arrangement stretches the filament coming out of the extruder by the process of sequential drawing which result in the formation of nanofiber materials. A die with segmented cross-section was used during melt extrusion process. A Box and Behnken factorial design of experiment was conducted to study the influence of multiple parameters on fiber/filament diameters. These parameters were distance of the first drawing zone from the die, airflow, and air temperature. The selected parameters were varied at three levels, −1, 0, and +1, respectively. The current setup produces fibers with diameter ranging from 820 to 1145 nm, smallest diameter was 820 nm. Among the selected parameters, the interaction effect of the air temperature and distance of the first drawing zone from the die was a dominant factor on the extrusion of nanofibers. These results show that in a multivariable process, interaction effect of the parameters played a major role in determining fiber diameter and it cannot be neglected. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.

SP  - 1093-1106
AB  - The β-form crystals in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) are proved to be favorable and effective for developing general iPP plastics with high performance. Herein, sustainable eggshell power decorated with calcium pimelate (DES), an effective β-form nucleating agent for iPP, was fabricated via the interaction between pimelic acid and Ca2+ on the surface of eggshell powder at elevated temperature. DSC and FTIR analysis identified the reaction occurred and formation of calcium pimelate on surface of the eggshell powder. Then, the effects of the functionalized eggshell powder on the nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization behavior, melting characteristics and polymorph structures were investigated. From the nonisothermal crystallization experiments, the incorporation of supported β-form nucleator greatly enhanced the crystallization temperature of iPP. The content of β-form crystals (Kβ) could reach a value as high as 87% at 5 mass% DES load. Moreover, the crystallization and melting characteristics of iPP nucleated by DES were not changed under multiple scan conditions with melt temperature range from 190 to 250 °C. Interestingly, from the investigation of isothermal crystallization and subsequent melting behavior, it was found that DES is a temperature-dependent selective nucleator for inducing iPP crystallization. Main α-form crystals or β-form crystals could form when using high or low crystallization temperatures, respectively. Particularly, these results demonstrated a possibility to tailor the ratio of α-form crystals to β-form crystals by simply choosing isothermal crystallization conditions. Then the crystallization mechanism based on thermodynamics and kinetics factors was further discussed. © 2016, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

VL  - 107

SP  - 1077-1086
AB  - Models of instantaneous soil-surface CO2 efflux (SCEins) are critical for understanding the potential drivers of soil C loss. Several simple SCEins models have been reported in the literature. Our objective was to compare and validate selected soil temperature (Ts)- and water content (qv)-based equations for modeling SCEins among a variety of cropping systems and land management practices. Soil-surface CO2 effluxes were measured and modeled for grain-harvested corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations, grain- and stover-harvested continuous corn systems with and without a cover crop, and reconstructed prairies with and without N fertilization on soils with subsurface drainage. Soil-surface CO2 effluxes, Ts, and qv were measured from 2008 to 2011. Models calibrated with weekly measured SCEins, Ts, and qv throughout the growing season produced lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than models calibrated with several weeks of hourly measured data. Model selection signi‑ cantly affected SCEins estimations, with models that use only Ts parameters having lower RMSE than models that use both Tsand qv. However, the model that produced the lowest RMSE during validation estimated growing-season SCE that did not significantly differ from numerical integration of weekly measured SCEins. All models had similar residual errors with autocorrelated trends at monthly, weekly, and hourly scales. Autoregressive moving average functions were able to precisely describe the temporal err ors. To accurately model SCEins and scale across time, improvement of temporal errors in Ts-and qv-based SCEins models is needed to obtain accurate and precise closure of C balances for managed and natural ecosystems. © 2015 by the American Society of Agronomy, 5585 Guilford Road, Madison, WI 53711.

TI  - Hot mothers, cool eggs: Nest-site selection by egg-guarding spiders accommodates conflicting thermal optima
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 469-475
AB  - In oviparous species providing maternal care, the choice of nest site is crucial for the survival of both the eggs and the mother. Most embryos only develop successfully within a narrow range of incubation conditions, which may differ from the mother's own requirements. How, then, do nest-attending mothers select sites that provide suitable conditions for embryonic development, without compromising their own viability? 3.We investigated nest-site selection in flat-rock spiders, Hemicloea major, a species that guards fixed egg sacs in a thermally challenging environment (under sun-exposed rocks). Females glue egg sacs beneath rocks during late spring and guard their eggs during summer, when temperatures beneath rocks often exceed 50°C. Our field surveys show that spiders laid eggs beneath rocks that were larger and thinner, and thus hotter, than were most available rocks. However, the egg sacs almost invariably were glued to the coolest sites on the substrate beneath a rock, rather than to the (hotter, by about 9°C) underside of the rock. By affixing their egg sacs to the coolest locations beneath the hottest rocks, females ensured that their developing offspring experienced moderate temperatures and avoided lethal extremes and, simultaneously, gave themselves access to much hotter areas (that enhance their feeding and growth rates) under the same rock. This strategy allows mobile adult spiders to actively select higher temperatures than can be tolerated by their embryos, while remaining close enough to their eggs for effective nest guarding. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - The results were obtained by measurements in 2014 and 2015 in an apple orchard in Starý Lískovec and Těšetice (South Moravia, Czech Republic, Central Europe) into fertile planting of apple trees. The results show that the bark surface temperature during the year slightly differs from the surrounding air temperature. In addition, it is in average a few tenths of a °C higher in the period before the onset of the vegetation and several tenths of a degree lower during vegetation. Causes of these differences appear to be associated with the flow of sap as well as with foliage. Although it can be reasonably assumed that the temperature of the bark surface on the south side will be significantly affected by the global radiation, our measurements did not demonstrate this dependency. It appears that the wind speed had significantly larger influence on the temperature differences in the non-vegetation period as at speeds over 3.5 m s-1, the drop of temperature is so significant that the bark surface is colder than the surrounding air. Comparison of the development of sums of daily and hourly effective temperatures above 10 °C has shown that where daily values do not show significant differences, hourly values differed so prominently that the calculated date of emergence of adult codling moth in the bark surface was approximately one week earlier than with the use of data for air temperatures. © 2015 Tomáš Středa et al., published by De Gruyter Open.

TI  - Effect of biodiesel-diesel-n-pentanol and. biodiesel-diesel-n-hexanol blends on diesel engine emission and combustion characteristics
VL  - 133
SP  - 761-776
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel-diesel-n-pentanol and biodiesel-diesel-n-hexanol blends without engine modification. The fuel constituents were varied between 0 and 100% in the range of 5%. In this, above 75% of biodiesel content, 5% of diesel and less than 20% of n-pentanol and n-hexanol content were selected. Based on the fuel characterization, B90-D5-P5, B85-D5-P10, B90-D5-H5 and B85-D5-H10 were selected for further experimental investigation. The lowest brake specific energy consumption of 12.64 MJ/kWh was obtained for B90-D5-H5 blend at full load condition. The maximum brake thermal efficiency of 31.0% was obtained in B90-D5-H5 blend. The B85-D5-H10 fuel has a maximum heat release rate of 44.53 J/degrees CA. The lowest carbon monoxide emission of 0.74% vol. was obtained from B85-D5-P10. At 100% load, least unburned hydrocarbons emission of 74 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-P10 blend. The maximum nitric oxide emission of 910 ppm was obtained in B85-D5-H10. Among the above mentioned blends B85-D5-P10 blend has the minimum emission of CO, UBHC and FSN. Thus, this paper discusses the viability of recommending biodiesel-diesel-alcohol blends to fulfill the future energy demands of the world. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many risk factors such as smoking and change of life style have been shown to promote genetic and adaptive epigenetic changes responsible for tumorigenesis. This study brings environmental temperature as a cancer causing factor to light. The cancer mortality rate (CMR) of a country was correlated with 17 different variables. Multivariate analysis of a total of 188 countries found that the average annual temperature (AAT) of a country might have a significant contribution to cancer death when compared with other factors such as alcohol and meat consumption. Univariate analysis found a negative correlation between AAT and CMR. All these countries were categorized into three temperature zones (zone I, −2 to 11.5 °C; number of countries, 38; zone II, 11.6 to 18.6 °C; number of countries, 32; and zone III, 18.7 to 30 °C; number of countries, 118). Out of the top-most 50 countries having the highest CMR, 26 (68.42 %), 10 (31.25 %), and 14 (11.66 %) belong to zone I, zone II, and zone III, respectively. Out of the least 50 countries having the lowest CMR, 1 (2.63 %), 4 (12.5 %), and 45 (37.5 %) belong to zone I, zone II, and zone III, respectively. CMR is low in those countries situated near to the Torrid zone (33° N to 23.5°S), but it is high for those countries situated away from these two latitudes. These data indicate that cold temperature may have a contribution in increasing tumorigenesis. High metabolic stress, which is the result of maintaining our body temperature against a cold environment, could be the possible cause for the higher cancer mortality. © 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).

VL  - 9
SP  - 1889-1896
AB  - Background: Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a small protein that potently promotes the survival of many types of neurons. Detection of GDNF is vital to monitoring the survival of sympathetic and sensory neurons. However, the specific method for GDNF detection is also un-discovered. The purpose of this study is to explore the method for protein detection of GDNF. Methods: A novel visual detection method based on a molecular translator and isothermal strand-displacement polymerization reaction (ISDPR) has been proposed for the detection of GDNF. In this study, a molecular translator was employed to convert the input protein to output deoxyribonucleic acid signal, which was further amplified by ISDPR. The product of ISDPR was detected by a lateral flow biosensor within 30 minutes. Results: This novel visual detection method based on a molecular translator and ISDPR has very high sensitivity and selectivity, with a dynamic response ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL, and the detection limit was 1 pg/mL of GDNF. Conclusion: This novel visual detection method exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity, which is very simple and universal for GDNF detection to help disease therapy in clinical practice. © 2015 Zhang et al.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The cutting temperature is important in machining process. The temperature is a most common effect base on cutting parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. Optimization of the cutting parameter can also reduce of heat temperature. This way can reduce cost and also can produce a good quality of production. Method/Statistical Analysis: In this study focus on effect of machining the aluminum alloy AL6061 by using a various diameter coolant nozzle during CNC lathe process of its inherent advantages. Hence, it also studies the effect of cutting temperature to the surface roughness and dimensional error that will be considered with the parameters to arrive at a conclusive result. Taguchi method orthogonal array L16' was selected as an experimental plan for turning on AL6061 by using CNC PUMA 230 turner with carbide tool insert. The L16' array used 5 factors and 4 levels in conduct the temperature measurement. Findings: Results show that the dominant failure mode is the surface roughness and dimensional accuracy when the nozzle orifice size increases during machining of aluminum alloy AL6061. The exploration for dimensional accuracy, productivity and the optimization of cutting speed in the technical and commercial aspects of the manufacturing processes of aluminum AL6061 are discussed in oil and gas components industries for further work. Applications/Improvements: Conclusion and recommendations will suggest an enhancement to this application.

TI  - An assessment of wheat yield sensitivity and breeding gains in hot environments
VL  - 280
IS  - 1752
AB  - Genetic improvements in heat tolerance of wheat provide a potential adaptation response to long-term warming trends, and may also boost yields in wheat-growing areas already subject to heat stress. Yet there have been few assessments of recent progress in breeding wheat for hot environments. Here, data from 25 years of wheat trials in 76 countries from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) are used to empirically model the response of wheat to environmental variation and assess the genetic gains over time in different environments and for different breeding strategies. Wheat yields exhibited the most sensitivity to warming during the grain-filling stage, typically the hottest part of the season. Sites with high vapour pressure deficit (VPD) exhibited a less negative response to temperatures during this period, probably associated with increased transpirational cooling. Genetic improvements were assessed by using the empirical model to correct observed yield growth for changes in environmental conditions and management over time. These 'climatecorrected' yield trends showed that most of the genetic gains in the high-yield-potential Elite Spring Wheat Yield Trial (ESWYT) were made at cooler temperatures, close to the physiological optimum, with no evidence for genetic gains at the hottest temperatures. In contrast, the Semi-Arid Wheat Yield Trial (SAWYT), a lower-yielding nursery targeted at maintaining yields under stressed conditions, showed the strongest genetic gains at the hottest temperatures. These results imply that targeted breeding efforts help us to ensure progress in building heat tolerance, and that intensified (and possibly new) approaches are needed to improve the yield potential of wheat in hot environments in order to maintain global food security in a warmer climate. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 24

AB  - We have studied the potential of environmental adaptation as a survival mechanism to enable lactic acid bacteria to withstand spray drying. The formulation process of these bacteria exposes them to stresses such as heating and dehydration on daily basis. In the present study, the effect of heat adaptation on subsequent exposure of Lactobacillus lactis subsp. lactis HE-1 cells to various types of lethal stress was examined by comparing the viability of heat-adapted cells with nonadapted ones. The responses of heat-adapted cells to other environmental stresses such as H2O2, heat, acid, and ethanol were also examined. The results showed that heat-adapted cells had a higher survival rate than the non-adapted cells. Morphological analysis was performed to explain the observed differences. The adaptation mechanisms in response to stresses in L. lactis subsp. lactis HE-1 are to be fundamental for survival during spray drying process. © 2015, The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 94

AB  - Knowledge of the degree to which corals undergo physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation in response to changes in their thermal environment is crucial to the success of coral reef conservation strategies. The potential of corals to acclimatize to temperatures exceeding historical thermal regimes was investigated by reciprocal transplantation of Acropora millepora colonies between the warm central and cool southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) for a duration of 14 months. Colony fragments retained at native sites remained healthy, whereas transplanted fragments, although healthy over initial months when temperatures remained within native thermal regimes, subsequently bleached and suffered mortality during seasonal temperature extremes. Corals hosting Symbiodinium D transplanted to the southern GBR bleached in winter and the majority suffered whole (40%; n = 20 colonies) or partial (50%) mortality at temperatures 1.1°C below their 15-year native minimum. In contrast, corals hosting Symbiodinium C2 transplanted to the central GBR bleached in summer and suffered whole (50%; n = 10 colonies) or partial (42%) mortality at temperatures 2.5°C above their 15-year native maximum. During summer bleaching, the dominant Symbiodinium type changed from C2 to D within corals transplanted to the central GBR. Corals transplanted to the cooler, southern GBR grew 74-80% slower than corals at their native site, and only 50% of surviving colonies reproduced, at least partially because of cold water bleaching of transplants. Despite the absence of any visual signs of stress, corals transplanted to the warmer, central GBR grew 52-59% more slowly than corals at their native site before the summer bleaching (i.e., from autumn to spring). Allocation of energy to initial acclimatization or reproduction may explain this pattern, as the majority (65%) of transplants reproduced one month earlier than portions of the same colonies retained at the southern native site. All parameters investigated (bleaching, mortality, Symbiodinium type fidelity, reproductive timing) demonstrated strong interactions between genotype and environment, indicating that the acclimatization potential of A. millepora populations may be limited by adaptation of the holobiont to native thermal regimes. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 8

AB  - Perceptions of climate change by rural communities are centered on observations of variations in temperature and rainfall patterns supported by observations and projections on climate alterations in the form of increased temperatures and scarce rainfall by scientists worldwide. The present study documented perceptions of climate variation and the community's ability to adapt to climate change hazards threatening the production of subsistence crops. Data were collected through interactions with 100 participants. In the study, climate change is explained as variations in temperature and rainfall patterns which resulted in excessive heat, erratic rainfall patterns and drought negatively impacting on subsistence crop production. Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on subsistence crop production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members' indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping. Mulching and the application of kraal manure improve the soil structure and fertility to reduce crop failure. These adaptation measures are resilient to the negative impact of climate hazards and may be helpful in the development of adaptation policies to assist rural communities vulnerable to climate change hazards. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Insurmountable heat: The evolution and persistence of defensive hyperthermia
VL  - 91
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-46
AB  - Fever, the rise in body temperature set point in response to infection or injury, is a highly conserved trait among vertebrates, and documented in many arthropods. Fever is known to reduce illness duration and mortality. These observations present an evolutionary puzzle: why has fever continued to be an effective response to fast-evolving pathogenic microbes across diverse phyla, and probably over countless millions of years? Framing fever as part of a more general thermal manipulation strategy that we term defensive hyperthermia, we hypothesize that the solution lies in the independent contributions to pathogen fitness played by virulence and infectivity. A host organism deploying defensive hyperthermia alters the ecological environment of an invading pathogen. To the extent that the pathogen evolves to be able to function effectively at elevated temperatures, it disadvantages itself at infecting the next (thermonormative) host, becoming more likely to be thwarted by that host’s immune system and outcompeted by wild ecotype conspecifics (a genetically distinct strain adapted to specific environmental conditions) that, although more vulnerable to elevated temperatures, operate more effectively at the host’s normal temperature. We evaluate this hypothesis in light of existing evidence concerning pathogen thermal specialization, and discuss theoretical and translational implications of this model. © 2016 by The University of Chicago Press.

TI  - Effects of different pruning intensity applications on plant shape and yield quality of 'SRA 63' Clementine
VL  - 928
SP  - 273-279
AB  - Pruning of Clementine requires a lot of time: more than 50 days of work per hectare in the traditional forms of orchard management. Because of the high cost and the lack of specialised workers, we observe a general tendency to delay the frequency of pruning in the citrus orchards. On the other hand regular pruning is of fundamental importance to have good fruit quality, to maintain health status of the orchard, and to store their regular productivity. In order to optimise the Clementine pruning technique, reduce the time of execution and maintain a good level of yield of better quality a field experiment was designed. In 1996 a commercial orchard of 'SRA 63' Clementine located in Southern East Sardinia was selected for the experiment. Plants were grafted on 'Troyer' Citrange, twenty-year-old, spaced 7×5 m, shaped to globe, over 4 m in height, and showed an excessive number of main branches (about 7-8 per tree) with a dense canopy. The entire orchard was preliminarily submitted to a gradual shape pruning during the first four years. In 2000 two main plots of 72 plants each were designed: A) pruning every year; and B) pruning every two years. The orchard was observed for a further period of four years for the following characters: trunk section area; canopy size, working time for pruning; pruned wood weight; fruit yield; fruit size. In both pruning applications (A and B) the canopy was more open and green than in the past, with a improvement of the plant heath status, a reduction of the number of treatments, water for irrigation and fertilizers, less working time for harvest, and with a significant better fruit size and increase of the production value.

VL  - 117

SP  - 229-235
AB  - Despite the scant quantitative data available in the literature, it has been hypothesized that some chemical compounds can have deleterious effects on soil stabilization with lime and cements (e.g., nitrates, phosphates and chlorides). This study intends to assess their influence on soil stabilization quantitatively. An original experimental procedure was followed. Selected soils were mixed with a potential deleterious compound at a concentration representative of what can be found in the field. The performance of the different mixtures in terms of soil stabilization was then assessed by performing mechanical tests on samples submitted to several curing conditions (temperature and humidity). The results showed that the tested compounds are likely to alter the soil stabilization processes and thus lower the mechanical performance of the stabilized soil. The results also showed that it is not possible to determine a single threshold value for the compounds considered because their influence on soil stabilization is also a function of the nature of the soil (silt or fine sand), the type of cement (CEM I or CEM II) and the curing conditions.

TI  - Detecting synoptic warming trends across the US Midwest and implications to human health and heat-related mortality
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-96
AB  - This paper highlights and expands on the extensive work concerning extreme heat events, and the environmental and societal factors that affect human health. Selections of this work were presented originally in a Union of Concerned Scientists public report ('Heat in the Heartland'). As humans respond concomitantly to a suite of meteorological variables, we accordingly aim to examine summertime frequencies and characteristics of select synoptic weather types in the Midwestern United States, particularly those associated with elevated health impacts risk. We analyse five major urban centres, paired with five nearby smaller cities, to investigate the potential relative differences due to urban form and size. In virtually all of these locales, the frequency of health-debilitating hot weather types has increased in the six most recent decades, with many of these also demonstrating statistically significant upward trends in air and dew point temperatures. This is most prevalent for overnight temperatures, where the hottest weather types display increasing overnight temperatures in both large and small cities, thus causing the diurnal temperature ranges to decrease. Furthermore, the prevalence of three or more consecutive runs of these days is on the rise, with all five large cities experiencing a higher number of heat waves today than in the late 1940s. We emphasize the importance of city-level efforts to assist in minimizing future climate-related health risks. Finally, we demonstrate the increasing human mortality response in one select city (Detroit, MI), which is estimated without the presence of city-level efforts, targeted interventions, adaptation strategies, or physiological acclimatization. This highlights the importance of providing accurate heat-health warnings to the public, and provides essential understanding of the Midwest US region's summertime climate trends. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB  - To understand whether climate limits current sea turtle nesting distributions and shapes the ecological niche of the terrestrial life-history stage of these wide-ranging marine vertebrates. Location: Coastlines world-wide. Methods: I predicted the spatial distributions of nesting habitat under current climatic conditions for seven sea turtle species using information criteria and maximum entropy modelling. I also compared niche similarity among species using three niche metrics: I, Schoener's D and relative rank. Results: Sea turtles currently nest across their entire bioclimatic envelopes, with up to six species predicted to nest on a single beach. The Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and Australasia support high nesting diversity, with most regional areas supporting three to five species. Despite large overlap in nesting distributions among species, loggerhead and green turtles have the broadest environmental niches, while Kemp's ridley and flatback turtles have very narrow niches. Main conclusions: The terrestrial nesting habitat of sea turtles is characterized by distinct climatic conditions, which are linked to the physical conditions necessary for eggs to hatch successfully and allow hatchlings to disperse from natal areas. Despite broad geographic patterns of overlap and similar embryonic tolerances to temperature and moisture among species, sea turtles partition habitat by nesting in different niche spaces. The tight link between current geographic patterns of nesting and climate, along with the dependence of developing embryos on nest microclimate, imply that regional or global changes in environmental conditions could differentially influence the distribution of sea turtle species under climate change. This could influence the adaptive potential of different populations, and predicting these responses before they occur will be important in mitigating the effects of climate change. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Environmental humidity influences the fitness and geographic distribution of all animals [1]. Insects in particular use humidity cues to navigate the environment, and previous work suggests the existence of specific sensory mechanisms to detect favorable humidity ranges [2-5]. Yet, the molecular and cellular basis of humidity sensing (hygrosensation) remains poorly understood. Here we describe genes and neurons necessary for hygrosensation in the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. We find that members of the Drosophila genus display species-specific humidity preferences related to conditions in their native habitats. Using a simple behavioral assay, we find that the ionotropic receptors IR40a, IR93a, and IR25a are all required for humidity preference in D. melanogaster. Yet, whereas IR40a is selectively required for hygrosensory responses, IR93a and IR25a mediate both humidity and temperature preference. Consistent with this, the expression of IR93a and IR25a includes thermosensory neurons of the arista. In contrast, IR40a is excluded from the arista but is expressed (and required) in specialized neurons innervating pore-less sensilla of the sacculus, a unique invagination of the third antennal segment. Indeed, calcium imaging showed that IR40a neurons directly respond to changes in humidity, and IR40a knockdown or IR93a mutation reduced their responses to stimuli. Taken together, our results suggest that the preference for a specific humidity range depends on specialized sacculus neurons, and that the processing of environmental humidity can happen largely in parallel to that of temperature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 215

SP  - 2220-2225
AB  - Survival of a potentially lethal high temperature stress is a genetically variable thermal adaptation trait in many organisms. Organisms cope with heat stress by basal or induced thermoresistance. Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat stress survival (HSS) in Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a cyclic heat-hardening pre-treatment, for flies that were reared at low (LD) or high (HD) density. Mapping populations were two panels of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously constructed from heat stress-selected stocks: RIL-D48 and RIL-SH2, derived from backcrosses to stocks of low and high heat resistance, respectively. HSS increased with heat hardening in both LD and HD flies. In addition, HSS increased consistently with density in non-hardened flies. There was a significant interaction between heat hardening and density effects in RIL-D48. Several QTL were significant for both density and hardening treatments. Many QTL overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified for other traits in previous studies based on LD cultures only. However, three new QTL were found in HD only (cytological ranges: 12E-16F6; 30A3-34C2; 49C-50C). Previously found thermotolerance QTL were also significant for flies from HD cultures. © 2012.

SP  - 79-121
AB  - Climate change is one of the most important global processes that the Biosphere is experiencing, and fish as a part of the Biosphere are not indifferent to this process. Coldwater fish and, particularly the Brown trout (Salmo trutta), are very sensitive to the predicted changes in temperature of rivers and streams. Fish are poikilotherms and their body temperature and physiological rates are dependent on the environmental temperature, as this is a key factor of their ecological niche. Gill surface is directly related to respiratory capacity which in turn is related to the oxygen content in the water. At the same time, water capacity to contain oxygen depends on the water temperature and thereby growth rate is also linked to temperature. As a consequence, changes in environmental temperature will directly affect Brown trout survival in its thermal limits. Climate change predictions point to Brown trout natural distribution shifting to the North and East and losing southern territories, in its rear edge. Coldwater fish will not only suffer because of extreme and selective summer temperatures but also as a result of thermal changes in the different phases of the life cycle. In many places, Brown trout will bevery close to their limit of physiological efficiency therefore compromising the production of somatic and reproductive biomass. Some ability for adapting to high temperatures is possible but physiological extremes may exist that cannot be forced. Genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity could compensate the effects of changing temperature regimes, but sudden changes might impede adaptation because plasticity is limited. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Summary: Alpine ecosystems are facing rapid human-induced environmental changes, and so more knowledge about tree adaptive potential is needed. This study investigated the relative role of isolation by distance (IBD) versus isolation by adaptation (IBA) in explaining population genetic structure in Abies alba and Larix decidua, based on 231 and 233 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) sampled across 36 and 22 natural populations, respectively, in the Alps and Apennines. Genetic structure was investigated for both geographical and environmental groups, using analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). For each species, nine environmental groups were defined using climate variables selected from a multiple factor analysis. Complementary methods were applied to identify outliers based on these groups, and to test for IBD versus IBA. AMOVA showed weak but significant genetic structure for both species, with higher values in L. decidua. Among the potential outliers detected, up to two loci were found for geographical groups and up to seven for environmental groups. A stronger effect of IBD than IBA was found in both species; nevertheless, once spatial effects had been removed, temperature and soil in A. alba, and precipitation in both species, were relevant factors explaining genetic structure. Based on our findings, in the Alpine region, genetic structure seems to be affected by both geographical isolation and environmental gradients, creating opportunities for local adaptation. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust.

TI  - Correlation Between Environmental Factors, a Life History Trait, Phenotypic Cohesion, and Gene Flow Levels in Natural Populations of Micropogonias furnieri: Is Salinity the Main Factor Driving Divergence?
VL  - 40

AB  - Marine fish are commonly considered to be characterized by limited population structure because of the absence of geographic barriers and the subsequent high levels of gene flow. In spite of this general observation, many cases of genetic geographical divergence have been observed, and natural selection has been suggested to be a causal factor. The white croaker, Micropogonias furnieri, constitutes an excellent model to test for adaptive hypotheses of population divergence, because of its wide geographic distribution along the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The main objective of this study was to analyze the possible effect of natural selection at the genetic level, using microsatellite loci as molecular markers, and to evaluate the effect of environmental variables, trophic preferences, and phenotypic cohesion on the population structure of M. furnieri. The outlier loci analyses suggested that some of the microsatellites analyzed were under divergent selective regimens, and analyses of population genetic structure considering only these loci revealed a stronger differentiation pattern in almost cases than results compared to those obtained with the entire microsatellite data set. Results obtained also revealed a correlation between phenotypic cohesion, salinity, and temperature with genetic structure in white croakers. These results support previous works which proposed that white croakers inhabiting the Río de la Plata estuary constitute a different evolutionary unit, maintained to some extent by selective processes. © 2017, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

TI  - Contrasted thermal preferences translate into divergences in habitat use and realized performance in two sympatric snakes
VL  - 284
IS  - 4
SP  - 265-275
AB  - Temperature influences ectotherm fitness by affecting physiological performance. Terrestrial reptiles behaviourally regulate their body temperature by selecting particular microhabitats or activity periods. In temperate climates, thermal constraints make precise thermoregulation costly. Theoretical models of thermoregulation predict that species in cool environments should exhibit lower optimal temperature for performance and lower thermal preferences to minimize thermoregulatory costs. Empirical data in support of this prediction remain equivocal because several species maintain high and constant body temperatures, even in cool environments. We studied two largely sympatric colubrid snakes, Hierophis viridiflavus and Zamenis longissimus that share numerous morphological and ecological similarities, but differ markedly in thermal preference. Our objective was to quantify their thermoregulatory strategies in the field to determine how thermal preferences translate in habitat use and performance gain. The thermophilic species, H. viridiflavus, selected open microhabitats, whereas Z. longissimus, which prefers cooler temperatures, used a greater diversity of microhabitats. The two species differed markedly in their exposure levels. Hierophis viridiflavus was constrained to shuttle between sun and shade to maintain preferred body temperatures rendering it very exposed, while covered microhabitats were usually thermally compatible with the requirements of Z. longissimus. High exposure was apparently counterbalanced by higher locomotor performances in H. viridiflavus. The divergence in thermal ecology between Z. longissimus and H. viridiflavus likely reflects different trade-offs between energy gain and predator avoidance. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Most temperate-climate lizards become inactive during the winter months of each year. As temperatures drop, they must find appropriate overwintering microhabitats to avoid lethal surface temperatures and/or thermoregulate. The environmental variables that characterize such microhabitats and the cues that lizards utilize to assess them are a critical but understudied component of their natural history. While many studies of overwintering site selection focus on temperature, other factors constituting microhabitats (e.g., surface structures, substrate) may play a role in site selection. We used the Jacky Dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian agamid lizard, to test for preference of using various cover types (leaf litter, open sand, sticks, rocks) for overwintering as well as the consequences of cover type selection. Jacky Dragons preferred overwintering beneath leaves compared to other structures, and this choice was associated with growth during winter, but not with survival. Our study highlights the potential importance of cover structures in overwintering site selection, suggests that midwinter activity may be common in Jacky Dragons, and calls for further study of the winter ecology of temperate-climate lizard species. © 2017 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

AB  - In this paper we structure, obtain and analyze results of an expert elicitation on the relationship between U. S. government Research & Development funding and the likelihood of achieving advances in cellulosic biofuel technologies. While there was disagreement among the experts on each of the technologies, the patterns of disagreement suggest several distinct strategies. Selective Thermal Processing appears to be the most promising path, with the main question being how much funding is required to achieve success. Thus, a staged investment in this path looks promising. With respect to gasification, there remains fundamental disagreement over whether success is possible even at higher funding levels. Thus, basic research into the viability of the path makes sense. The Hydrolysis path induced the widest range of responses from the experts, indicating there may be value in collecting more information on this technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 20
SP  - 116-126
AB  - The potential and adaptive flexibility of population dynamic P-systems (PDP) to study population dynamics suggests that they may be suitable for modelling complex fluvial ecosystems, characterized by a composition of dynamic habitats with many variables that interact simultaneously. Using as a model a reservoir occupied by the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we designed a computational model based on P systems to study the population dynamics of larvae, in order to evaluate management actions to control or eradicate this invasive species. The population dynamics of this species was simulated under different scenarios ranging from the absence of water flow change to a weekly variation with different flow rates, to the actual hydrodynamic situation of an intermediate flow rate. Our results show that POP models can be very useful tools to model complex, partially desynchronized, processes that work in parallel. This allows the study of complex hydroecological processes such as the one presented, where reproductive cycles, temperature and water dynamics are involved in the desynchronization of the population dynamics both, within areas and among them. The results obtained may be useful in the management of other reservoirs with similar hydrodynamic situations in which the presence of this invasive species has been documented.

TI  - Adaptation to enemy shifts: Rapid resistance evolution to local vibrio spp. in invasive pacific oysters
VL  - 282
IS  - 1804
AB  - One hypothesis for the success of invasive species is reduced pathogen burden, resulting from a release from infections or high immunological fitness of invaders. Despite strong selection exerted on the host, the evolutionary response of invaders to newly acquired pathogens has rarely been considered. The two independent and genetically distinct invasions of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas into the North Sea represent an ideal model system to study fast evolutionary responses of invasive populations. By exposing both invasion sources to ubiquitous and phylogenetically diverse pathogens (Vibrio spp.), we demonstrate that within a few generations hosts adapted to newly encountered pathogen communities. However, local adaptation only became apparent in selective environments, i.e. at elevated temperatures reflecting patterns of disease outbreaks in natural populations. Resistance against sympatric and allopatric Vibrio spp. strains was dominantly inherited in crosses between both invasion sources, resulting in an overall higher resistance of admixed individuals than pure lines. Therefore, we suggest that a simple genetic resistance mechanism of the host is matched to a common virulence mechanism shared by local Vibrio strains. This combination might have facilitated a fast evolutionary response that can explain another dimension of why invasive species can be so successful in newly invaded ranges. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Climate-induced potential productivity of forest vegetation during the past 308 years in northern Da Hinggan Mountain region, China
VL  - 37
IS  - 6
SP  - 1900-1911
AB  - Understanding the evolution and mechanisms of climate-induced potential productivity in the climate change sensitive regions of northern Da Hinggan Mountain are fundamental for maintaining the ecosystem balance of northeastern China. The present study employed a meteorological data series from 1707 to 2014 by using standard tree-ring chronology data collection methods and observations from 13 weather stations in northern Da Hinggan Mountain region. Using a Miami model and wavelet analysis, we analyzed the evolution of climate-induced potential productivity and its response to climate change. Results show that four types of climate-induced potential productivity (air temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and standard climate-induced potential productivity (W)) have increased significantly(P ≤ 0.001) since 1707. W has increased at a rate of 1.79 kg hm-2 a-1 in this region since 1707. During the 20th century, the change rate of W caused by climate change peaked at 10.14 kg hm-2 a-1. During the 19th century, the change rate of W caused by climate change reached a minimum of 0.50 kg hm-2 a-1. These values of W were in the mid-range for the 18th(0.66 kg hm-2 a-1) and the 21st(4.79 kg hm-2 a-1)) centuries. The value of W for the analyzed centuries was ranked as the 21st &gt;20th &gt;18th &gt;19th century. The ratio of temperature potential productivity (WT) to precipitation potential productivity (WR) peaked in the 21st century; this century also experienced the highest correlation between precipitation and temperature. The different time scales in the four types of climate-induced potential productivity changed periodically in the wavelet analysis, but was relatively consistent. The first major periodic oscillation of the wavelet analysis was 215–219 years, and other major periodic oscillations in wavelet analysis were at 138, 138, 136, 138 years. W showed a consistently positive trend in northern Da Hinggan Mountain, high, sub-high, and low values of W in Genhe, Tahe, and southern Elunchun Counties of northern Da Hinggan Mountain, respectively. That is, the amplitude of the W gradually decreased from northwest to southeast. Therefore, the geographical environment greatly influenced the value of W as it varied significantly across the region. Climate-induced potential productivity was relatively high in the region with a good correlation between temperature and precipitation. The regional ecosystems are obviously dominated by forest vegetation with lush growth in northern area where the original forest landscape remained more intact than in the south where secondary forest vegetation is dominant. In addition, W was significantly positively correlated with annual air temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. A 1- increase in mean annual air temperature and 10 mm increase in annual precipitation and evapotranspiration could induce an increase in W by 453.71, 74.40, 219.01 kg/ hm2 in standard climate-induced potential productivity, respectively. Overall, air temperature is the main factor influencing any change in W. In the future, a warm-wet climate will be beneficial for the growth of forest vegetation, whereas a cold-dry climate will be unfavorable. Climate change is expected to create a warmer- wetter climate in northern Da Hinggan Mountain region, which could increase the potential productivity. If the temperature increases (or decreases) 1–2°C, precipitation increase would be expected to increase (or decrease) 10%–20%, and the potential productivity based on climatic conditions would increase (or decrease) within a range of 10.9 to 21.7%. These results may provide a basic method for studying potential productivity based on climate change for forest vegetation at regional scales, and an important reference value for future estimations of forest carbon-sinks, implementing carbon trade in the near future, studying ecological security, and formulating ecological function planning in China's northern border. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

VL  - 120
IS  - 6
SP  - 1163-1174
AB  - A cDNA (msaCIG) encoding a cold-inducible Y2K4 dehydrin in alfalfa (Medicagosativa spp. sativa) was shown to share extensive homology with sequences from other species and subspecies of Medicago. Differences were mainly the result of the occurrence of large indels, amino acids substitutions/deletions and sequence duplications. Using a combination of a bulk segregant analysis and RFLP hybridization, we uncovered an msaCIG polymorphism that increases in frequency in response to recurrent selection for superior freezing tolerance. Progenies from crosses between genotypes with (D+) or without (D-) the polymorphic dehydrin significantly differed in their tolerance to subfreezing temperatures. Based on the msaCIG sequence, we looked for intragenic variations that could be associated to the polymorphism detected on Southern blots. Amplifications with primers targeting the 3′ half side of msaCIG revealed fragment size variations between pools of genotypes with (+) or without (-) the polymorphism. Three major groups of amplicons of ≈370 nt (G1), 330 nt (G2), and 290 nt (G3) were distinguished. The G2 group was more intensively amplified in pools of genotypes with the polymorphic dehydrin and was associated to a superior freezing tolerance phenotype. Sequences analysis revealed that size variation in the 3′ half was attributable to the variable occurrence of large indels. Single amino acid substitutions and/or deletions caused major differences in the prediction of the secondary structure of the polypeptides. The identification of dehydrin variants associated to superior freezing tolerance paves the way to the development of functional markers and the fixation of favorable alleles in various genetic backgrounds. © Her Majesty the Queen in Rights of Canada 2009.

TI  - Extremophiles as sources of exopolysaccharides
SP  - 605-619
AB  - Extreme environments, generally characterized by atypical temperatures, pH, pressure, salinity, toxicity and radiation levels, are inhabited by various microorganisms specifically adapted to these particular conditions. These microorganisms, called extremophiles, are of significant biotechnological importance as their enzymes (extremozymes) and biopolymers possess unique properties that offer insights into their biology and evolution. The enthusiastic search for novel extremophiles has largely been stimulated by the uniqueness of their survival mechanisms. This uniqueness can be transformed into valuable applications ranging from wastewater treatment to the diagnosis of infectious and genetic diseases. One adaptation strategy of particular importance to extremophiles is the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that envelop the cell as a barrier protecting them against environmental extremes such as desiccation, temperature, pressure, salinity, acidity, heavy metals, and radiation. Due to their many interesting physicochemical and rheological properties, these biopolymers possess novel functionality that is generally superior to petrochemicalderived polymers in aspects that embrace biodegradability, and environmental and human compatibility. Consequently, biopolymers of extremophiles are widely used in foods, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, textiles, detergents, adhesives, oil-recovery from wells, brewing and waste treatment processes. In this chapter, we present a brief overview of life under extreme environmental conditions. This is followed by a discussion of extremophilic microorganisms and their adaptation mechanisms, and specifically focuses on the production of EPSs and their ecological and physiological functions. The application areas of industrially important EPSs from various extremophilic producer strains are also mentioned. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of the complexity of sunflower growing regions on the genetic progress achieved by breeding programs
VL  - 35
IS  - 57
SP  - 113-122
AB  - Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) breeding programs typically target heterogeneous regions, where large genotype × environment interactions (GEI) complicate genetic progress. Some understanding of the underlying factors, nature and repeatability of GEIs can help to accommodate their effects. This review summarizes the findings of a series of studies conducted in Argentina with the goals of understanding the effect of GEIs on sunflower yield progress and design breeding strategies aimed at impacting on future rates of genetic advance. Pattern analyses revealed that the central and northern subregions are different mega-environments (ME), which suggests that yield gains in the northern ME would have been reduced if selection had been done in central environments and vice versa. Photoperiod and minimum temperature during the reproductive phases are the main environmental factors underlying the observed GEIs. Genetic gain analyses indicated clear and continuous improvements in oil yield due to plant breeding during 25 years and confirmed the prediction about lack of yield gains under the northern ME from selection done in central environments. The central ME showed the highest and most consistent genetic progress, probably because it concentrates most breeding programs and shows the highest repeatability. Breeding progressed to merge the best combinations of two original hybrid groups, reducing the original maturity range within MEs and concentrating on different maturity types among MEs. The model of correlated response to selection indicated that dividing the central-north region of Argentina in central and northern MEs and exploiting specific adaptation would result in faster genetic progress. In the central ME, there is scope to replace years with locations at no costs in heritability. In the northern subregion, trials should be conducted over at least four years. Late planting dates in a central location associated positively with the northern environments in terms of genotypic discrimination; which constitutes an opportunity for indirect selection for the northern ME. Physiological models served to establish the importance of attributes and processes affecting crop performance in the post-anthesis phase in determining the observed genotypeby-planting time interaction. The diameter of the empty center and canopy stay green were found to be efficient secondary indicators related to seed set and duration of grain filling, respectively - indicators that can be used to improve the efficiency of selection for specific adaptation to late plantings and to the northern ME.

AB  - In assisted reproduction, ejaculated semen is either washed immediately for in vitro fertilization or diluted and processed further for optimal low temperature liquid- or cryo-preservation. The extended handling of semen makes sperm vulnerable to organelle and/ or membrane damages. In addition to several important functions, mitochondrion is chiefly responsible for production of detrimental free radicals in spermatozoa. Therefore, direct evaluation of mitochondrial activitymight be useful in semen evaluation protocol as an alternate, more objective and desirable parameter of spermatozoa quality. This is further aided by availability of wide spectral range of fluorescent probes that has advantage of simultaneous multi-parametric assay. Even with availability of several mitochondrial-specific probes, it is sometimes difficult for an investigator to select a most suited dye for experimentation. Therefore, in this review the literature pertaining to role of the mitochondria in the sperm cell, focusing on morphology, maintenance of trans-membrane potential, mechanism involved in generation of reactive species, and comparative analysis of a number of probes used for evaluating mitochondrial function in sperm cells are discussed. Our intention is to present concise information on the technical aspects of various probing methods, and this might be useful for investigators to design experimental approach by proper selection of the dye and for accurate interpretation of the results. © 2016 Hainan Medical College

AB  - Aim: Similar regimes of selection in different geographical settings can deterministically produce similar adaptive morphologies. We tested the hypothesis that the evolutionary trajectories of fish in upwelling zones can be altered by biogeographic contingencies in the biological and physical environment. Location: Eastern Pacific and western Atlantic oceans. Methods: We estimated phylogenetic relationships among eastern Pacific temperate anchovies (genus Engraulis) and tropical anchovies (genus Cetengraulis) with neighbour-joining and Bayesian tree analysis of a 521-bp segment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b. Available sequences for five additional engraulid taxa were included to establish polarity of the tree. Bayesian estimates (BEAST) of time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the nodes in the phylogeny were calibrated with divergence between Cetengraulis edentulus and Cetengraulis mysticetus precipitated by the rise of the Panama Isthmus 2.8-3.2 Ma. Results: Neighbour-joining and Bayesian trees indicate that South American Engraulis anchoita (Argentina) and Engraulis ringens (Chile) together are basal sister taxa to the California anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Old World anchovies (Engraulis japonicas, Engraulis australis, Engraulis capensis and Engraulis encrasicolus). The two tropical species of Cetengraulis are sister-taxa to Californian E. mordax, even though their phenotypes and ecologies differ markedly. A relaxed molecular clock indicates a TMRCA between Californian E. mordax and Cetengraulis at about 4.2 Ma (3.0-6.3 Ma 95% highest probability density). Main conclusions: The TMRCA between the California anchovy, E. mordax, and tropical Cetengraulis coincides with the formation of the Gulf of California, which provided opportunities for allopatric isolation during climate oscillations. Mid-Pliocene warming (3.1-2.9 Ma) may have trapped ancestors of Cetengraulis in the Gulf of California, where they evolved digestive tract morphologies to exploit inshore tropical habitats with low plankton productivities. While populations of several other temperate fishes have become isolated in the Gulf of California, few of these derived species show strong adaptive shifts from temperate sister taxa or range expansions into the tropical provinces of the western Atlantic and eastern Pacific. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Bioassay-directed identification of toxicants in sediments of Liaohe River, northeast China
VL  - 219
SP  - 663-671
AB  - Contaminants accumulated in sediments may directly harm benthic organisms, however, the specific contaminants responsible for adverse effects have been poorly described. In this study, a bioassay directed analysis combined with toxicity tests and chemistry analysis was conducted to determine the compounds eliciting the greatest toxicological effect in the sediments in Liaohe River, northeast China. A total of 24 sediment samples were examined to determine their acute toxicity to midge Chironomus tentans (C. tentans). Of these samples, 15 exhibited significant toxicity, with a mortality of 23%-93% (p < 0.05). Numerous contaminants, including 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 32 polychlorinated biphenyls, 20 organochlorine pesticides, 6 organophosphate pesticides, 8 pyrethroids, and 5 heavy metals were analyzed. On the basis of toxic unit (TU) analysis results, pyrethroids may contribute to the toxicity of 9 of the 15 toxic samples with concentrations of >1 TU. The significant correlation between the TUs of pyrethroids and the mortality of C tentans (r(2) = 0.74, p < 0.01) confirmed the major role of pyrethroids in toxicity. The selected sediment samples responding to piperonyl butoxide and low temperature with the increased toxicity exhibited the characteristics of pyrethroids. The bioassay-based screening framework provided strong evidence that pyrethroids were the primary cause of sediment toxicity in Liaohe River. Further studies should therefore be conducted to regulate this important class of pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Key message: Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediates high frequency of germline transformation of cotton meristem explants. The meristem transformation system we developed is rapid, high throughput and genotype-flexible. We have developed a high throughput cotton transformation system based on direct Agrobacterium inoculation of mechanically isolated meristem explants of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The explants were inoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain, AB33 harboring a 2 T-DNA binary vector pMON114908. This vector contained a gene of interest, an intron-disrupted β-glucuronidase gene in one T-DNA, and a selectable marker gene, aadA in the other T-DNA. Critical factors, such as method of co-culture, culture temperature during selection, composition of selection medium, and selection scheme were found to influence transformation frequency. The cycle time from initial inoculation to the transplanting of transgenic plants to soil was 7-8 weeks. Stable integration of transgenes and their transmission to progeny were confirmed by molecular and genetic analyses. Transgenes segregated in the expected Mendelian fashion in the T1 generation for most of the transgenic events. It was possible to recover marker-free events in the T1 generation when utilizing a binary vector that contained the selectable marker and gene of interest expression cassettes on independent T-DNAs. The procedure presented here has been used to regenerate thousands of independent transgenic events from multiple varieties with numerous constructs, and we believe it represents a major step forward in cotton transformation technology. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Warpage optimisation on the moulded part using response surface methodology (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) optimisation approaches
VL  - 1885
AB  - Todays, many optimisation approaches have been explored by many researchers to find the appropriate processing parameters setting for the injection moulding process. From the previous researches, it was reported that the optimisation work has improved the moulded part quality. In this study, the application of optimisation work to improve warpage of the front panel housing have been explored. By selecting cooling time, coolant temperature, packing pressure and melt temperature as the variable parameters, design of experiment (DOE) have been constructed by using the rotatable central composite design (CCD) approach. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was performed to obtain the mathematical model. This mathematical model then will be used in Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation method as a fitness function to determine the appropriate processing parameters setting which will optimise the warpage condition. Based on the results, Coolant temperature give the most significant contribution to the warpage condition and warpage have optimised by 40.5% after optimisation. The finding shows that the application of optimisation work offers the best quality of moulded part produced. © 2017 Author(s).

TI  - Hypothesis: Cryptochromes and brown fat are essential for adaptation and affect mood and mood-related behaviors
AB  - Solar radiation and ambient temperature have acted as selective physical forces among populations and thereby guided species distributions in the globe. Circadian clocks are universal and evolve when subjected to selection, and their properties contribute to variations in fitness within specific environments. Concerning humans, as compared to the remaining, the "evening owls" have a greater deviation from the 24 h cycle, are under a greater pressure to circadian desynchrony and more prone to a cluster of health hazards with the increased mortality. Because of their position in the hierarchy and repressive actions, cryptochromes are the key components of the feedback loops on which circadian clocks are built. Based on the evidence a new hypothesis is formulated in which brown adipocytes with their cryptochromes are responsive to a broad range of physical stimuli from the habitat and through their activity ensure adaptation of the individual. The over-activated brown adipose tissue with deficient cryptochromes might induce disrupted thermoregulation and circadian desynchrony, and thereby contribute to lowered mood and pronounced depressive behaviors. © 2012 Partonen.

TI  - Variation in rates of spontaneous male production within the nematode species Pristionchus pacificus supports an adaptive role for males and outcrossing
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The nematode species Pristionchus pacificus has an androdioecious mating system in which populations consist of self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and relatively few males. The prevalence of males in such a system is likely to depend on the relative pros and cons of outcrossing. While outcrossing generates novel allelic combinations and can therefore increase adaptive potential, it may also disrupt the potentially beneficial consequences of repeated generations of selfing. These include purging of deleterious alleles, inheritance of co-adapted allele complexes, improved hermaphrodite fitness and increased population growth. Here we use experimental and population genetic approaches to test hypotheses relating to male production and outcrossing in laboratory and natural populations of P. pacificus sampled from the volcanic island of La Réunion. Results: We find a significant interaction between sampling locality and temperature treatment influencing rates of spontaneous male production in the laboratory. While strains isolated at higher altitude, cooler localities produce a higher proportion of male offspring at 25 °C relative to 20 or 15 °C, the reverse pattern is seen in strains isolated from warmer, low altitude localities. Linkage disequilibrium extends across long physical distances, but fails to approach levels reported for the partially selfing nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans. Finally, we find evidence for admixture between divergent genetic lineages. Conclusions: Elevated rates of laboratory male generation appear to occur under environmental conditions which differ from those experienced by populations in nature. Such elevated male generation may result in higher outcrossing rates, hence driving increased effective recombination and the creation of potentially adaptive novel allelic combinations. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium decay support selfing as the predominant reproductive strategy in P. pacificus. Finally, despite the potential for outcrossing depression, our results suggest admixture has occurred between distinct genetic lineages since their independent colonization of the island, suggesting outcrossing depression may not be uniform in this species. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - The critical limiting temperature and selective brain cooling: Neuroprotection during exercise?
VL  - 27
IS  - 6
SP  - 582-590
AB  - There is wide consensus that long duration exercise in the heat is impaired compared with cooler conditions. A common observation when examining exercise tolerance in the heat in laboratory studies is the critical limiting core temperature (CLT) and the apparent attenuation in central nervous system (CNS) drive leading to premature fatigue. Selective brain cooling (SBC) purportedly confers neuroprotection during exercise heat stress by attenuating the increase in brain temperature. As the CLT is dependent on heating to invoke a reduction in efferent drive, it is thus not compatible with SBC which supposedly attenuates the rise in brain temperature. Therefore, the CLT and SBC hypotheses cannot be complimentary if the goal is to confer neuroprotection from thermal insult as it is counter-intuitive to selectively cool the brain if the purpose of rising brain temperature is to down-regulate skeletal muscle recruitment. This presents a circular model for which there is no apparent end to the ultimate physiological outcome; a 'hot brain' selectively cooled in order to reduce the CNS drive to skeletal muscle. This review will examine the postulates of the CLT and SBC with their relationship to the avoidance of a 'hot brain' which together argue for a theoretical position against neuroprotection as the key physiological strategy in exercise-induced hyperthermia. © 2011 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - Does sex-ratio selection influence nest-site choice in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination?
VL  - 280
IS  - 1772
AB  - Evolutionary theory predicts that dioecious species should produce a balanced primary sex ratio maintained by frequency-dependent selection. Organisms with environmental sex determination, however, are vulnerable to maladaptive sex ratios, because environmental conditions vary spatio-temporally. For reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination, nest-site choice is a behavioural maternal effect that could respond to sex-ratio selection, as mothers could adjust offspring sex ratios by choosing nest sites that will have particular thermal properties. This theoretical prediction has generated decades of empirical research, yet convincing evidence that sex-ratio selection is influencing nesting behaviours remains absent. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence from nature that sex-ratio selection, rather than only viability selection, is probably an important component of nest-site choice in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination.We compare painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) neonates from maternally selected nest sites with those from randomly selected nest sites, observing no substantive difference in hatching success or survival, but finding a profound difference in offspring sex ratio in the direction expected based on historical records. Additionally, we leverage long-term data to reconstruct our sex ratio results had the experiment been repeated in multiple years. As predicted by theory, our results suggest that sex-ratio selection has shaped nesting behaviour in ways likely to enhance maternal fitness. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 168
SP  - 60-67
AB  - Dielectric properties of egg white powder (EWP) in the moisture content range of 5.5-13.4% d.b. were measured with an impedance analyzer employing a coaxial probe technique in the frequency range from 10 to 3000 MHz and temperature range from 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C. The dielectric properties of EWP were maximum in the frequency range of 250-300 MHz for temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 100 degrees C at all moisture content levels. The dielectric constant and loss factor values of EWP increased with an increase in moisture content and temperature. The second-order models were fitted for experimental dielectric constant and loss factor data as a function of moisture content and temperature at five selected radio (13.56, 27.12 and 40.68 MHz) and microwave (915 and 2450 MHz) frequencies with coefficients of determination >= 0.939. Penetration depths of EWP were calculated for five selected frequencies at different moisture contents and temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hydrogen sulfide in thermal spring waters and its action on bacteria of human origin
VL  - 108
SP  - 210-214
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a molecule dissolved in many thermal spring waters at variable concentration. The H2S effects of thermal waters treatments have long been studied, for dermatological and clinical treatments, but its role in recreational waters was never investigated. The use of sulfur spring waters in pools raises concerns related to disinfection by oxidants. The aim of this work is to evaluate the survival rate of microbial species in waters with different titers of H2S. Four selected thermal waters collected from Italian springs, belonging to different chemical categories, have been tested in comparison to Tyrrhenian sea water and natural mineral bottled water. Results show inhibition properties on bacterial proliferation that seem related to H2S concentrations. To further asses this phenomenon H2S was added to thermal and natural mineral waters. The results strongly support a bactericidal role of H2S in thermal spring waters used for recreational purposes. These observations open up new perspectives for a disinfectant role of H2S in pool treatment and management. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genetic Advances in Adapting Rice to a Rapidly Changing Climate
VL  - 198

SP  - 360-373
AB  - Rice, with its wide geographic distribution extending from 50°N to 35°S, is expected to be the most vulnerable cultivated crop to future changing climates. Among the different abiotic stresses, extreme temperatures coinciding with critical developmental stages, increasingly frequent floods and drought spells, and worsening sea water inundation are some of the major threats to sustainable rice productivity. Following the successful implementation of molecular marker-assisted backcrossing to introgress large-effect QTL for submergence tolerance in rice mega varieties, rice breeding for drought, salinity and, recently, heat tolerance is employing the same approach. Although tolerance for combined submergence and salinity has been achieved, developing rice varieties with multiple tolerance for other abiotic and biotic stresses and finding the appropriate agronomic package to exploit their performance remain a challenge. The major bottleneck is the lack of unidentified large-effect QTL for other abiotic stresses that are strongly influenced by genotype × environment (G × E) interaction. Rapid advances in the use of molecular tools, including a plethora of SNP markers, are expected to facilitate the development of major abiotic stress-tolerant rice. In response to the actual farmer field situation, progress achieved in understanding and developing independent abiotic stress tolerance is being exploited to combine tolerances (for example, heat and drought; salinity and submergence) to address emerging environmental problems across a wide range of rice ecosystems. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

VL  - 147
IS  - 2
SP  - 82-89
AB  - Here we report the viability of natural chromosomal O-inversion structural homo- and heterokaryotypes in a population of D. subobscura from Avala Mountain, Serbia, subjected to cold and heat stress during spring 2004. These results were compared with those observed in the same population in September 2004. We detected protection of a great number of lethal genes in O-chromosome lethal heterozygous combinations, independently of inversion backgrounds and temperature stress. The positive epistatic interactions of mildly-deleterious genes observed only in O-inversion heterokaryotypes (at distinct temperatures) and lethal genes in O-inversion homokaryotypes (under temperature stress only) could be responsible for reducing the genetic load. The seasonal fluctuations in frequencies of several chromosomal arrangements and karyotypes indicate a seasonal adaptation to changeable environmental conditions. The sample of D. subobscura collected in spring 2004 was tolerant to cold but not to heat, and these results point to tolerance to extreme low temperatures, possibly as a result of natural selection. Also, a non-random distribution of distinct combinations of viability classes among several O-inversion karyotypes (under both optimal conditions and heat stress) was observed. This observation could be taken as evidence of co-adaptation: different capacities of several O-inversion karyotypes with different combinations of genes to tolerate a range of temperatures. We conclude that frequency-dependent and supergene selection are balancing selection mechanisms and are responsible for the protection of chromosomal inversions in natural populations of D. subobscura. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Relationship between behavior and physiology in an invasive pest species: Oviposition site selection and temperature-dependent development of the oriental fruit moth (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae)
VL  - 39
IS  - 2
SP  - 561-569
AB  - Oviposition site selection is crucial for the reproductive success of a herbivore insect species with relatively sedentary larvae. The optimal oviposition theory, i.e., the preference-performance hypothesis, has thus far mainly been tested with a focus on nutritional quality of the host. This study investigates whether female oriental fruit moth Grapholita (Cyclic) molesta choose a microhabitat for oviposition characterized by a temperature range within which their offspring perform best. Thermal preferences of females during oviposition were assessed in a circular temperature gradient arena. Offspring performance and survival were assessed under different constant temperature conditions. Females preferred oviposition sites of similar to 30 degrees C over lower and higher temperatures. At this temperature, egg, larval, and pupal development was significantly faster than at 22 and 25 degrees C, and larval development was also faster than at 33 degrees C. At 30 degrees C and at the lower temperatures tested, survival of eggs and larvae was significantly higher than at 33 degrees C, whereas development was precluded at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, female pupal weight attained at 30 and 33 degrees C exceeded that reached at the lower temperatures tested. Considering the potentially reduced predation risk caused by the shorter developmental time of eggs and larvae, the laboratory data suggest that this species maximizes its fitness by selecting a thermally optimal environment for its offspring, supporting the optimal oviposition theory. Conversely, it is known that the codling moth (C. pomonella) lacks a mechanism to avoid temperatures lethal to progeny development, which may reflect the differences in geographic ranges of these tortricids.

TI  - Acute survivorship of the deep-sea coral Lophelia pertusa from the Gulf of Mexico under acidification, warming, and deoxygenation
VL  - 1
AB  - Changing global climate due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are driving rapid changes in the physical and chemical environment of the oceans via warming, deoxygenation, and acidification. These changes may threaten the persistence of species and populations across a range of latitudes and depths, including species that support diverse biological communities that in turn provide ecological stability and support commercial interests. Worldwide, but particularly in the North Atlantic and deep Gulf of Mexico, Lophelia pertusa forms expansive reefs that support biological communities whose diversity rivals that of tropical coral reefs. In this study, L. pertusa colonies were collected from the Viosca Knoll region in the Gulf of Mexico (390 to 450 m depth), genotyped using microsatellite markers, and exposed to a series of treatments testing survivorship responses to acidification, warming, and deoxygenation. All coral nubbins survived the acidification scenarios tested, between pH of 7.67 and 7.90 and aragonite saturation states of 0.92 and 1.47. However, net calcification generally declined with respect to pH, though a disparate response was evident where select individuals net calcified and others exhibited net dissolution near a saturation state of 1. Warming and deoxygenation both had negative effects on survivorship, with up to 100% mortality observed at temperatures above 14°C and oxygen concentrations of approximately 1.5 ml· l-1. These results suggest that, over the short-term, climate change and OA may negatively impact L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico, though the potential for acclimation and the effects of genetic background should be considered in future research. © 2014 Lunden, McNicholl, Sears, Morrison and Cordes.

AB  - Pure Mysore and two bivoltine breeds NH4D2 and CSR2 were reared at 25°C, 30°C and 35°C and 75-80 RH% from a day before 4th moult till spinning. Larval weight, larval duration, silk gland weight, silk gland - somatic index, silk conversion index, silk productivity, ERR, rate of cocooning, cocoon yield, cocoon weight, shell weight, shell percentage, filament length and fecundity were significantly reduced at 35°C than at 30°C. The economic characters were affected more in bivoltine races than in PM, and in CSR2 than in NB4 D2 in the two bivoltine races. Expression of economic characters, when late age worms were held at high temperature, has a functional value in the selection of high temperature tolerant breeds. The physiological basis of temperature compensation in the expression of economic traits in races having different limits of high temperature tolerance is examined. The severity of impairment of economic traits, and the time and the number of larvae and pupae died have a strong racial bias.

TI  - Heritability estimates for male proportion in the GIFT Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.)
VL  - 372
SP  - 137-148
AB  - The main goal of this study was to estimate the heritability of the proportion of phenotypic males in progeny of Nile tilapia broodstock based on visually scored sex from six consecutive pedigreed generations from the GIFT project. Mean male proportion was 0.44 across all generations, ranging from 0.37 to 0.56 across generations and environments. Across all generations there was a low but significant "additive" genetic component for male proportion with heritability estimates of 0.12+/-0.02 (observed scale) and 0.22+/-0.04 (underlying liability scale). The within generation heritability estimates varied from 0.00+/-0.03 to 0.25+/-0.07 on the observed scale, and from 0.11+/-0.02 to 0.32+/-0.07 on the underlying liability scale. As expected, genetic correlations between male proportion in the different post-nursery test environments were in 16 out of 17 cases not significantly different from unity (P>0.05) since sex was determined before fish were stocked in the different test environments, indicating no or the same degree of sex dependent mortality among the families in the different environments. In general, the regression coefficient of raw family means on the estimated mean family breeding values is expected to be unity for a normal polygenic trait. The regression coefficient of observed full-sib family male proportions on the associated mid-parent estimated breeding values across generations (omitting the records of the 1st generation offspring of each breeder, one generation at a time) was significantly different (P<0.01) from unity (0.64+/-0.12). This suggests that the magnitude of the genetic variation in male proportion found in this study may be biased upwards by some parents having a phenotypic sex different from that determined by the major sex determining system (XX/XY). Selection for increased male proportion based solely on family means may lead to an increased fraction of masculinized XX males. If a "normal" (XXxXY) mating produces a significantly skewed sex ratio, this has to be a result of either 1) masculinizing/feminizing of XX/XY offspring, 2) differing viability of "male" and "female" sperm, or 3) sex-specific mortalities prior to recording of sex. Thus, selecting males from "high male" families may involve selecting XX sires, which will counteract the response to selection as all their offspring will be XX females. Genetic selection for increased male proportion in a purebred population (without the use of temperature treatment) is expected to be difficult. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-throughput strategies for penicillin G acylase production in rE. coli fed-batch cultivations
VL  - 14
AB  - Background: Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is used industrially to catalyze the hydrolysis of penicillin G to obtain 6-aminopenicillanic acid. In Escherichia coli, the most-studied microorganism for PGA production, this enzyme accumulates in the periplasmic cell space, and temperature plays an important role in the correct synthesis of its subunits.Results: This work investigates the influence of medium composition, cultivation strategy, and temperature on PGA production by recombinant E. coli cells. Shake flask cultures carried out using induction temperatures ranging from 18 to 28°C revealed that the specific enzyme activity achieved at 20°C (3000 IU gDCW-1) was 6-fold higher than the value obtained at 28°C. Auto-induction and high cell density fed-batch bioreactor cultures were performed using the selected induction temperature, with both defined and complex media, and IPTG and lactose as inducers. Final biomass concentrations of 100 and 120 gDCW L-1, and maximum enzyme productivities of 7800 and 5556 IU L-1 h-1, were achieved for high cell density cultures using complex and defined media, respectively.Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, the volumetric enzyme activity and productivity values achieved using the complex medium are the highest ever reported for PGA production using E. coli. Overall PGA recovery yields of 64 and 72% after purification were achieved for crude extracts obtained from cells cultivated in defined and complex media, respectively. The complex medium was the most cost-effective for PGA production, and could be used in both high cell density and straightforward auto-induction protocols. © 2014 Vélez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 53
SP  - 30-35
AB  - Marine microorganisms are a potential source of enzymes with structural stability, high activity at low temperature and unique substrate selectivity. Thraustochytrids are marine heterotrophic microbes, well known for the production of omega-3 fatty acids. In this study the effect of Tween 80 as a carbon source was investigated with regard to biomass, lipase and lipid productivity in Schizochytrium sp. S31. Tween 80 (1%) and 120 h of incubation were the optimum condition period for biomass, lipid and lipase productivity in a stirred tank reactor. The yields obtained were 0.9 g L-1 of biomass, 300 mgg(-1) of lipid and 39 U/g of lipase activity. Sonication was optimised in terms of time and acoustic power to maximise the yield of extracted lipase. The extracted lipase from Schizochytrium S31 was observed to hydrolyse long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA and EPA. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Determinant factors in the production of a co-occluded binary mixture of Helicoverpa armigera Alphabaculovirus (HearNPV) genotypes with desirable insecticidal characteristics
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
AB  - A co-occluded binary mixture of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus genotypes HearSP1B and HearLB6 at a 1:1 ratio (HearSP1B+HearLB6) was selected for the development of a virus-based biological insecticide, which requires an efficient large-scale production system. In vivo production systems require optimization studies in each host-virus pathosystem. In the present study, the effects of larval instar, rearing density, timing of inoculation, inoculum concentration and temperature on the production of HearSP1B+HearLB6 in its homologous host were evaluated. The high prevalence of cannibalism in infected larvae (40-87%) indicated that insects require individual rearing to avoid major losses in OB production. The OB production of recently molted fifth instars (7.0 x 109 OBs/larva), combined with a high prevalence of mortality (85.7%), resulted in the highest overall OB yield (6.0 x 1011 OBs/100 inoculated larvae), compared to those of third or fourth instars. However, as inoculum concentration did not influence final OB yield, the lowest concentration, LC80 (5.5 x 106 OBs/ml), was selected. Incubation temperature did not significantly influence OB yield, although larvae maintained at 30°C died 13 and 34 hours earlier than those incubated at 26°C and 23°C, respectively. We conclude that the efficient production of HearSP1B+HearLB6 OBs involves inoculation of recently molted fifth instars with a LC80 concentration of OBs followed by individual rearing at 30°C. © 2016 Arrizubieta et al.

TI  - Sensitivity of inland decay of North Atlantic tropical cyclones to soil parameters
VL  - 63
IS  - 3
SP  - 1527-1542
AB  - Using the HURDAT best track analysis of track and intensity of tropical cyclones that made landfall over the continental United States during the satellite era (1980-2005), we analyze the role of land surface variables on the cyclone decay process. The land surface variables considered in the present study included soil parameters (soil heat capacity and its surrogate soil bulk density), roughness, topography and local gradients of topography. The sensitivity analysis was carried out using a data-adaptive genetic algorithm approach that automatically selects the most suitable variables by fitting optimum empirical functions that estimates cyclone intensity decay in terms of given observed variables. Analysis indicates that soil bulk density (soil heat capacity) has a dominant influence on cyclone decay process. The decayed inland cyclone intensities were found to be positively correlated with the cube of the soil bulk density (heat capacity). The impact of the changes in soil bulk density (heat capacity) on the decayed cyclone intensity is higher for higher intensity cyclones. Since soil bulk density is closely related to the soil heat capacity and inversely proportional to the thermal diffusivity, the observed relationship can also be viewed as the influence of cooling rate of the land surface, as well as the transfer of heat and moisture underneath a land-falling storm. The optimized prediction function obtained by statistical model processes in the present study that predicts inland intensity changes during 6-h interval showed high fitness index and small errors. The performance of the prediction function was tested on inland tracks of eighteen hurricanes and tropical storms that made landfall over the United States between 2001 and 2010. The mean error of intensity prediction for these cyclones varied from 1.3 to 15.8 knots (0.67-8.12 m s -1). Results from the data-driven analysis thus indicate that soil heat flux feedback should be an important consideration for the inland decay of tropical cyclones. Experiments were also undertaken using Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) Advanced Research Version (ARW ver 3.3) to assess the sensitivity of the soil parameters (roughness, heat capacity and bulk density) on the post-landfall structure of select storms. The model was run with 1-km grid spacing, limited area single domain with boundary conditions from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Of different experiments, only the surface roughness change and soil bulk density (heat capacity) change experiments showed some sensitivity to the intensity change. The WRF results thus have a low sensitivity to the land parameters (with only the roughness length showing some impact). This calls for reassessing the land surface response on post-landfall characteristics with more detailed land surface representation within the mesoscale and hurricane modeling systems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 23

SP  - 1699-1707
AB  - Individuals can adapt to heterogeneity in their environment through either local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Colour forms of the ladybird Harmonia axyridis are a classic example of local adaptation, in which the frequency of melanic forms varies greatly between populations. In some populations, there are also large seasonal changes in allele frequency, with melanism being costly in summer and beneficial in winter. We report that the non-melanic morph of H. axyridis dramatically increases its degree of melanization at cold temperatures. Furthermore, there is genetic variation in reaction norms, with different families responding to temperature in different ways. Variation at different spatial and temporal scales appears to have selected for either genetic or phenotypically plastic adaptations, which may be important in thermoregulation. As melanism is known to have a large effect on fitness in H. axyridis, this plasticity of melanization may have hastened its spread as an invasive species. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Driving factors of a vegetation shift from Scots pine to pubescent oak in dry Alpine forests
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 229-240
AB  - An increasing number of studies have reported on forest declines and vegetation shifts triggered by drought. In the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais), one of the driest inner-Alpine regions, the species composition in low elevation forests is changing: The sub-boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) dominating the dry forests is showing high mortality rates. Concurrently the sub-Mediterranean pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) has locally increased in abundance. However, it remains unclear whether this local change in species composition is part of a larger-scale vegetation shift. To study variability in mortality and regeneration in these dry forests we analysed data from the Swiss national forest inventory (NFI) on a regular grid between 1983 and 2003, and combined it with annual mortality data from a monitoring site. Pine mortality was found to be highest at low elevation (below 1000 m a.s.l.). Annual variation in pine mortality was correlated with a drought index computed for the summer months prior to observed tree death. A generalized linear mixed-effects model indicated for the NFI data increased pine mortality on dryer sites with high stand competition, particularly for small-diameter trees. Pine regeneration was low in comparison to its occurrence in the overstorey, whereas oak regeneration was comparably abundant. Although both species regenerated well at dry sites, pine regeneration was favoured at cooler sites at higher altitude and oak regeneration was more frequent at warmer sites, indicating a higher adaptation potential of oaks under future warming. Our results thus suggest that an extended shift in species composition is actually occurring in the pine forests in the Valais. The main driving factors are found to be climatic variability, particularly drought, and variability in stand structure and topography. Thus, pine forests at low elevations are developing into oak forests with unknown consequences for these ecosystems and their goods and services. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Quantifying relationships between land-use gradients and structural and functional indicators of stream ecological integrity
VL  - 57
IS  - 1
SP  - 74-90
AB  - 1.Modification of natural landscapes and land-use intensification are global phenomena that can result in a range of differing pressures on lotic ecosystems. We analysed national-scale databases to quantify the relationship between three land uses (indigenous vegetation, urbanisation and agriculture) and indicators of stream ecological integrity. Boosted regression tree modelling was used to test the response of 14 indicators belonging to four groups - water quality (at 578 sites), benthic invertebrates (at 2666 sites), fish (at 6858 sites) and ecosystem processes (at 156 sites). Our aims were to characterise the ecological response curves of selected functional and structural metrics in relation to three land uses, examine the environmental moderators of these relationships and quantify the relative utility of metrics as indicators of stream ecological integrity. 2.The strongest indicators of land-use effects were nitrate+nitrite, delta-15 nitrogen value (δ15N) of primary consumers and the Macroinvertebrate Community Index (a biotic index of organic pollution), while the weakest overall indicators were gross primary productivity, benthic invertebrate richness and fish richness. All indicators declined in response to removal of indigenous vegetation and urbanisation, while variable responses to agricultural intensity were observed for some indicators. 3.The response curves for several indicators suggested distinct thresholds in response to urbanisation and agriculture, specifically at 10% impervious cover and at 0.1gm-3 nitrogen concentration, respectively. 4.Water quality and ecosystem process indicators were influenced by a combination of temperature, slope and flow variables, whereas for macroinvertebrate indicators, catchment rainfall, segment slope and temperature were significant environmental predictor variables. Downstream variables (e.g. distance to the coast) were significant in explaining residual variation in fish indicators, not surprisingly given the preponderance of diadromous fish species in New Zealand waterways. The inclusion of continuous environmental variables used to develop a stream typology improved model performance more than the inclusion of stream type alone. 5.Our results reaffirm the importance of accounting for underlying spatial variation in the environment when quantifying relationships between land use and the ecological integrity of streams. Of distinctive interest, however, were the contrasting and complementary responses of different indicators of stream integrity to land use, suggesting that multiple indicators are required to identify land-use impact thresholds, develop environmental standards and assign ecological scores for reporting purposes. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 348

AB  - H2O2 was directly synthesized from the elements over supported I'd membranes in O-2-saturated, aqueous H2SO4 (0.03 mol/l) between 303 and 348 K while feeding H-2 through the membrane. The H2O2 yield increased with temperature despite H2O2 selectivity declining simultaneously due to faster H2O2 decomposition. Both H2O2 yield and selectivity improved with H-2 feed pressure, however. Comparison of H-2 consumption during H2O2 synthesis with the intrinsic membrane H-2 permeability and the energetics of H-2 oxidation on Pd surfaces revealed that the H2O2 productivity gain with temperature was primarily owed to the acceleration of reaction kinetics. The H2O2 selectivity enhancement with H-2 feed pressure is attributed to the inhibition of direct H2O formation as a result of hindered O-2 dissociation due to blocking of O atom adsorption sites on the membrane surface because of increasing occupation by H atoms. H2O2. decomposition and reduction on the Pd membrane surface accelerate much faster with temperature than H2O2 formation and need to be suppressed in order to maximize H2O2 yield and H-2 utilization at higher temperatures.

AB  - California's Mediterranean agro-ecosystems are a major source of U.S. fruits and vegetables, and vulnerable to future extremes of precipitation and temperature brought on by climate change, including increased drought and flooding, and more intense and longer heat waves. To develop resilience to these threats, strategies are necessary for climate-smart management of soil and water. Long-term, large-scale, replicated ecological experiments provide unique testbeds for studying such questions. At the UC Davis Russell Ranch Sustainable Agriculture Facility (RRSAF), the 100-year Century Experiment, initiated in 1992, is investigating the effects of multiple farming practices in a farm-scale replicated study of 10 row crop cropping systems. It includes different fertility management systems: organic, conventional and hybrid (conventional plus winter cover crop) systems; different crops: wheat, tomatoes, corn, alfalfa, cover crops and grasslands; and different irrigation systems: rainfed, flood irrigated and drip irrigated. We briefly describe and report on a selection of long-term experiments conducted at RRSAF investigating soil management and irrigation practices, which are an important focus for developing climate-smart strategies in Mediterranean systems. For example, long-term monitoring of soil carbon content revealed that most crop systems have experienced a small increase in soil carbon since 1993, and increases in organically managed plots were substantially higher. As RRSAF continues to build upon this rich dataset from one of a very few long-term row crop experiments in Mediterranean ecosystems, it provides a testbed for identifying climate-smart solutions for these agronomically important ecosystems.

SP  - 1197-1208
AB  - Marine and freshwater phytoplankton populations often show large clonal diversity, which is in disagreement with clonal selection of the most vigorous genotype(s). Temporal fluctuation in selection pressures in variable environments is a leading explanation for maintenance of such genetic diversity. To test the influence of temperature as a selection force in continually (seasonally) changing aquatic systems we carried out reaction norms experiments on co-occurring clonal genotypes of a ubiquitous diatom species, Asterionella formosa Hassall, across an environmentally relevant range of temperatures. We report within population genetic diversity and extensive diversity in genotype-specific reaction norms in growth rates and cell size traits. Our results showed genotype by environment interactions, indicating that no genotype could outgrow all others across all temperature environments. Subsequently, we constructed a model to simulate the relative proportion of each genotype in a hypothetical population based on genotype and temperature-specific population growth rates. This model was run with different seasonal temperature patterns. Our modeling exercise showed a succession of two to several genotypes becoming numerically dominant depending on the underlying temperature pattern. The results suggest that (temperature) context dependent fitness may contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity in isolated populations of clonally reproducing microorganisms in temporally variable environments. © 2012 Phycological Society of America.

SP  - 851-856
AB  - Internal and external influences determine the work output that can be achieved on any given day. One factor is external temperature, with a significant effect on the ability of workers to work outdoors. If temperatures are too hot or cold, losses of productivity occur and the labor consumption rate increases. This paper presents a survey indicating the percentage labor consumption rate increase to be factored in as a result of suboptimal external temperatures during reinforced concrete works. An example demonstrates how much the selection of the construction start date influences construction costs if the survey findings are taken into account. Both deterministic and probabilistic calculations were performed to address the uncertainties included in the equations and to illustrate the results in histograms and curves. For this purpose, Monte-Carlo simulations made it possible to assign distribution functions to individual input parameters to carry out the calculations. Potential savings were identified that result from choosing a favorable construction start date. In the event of any disruptions or delays, the potential effects on the labor consumption rate can be assessed systematically with respect to chances and risks. Copyright © 2015 ISEC Press.

VL  - 52

SP  - 6818-6828
AB  - The annual freeze/thaw (FT) cycle determines the potential growing season in boreal landscapes and is a major factor determining ecosystem productivity and associated exchange of trace gases (CO2), H2O) with the atmosphere. Accurate characterization of these processes can improve regional assessment of seasonal carbon dynamics and climate feedbacks. FT process variations are spatially and temporally complex due to topography, snow depth and wetness, land cover, or local climatic conditions. In this paper, we perform a landscape analysis of multifrequency and multitemporal satellite microwave remote sensing measurements at L-band (JERS-1), C-band (ERS), and Ku-band (QuikSCAT) for characterizing FT dynamics. We first analyze backscatter sensitivity of the three frequencies to FT conditions over selected Alaska temperature sites. We then apply an FT classifier over two study areas (wetland complex and moderate topography) and examine differences in FT timing according to vegetation, elevation, and north/south facing slope. Results show that L-, C-, and Ku-band backscatter are sensitive to landscape FT state transitions, with higher backscatter for nonfrozen than frozen conditions at C- and L-bands but the opposite response at Ku-band. We applied a change detection algorithm to the C-band and L-band data over both study areas and analyzed the FT classifications with land cover information. These results resolve characteristic patterns of earlier spring thawing for south facing slopes, lower elevations, and coniferous vegetation. Our results also inform similar FT algorithm development for the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive mission by documenting L-band FT sensitivity and heterogeneity over a boreal landscape. © 1980-2012 IEEE.

TI  - A new methodology to select the thermal solar collectors by localizations and applications
AB  - The temperature requirements of the majority of solar thermal collector's applications is between 40°C and 260°C. The characteristics of low to medium-high temperature solar collectors are given and an overview of the relation between the efficiency and operating temperature of existing technologies is presented. Four thermal collectors have been considered in this study varying from the simple stationary flat plate to a movable parabolic trough one. Based on theoretical studies of solar systems, a mapping for various solar technologies was performed to different climate zones and different heat demand. The study was based on three criteria. Firstly, the industrial process heat demand, secondly, the efficiency of the solar thermal collectors (STC) and at last, the solar potential in different localizations. The viabilities of the systems depend primarily on these criteria. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - High ethylene productivity through the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane has been achieved in a catalytic membrane reactor based on a highly solid-state oxygen permeable material (Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ). Ethylene is selectively produced by avoiding the direct contact of molecular oxygen and hydrocarbons, thereby minimizing the oxygen concentration in the reaction side. Another key aspect in the process is the dilution of ethane in the feed to achieve high ethylene yields. There exists a specific combination of the ethane concentration and feed flow that maximizes ethylene productivity, whereas the diluting gas nature has a direct impact on the formation of higher olefins and coking issues. Indeed, the use of methane as an almost-inert dilutant allows the reduction of oligomerization and aromatization of the formed ethylene and therefore improves the reactor stability even at operating temperatures from 800 to 900°C. This behavior is attributed to the competitive adsorption of methane and ethane/ethylene, the modification of the radical-driven homogeneous reaction, and the change of partially reducible membrane surface. The productivity values achieved at 850°C were 383mLmin-1cm-2 for Ar and 353mLmin-1cm-2 for CH4, with a selectivity of 80 and 90%, respectively. Straight on through to the other side: Catalytic membrane reactors based on solid-state oxygen conductors enabled us to achieve high ethylene productivity through the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The selectivity is maximized by preventing the direct contact of molecular oxygen and hydrocarbons, by properly selecting the temperature and inlet gas flow rates, and by using methane as a diluting agent. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

TI  - The non-essential mycolic acid biosynthesis genes hadA and hadC contribute to the physiology and fitness of Mycobacterium smegmatis
VL  - 10
IS  - 12
AB  - Gram positive mycobacteria with a high GC content, such as the etiological agent of tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possess an outer membrane mainly composed of mycolic acids (MAs), the so-called mycomembrane, which is essential for the cell. About thirty genes are involved in the biosynthesis of MAs, which include the hadA, hadB and hadC genes that encode the dehydratases Fatty Acid Synthase type II (FAS-II) known to function as the heterodimers HadA-HadB and HadB-HadC. The present study shows that M. smegmatis cells remain viable in the absence of either HadA and HadC or both. Inactivation of HadC has a dramatic effect on the physiology and fitness of the mutant strains whereas that of HadA exacerbates the phenotype of a hadC deletion. The hadC mutants exhibit a novel MA profile, display a distinct colony morphology, are less aggregated, are impaired for sliding motility and biofilm development and are more resistant to detergent. Conversely, the hadC mutants are significantly more susceptible to low- and high-temperature and to selective toxic compounds, including several current anti-tubercular drugs. © 2015 Jamet et al.

TI  - MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy in neuro-oncology: A review of its current clinical applications
VL  - 87
IS  - 2
SP  - 67-82
AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive treatment modality with recent increasing use to ablate brain tumors. When originally introduced in the late 1980s, the inability to precisely monitor and control the thermal ablation limited the adoption of LITT in neuro-oncology. Popularized as a means of destroying malignant hepatic and renal metastatic lesions percutaneously, its selective thermal tumor destruction and preservation of adjacent normal tissues have since been optimized for use in neuro-oncology. The progress made in real-time thermal imaging with MRI, laser probe design, and computer algorithms predictive of tissue kill has led to the resurgence of interest in LITT as a means to ablate brain tumors. Current LITT systems offer a surgical option for some inoperable brain tumors. We discuss the origins, principles, current indications, and future directions of MRI-guided LITT in neuro-oncology. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Global gene expression analysis provides insight into local adaptation to geothermal streams in tadpoles of the Andean toad Rhinella spinulosa
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - The anuran Rhinella spinulosa is distributed along the Andes Range at altitudes that undergo wide daily and seasonal variation in temperature. One of the populations inhabits geothermal streams, a stable environment that influences life history traits such as the timing of metamorphosis. To investigate whether this population has undergone local adaptation to this unique habitat, we carried out transcriptome analyses in animals from two localities in two developmental stages (prometamorphic and metamorphic) and exposed them to two temperatures (20 and 25 °C). RNA-Seq, de novo assembly and annotation defined a transcriptome revealing 194,469 high quality SNPs, with 1,507 genes under positive selection. Comparisons among the experimental conditions yielded 1,593 differentially expressed genes. A bioinformatics search for candidates revealed a total of 70 genes that are highly likely to be implicated in the adaptive response of the population living in a stable environment, compared to those living in an environment with variable temperatures. Most importantly, the population inhabiting the geothermal environment showed decreased transcriptional plasticity and reduced genetic variation compared to its counterpart from the non-stable environment. This analysis will help to advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that account for the local adaptation to geothermal streams in anurans. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change presents a significant challenge to global health. This paper examines the health impacts of climate change from extreme weather events, temperature changes, rising sea levels and changes in precipitation. These health impacts include heat-related illnesses and deaths, air pollution-related health effects, allergic diseases, infectious diseases, malnutrition, and disasters associated with extreme weather-related health effects such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, fires, heavy precipitation, storms and flooding. Most populations will be impacted by climate change in the next decades, putting peoples' lives and wellbeing at risk. Vulnerable populations across the globe will be impacted disproportionately due to climate change. It is populations that are often least responsible for climate change that experience the greatest adverse impacts, raising important moral issues of equity and fairness. In addition to reviewing the literature on the health impacts of climate change, this paper will examine issues of inequity across vulnerable populations and generations due to climate change, the health co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, and potential options for adaptation to increasingly extreme weather events.

VL  - 9

AB  - Antarctic soils represent a unique environment characterised by extremes of temperature, salinity, elevated UV radiation, low nutrient and low water content. Despite the harshness of this environment, members of 15 bacterial phyla have been identified in soils of the Ross Sea Region (RSR). However, the survival mechanisms and ecological roles of these phyla are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether strains of Paenibacillus darwinianus owe their resilience to substantial genomic changes. For this, genome-based comparative analyses were performed on three P. darwinianus strains, isolated from gamma-irradiated RSR soils, together with nine temperate, soil-dwelling Paenibacillus spp. The genome of each strain was sequenced to over 1,000-fold coverage, then assembled into contigs totalling approximately 3 Mbp per genome. Based on the occurrence of essential, single-copy genes, genome completeness was estimated at approximately 88%. Genome analysis revealed between 3,043-3,091 protein-coding sequences (CDSs), primarily associated with two-component systems, sigma factors, transporters, sporulation and genes induced by cold-shock, oxidative and osmotic stresses. These comparative analyses provide an insight into the metabolic potential of P. darwinianus, revealing potential adaptive mechanisms for survival in Antarctic soils. However, a large proportion of these mechanisms were also identified in temperate Paenibacillus spp., suggesting that these mechanisms are beneficial for growth and survival in a range of soil environments. These analyses have also revealed that the P. darwinianus genomes contain significantly fewer CDSs and have a lower paralogous content. Notwithstanding the incompleteness of the assemblies, the large differences in genome sizes, determined by the number of genes in paralogous clusters and the CDS content, are indicative of genome content scaling. Finally, these sequences are a resource for further investigations into the expression of physiological attributes that enable survival under extreme conditions and selection processes that affect prokaryotic genome evolution. © 2014 PLOS ONE.

TI  - Separation of methanol-n-butyl acetate mixtures by pervaporation: Potential of 10 commercial membranes
VL  - 429
SP  - 1-12
AB  - The transesterification reaction to produce methanol and butyl acetate has great interest in the chemical industry. The separation of these two compounds from the reaction media increases the productivity, thus, a hybrid configuration composed of reaction-pervaporation is of interest. In this work, 10 commercial specialty membranes (PolyAn and Sulzer Pervap membranes) have been studied in a pervaporation setup at three temperatures (30, 40 and 50 degrees C) and a feed concentration ranging between 20 and 80 mol% methanol/butyl acetate in order to determine their performance in terms of permeance, selectivity and the McCabe-Thiele separation diagram. From the results, it can be observed that most of the membranes are butyl acetate selective, with selectivities up to 307 and permeances of butyl acetate up to about 80,000 GPU. In general, an increase in temperature decreases the permeance of butyl acetate through the PolyAn membranes and it has a dramatic effect on the Pervap 1201 membrane since the selectivity to butyl acetate decays from 300 at 30 degrees C to around 0.2 at 50 degrees C. The Pervap 2255-50 membrane presents an increase of selectivity as the temperature increases. On this basis the potential of developing a pervaporation membrane reactor for production of butyl acetate by transesterification is assessed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 44

SP  - 688-699
AB  - The sexual cycle of Siberian salamander females (Salamandrella keyserlingii Dybowski 1870) has been studied in the tundra of the northern coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Spawning starts soon after the end of wintering (in the second half of May) and ends up in the first half of June. At the end of June, the ovaries show obvious features of a new ovogenic cycle; i.e., pigment starts accumulating in large vitellogenic oocytes. By the end of July, the ovaries in most individuals are already filled with pigmented follicles and the oviduct epithelium is restored. The time from spawning to the appearance of a new generation of mature oocytes lasts a little more than two months (i.e., half of the whole activity season). In the second half of August, the state of the genital system is identical to that in spring before spawning, this proving their annual reproduction. The average fecundity in the studied water bodies varies from 102 to 123 eggs and is comparable to that in other parts of the distribution range. Oogenesis both in the vast majority of females that reach pubescence (subadultus) and in those that spawn in spring occurs simultaneously, but in some subadults it is completed almost a month or a month and a half earlier. By this phenological feature, the female subadults differ considerably from the male subadults, in which completion of spermatogenesis extends much more strongly into the season. A study of the ecology of the Siberian salamander in the conditions of a short season of activity with low temperatures allows for the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk to be considered not as extreme, but, in contrast, rather favorable for its habitation. Many population characteristics in this area are typical for the species in general. The main features of the male and female sexual cycles appear to be similar to those observed in species of the same family that live in the south of the region. The short period of germinal cell development, coupled with the outstanding winter cold hardiness of the species, partially accounts for its unique adaptive potential, which allows it to colonize vast territories of northern Eurasia and successfully thrive in the territories with short and cold summer period. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

TI  - Tool Selection in Drilling of Magnesium UNSM11917 Pieces under Dry and MQL Conditions Based on Surface Roughness
VL  - 184
SP  - 117-127
AB  - Nowadays, the use of lighter materials for transportation purposes is still a challenge; especially in the aeronautical and aerospace sectors. The use of certain materials, such as magnesium alloys which have exceptional mechanical properties relative to density as structural materials, allows a remarkable reduction of weight. These alloys have significant challenges in machining. On the one hand, their use with water-based lubricants can produce flammable hydrogen atmospheres and, on the other hand, the operational parameters can produce tiny chips which, at high temperature, could burn. Regarding the tools, drills are the most used ones in drilling operations; manufacturers do not always take in consideration magnesium alloys. This is why, sometimes, the data from other types of similar alloys need to be extrapolated. This work shows an experimental study about the drilling of magnesium pieces based on surface roughness. The main goal is to determine the tools that best suit the requirement of surface roughness for this type of operations, which, for the aeronautical sector, is from 0.8 to 1.6 mu m. The tests have been conducted under different cutting conditions, using several types of tools and two sustainable lubrication systems. In particular, dry machining and minimum quantity of lubrication (MQL) system have been used. A design of experiments (DOE) has been used to optimize the resources. The average roughness, Ra, has been selected as a response variable. The roughness values obtained are lower than 0.9 mu m (namely, from 0.13 mu m to 0.87 mu m); so, it is possible to increase some of the parameter values, in order to improve the productivity, without they go outside the established limits. The results have been analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. A model for estimating the expected surface roughness in terms of the Rae, has been developed. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Plasticity and inter-population variability in physiological and life-history traits of the mussel Mytilus chilensis: A reciprocal transplant experiment
VL  - 490
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Geographically widespread species must cope with environmental differences between habitats. Information concerning geographic variations in response to climate variability is critical because many morphological, life history and physiological traits show variation across space. Reciprocal transplant experiments have shown to be relevant to evaluate the role of phenotypic plasticity and potential local adaptation in ecophysiological responses when coping with environmental variability. In this study, we characterize through reciprocal transplant experiments the reaction norms of morphological, biochemical, physiological and life-history traits between two intertidal populations of the socioeconomically important mussel Mytilus chilensis, inhabiting contrasting local environments (estuarine vs coastal habitats). We found a gradient in phenotypic plasticity with plastic trait responses in metabolic, ingestion and clearance rates, and in HsP(70) gene expression, and some traits with responses more canalized as growth and calcification rates. This emphasizes that responses not only vary across different local populations but also in different traits in M. chilensis, thus it is difficult to establish an overall trend of the responses at integrated organismal level. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of factors such as salinity and carbonate system parameters evaluated make it necessary to study the response at the population level with emphasis on benthic species important in aquaculture. Finally, field studies such as this one are useful for documenting the patterns of traits variation that occur in nature, identifying possible causes of such variation, and generating testable hypotheses for future controlled experiments.

TI  - Buffering and amplifying interactions among OAW (ocean acidification & warming) and nutrient enrichment on early life-stage Fucus vesiculosus L. (phaeophyceae) and their carry over effects to hypoxia impact
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
AB  - Ocean acidification and warming (OAW) are occurring globally. Additionally, at a more local scale the spreading of hypoxic conditions is promoted by eutrophication and warming. In the semi-enclosed brackish Baltic Sea, occasional upwelling in late summer and autumn may expose even shallow-water communities including the macroalga Fucus vesiculosus to particularly acidified, nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor water bodies. During summer 2014 (July-September) sibling groups of early life-stage F. vesiculosus were exposed to OAWin the presence and absence of enhanced nutrient levels and, subsequently to a single upwelling event in a near-natural scenario which included all environmental fluctuations in the Kiel Fjord, southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany (54°27 'N, 10°11 'W). We strove to elucidate the single and combined impacts of these potential stressors, and how stress sensitivity varies among genetically different sibling groups. Enhanced by a circumstantial natural heat wave, warming and acidification increased mortalities and reduced growth in F. vesiculosus germlings. This impact, however, was mitigated by enhanced nutrient conditions. Survival under OAW conditions strongly varied among sibling groups hinting at a substantial adaptive potential of the natural Fucus populations in the Western Baltic. A three-day experimental upwelling caused severe mortality of Fucus germlings, which was substantially more severe in those sibling groups which previously had been exposed to OAW. Our results show that global (OAW), regional (nutrient enrichment) and local pressures (upwelling), both alone and co-occurring may have synergistic and antagonistic effects on survival and/or growth of Fucus germlings. This result emphasizes the need to consider combined stress effects. © 2016 Al-Janabi et al.

TI  - The Arctic charr story: Development of subarctic freshwater fish farming in Sweden
VL  - 650
IS  - 1
SP  - 265-274
AB  - We present an overview of 27 years of experience of domestication and farming of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) in Sweden. The domestication process included an evaluation of suitable strains for farming, a breeding programme and the study of the biological and behavioural characteristics of the species. Traits of three different Arctic charr populations differing in ecology and appearance were compared during initial 2-year trials under farming conditions. The best-performing population with respect to the growth rate and the lowest frequency of early sexual maturation was a piscivore form and this became the foundation for a breeding programme intended to select for an Arctic charr strain suitable for farming. After 23 years and 7 generations, our selective breeding has resulted in a fast-growing, late-maturing strain much appreciated by farmers. The biological and behavioural characteristics studied included annual and diel locomotor activity, feeding, social and thermal behaviour. Applying our findings in these areas has greatly improved both profits and conditions for the fish. Other investigations have focused on the application and further evaluation of the results from research in practical farming trials, such as evaluation of growth at different farms with different temperature conditions, optimal time and stocking density for start-feeding and evaluation of different feeding schedules. In Sweden, Arctic charr is mainly farmed in net pens situated in nutritionally depleted and extremely unproductive water reservoirs formed by damming rivers to create electric power. Judicious farming of Arctic charr in such reservoirs can restore their nutritional and productivity state to that which existed before regulation. Site selection criteria for Arctic charr farming in such waters have been developed. The development of intensive farming of Arctic charr in Sweden is discussed together with current limitations and future possibilities. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 124

SP  - 131-142
AB  - Mountain plant species with wide elevational ranges are expected to be exposed to different selection pressures at low and high elevation. Estimating the extent of genetic population differentiation contributes to our understanding of selective forces shaping phenotypic variation of plants in response to changing climate conditions. Using a common garden experiment, we measured narrow-sense heritability (h2) and quantitative trait differentiation (QST) in several growth-related, reproductive and phenological traits among low and high elevation populations of the semi-dry grassland species Ranunculus bulbosus from the Swiss Alps. QST values were compared to neutral genetic differentiation (FST) based on AFLP markers and indicated divergent selection in most traits among all populations as well as among low and high elevation populations separately. Furthermore, pairwise QST and FST estimates were not correlated suggesting that neutral marker differentiation is not a valuable proxy for quantitative trait differentiation. Neutral molecular differentiation increased with geographical distance whereas quantitative genetic differentiation did not follow an isolation by distance pattern. Plant traits did mostly not differ among low and high populations and pairwise QST–FST comparisons indicated no divergent selection between the two elevations. Differing levels of trait differentiation in low and high elevation populations, however, indicated that different selective forces acted on plants at contrasting elevations suggesting that selection regimes might alter under climate warming. © 2014, Swiss Botanical Society.

TI  - Geographic variation in thermal plasticity of life history and wing pattern in Bicyclus anynana
VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-102
AB  - Temperature is one of the main environmental cues regulating seasonal plasticity in insects. Global climate change may lead to a change in the predictive value of temperature for seasonal conditions, potentially resulting in a mismatch of phenotypic form and environment. The afrotropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows striking seasonal plasticity for wing patterns and life history traits. This polyphenism is an adaptation to contrasting patterns of rainfall over wet and dry seasons, and is mainly determined by temperature. To investigate the extent of local adaptation of the developmental plasticity response to regional climate, we compared the thermal reaction norms for several life history traits and wing pattern of 2 distant populations from regions with different temperature - rainfall associations. We found little to no population differentiation for the life history traits, while wing pattern showed substantially more geographic variation. Broad-sense heritabilities and cross-environment correlations for wing pattern and 2 life history traits indicated a potential for adaptation of the plasticity response of these traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of wing pattern can be population-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of wing pattern to seasonal environment. Traits that can be further modified by acclimation during the butterfly's adult life span (starvation resistance, resting metabolic rate and egg size) showed no geographic differentiation for their developmental plasticity. This indicates that for these traits, adult acclimation plays an important role in coping with local climate. © Inter-Research 2010.

SP  - 357-361
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the short-term effect of the black film covering combined with niclosamide on Oncomelania hupensis snail control in marshland and lake regions. Methods: A ditch with snails in Anxiang County was selected as the experimental sites. The ditch was divided into 3 groups: a film group, a niclosamide group, and a niclosamide and film group. The snails were surveyed before the test and 1, 3, 5, 7 days after the experiment. Results: Alter the film covering, the highest temperature of the surface of soil was 63.7°C on the first day, and the temperature higher than 40°C lasted 4.34 hours. On the second day, the highest temperature was 52.3°C, and the temperature higher than 40° lasted 4.96 hours. On the fourth day and fifth day, the temperature was lower than 30°C, while the temperature was lower than 34°C on the sixth day. On the seventh day of the experiment, the snail death rates of the film group, the niclosamide group, and the niclosamide and film group on the soil surface were 16.36%, 58.40% and 53.57%, respectively. On the seventh day, the snail death rates of the film group, and the niclosamide and film group under the soil were 20.00% and 40.00%, respectively, while no snails were found under the soil in the niclosamide group 3 days after the experiment. In mesh bags, the snail death rates of the film group, the niclosamide group, and the niclosamide and film group were 84.00%, 95.33% and 95.33%, respectively. Conclusion: The short-term effect of the black film covering on snail control is not obvious, and the black film covering does no promote the molluscicidal effect of niclosamide.

TI  - How does the dengue vector mosquito Aedes albopictus respond to global warming?
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Global warming has a marked influence on the life cycle of epidemic vectors as well as their interactions with human beings. The Aedes albopictus mosquito as the vector of dengue fever surged exponentially in the last decade, raising ecological and epistemological concerns of how climate change altered its growth rate and population dynamics. As the global warming pattern is considerably uneven across four seasons, with a confirmed stronger effect in winter, an emerging need arises as to exploring how the seasonal warming effects influence the annual development of Ae. albopictus. Methods: The model consolidates a 35-year climate dataset and designs fifteen warming patterns that increase the temperature of selected seasons. Based on a recently developed mechanistic population model of Ae. albopictus, the model simulates the thermal reaction of blood-fed adults by systematically increasing the temperature from 0.5 to 5 °C at an interval of 0.5 °C in each warming pattern. Results: The results show the warming effects are different across seasons. The warming effects in spring and winter facilitate the development of the species by shortening the diapause period. The warming effect in summer is primarily negative by inhibiting mosquito development. The warming effect in autumn is considerably mixed. However, these warming effects cannot carry over to the following year, possibly due to the fact that under the extreme weather in winter the mosquito fully ceases from development and survives in terms of diapause eggs. Conclusions: As the historical pattern of global warming manifests seasonal fluctuations, this study provides corroborating and previously ignored evidence of how such seasonality affects the mosquito development. Understanding this short-term temperature-driven mechanism as one chain of the transmission events is critical to refining the thermal reaction norms of the epidemic vector under global warming as well as developing effective mosquito prevention and control strategies. © 2017 The Author(s).

VL  - 1

SP  - 1846-1852
AB  - Temperature profoundly affects species' geographic ranges, but the extent to which it limits contemporary range edges has been difficult to assess from laboratory experiments of thermal tolerance. The persistence of populations depends on temperature-mediated outcomes of ecological and demographic processes across all stages of a species' life history, as well as any adaptation to local temperature regimes. We assessed the relationships between sea temperature and observed distributional ranges for 1,790 shallow-water marine species from 10 animal classes and found remarkable consistencies in trends in realized thermal limits among taxa and ocean basins, as well as general agreement with previous laboratory findings. Realized thermal niches increase from the Equator towards cold-temperate locations, despite an opposite trend in geographic range size. Species' cool distribution limits are best predicted by the magnitude of seasonality within their range, while a relatively firm thermal barrier exists on the equatorward range edge for temperate species. Our findings of consistencies in realized thermal limits indicate potential limits to adaptation among common marine species and highlight the value of realized thermal niches for predicting species' distributional dynamics in warming seas. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - The adaptive capacity of fishery management systems for confronting climate change impacts on marine populations
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 561-575
AB  - Global climate change will affect the abundance, distribution, and life history timing of many exploited marine populations, but specific changes are difficult to predict. Management systems in which harvest strategies and tactics are flexible in responding to unpredictable biological changes are more likely to succeed in maintaining productive populations. We explore the adaptability of fisheries management systems in relation to oceanic warming rates by asking how two important management characteristics vary with temperature changes for >500 stocks. (1) Harvest control rules, a framework for altering fishing pressure in response to changes in the abundance of targeted species (primarily due to fishing), may provide the capacity for harvest policies to change in response to climate-driven abundance declines also. (2) Seasonal openings with flexible dates that involve in-season monitoring may allow managers to better respond to possible changes in the timing of life-history periods like spawning to prevent fishing seasons falling out of sync with species' phenology. Harvest control rules were widely used across industrialized fisheries including in regions that experienced relatively high oceanic warming rates, but after controlling for regional factors we found no association between ocean warming and the use of harvest control rules. Flexible-date seasonal openings were rare compared to fixed-date seasonal openings, but tended to occur in areas with the greatest warming rates while fisheries without seasonal closures tended to occur in areas with the least observed temperature changes. We found no consistent evidence of recent ocean warming effects on the current biomass or exploitation rates relative to management targets of 241 assessed marine populations. Together, these results suggest that the oceanic areas expected to have the greatest climate impacts on populations do at least tend to contain fisheries that demonstrate the potential for adaptability to unpredictable climate impacts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - MICRO QUANTITY INTERNAL COOLING (MQUIC (TM)) OF CUTTING TOOLS FOR INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY WHILE MACHINING TI-6AL-4V
VL  - 1
SP  - 209-218
AB  - Machining of space age materials like Ti-6Al-4V is associated with thermally activated wear mechanisms which lead to rapid tool failure and increased machine downtime. The high strength and low thermal conductivity of Ti-6Al-4V can reduce tool-life significantly at high cutting speeds adding drastically to the per-unit cost. A new concept, Micro Quantity Internal Cooling (MQUIC™) has been developed to extend the tool-life and/or enable higher cutting speeds while machining Ti-6Al-4V. The concept involves introducing flow (coolant) in a micro-duct placed inside the tool and close to the cutting edge, thus bringing the cooling source close to the heat source (chipcontact area). In this research, experiments have been conducted to compare the performance (wear rates) of cutting tools using the MQUIC™ concept with those run under dry or flood conditions. Further, two levels of feed and cutting speed are selected for the experiments so as to be able to investigate the combined effect of parameters on tool performance. Physical testing employing coolant consumption of less than 5% of typical flood coolant rates proves the viability of the concept by demonstrating wear rates of 1/3 to 1/2 those of flood cooling. The testing also proves the application of the MQUIC™ concept to enable higher cutting speeds than the current industry standard for machining Ti-6Al-4V. This paper presents the experimental setup, methodology and results obtained while testing the feasibility of the concept. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 481-489
AB  - Sargassum muticum is a successful invasive Phaeophyte macroalga, which has colonized from Norway to the Mediterranean in Europe and from Alaska to the Bay of Mexico on the American Atlantic coast. It is also being evaluated as a commercial crop within its native range, SE Asia. Understanding its reproductive tolerance will improve our understanding of its invasive potential and allow optimal germling production for commercial cultivation. Egg liberation, fertilization and germling production were monitored in fertile branchlets collected from Great Cumbrae, Scotland, UK. These were incubated under a range of conditions as follows: photon flux densities (20–150 μmol photons m−2 s−1), salinity (0–70 psu), temperature (10–30 °C) and desiccation in either the sun (5–60 min) or the shade (15–120 min). The optimum conditions to maximize germling production were found to be a 15–30 min desiccation period in the shade, followed by immersion into normal salinity seawater at 20 °C and 50–100 μmol photons m−2 s−1. This information could be useful for the development of a cultivation industry within its native range. An interactive effect was seen between temperature and light intensity with germling production favoured in high light and low temperature (10–15 °C, 100–150 μmol photons m−2 s−1) and vice versa (25–30 °C, 20–50 μmol photons m−2 s−1). Whilst its salinity and desiccation tolerance agree with previous investigations 40 years ago, the lower temperature optimum of 20 °C (previously 25 °C) may indicate selection for lower temperature reproduction within the UK population. This may accelerate its invasion northward into Scotland. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Recording the transition from flare-up to steady-state arc magmatism at the Purico-Chascon volcanic complex, northern Chile
VL  - 422
SP  - 75-86
AB  - The long-term evolution of continental magmatic arcs is episodic, where a few transient events of high magmatic flux or flare-ups punctuate the low-flux magmatism or "steady state" that makes up most of the arc history. How this duality manifests in terms of differences in crustal architecture, magma dynamics and chemistry, and the time scale over which transitions occur is poorly known. Herein we use multiscale geochemical and isotopic characteristics coupled with geothermobarometry at the Purico-Chascon Volcanic Complex (PCVC) in the Central Andes to identify a transition from flare-up to steady state arc magmatism over similar to 800 kyr during which significant changes in upper crustal magmatic dynamics are recorded. The PCVC is one of the youngest volcanic centers related to a 10-1 Ma ignimbrite flare-up in the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex of the Central Andes. Activity at the PC,VC initiated 0.98 +/- 0.03 Ma with the eruption of a large 80-100 km(3) crystal-rich dacite ignimbrite. High, restricted Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios between 0.7085 and 0.7090 in the bulk rock and plagioclase crystals from the Purico ignimbrite, combined with mineral chemistry and phase relationships indicate the dacite magma accumulated and evolved at relatively low temperatures around 800-850 degrees C in the upper crust at 4-8 km depth. Minor andesite pumice erupted late in the ignimbrite sequence records a second higher temperature (965 degrees C), higher pressure environment (17-20 km), but with similar restricted radiogenic bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7089-0.7091 to the dacites. The compositional and isotopic characteristics of the Purico ignimbrite implicate an extensive zone of upper crustal mixing, assimilation, storage and homogenization (MASH) between 30 and 4 km beneath the PCVC 1 Ma. The final eruptions at the PCVC <0.18 +/- 0.02 Ma suggest a change in the magmatic architecture beneath the PCVC. These eruptions produced three small <6 km3 crystal-rich dacite lava domes with radiogenic bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.7075 to 0.7081, that contain abundant basaltic-andesite inclusions with relatively low bulk rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7057-0.7061. Plagioclase and amphibole in the host lava of Cerro Chascon, the largest of the domes, record two distinct magmatic environments; an upper crustal environment identical to that recorded in the Purico ignimbrite, and a second deeper, similar to 15-20 km depth, higher temperature (similar to 922-1001 degrees C) environment. This deeper environment is recorded in textures and compositions of distinct mineral phases, and in intracrystalline isotope ratios. Plagioclase cores in the host dacite lava and mafic inclusions have in situ Sr-87/Sr-86 isotopic compositions of 0.7083 to 0.7095, broadly similar to plagioclase from the Purico ignimbrite. in contrast, plagioclase rims and microphenocrysts in the mafic inclusions are isotopically distinct with lower Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios (0.7057 to 0.7065 and 0.7062 to 0.7064, respectively) that overlap with the regional isotopic "baseline" compositions that are parental to the modern arc lavas. The textural and compositional characteristics of the PCVC attest to two distinct stages in its history. At similar to 1 Ma the system was broadly homogeneous and dominantly dacitic recording extensive upper crustal magmatism. By similar to 0.2 Ma the PCVC had transitioned to a more compositionally heterogeneous, smaller volume, mixed dacite to basaltic-andesite system, coinciding with the appearance of less-enriched "baseline" compositions. The evolution of PCVC is a microcosm of the Central Andean arc in this region where, from 10 to 1 Ma, upper crustal MASH processes resulted in the production and eruption of large volumes of homogeneous crystal-rich dacite during a regional ignimbrite flare-up. Since similar to 1 Ma, decreasing explosivity, smaller eruptive volumes, increasing heterogeneity, and the emergence of less isotopically enriched basaltic-andesite to dacite composite volcanoes signal a return to steady-state arc volcanism. We posit that the transition from flare-up to steady state captured at the PCVC tracks the waning of the arc scale "thermal engine". High magmatic fluxes during the flare-up would lead to elevated geothermal gradients and efficient crustal processing leading to a dominantly "crustal" magmatism feeding the large volume Purico ignimbrite. This upper crustal MASH zone would act as an efficient filter to any parental compositions precluding them from the eruption record. As magmatic flux and thermal energy wanes, crustal isotherms would relax leading to greater thermal contrast between parental magmas, upper crust, and remnant felsic magmas stored in the upper crust. These changes are manifested in the preservation of textural and compositional heterogeneity and the survival of less isotopically enriched magmas in the upper crust. The chemical imprint of these arc-scale changes in magma dynamics is recorded at all scales from bulk rock to intra-crystalline. The distinct magma dynamics and chemical signatures of the two modes of arc magmatism detailed here should provide a model for investigations of mature continental arc evolution through time and space.

TI  - Different ultimate factors define timing of breeding in two related species
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
AB  - Correct reproductive timing is crucial for fitness. Breeding phenology even in similar species can differ due to different selective pressures on the timing of reproduction. These selection pressures define species' responses to warming springs. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis suggests that timing of breeding in animals is selected to match with food availability (synchrony). Alternatively, time-dependent breeding success (the date hypothesis) can result from other seasonally deteriorating ecological conditions such as intra- or interspecific competition or predation.We studied the effects of two ultimate factors on the timing of breeding, synchrony and other time-dependent factors (time-dependence), in sympatric populations of two related forest-dwelling passerine species, the great tit (Parus major) and the willow tit (Poecile montanus) by modelling recruitment with long-termcapture-recapture data.We hypothesized that these two factors have different relevance for fitness in these species.We found that local recruitment in both species showed quadratic relationships with both time-dependence and synchrony. However, the importance of these factors was markedly different between the studied species. Caterpillar food played a predominant role in predicting the timing of breeding of the great tit. In contrast, for the willow tit time-dependence modelled as timing in relation to conspecifics was more important for local recruitment than synchrony. High caterpillar biomass experienced during the pre- and postfledging periods increased local recruitment of both species. These contrasting results confirmthat these species experience different selective pressures upon the timing of breeding, and hence responses to climate change may differ. Detailed information about life-history strategies is required to understand the effects of climate change, even in closely related taxa. The temporal match-mismatch hypothesis should be extended to consider subsequent critical periods when food needs to be abundantly available. © 2016 Pakanen et al.

TI  - Micro-scale vegetable production and the rise of microgreens
VL  - 57
SP  - 103-115
AB  - Background: Interest in fresh, functional foods is on the rise, compelled by the growing interest of consumers for diets that support health and longevity. Microgreens garner immense potential for adapting leafy vegetable production to a micro-scale and for improving nutritional value in human diet. Scope and approach: Major preharvest factors of microgreens production, such as species selection, fertilization, biofortification, lighting and growth stage at harvest are addressed with respect to crop physiology and quality, as well as postharvest handling and applications, temperature, atmospheric composition, lighting and packaging technology which influence shelf-life and microbial safety. Key prospects for future research aiming to enhance quality and shelf-life of microgreens are highlighted. Key findings and conclusions: Effective non-chemical treatments for seed surface sterilization and antimicrobial action, pre-sowing treatments to standardize and shorten the production cycle and crop specific information on the interaction of sowing rate with yield and quality deserve further attention. Indigenous landraces, underutilized crops and wild edible plants constitute a vast repository for selection of genetic material for microgreens. Modular fertilization may fortify microgreens bioactive content and augment their sensorial attributes. Pre- and postharvest select-waveband, intensity and photoperiod combinations can elicit compound-specific improvements in functional quality and in shelf-life. Research is needed to identify effective sanitizers and drying methods non-abusive on quality and shelf-life for commercialization of ready-to-eat packaged microgreens. Genotypic variability in postharvest chilling sensitivity and the interactions of temperature, light conditions and packaging gas permeability should be further examined to establish environments suppressive on respiration but preventive of off-odor development.

TI  - Climate change mitigation through adaptation: The effectiveness of forest diversification by novel tree planting regimes
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
AB  - Climate change is projected to have negative implications for forest ecosystems and their dependent communities and industries. Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world’s northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015–2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests. © 2017 Hof et al.

VL  - 186
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-213
AB  - The highly permeable integument of amphibians renders them vulnerable to chemical characteristics of their environment, especially during the aquatic larval stage. As the cane toad (Rhinella marina, Bufonidae) invades southwards along the east coast of Australia, it is encountering waterbodies with highly variable conditions of temperature, pH, and salinity. Understanding the tolerance of toads to these conditions can clarify the likely further spread of the invader, as well as the adaptability of the species to novel environmental challenges. We measured salinity in waterbodies in the field and conducted laboratory trials to investigate the impacts of salinity on toad viability. Eggs and tadpoles from the southern invasion front tolerated the most saline conditions we found in potential spawning ponds during surveys [equivalent to 1200 ppm (3.5 % the salinity of seawater)]. Indeed, high-salinity treatments increased tadpole body sizes, accelerated metamorphosis, and improved locomotor ability of metamorphs (but did not affect metamorph morphology). At very low salinity [40 ppm (0.1 % seawater)], eggs hatched but larvae did not develop past Gosner stage 37. Our study shows that the egg and larval life stages of cane toads can tolerate wide variation in the salinity of natal ponds and that this aspect of waterbody chemistry is likely to facilitate rather than constrain continued southward expansion of the toad invasion front in eastern Australia. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 41
SP  - 96-105
AB  - A hyperspectral imaging system was coupled to a precision, pulsed-jet, micro-dosing system to selectively deliver high-temperature, organic, food-grade oil for intra-row weed control in early growth tomatoes. The imaging system, based upon a multispectral Bayesian classifier, successfully discriminated the species of 95.9%, on average, of plant canopy for tomato, Solanum nigrum L and Amaranthus retroflexus L using canopy reflectance in the 384-810 nm range. Food-grade oil, heated to approximately 160 C, was applied to weeds using a pressurized micro-dosing pulsed-jet. The target application rate was approximately 0.85 mg/cm(2) in 10-ms-pulsed doses while traveling at a ground speed of 0.04 m/s. In an outdoor test, approximately 95.8% of S. nigrum and 93.8% of A. retroflexus were controlled 15 days post thermal treatment, while only 2.4% of the tomato plants received significant damage. Application coverage assessments of leaf surfaces immediately after the heated oil application found that tomato viability was retained if 50% or less of the leaf surface was inadvertently dosed, while 100% mortality was achieved for S. nigrum and A. retroflexus if more than 90% of their respective leaf surfaces were covered with heated oil.

TI  - Seasonal variation in basal and plastic cold tolerance: Adaptation is influenced by both long- and short-term phenotypic plasticity
VL  - 7
IS  - 14
SP  - 5248-5257
AB  - Understanding how thermal selection affects phenotypic distributions across different time scales will allow us to predict the effect of climate change on the fitness of ectotherms. We tested how seasonal temperature variation affects basal levels of cold tolerance and two types of phenotypic plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster. Developmental acclimation occurs as developmental stages of an organism are exposed to seasonal changes in temperature and its effect is irreversible, while reversible short-term acclimation occurs daily in response to diurnal changes in temperature. We collected wild flies from a temperate population across seasons and measured two cold tolerance metrics (chill-coma recovery and cold stress survival) and their responses to developmental and short-term acclimation. Chill-coma recovery responded to seasonal shifts in temperature, and phenotypic plasticity following both short-term and developmental acclimation improved cold tolerance. This improvement indicated that both types of plasticity are adaptive, and that plasticity can compensate for genetic variation in basal cold tolerance during warmer parts of the season when flies tend to be less cold tolerant. We also observed a significantly stronger trade-off between basal cold tolerance and short-term acclimation during warmer months. For the longer-term developmental acclimation, a trade-off persisted regardless of season. A relationship between the two types of plasticity may provide additional insight into why some measures of thermal tolerance are more sensitive to seasonal variation than others. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Protein sequences bound to mineral surfaces persist into deep time
VL  - 5
AB  - Proteins persist longer in the fossil record than DNA, but the longevity, survival mechanisms and substrates remain contested. Here, we demonstrate the role of mineral binding in preserving the protein sequence in ostrich (Struthionidae) eggshell, including from the palaeontological sites of Laetoli (3.8 Ma) and Olduvai Gorge (1.3 Ma) in Tanzania. By trackingprotein diagenesis back in time we find consistent patterns of preservation, demonstratingauthenticity of the surviving sequences. Molecular dynamics simulations of struthiocalcin-1 and -2, the dominant proteins within the eggshell, reveal that distinct domains bind to the mineral surface. It is the domain with the strongest calculated binding energy to the calcite surface that is selectively preserved. Thermal age calculations demonstrate that the Laetoli and Olduvai peptides are 50 times older than any previously authenticated sequence (equivalent to ~16 Ma at a constant 10°C). © Demarchi et al.

TI  - To what extent does temperature affect sex ratio in red cherry shrimp, neocaridina davidi? The scenario global warming to offspring sex ratio
VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 7575-7579
AB  - An invasive freshwater shrimp, Red Cherry Shrimp (Decapoda: Caridea: Atyidae), is naturally distributed in fresh water habitats of Asia. This forage species has an important role in aquatic ecosystems by transferring planktonic production into higher trophic levels mainly including fish and aquatic animals. However, temperature strongly affects sex ratio and in turn offspring quantity. In order to determine the effect of temperature on incubation period, egg yield, offspring sex ratio as well as survival, a comprehensive experiment was conducted at three temperatures (20, 23 and 26°C). Significant differences among temperatures for hatching period were an expected result. Higher survival and more eggs were achieved at 26°C comparing the lower experimental temperatures. The female/male ratio, which was 80% at 20°C and approximately 50% at 23°C, drastically dropped to 18% at 26°C. This ratio may drop to 0% at higher temperatures, which are tolerance limits for Red Cherry Shrimp. Therefore, in sex-dependent selective breeding, the temperature should be taken into consideration. Consequently, as temperature increases the sex ratio of the offspring increases in favour of the male. The continuation of global warming and rising above 26°C may be an important source of stress on the natural sustainability of Red Cherry Shrimp stocks. © 2017 Parlar Scientific Publications.

VL  - 27
IS  - 2
SP  - 194-201
AB  - Background: Prior studies including the Framingham Heart Study have suggested associations between single components of air pollution and vascular function; however, underlying mixtures of air pollution may have distinct associations with vascular function. Methods: We used a k-means approach to construct five distinct pollution mixtures from elemental analyses of particle filters, air pollution monitoring data, and meteorology. Exposure was modeled as an interaction between fine particle mass (PM2.5), and concurrent pollution cluster. Outcome variables were two measures of microvascular function in the fingertip in the Framingham Offspring and Third Generation cohorts from 2003 to 2008. Results: In 1,720 participants, associations between PM2.5 and baseline pulse amplitude tonometry differed by air pollution cluster (interaction P value 0.009). Higher PM2.5 on days with low mass concentrations but high proportion of ultrafine particles from traffic was associated with 18% (95% confidence interval: 4.6%, 33%) higher baseline pulse amplitude per 5 ìg/m3 and days with high contributions of oil and wood combustion with 16% (95% confidence interval: 0.2%, 34%) higher baseline pulse amplitude. We observed no variation in associations of PM2.5 with hyperemic response to ischemia observed across air pollution clusters. Conclusions: PM2.5 exposure from air pollution mixtures with large contributions of local ultrafine particles from traffic, heating oil, and wood combustion was associated with higher baseline pulse amplitude but not hyperemic response. Our findings suggest little association between acute exposure to air pollution clusters reflective of select sources and hyperemic response to ischemia, but possible associations with excessive small artery pulsatility with potentially deleterious microvascular consequences.

TI  - Behavioural adaptation of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis to short-term heat stress
VL  - 100
SP  - 28-34
AB  - Under ongoing climate warming, both the degree and number of high-temperature events in summer may increase, and behavioural adaptation is an important ecological strategy employed by insects to cope with such events. The rice leaf folder, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Güenée, is a serious insect pest of rice fields in summer. Population outbreaks have become more frequent in the last ten years. In addition to adult migration, rice leaf folders are thought to have other thermal adaptations. Therefore, the behaviours of larval and adult rice leaf folders, such as leaf folding (making shelter) and habitat selection for pupae and eggs, were observed on rice plants under heat stress. The results showed that larval shelter-making velocities significantly decreased during or after four hours of heat exposure, and shelter size decreased as the temperature increased. Larvae preferred to pupate on young rice leaves at 27 °C and middle-aged leaves at 30 °C, but they strongly preferred older leaves when reared at 34 °C. Female moths generally preferred to oviposit on the top of young leaves, but they preferred the middle and lower leaves for egg deposition when exposed to 36 and 40 °C, respectively. Furthermore, more eggs were distributed on the lower surfaces of rice leaves with an increase in heat stress. These behavioural responses of rice leaf folders to heat stress indicate that this pest has great potential to adapt to high temperatures; therefore, the possibility of a population outbreak will remain high despite global warming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 131
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-95
AB  - This paper applies city-specific mortality relationships for extremely hot and cold temperatures for 33 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States to develop mortality projections for historical and potential future climates. These projections, which cover roughly 100 million of 310 million U.S. residents in 2010, highlight a potential change in health risks from uncontrolled climate change and the potential benefits of a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy. Our analysis reveals that projected mortality from extremely hot and cold days combined increases significantly over the 21st century because of the overwhelming increase in extremely hot days. We also find that the evaluated GHG mitigation policy could substantially reduce this risk. These results become more pronounced when accounting for projected population changes. These results challenge arguments that there could be a mortality benefit attributable to changes in extreme temperatures from future warming. This finding of a net increase in mortality also holds in an analog city sensitivity analysis that incorporates a strong adaptation assumption. While our results do not address all sources of uncertainty, their scale and scope highlight one component of the potential health risks of unmitigated climate change impacts on extreme temperatures and draw attention to the need to continue to refine analytical tools and methods for this type of analysis. © 2014, The Author(s).

VL  - 67

SP  - 392-401
AB  - Bacteria living within the surface mucus layer of corals compete for nutrients and space. A number of stresses affect the outcome of this competition. The interactions between native microorganisms and opportunistic pathogens largely determine the coral holobiont's overall health and fitness. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that commensal bacteria isolated from the mucus layer of a healthy elkhorn coral, Acropora palmata, are capable of inhibition of opportunistic pathogens, Vibrio shiloi AK1 and Vibrio coralliilyticus. These vibrios are known to cause disease in corals and their virulence is temperature dependent. Elevated temperature (30 °C) increased the cell numbers of one commensal and both Vibrio pathogens in monocultures. We further tested the hypothesis that elevated temperature favors pathogenic organisms by simultaneously increasing the fitness of vibrios and decreasing the fitness of commensals by measuring growth of each species within a co-culture over the course of 1 week. In competition experiments between vibrios and commensals, the proportion of Vibrio spp. increased significantly under elevated temperature. We finished by investigating several temperature-dependent mechanisms that could influence co-culture differences via changes in competitive fitness. The ability of Vibrio spp. to utilize glycoproteins found in A. palmata mucus increased or remained stable when exposed to elevated temperature, while commensals' tended to decrease utilization. In both vibrios and commensals, protease activity increased at 30 °C, while chiA expression increased under elevated temperatures for Vibrio spp. These results provide insight into potential mechanisms through which elevated temperature may select for pathogenic bacterial dominance and lead to disease or a decrease in coral fitness. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Balanced primary sex ratios and resilience to climate change in a major sea turtle population
VL  - 577
SP  - 189-203
AB  - Global climate change is expected to have major impacts on biodiversity. Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, and many populations produce highly femalebiased offspring sex ratios, a skew likely to increase further with global warming. We estimated the primary sex ratio at one of the world's largest green turtle Chelonia mydas rookeries in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and explored its resilience to climate change. In 2013 and 2014, we deployed data loggers recording nest (n = 101) and sand (n = 30) temperatures, and identified hatchling sex by histological examination of gonads. A logistic curve was fitted to the data to allow predictions of sex ratio across habitats and through the nesting season. The population-specific pivotal temperature was 29.4°C, with both sexes produced within incubation temperatures from 27.6 to 31.4°C: the transitional range of temperatures (TRT). Primary sex ratio changed from maleto female-biased across relatively small temporal and spatial scales. Overall it was marginally female-biased, but we estimated an exceptionally high male hatchling production of 47.7% (95% CI: 36.7-58.3%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 33.8-55.4%) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both the temporal and spatial variation in incubation conditions and the wide range of the TRT suggest resilience and potential for adaptation to climate change if the present nesting habitat remains unchanged. These findings underline the importance of assessing site-specific parameters to understand populations' responses to climate change, particularly with regard to identifying rookeries with high male hatchling production that may be key for the future conservation of sea turtles under projected global warming scenarios. © Inter-Research 2017.

AB  - The results of a set of laboratory impact experiments (speeds in the range 1-5 km s-1) are reviewed. They are discussed in the context of terrestrial impact ejecta impacting the Moon and hence lunar astrobiology through using the Moon to learn about the history of life on Earth. A review of recent results indicates that survival of quite complex organic molecules can be expected in terrestrial meteorites impacting the lunar surface, but they may have undergone selective thermal processing both during ejection from the Earth and during lunar impact. Depending on the conditions of the lunar impact (speed, angle of impact etc.) the shock pressures generated can cause significant but not complete sterilisation of any microbial load on a meteorite (e. g. at a few GPa 1-0.1% of the microbial load can survive, but at 20 GPa this falls to typically 0.01-0.001%). For more sophisticated biological products such as seeds (trapped in rocks) the lunar impact speeds generate shock pressures that disrupt the seeds (experiments show this occurs at approximately 1 GPa or semi-equivalently 1 km s-1). Overall, the delivery of terrestrial material of astrobiological interest to the Moon is supported by these experiments, although its long term survival on the Moon is a separate issue not discussed here. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Economic viability of adaptation for timber distribution poles considering climate change
AB  - Hurricane intensity or/and frequency may change due to the increase in sea surface temperature as a result of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to explore several climatic adaptation strategies for timber distribution poles that may aid in mitigating increased replacement costs that may be expected due to climate change. A life cycle cost analysis is conducted to assess the economic viability of four proposed adaptation strategies considering a potential increase in wind speed of 10% over 50 years. The scenario of no climate change is considered in this paper to show the applicability the proposed framework for hurricane risk mitigation under current conditions (i.e. wind speeds remain stationary). This paper finds that certain adaptation measures can reduce timber pole replacement costs.

AB  - To overcome the lower accuracy, poor convergence and worse generality of the thermal error modeling method based on BP neural network, the fuzzy cluster theory was used to group temperature variables and the correlation analysis was conducted to select thermal senstive points to mine the correlation between temperature variables and thermal errors and to reduce the coupling among temperature variables. Besides, the reciprocal of the square sum of the residual errors was regarded as the individual fitness function in the PSO algorithm. Moreover, the performance code of the head of the individual was regarded as the number of the nodes in the hidden layer and the body of the individual was mapped to the weights and thresholds of the BP network. The extreme value and global extreme value of the individual were tracked to update the speed and position of the individuals. Then, the five-point method was utilized to measure the spindle thermal errors of a jig-boring. After that, the elongation and thermal tilt angle models were established based on the BP and PSO-BP models. The results show that the thermal error model based on PSO-BP model can predict thermal errors of the machine tool spindle under different cutting conditions and the results validate the effectiveness of the measuring and modeling methods. © 2016, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press.

TI  - Rhythmic natural selection over intertidal and brackish water genotypes: Simple formulations for testing hypothesis
VL  - 14
SP  - 83-88
AB  - Tidal cycles at benthic habitats induce a set of periodic environmental changes in variables like salinity, temperature and sediment water content which are able to stress benthic organisms. Consequently, a natural selection temporally correlated with tides affects the fitness of genotypes (wi) depending on their adaptation degree. Classic population genetics demonstrate that (1) rhythmic wi is more restrictive than equivalent spatial variations to preserve genetic variance, and (2) mean fitness of the population (w-) does not have to be enhanced by genetic variance (σ2w). The present study develops a simple replicator dynamics-based model of continuous selection, where wi of multiple asexual genotypes fluctuates as a sinusoid. The amplitude of w was set as 0.5 (1-wmin), whereas the ratio of tide period to generation time (h) was defined. Overall, the model shows that if h&gt;1, then the success of an advantageous genotype is exposed to randomness, and w- may decrease over generations. In contrast, if h&lt;1 the success is deterministic, is limiting co-dominance, and only depends on wmin. The amount of different genotypes buffers the decay of σ2w and hence increases cohesiveness. Finally, the reliability of the model is analyzed for a set of target intertidal and brackish water organisms. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Conversion of fat-containing waste from the margarine manufacturing process into bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates
VL  - 71
SP  - 68-73
AB  - A fat-containing waste produced from the margarine manufacturing process was tested as a low cost carbon source for cultivation of different polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) producing bacterial strains, including Cupriavidus necator, Comamonas testosteroni and several Pseudomonas strains. The margarine waste was mainly composed of free fatty acids (76 wt.%), namely mystiric, oleic, linoleic and stearic acids. In preliminary shake flask experiments, several strains were able to grow on the margarine waste, but C necator reached the highest PHA content in the biomass (69 wt.%). This strain was selected for batch bioreactor experiments, wherein it reached a cell dry weight of 11.2 g/L with a polymer content of 56 wt.%. The culture produced 6.4 g/L of polyhydroxybutyrate, P3(HB), within 20 h of cultivation, which corresponds to a volumetric productivity of 0.33 g(pha)/L h. The P3(HB) polymer produced by C. necator from the margarine waste had a melting point of 173.4 degrees C, a glass transition temperature of 7.9 degrees C and a crystallinity of 56.6%. Although the bioprocess needs to be optimized, the margarine waste was shown to be a promising substrate for P(3HB) production by C necator, resulting in a polymer with physical and chemical properties similar to bacterial P(3HB) synthesized from other feedstocks.

AB  - Temperature plays an important role in the growth, development, and geographic distribution of insects. There is convincing evidence that heat-shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles in helping organisms adapt to thermal stress. To better understand the physiological and ecological influence of thermal stress on the different development stages of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mediterranean species (MED), nymphs and adults were shocked with temperatures of 35, 38, and 41 °C for 1 and 2 h, respectively, and the survival rate, fecundity, and developmental duration were investigated in the laboratory. The expression levels of the hsp40, hsp70, and hsp90 genes were assessed using real-time PCR. The results indicate that the survival rates of the nymphs and adults decreased with increased temperature. A 2-h heat shock at 41°C induced a significant reduction in fecundity in adults and an increase in developmental duration in young nymphs. Hsp90 showed higher temperature responses to thermal stress than hsp40 or hsp70. The expression levels of the hsps in the adults were significantly down-regulated by a 2-h heat shock at 41°C compared with that by a 1-h treatment. A significant decrease in the expression levels of the hsps also occurred in the adults when the temperature increased from 38 to 41°C for the 2-h treatment, whereas no significant decrease occurred in the nymphs. Compared with previous studies, we provide some evidence indicating that MED has the potential to adapt to a wider temperature range than the Middle East-Asia Minor 1 species. © The Author 2017.
