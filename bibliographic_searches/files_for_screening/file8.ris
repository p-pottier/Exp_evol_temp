VL  - 26

AB  - Evolutionary transitions between sex-determining mechanisms (SDMs) are an enigma. Among vertebrates, individual sex (male or female) is primarily determined by either genes (genotypic sex determination, GSD) or embryonic incubation temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD), and these mechanisms have undergone repeated evolutionary transitions. Despite this evolutionary lability, transitions from GSD (i.e. from male heterogamety, XX/XY, or female heterogamety, ZZ/ZW) to TSD are an evolutionary conundrum, as they appear to require crossing a fitness valley arising from the production of genotypes with reduced viability owing to being homogametic for degenerated sex chromosomes (YY or WW individuals). Moreover, it is unclear whether alternative (e.g. mixed) forms of sex determination can persist across evolutionary time. It has previously been suggested that transitions would be easy if temperature-dependent sex reversal (e.g. XX male or XY female) was asymmetrical, occurring only in the homogametic sex. However, only recently has a mechanistic model of sex determination emerged that may allow such asymmetrical sex reversal. We demonstrate that selection for TSD in a realistic sex-determining system can readily drive evolutionary transitions from GSD to TSD that do not require the production of YY or WW individuals. In XX/XY systems, sex reversal (female to male) occurs in a portion of the XX individuals only, leading to the loss of the Y allele (or chromosome) from the population as XX individuals mate with each other. The outcome is a population of XX individuals whose sex is determined by incubation temperature (TSD). Moreover, our model reveals a novel evolutionarily stable state representing a mixed-mechanism system that has not been revealed by previous approaches. This study solves two long-standing puzzles of the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms by illuminating the evolutionary pathways and endpoints. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Genetic improvement of tilapias in China: Genetic parameters and selection responses in growth, pond survival and cold-water tolerance of blue tilapia (oreochromis aureus) after four generations of multi-trait selection
VL  - 396
SP  - 32-42
AB  - Genetic parameters and selection responses were obtained for growth, pond survival and cold-water tolerance of Progift blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) in China after four generations of multi-trait selection. Blue tilapia from four Chinese hatchery stocks and one from Vietnam were used to compose a synthetic breeding population. About 31,000 tagged fingerlings representing 519 full-sib families in five generations were tested in freshwater earthen ponds in Hainan Province of China. Individual body weights were recorded on 11,000 fish at the expected time of sexual maturation and 22,000 at harvest to estimate genetic parameters for growth rate. An additional 5000 tagged fingerlings representing all families in G(3) and G(4) were challenged to estimate genetic parameters for cold-water tolerance. Heritability (h(2)) estimates for body weight were relatively stable across time of recordings and generations, and was of similar magnitude (0.40 +/- 0.04) when analyzing all harvest data. The h(2) of pond survival was considerably lower (0.05 +/- 0.01 and 0.08 +/- 0.11), while that of cold-water tolerance was intermediate (0.20 +/- 0.04 and 0.30 +/- 0.31) when estimated on the observed and underlying scales. Including all data, effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c(2)) accounted for 7% and 1%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variance for body weight at harvest and the two survival traits. Genetic correlation between growth recorded at expected time of sexual maturation and at harvest was very high (0.99 +/- 0.01). The genetic correlation between growth and pond survival was positive (0.15 +/- 0.08), while that between growth and cold-water tolerance was not significantly different from zero (0.02 +/- 0.12). Breeding candidates in the base population (G(0)) were ranked according to their individual breeding values for growth (recorded as body weight at harvest), while those in later generations (G(1)-G(3)) were ranked according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. A genetic trend analysis based on all grow-out data predicted an accumulated selection response of 168 g (2.16 phenotypic standard deviation units) and an average selection response of 14.0% per generation of selection when using the LS mean of the G(0) as a base line for the comparison. Genetic trend analyses of survival data predicted accumulated selection responses of 8.4 and 1.2%-units higher survival rates in earthen ponds and cold-water challenge tests, respectively. The average inbreeding coefficient (F) was estimated to be 2.1% in the G(4) generation. The results are discussed in a practical context of adapting selective breeding technology to a new aquaculture species and it is concluded that the ongoing selective breeding of blue tilapia in China has resulted in considerable genetic improvements of both growth (about 70% larger body weight at harvest) and pond survival after four generations of multi-trait selection.

VL  - 63

AB  - This study was carried out to study the diet type, genetic, morphometric and histological variations between two natural populations of Trachylepis quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza and Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum habitats. In this study, morphometric examination showed that Trachylepis quinquetaeniata is a typically ground-dwelling Skink and seems to be frequently associated with grass and below shrubs. Geographic variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and head size dimorphism (HSD) with greater dimensions in Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum compared with Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza might be correlated with spatial food availability and abundance or micro-evolutionary change or phenotypic plasticity. Also, the increase of body size and mass in individuals from Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum might be an adaptation to lower ambient temperature and hypoxia. Diet analysis showed that the bulk of gut contents were beetles, plant bugs, hymenopterans and dipterans. The remainder of the plant material was probably ingested secondarily. Moreover, the increase in the activity of Ldh in liver tissues of T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza could be confirmed by the significant increase in the accumulation of the total lipids in liver and muscle tissues than that in the other population. As well as, a marked degeneration, necrosis and desquamation of spermatogoneal cells lining seminiferous tubules in testes of T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum than that in the other population inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza that could be attributed to the bioaccumulation of soil heavy metals in testes. Higher carbohydrate accumulation in the former lizards' population was confirmed by the high availability and diversity of diet in El-Faiyum habitat. Thus we concluded that T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza is more active, energetic and adaptable in its habitat than T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum. © 2017 by the C.M.B.

VL  - 172

SP  - 645-652
AB  - Life history traits may vary within and among species. Rarely, however, are both variations examined concurrently to identify the life history adaptation. We found that female body size, offspring number and size, and incubation period showed convergent evolution in two lacertid lizards (Takydromus wolteri and Eremias argus) that occur sympatrically in high-latitude and low-latitude localities. Females from the high-latitude population were larger and produced larger clutches than those from the low-latitude population. In both species, the incubation period was shorter for the high-latitude population than for the low-latitude population. However, the physiological mechanism underlying the shorter incubation period differed between the species. These results suggest that: (1) sympatric lizards may adopt similar reproductive strategies in response to their common environments, and (2) embryonic development of the two species follows different pathways for adaptation to low temperatures. This study highlights the importance of understanding the adaptive evolution of life history in response to environmental changes at the embryonic life stages. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Quantifying exciton hopping in disordered media with quenching sites: Application to arrays of quantum dots
VL  - 88
IS  - 15
AB  - We present an analytical method for quantifying exciton hopping in an energetically disordered system with quenching sites. The method is subsequently used to provide a quantitative understanding of exciton hopping in a quantum dot (QD) array. Several statistical quantities that characterize the dynamics (survival probability, average number of distinct sites visited, average hopping distance, and average hopping rate in the initial stage) are obtained experimentally by measuring time-resolved fluorescence intensities at various temperatures. The time evolution of these quantities suggests in a quantitative way that at low temperature an exciton tends to be trapped at a local low-energy site, while at room temperature, exciton hopping occurs repeatedly, leading to a large hopping distance. This method will serve to facilitate highly efficient optoelectronic devices using QDs such as photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diodes, since exciton hopping is considered to strongly influence their operational parameters. The presence of a dark QD (quenching site) that exhibits fast decay is also quantified. © 2013 American Physical Society.

TI  - Life-history evolution on tropidurinae lizards: Influence of lineage, body size and climate
VL  - 6
IS  - 5
AB  - The study of life history variation is central to the evolutionary theory. In many ectothermic lineages, including lizards, life history traits are plastic and relate to several sources of variation including body size, which is both a factor and a life history trait likely to modulate reproductive parameters. Larger species within a lineage, for example tend to be more fecund and have larger clutch size, but clutch size may also be influenced by climate, independently of body size. Thus, the study of climatic effects on lizard fecundity is mandatory on the current scenario of global climatic change. We asked how body and clutch size have responded to climate through time in a group of tropical lizards, the Tropidurinae, and how these two variables relate to each other. We used both traditional and phylogenetic comparative methods. Body and clutch size are variable within Tropidurinae, and both traits are influenced by phylogenetic position. Across the lineage, species which evolved larger size produce more eggs and neither trait is influenced by temperature components. A climatic component of precipitation, however, relates to larger female body size, and therefore seems to exert an indirect relationship on clutch size. This effect of precipitation on body size is likely a correlate of primary production. A decrease in fecundity is expected for Tropidurinae species on continental landmasses, which are predicted to undergo a decrease in summer rainfall. © 2011 Brandt, Navas.

VL  - 33

SP  - 1768-1776
AB  - The understanding of protein evolution depends on the ability to relate the impact of mutations on molecular traits to organismal fitness. Biological activity and robustness have been regarded as important features in shaping protein evolutionary landscapes. Conformational dynamics, which is essential for protein function, has received little attention in the context of evolutionary analyses. Here we employ NMR spectroscopy, the chief experimental tool to describe protein dynamics at atomic level in solution at room temperature, to study the intrinsic dynamic features of a metallo-blactamase enzyme and three variants identified during a directed evolution experiment that led to an expanded substrate profile. We show that conformational dynamics in the catalytically relevant microsecond to millisecond timescale is optimized along the favored evolutionary trajectory. In addition, we observe that the effects of mutations on dynamics are epistatic. Mutation Gly262Ser introduces slow dynamics on several residues that surround the active site when introduced in the wild-type enzyme. Mutation Asn70Ser removes the slow dynamics observed for few residues of the wild-type enzyme, but increases the number of residues that undergo slow dynamics when introduced in the Gly262Ser mutant. These effects on dynamics correlate with the epistatic interaction between these two mutations on the bacterial phenotype. These findings indicate that conformational dynamics is an evolvable trait, and that proteins endowed with more dynamic active sites also display a larger potential for promoting evolution. © The Author 2016.

TI  - Melanism and ontogeny: A case study in lizards of the Liolaemus fitzingerii group (Squamata: Liolaemini)
VL  - 94
IS  - 3
SP  - 199-206
AB  - Color polymorphisms in general and melanism in particular have been the focus of many evolutionary adaptation studies. In lizards of the genus Liolaemus Wiegmann, 1834, patterns of melanism have been poorly studied, although they have been used as diagnostic characters for identifying and describing new species. We investigated the relationships between melanism, body size, sex, and time in a population of Rawson Lizard (Liolaemus xanthoviridis Cei and Scolaro, 1980) with extensive ventral melanism. The study took place in Bahía Isla Escondida, Chubut (Argentina), during three summer seasons (2012 to 2014). We tagged each individual, recorded body measurements and sex, and took ventral photographs to estimate the proportion of melanism. Our results showed that ventral melanism increased over time as each individual increased its snout–vent length (SVL). Body size explained 44% of the variation in melanism and males were more melanistic than females. Previous comparative studies of lizards in this species group showed no relationship between melanism and different taxonomic units or with thermal functionality. Here, we present evidence suggesting that melanism might be a character with an ontogenetic origin that is strongly associated with sex and body size. This pattern could be shared among species of this group of lizards, and even more importantly, it may be related to variable selection forces occurring throughout ontogeny. © 2016, All rights reserved.

VL  - 2015
IS  - 10
AB  - Titanosauria is a globally distributed clade of sometimes extremely large Mesozoic herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs. On the basis of current evidence these giant dinosaurs seem to have reproduced in specific and localized nesting sites. However, no investigations have been performed to understand the possible ecological and geological biases that acted for the selection of these nesting sites worldwide. In this study, observations were performed on the best-known Cretaceous nesting sites around the world. Our observations strongly suggest their eggs were incubated with environmental sources of heat, in burial conditions. Taking into account the clutch composition and geometry, the nature and properties of the sediments, the eggshells' structures and conductance, it would appear that titanosaurs adopted nesting behaviors comparable to the modern Australasian megapodes, using burrow-nesting in diverse media and mound-building strategies. © 2015 Hechenleitner et al.

TI  - Cranial size has increased over 133 years in a common bat, Pipistrellus kuhlii: A response to changing climate or urbanization?
VL  - 41
IS  - 5
SP  - 944-953
AB  - Aim: Bats are promising candidates for studying morphometric responses to anthropogenic climate or land-use changes. We assessed whether the cranial size of a common bat (Pipistrellus kuhlii) had changed between 1875 and 2007. We formulated the following hypotheses: (1) if heat loss is an important reaction to climate change, body size will have decreased in response to the increased temperatures, because small bats have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and dissipate heat more effectively; (2) if water loss is the main driver, body size will have increased in response to the temperature increase, because larger bats will lose water more slowly through a reduced surface-to-volume ratio; (3) the energetic benefits provided by urbanization (food concentration at street lamps, warmer maternity roosts in buildings) will lead to a general body size increase in P. kuhlii; and (4) because street lamps impair moth antipredatory manoeuvres, cranial size may have selectively increased as an adaptive response to handle larger prey (moths) in artificially illuminated sites. Ours is the first study to assess temporal trends in bat body size over more than a century and to relate them to urbanization. Location: Mainland Italy. Methods: We used traditional morphometrics to compare seven variables of skull size in 117 museum specimens (75 female, 42 male). Results: Cranial size increased after 1950, but this change was not paralleled by an increase in body size, measured as forearm length. This selective increase matched a rapid increase in electric public illumination in Italy. Main conclusions: Street lights are crucial foraging sites for P. kuhlii. The directional change that we found in cranial size might represent microevolutionary adaptive tracking of a sudden shift in food size, making more profitable prey available. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The growth and development of plants from most species is restricted by low temperature stress at some stage of their life cycle. To cope with this stress, plants have evolved adaptive mechanisms that are temperature regulated and involve acclimation processes that can be reversed. Survival of temperatures below freezing is normally the emphasis of discussions on breeding for low temperature tolerance in field crops. The selection for complex genetic traits such as low temperature tolerance, can be simplified in plant breeding programs when linked qualitative markers are identified. This method of locating quantitative trait loci requires a detailed marker gene linkage map and in many crop species there is a dearth of markers. In addition to providing sophisticated tools for more intensive studies to establish genetic potential at the chromosomal/DNA level, developments in molecular genetics have presented an opportunity to investigate expression of genetic potential at the RNA and polypeptide level. . © 1993 by the Crop Science Society of America, Inc.

VL  - 23

SP  - 2484-2493
AB  - We examined latitudinal variation in adult and larval heat tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster from eastern Australia. Adults were assessed using static and ramping assays. Basal and hardened static heat knockdown time showed significant linear clines; heat tolerance increased towards the tropics, particularly for hardened flies, suggesting that tropical populations have a greater hardening response. A similar pattern was evident for ramping heat knockdown time at 0.06-°C-min-1 increase. There was no cline for ramping heat knockdown temperature (CTmax) at 0.1-°C-min-1 increase. Acute (static) heat knockdown temperature increased towards temperate latitudes, probably reflecting a greater capacity of temperate flies to withstand sudden temperature increases during summer in temperate Australia. Larval viability showed a quadratic association with latitude under heat stress. Thus, patterns of heat resistance depend on assay methods. Genetic correlations in thermotolerance across life stages and evolutionary potential for critical thermal limits should be the focus of future studies. © 2010 The Authors.

VL  - 69
IS  - 8
SP  - 2210-2226
AB  - Although temperature variation is known to cause large-scale adaptive divergence, its potential role as a selective factor over microgeographic scales is less well-understood. Here, we investigated how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms) traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the presence of gene flow. © 2015, Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - A Quantitative Genomic Approach for Analysis of Fitness and Stress Related Traits in a Drosophila melanogaster Model Population
VL  - 2016
AB  - The ability of natural populations to withstand environmental stresses relies partly on their adaptive ability. In this study, we used a subset of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a population of inbred, genome-sequenced lines derived from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate whether this population harbors genetic variation for a set of stress resistance and life history traits. Using a genomic approach, we found substantial genetic variation for metabolic rate, heat stress resistance, expression of a major heat shock protein, and egg-to-adult viability investigated at a benign and a higher stressful temperature. This suggests that these traits will be able to evolve. In addition, we outline an approach to conduct pathway associations based on genomic linear models, which has potential to identify adaptive genes and pathways, and therefore can be a valuable tool in conservation genomics. © 2016 Palle Duun Rohde et al.

AB  - Life on Earth is limited by physical and chemical extremes that define the 'habitable space' within which it operates. Aside from its requirement for liquid water, no definite limits have been established for life under any extreme. Here, we employ growth data published for 67 prokaryotic strains to explore the limitations for microbial life under combined extremes of temperature, pH, salt (NaCl) concentrations, and pressure. Our review reveals a fundamental lack of information on the tolerance of microorganisms to multiple extremes that impedes several areas of science, ranging from environmental and industrial microbiology to the search for extraterrestrial life. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Is bigger better? A possibility for adaptation of Daphnia to filamentous cyanobacteria in the face of global warming
VL  - 798
IS  - 1
SP  - 105-118
AB  - Body size is a key determinant of fitness in Daphnia. Bigger size means higher feeding efficiency and reproduction. However, filamentous cyanobacteria have a more detrimental effect on larger daphnids. Predicted global warming is expected to reduce size of Daphnia and facilitate frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria. Therefore, we asked two questions: (i) does elevated temperature cause reduced size of daphnids, and (ii) is temperature-dependent size reduction adaptive in an environment dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria? To address these issues, we obtained 8 clones of the Daphnia longispina complex from artificially heated lakes and 8 clones from control lakes, and exposed them to a favorable food Scenedesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and the filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in life table experiments at 16, 20, and 24°C. Individuals from heated lakes attained larger body size than those from control lakes. Moreover, exposure to the filamentous cyanobacterium led to reduced fecundity of Daphnia from the non-heated lakes and did not affect reproduction of Daphnia from the heated lakes. We conclude that Daphnia display some evolutionary adaptations to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria, linked to long-term exposition to elevated temperature. Our results violate broadly accepted assumptions that ectotherms are smaller in warmer environments. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

TI  - Adaptive responses to cool climate promotes persistence of a non-native lizard
VL  - 282
IS  - 1803
AB  - Successful establishment and range expansion of non-native species often require rapid accommodation of novel environments. Here, we use commongarden experiments to demonstrate parallel adaptive evolutionary response to a cool climate in populations of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) introduced from southern Europe into England. Low soil temperatures in the introduced range delay hatching, which generates directional selection for a shorter incubation period. Non-native lizards from two separate lineages have responded to this selection by retaining their embryos for longer before oviposition— hence reducing the time needed to complete embryogenesis in the nest—and by an increased developmental rate at low temperatures. This divergence mirrors local adaptation across latitudes and altitudes within widely distributed species and suggests that evolutionary responses to climate can be very rapid. When extrapolated to soil temperatures encountered in nests within the introduced range, embryo retention and faster developmental rate result in one to several weeks earlier emergence compared with the ancestral state. We show that this difference translates into substantial survival benefits for offspring. This should promote short- and long-term persistence of nonnative populations, and ultimately enable expansion into areas that would be unattainable with incubation duration representative of the native range. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Life cycle truncation in a trematode: Does higher temperature indicate shorter host longevity?
VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 697-704
AB  - The typical three-host life cycle of most trematodes creates transmission challenges for which a variety of adaptations have evolved to increase the probability of transmission. Some species can abbreviate their life cycle via progenesis, the precocious maturation of the parasite in the second intermediate host resulting in the production of eggs through self-fertilisation without requiring a definitive host. Adoption of the progenetic life cycle may be a conditional strategy in response to different environmental cues related to low probability of transmission to the definitive host. Using high water temperature and/or limited diet as experimental stressors, we tested the effect of body condition and life span of the fish second intermediate host on facultative truncation of the typical three-host life cycle by progenesis in Stegodexamene anguillae. The results suggest that environmental cues, such as temperature and encystment site, may signal transmission opportunities to the parasite so that it may adjust its developmental strategy accordingly. Indeed, a greater proportion of worms became progenetic at higher temperatures, and progenesis was more common among worms encysted in the gonads or body cavity of their fish hosts than among those in other host tissues. These findings highlight the often unrecognised plasticity in parasite developmental and transmission strategies. (C) 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SP  - 99-105
AB  - In this paper two mathematical models with shrinkage effect describing eggplant drying are developed and discussed. The models are both modified diffusion equations and take differently into account changes of eggplant slice structure during drying. In the first model a diffusion coefficient variable with the water content is considered while in the second model a fictitious convective term is introduced. The two models are both suitable to describe the analyzed drying processes. Moreover, their equivalence is analytically demonstrated. Parameters values are estimated through a nonlinear regression procedure by comparison with the drying experiments carried out at different temperatures. Information about thickness evolution, derived from the models, are found to be in agreement with experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 22
IS  - 11
SP  - 3090-3097
AB  - To elucidate the mechanisms of thermal adaptation and acclimation in ectothermic aquatic organisms from differing climates, we used a common-garden experiment for thermal stress to investigate the heat shock response of redband trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdneri) from desert and montane populations. Evidence for adaptation was observed as expression of heat shock genes in fish from the desert population was more similar to control (unstressed) fish and significantly different (P ≤ 0.05) from those from the montane population, while F1 crosses were intermediate. High induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in the montane strain appeared to improve short-term survival during first exposure to high water temperatures, but high physiological costs of Hsp production may have led to lower long-term survival. In contrast, the desert strain had significantly lower heat shock response than the montane fish and F1 crosses, suggesting that these desert fish have evolved alternative mechanisms to deal with thermal stress that provide better balance of physiological costs. Genomewide tests of greater than 10 000 SNPs found multiple SNPs that were significantly associated with survival under thermal stress, including Hsp47 which consistently appeared as a strong candidate gene for adaption to desert climates. Candidate SNPs identified in this study are prime targets to screen more broadly across this species' range to predict the potential for adaptation under scenarios of climate change. These results demonstrate that aquatic species can evolve adaptive responses to thermal stress and provide insight for understanding how climate change may impact ectotherms. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Positive selection in development and growth rate regulation genes involved in species divergence of the genus Radix
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Life history traits like developmental time, age and size at maturity are directly related to fitness in all organisms and play a major role in adaptive evolution and speciation processes. Comparative genomic or transcriptomic approaches to identify positively selected genes involved in species divergence can help to generate hypotheses on the driving forces behind speciation. Here we use a bottom-up approach to investigate this hypothesis by comparative analysis of orthologous transcripts of four closely related European Radix species. Results: Snails of the genus Radix occupy species specific distribution ranges with distinct climatic niches, indicating a potential for natural selection driven speciation based on ecological niche differentiation. We then inferred phylogenetic relationships among the four Radix species based on whole mt-genomes plus 23 nuclear loci. Three different tests to infer selection and changes in amino acid properties yielded a total of 134 genes with signatures of positive selection. The majority of these genes belonged to the functional gene ontology categories "reproduction" and "genitalia" with an overrepresentation of the functions "development" and "growth rate". Conclusions: We show here that Radix species divergence may be primarily enforced by selection on life history traits such as (larval-) development and growth rate. We thus hypothesise that life history differences may confer advantages under the according climate regimes, e.g., species occupying warmer and dryer habitats might have a fitness advantage with fast developing susceptible life stages, which are more tolerant to habitat desiccation. © 2015 Feldmeyer et al.

TI  - Combining a coupled FTIR-EGA system and in situ DRIFTS for studying soil organic matter in arable soils
VL  - 10

SP  - 2897-2913
AB  - An optimized spectroscopic method combining quantitative evolved gas analysis via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-EGA) in combination with a qualitative in situ thermal reaction monitoring via diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (in situ(T) DRIFTS) is being proposed to rapidly characterize soil organic matter (SOM) to study its dynamics and stability. A thermal reaction chamber coupled with an infrared gas cell was used to study the pattern of thermal evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) in order to relate evolved gas (i.e., CO2) to different qualities of SOM. Soil samples were taken from three different arable sites in Germany: (i) the Static Fertilization Experiment, Bad Lauchstadt (Chernozem), from treatments of farmyard manure (FYM), mineral fertilizer (NPK), their combination (FYM + NPK) and control without fertilizer inputs; (ii) Kraichgau; and (iii) Swabian Alb (Cambisols) areas, Southwest Germany. The two latter soils were further fractionated into particulate organic matter (POM), sand and stable aggregates (Sa + A), silt and clay (Si + C), and NaOCl oxidized Si + C (rSOC) to gain OM of different inferred stabilities; respiration was measured from fresh soil samples incubated at 20 degrees C and 50% water holding capacity for 490 days. A variable long path length gas cell was used to record the mid-infrared absorbance intensity of CO2 (2400 to 2200 cm(-1)) being evolved during soil heating from 25 to 700 degrees C with a heating rate of 68 degrees C min(-1) and holding time of 10 min at 700 degrees C. Separately, the heating chamber was placed in a diffuse reflectance chamber (DRIFTS) for measuring the mid-infrared absorbance of the soil sample during heating. Thermal stability of the bulk soils and fractions was measured via the temperature of maximum CO2 evolution (CO2max). Results indicated that the FYM + NPK and FYM treatments of the Chernozem soils had a lower CO2max as compared to both NPK and CON treatments. On average, CO2max of the Chernozem was much higher (447 degrees C) as compared to the Cambisol sites (Kraichgau 392 degrees C; Swabian Alb 384 degrees C). The POM fraction had the highest CO2max (477 degrees C), while rSOC had a first peak at 265 degrees C at both sites and a second peak at 392 degrees C for the Swabian Alb and 482 degrees C for the Kraichgau. The CO2max increased after 490 day incubation, while the C lost during incubation was derived from the whole temperature range but a relatively higher proportion from 200 to 350 degrees C. In situT DRIFTS measurements indicated decreases in vibrational intensities in the order of C-H = unknown C vibration < C-H < -COO/C = C< C = C with increasing temperature, but interpretation of vibrational changes was complicated by changes in the spectra (i. e., overall vibrational intensity increased with temperature increase) of the sample during heating. The relative quality changes and corresponding temperatures shown by the in situT DRIFTS measurements enabled the fitting of four components or peaks to the evolved CO2 thermogram from the FTIR-EGA measurements. This gave a semi-quantitative measure of the quality of evolved C during the heating experiment, lending more evidence that different qualities of SOM are being evolved at different temperatures from 200 to 700 degrees C. The CO2max was influenced by long-term FYM input and also after 490 days of laboratory incubation, indicating that this measurement is an indicator for the relative overall SOM stability. The combination of FTIR-EGA and in situ(T) DRIFTS allows for a quantitative and qualitative monitoring of thermal reactions of SOM, revealing its relative stability, and provides a sound basis for a peak fitting procedure for assigning proportions of evolved CO2 to different thermal stability components.

TI  - Experimental evolution of insect immune memory versus pathogen resistance
VL  - 284
IS  - 1869
AB  - Under strong pathogen pressure, insects often evolve resistance to infection. Many insects are also protected via immune memory (immune priming), whereby sublethal exposure to a pathogen enhances survival after secondary infection. Theory predicts that immune memory should evolve when the pathogen is highly virulent, or when pathogen exposure is relatively rare. However, there are no empirical tests of these hypotheses, and the adaptive benefits of immune memory relative to direct resistance against a pathogen are poorly understood. To determine the selective pressures and ecological conditions that shape immune evolution, we imposed strong pathogen selection on flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) populations, infecting them with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for 11 generations. Populations injected first with heat-killed and then live Bt evolved high basal resistance against multiple Bt strains. By contrast, populations injected only with a high dose of live Bt evolved a less effective but strain-specific priming response. Control populations injected with heat-killed Bt did not evolve priming; and in the ancestor, priming was effective only against a low Bt dose. Intriguingly, one replicate population first evolved priming and subsequently evolved basal resistance, suggesting the potential for dynamic evolution of different immune strategies. Our work is the first report showing that pathogens can select for rapid modulation of insect priming ability, allowing hosts to evolve divergent immune strategies (generalized resistance versus specific immune memory) with potentially distinct mechanisms. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

AB  - Magnetic Cooper-pairing mechanisms have been proposed for heavy-fermion and cuprate superconductors; however, strong electron correlations and complications arising from a pseudogap or competing phases have precluded commonly accepted theories. In the iron arsenides, the proximity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in the phase diagram, the apparently weak electron-phonon coupling and the resonance peak in the superconducting spin-excitation spectrum have also fostered the hypothesis of magnetically mediated Cooper pairing. However, as most theories of superconductivity are based on a pairing boson of sufficient spectral weight in the normal state, detailed knowledge of the spin-excitation spectrum above the superconducting transition temperature T c is required to assess the viability of this hypothesis. Using inelastic neutron scattering we have studied the spin excitations in optimally doped BaFe 1.85 Co 0.15 As 2 (T c =25 K) over a wide range of temperatures and energies. We present the results in absolute units and find that the normal-state spectrum carries a weight comparable to that in underdoped cuprates. In contrast to cuprates, however, the spectrum agrees well with predictions of the theory of nearly antiferromagnetic metals, without the aforementioned complications. We also show that the temperature evolution of the resonance energy monotonically follows the closing of the superconducting energy gap Δ, as expected from conventional Fermi-liquid approaches. Our observations point to a surprisingly simple theoretical description of the spin dynamics in the iron arsenides and provide a solid foundation for models of magnetically mediatedsuperconductivity. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Temperature-dependent torque transmissibility characteristic for automotive dry dual clutches
SP  - 2126-2131
AB  - Dry clutches are widely used in automated manual transmissions. In order to obtain 'good' clutch engagements a precise torque transmissibility estimation is crucial. In this paper, a temperature-dependent model of the torque transmissibility characteristic for dry dual clutches is proposed. Dynamic models of the clutches thermal evolutions are determined and linked to the characteristics of the mechanical components influencing the torque transmissibility. Numerical simulations obtained by considering a realistic powertrain model with a dry dual clutch transmission and a corresponding multivariable controller, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2015 EUCA.

TI  - Are viviparous lizards more vulnerable to climate warming because they have evolved reduced body temperature and heat tolerance?
VL  - 185
IS  - 4
SP  - 573-582
AB  - Lizards may experience population declines and extinctions on a similar scale to that experienced by amphibians, and climate warming is one hypothesis proposed to explain these declines and extinctions. Within lizards, viviparous species are hypothesized to be more vulnerable to climate warming, because they have evolved reduced body temperature and heat tolerance, but this idea remains untested. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three temperatures (20, 24, and 28 °C) × two species [Phrynocephalus przewalskii (oviparous) and P. putjatia (viviparous)] factorial design experiment that simulated warming on oviparous versus viviparous lizards. Our manipulation of ambient temperature affected activity and thermal preference in both species, birth date in P. putjatia, and egg mass in P. przewalskii; other examined traits (fecundity, reproductive output, and size, morphology, and sprint speed of offspring) were not affected. Neither in P. putjatia nor in P. przewalskii behavioral responses to rising temperatures differ between the sexes. The viviparous species thermoregulated more actively than did the oviparous species, but the two species did not differ in thermal preference. Warming reduced the activity time allotted for thermoregulation in both species, but the effect was more dramatic in the viviparous species. Our data support one of the central predictions that lead to the hypothesis that viviparous lizards are more vulnerable to climate warming; however, this is not because viviparous lizards have evolved reduced body temperature and heat tolerance, but, because warming constrains activity more dramatically in viviparous species. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

TI  - Stream Noise, Hybridization, and Uncoupled Evolution of Call Traits in Two Lineages of Poison Frogs: Oophaga histrionica and Oophaga lehmanni
VL  - 8
IS  - 10
AB  - According to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, communication signals are evolutionary shaped in a way that minimizes its degradation and maximizes its contrast against the background noise. To compare the importance for call divergence of acoustic adaptation and hybridization, an evolutionary force allegedly promoting phenotypic variation, we compared the mate recognition signal of two species of poison frogs (Oophaga histrionica and O. lehmanni) at five localities: two (one per species) alongside noisy streams, two away from streams, and one interspecific hybrid. We recorded the calls of 47 males and characterized the microgeographic variation in their spectral and temporal features, measuring ambient noise level, body size, and body temperature as covariates. As predicted, frogs living in noisy habitats uttered high frequency calls and, in one species, were much smaller in size. These results support a previously unconsidered role of noise on streams as a selective force promoting an increase in call frequency and pleiotropic effects in body size. Regarding hybrid frogs, their calls overlapped in the signal space with the calls of one of the parental lineages. Our data support acoustic adaptation following two evolutionary routes but do not support the presumed role of hybridization in promoting phenotypic diversity. © 2013 Vargas-Salinas, Amézquita.

AB  - Fine grained polycrystalline NiTi shape memory alloys containing 15 at.% Hf and Zr and zero or 3 at.% Cu fabricated by ingot metallurgy were investigated using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction in order to examine the viability of producing stable and affordable high temperature shape memory alloys. The alloys produced had a high thermal hysteresis, in excess of 70 degrees C but At temperatures of over 250 degrees C were obtained for Ni50Ti35Hf15. 3 at.% Cu additions did not significantly reduce the per-cycle degradation of transformation temperatures but did reduce the transformation temperatures. The evolution of the lattice parameters during the first five thermal cycles was observed. Negative thermal expansion was found in the b(B19'), cell direction in all the alloys examined and significant deviations in the lattice parameters in the region of transformation were found. A per-cycle evolution in the end-point B19' lattice parameters was observed, but no such evolution was found for the B2 phase, which is rationalised by appealing to the increase in population of interface dislocations.

VL  - 76
IS  - 10
SP  - 2558-2570
AB  - The parental influences on three progeny traits (survival to eyed-embryo stage, post-hatching body length and yolk-sac volume) of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus were studied under two thermal conditions (2 and 7° C) using a factorial mating design. The higher temperature resulted in elevated mortality rates and less advanced development at hatching. Survival was mostly attributable to maternal effects at both temperatures, but the variation among families was dependent on egg size only at the low temperature. No additive genetic variation (or pure sire effect) could be observed, whereas the non-additive genetic effects (parental combination) contributed to offspring viability at 2° C. In contrast, any observable genetic variance in survival was lost at 7° C, most likely due to the increased environmental variance. Irrespective of temperature, dam and sire-dam interaction contributed significantly to the phenotypic variation in both larval length and yolk size. A significant proportion of the variation in larval length was also due to the sire effect at 2° C. Maternal effects were mediated partly through egg size, but as a whole, they decreased in importance at the high temperature, enabling a concomitant increase in non-additive genetic effects. For larval length, however, the additive component, like maternal effects, decreased at 7° C. The present results suggest that an exposure to thermal stress during incubation can modify the genetic architecture of early developmental traits in S. alpinus and presumably constrain their short-term adaptive potential and evolvability by increasing the amount of environmentally induced variation. © 2010 The FGFRI.

TI  - Implications of climate change for the reproductive capacity and survival of New World silversides (family Atherinopsidae)
VL  - 77
IS  - 8
SP  - 1818-1834
AB  - The New World silversides (family Atherinopsidae) are found in marine, estuarine and inland waters of North, Central and South America, where they are ecologically important as forage fishes and sometimes economically important for commercial and recreational fisheries. This report reviews the knowledge of the reproductive attributes of temperate and subtropical atherinopsids in relation to temperature and discusses the potential effects of climate change on their reproduction and adaptive responses. Their reproductive cycles are primarily entrained by photoperiod with high temperature acting as a limiting factor. They are generally multiple spawners which release successive batches of eggs in spring, but some species can spawn also in autumn and even summer when temperatures do not increase excessively. The decoupling of temperature patterns and photoperiod with further global warming and associated asymmetric thermal fluctuations could lead to spawning at times or temperatures that are unsuitable for larval development and growth. Many members of this family show temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), where the phenotypic sex of an individual is determined partly or wholly by the temperature experienced during gonadal sex differentiation, and high-temperature induced germ cell degeneration and decreased fertility. The predicted short-term reproductive responses of atherinopsids to climate change therefore include acceleration, shortening or overall disruption of spawning activity, and also more subtle, but nonetheless equally population-threatening, dysfunctions such as highly skewed sex ratios and partial or total loss of fertility. In the case of species with TSD, asymmetric thermal fluctuations could also cause larvae to encounter temperatures lower than normal during early development and be feminized. Such dysfunctions have been documented already in natural populations but are confined so far to landlocked, inland water habitats, perhaps because they impose more severe thermal fluctuations and limitations to migration and dispersal. The severity and recurrence of these dysfunctions with further climate change will depend both on the magnitude, speed and pattern of change and on how much (or how fast) physiological and behavioural traits can evolve to match the new conditions imposed by the climate, which is largely unknown. In this regard, compelling evidence is shown that numerous traits, including the sex determination system, are capable of rapid evolution and could mitigate the negative effects of temperature increases on population viability in atherinopsids. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Many organisms modify their physiological functions by acclimating to changes in their environment. Recent studies of thermal physiology have been influenced by verbal models that fail to consider the selective advantage of acclimation and thus make no predictions about variation in acclimation capacity. We used a quantitative model of optimal plasticity to generate predictions about the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to acclimate to developmental temperature. This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations. Based on the model, we expected that flies from the highly seasonal environment of New Jersey would acclimate thermal sensitivity more than would flies from the less seasonal environment of Florida. When raised at constant and fluctuating temperatures, flies from these populations failed to adjust their thermal optima in the way predicted by the model, suggesting that current assumptions about functional and genetic constraints should be reconsidered. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Survival of E. coli O157:H12 in creek sediments after inoculation and re-inoculation
VL  - 46

SP  - 234-245
AB  - This work tested the hypothesis that E. coli survival after streambed sediment inoculation does not differ significantly from survival in the same sediment after re-inoculation. The E. coli O157:H12 survived in two sediments with markedly different particle size distributions and organic matter contents in one-month-long experiments in flow-through chambers at 14°C and 23°C. The inactivation rates after re-inoculation were smaller than after inoculation; the differences were significant (P < 0.1) in two of four experiments. This study suggests that E. coli O157:H12 was able to adapt to the sediment environment so that its survival after re-inoculation improved. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

VL  - 19

AB  - In ectotherms, variation in life history traits among populations is common and suggests local adaptation. However, geographic variation itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (QST) obtained from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably neutral microsatellite markers (FST). We found that R. temporaria populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in different temperatures at local, and in FST at regional scale. Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the divergence in growth and development rates as well as in temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 9789400759312
SP  - 387-411
AB  - Extreme environments are habitats that experience steady or fluctuating exposure to one or more environmental factors, such as salinity, osmolarity, desiccation, UV radiation, barometric pressure, pH, temperature, heavy metals, xenobiotics and antibiotics. The evolutionary biologist studies the steps by which the adaptations have evolved. But the general nature of such adaptive steps is still unclear. Evolution is often thought to be random and dependent on unpredictable events. This chapter focuses on antibiotic and xenobiotic stress in the environment and the microbial adaptations along with the genetic regulation of these stresses. Bacteria have come up with sophisticated modes of cooperative behaviour to cope with adverse and varying environmental conditions. They developed intricate communication capabilities, including a broad repertoire of chemical signaling mechanisms, collective activation and deactivation of genes and even exchange of genetic materials. With these tools, they can communicate and self-organize their colonies into multicellular hierarchical aggregates, out of which new abilities emerge. Many examples of bacterial mechanisms are thought to be adaptations for survival in changing environments, some of which are the mutator phenotypes, sporulation, adaptive mutation, and phase variation. The most frequently proposed hypothesis is that genes involved in antibiotic resistance originated in antibiotic-producing organisms, as part of the cluster involved in antibiotic biogenesis, to prevent self-inhibition. Eventually, these genes may have moved to the neighboring bacterial organisms, which then became resistant. Alternatively, these neighboring organisms may have introduced changes in the DNA sequence of possibly duplicate genes involved in functions that were thus reoriented to antibiotic elimination or detoxification. Recent studies have revealed the existence of new types of xenobiotic catabolic mobile genetic elements, such as catabolic genomic islands, which integrate into the chromosome after transfer. Molecular analysis of the catabolic pathways of xenobiotic-degrading bacteria indicated that they might have adapted to the appearance of such compounds by expressing new functions to resist the potential toxic effects of the molecules or to use their beneficiary characteristics, for example, as an alternative source of essential nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen or energy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 19

SP  - 2625-2633
AB  - Global warming and contamination represent two major threats to biodiversity that have the potential to interact synergistically. There is the potential for gradual local thermal adaptation and dispersal to higher latitudes to mitigate the susceptibility of organisms to contaminants and global warming at high latitudes. Here, we applied a space-for-time substitution approach to study the thermal dependence of the susceptibility of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae to zinc in a common garden warming experiment (20 and 24 °C) with replicated populations from three latitudes spanning >1500 km in Europe. We observed a striking latitude-specific effect of temperature on the zinc-induced mortality pattern; local thermal adaptation along the latitudinal gradient made Swedish, but not French, damselfly larvae more susceptible to zinc at 24 °C. Latitude- and temperature-specific differences in zinc susceptibility may be related to the amount of energy available to defend against and repair damage since Swedish larvae showed a much stronger zinc-induced reduction of food intake at 24 °C. The pattern of local thermal adaptation indicates that the predicted temperature increase of 4 °C by 2100 will strongly magnify the impact of a contaminant such as zinc at higher latitudes unless there is thermal evolution and/or migration of lower latitude genotypes. Our results underscore the critical importance of studying the susceptibility to contaminants under realistic warming scenarios taking into account local thermal adaptation across natural temperature gradients. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 436

SP  - 1667-1673
AB  - We report the results of our three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulation of collapsing unmagnetized molecular cloud cores. We investigate the formation and evolution of the circumstellar disc and the clumps formed by disc fragmentation. Our simulation shows that disc fragmentation occurs in the early phase of circumstellar disc evolution and many clumps form. The clump can be represented by a polytrope sphere of index n similar to 3 and n greater than or similar to 4 at central temperature T-c less than or similar to 100 K and T-c greater than or similar to 100 K, respectively. We demonstrate, numerically and theoretically, that the maximum mass of the clump, beyond which it inevitably collapses, is similar to 0.03 M-circle dot. The entropy of the clump increases during its evolution, implying that evolution is chiefly determined by mass accretion from the disc rather than by radiative cooling. Although most of the clumps rapidly migrate inward and finally fall on to the protostar, a few clumps remain in the disc. The central density and temperature of the surviving clump rapidly increase and the clump undergoes a second collapse within 1000-2000 years after its formation. In our simulation, three second cores of masses 0.2 M-circle dot, 0.15 M-circle dot and 0.06 M-circle dot formed. These are protostars or brown dwarfs rather than protoplanets. For the clumps to survive as planetary-mass objects, the rapid mass accretion should be prevented by some mechanisms.

AB  - Understanding how natural selection generates and maintains adaptive genetic diversity in heterogeneous environments is key to predicting the evolutionary response of populations to rapid environmental change. Detecting selection in complex spatial environments remains challenging, especially for threatened species where the effects of strong genetic drift may overwhelm signatures of selection. We carried out a basinwide riverscape genomic analysis in the threatened southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), an ecological specialist with low dispersal potential. High-resolution environmental data and 5162 high-quality filtered SNPs were used to clarify spatial population structure and to assess footprints of selection associated with a steep hydroclimatic gradient and with human disturbance across the naturally and anthropogenically fragmented Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). Our approach included FST outlier tests to define neutral loci, and a combination of spatially explicit genotype-environment association analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci while controlling for the effects of landscape structure and shared population history. We found low levels of genetic diversity and strong neutral population structure consistent with expectations based on spatial stream hierarchy and life history. In contrast, variables related to precipitation and temperature appeared as the most important environmental surrogates for putatively adaptive genetic variation at both regional and local scales. Human disturbance also influenced the variation in candidate loci for adaptation, but only at a local scale. Our study contributes to understanding of adaptive evolution along naturally and anthropogenically fragmented ecosystems. It also offers a tangible example of the potential contributions of landscape genomics for informing in situ and ex situ conservation management of biodiversity. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Metabolism is generally required for cellular maintenance and for the generation of offspring under conditions that support growth. The rates, yields (efficiencies), adaptation time and robustness of metabolism are therefore key determinants of cellular fitness. For biotechnological applications and our understanding of the evolution of metabolism, it is necessary to figure out how the functional system properties of metabolism can be optimized, via adjustments of the kinetics and expression of enzymes, and by rewiring metabolism. The trade-offs that can occur during such optimizations then indicate fundamental limits to evolutionary innovations and bioengineering. In this paper, we review several theoretical and experimental findings about mechanisms for metabolic optimization. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Unexpected high genetic diversity in small populations suggests maintenance by associative overdominance
VL  - 26
IS  - 23
SP  - 6510-6523
AB  - The effective population size (Ne) is a central factor in determining maintenance of genetic variation. The neutral theory predicts that loss of variation depends on Ne, with less genetic drift in larger populations. We monitored genetic drift in 42 Drosophila melanogaster populations of different adult census population sizes (10, 50 or 500) using pooled RAD sequencing. In small populations, variation was lost at a substantially lower rate than expected. This observation was consistent across two ecological relevant thermal regimes, one stable and one with a stressful increase in temperature across generations. Estimated ratios between Ne and adult census size were consistently higher in small than in larger populations. The finding provides evidence for a slower than expected loss of genetic diversity and consequently a higher than expected long-term evolutionary potential in small fragmented populations. More genetic diversity was retained in areas of low recombination, suggesting that associative overdominance, driven by disfavoured homozygosity of recessive deleterious alleles, is responsible for the maintenance of genetic diversity in smaller populations. Consistent with this hypothesis, the X-chromosome, which is largely free of recessive deleterious alleles due to hemizygosity in males, fits neutral expectations even in small populations. Our experiments provide experimental answers to a range of unexpected patterns in natural populations, ranging from variable diversity on X-chromosomes and autosomes to surprisingly high levels of nucleotide diversity in small populations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 89
IS  - 1
SP  - 183-188
AB  - A rare diminutive belemnite, Pumiliobelus n. Gen., is described based on the new species P. haigi and P. Tumidus from the upper Gearle Siltstone (Cenomanian) of the Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia. No smaller belemnites than these species are known. That they are based on adult specimens rather than juveniles is supported by a large sample, some 80 specimens, of P. haigi which collectively show a proportional range in size typical of belemnite species in general, a group in which juveniles are conspicuously lacking in the fossil record. Rostral morphology places Pumiliobelus in the Dimitobelidae, a distinctively Austral family of Aptian-Maastrichtian age, which became progressively restricted to high latitudes through the late Cretaceous. Each species of Pumiliobelus is known from a single locality where it co-occurs with the long-ranging (Albian-Cenomanian) Dimitobelus diptychus Whitehouse of widespread distribution at mid to high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Dwarfism in the Dimitobelidae, as expressed by Pumiliobelus, is considered to reflect adaptive evolution to engage opportunistic life strategies that favored small body size and rapid population turnover. The rare occurrence of dwarf Dimitobelidae indicates that such strategies were limited in both geographic range and duration. Dwarfism expressed by Pumiliobelus may relate to paedomorphosis induced by rising seawater temperatures in the mid Cretaceous. © 2015, The Paleontological Society.

VL  - 11

SP  - 8661-8688
AB  - Up to now, traffic noise effect studies focused on hypertension as health outcome. Hypotension has not been considered as a potential health outcome although in experiments some people also responded to noise with decreases of blood pressure. Currently, the characteristics of these persons are not known and whether this down regulation of blood pressure is an experimental artifact, selection, or can also be observed in population studies is unanswered. In a cross-sectional replication study, we randomly sampled participants (age 20-75, N = 807) from circular areas (radius = 500 m) around 31 noise measurement sites from four noise exposure strata (35-44, 45-54, 55-64, >64 Leq, dBA). Repeated blood pressure measurements were available for a smaller sample (N = 570). Standardized information on socio-demographics, housing, life style and health was obtained by door to door visits including anthropometric measurements. Noise and air pollution exposure was assigned by GIS based on both calculation and measurements. Reported hypotension or hypotension medication past year was the main outcome studied. Exposure-effect relationships were modeled with multiple non-linear logistic regression techniques using separate noise estimations for total, highway and rail exposure. Reported hypotension was significantly associated with rail and total noise exposure and strongly modified by weather sensitivity. Reported hypotension medication showed associations of similar size with rail and total noise exposure without effect modification by weather sensitivity. The size of the associations in the smaller sample with BMI as additional covariate was similar. Other important cofactors (sex, age, BMI, health) and moderators (weather sensitivity, adjacent main roads and associated annoyance) need to be considered as indispensible part of the observed relationship. This study confirms a potential new noise effect pathway and discusses potential patho-physiological routes of actions. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Sexual and Natural Selection Both Influence Male Genital Evolution
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
AB  - Rapid and divergent evolution of male genital morphology is a conspicuous and general pattern across internally fertilizing animals. Rapid genital evolution is thought to be the result of sexual selection, and the role of natural selection in genital evolution remains controversial. However, natural and sexual selection are believed to act antagonistically on male genital form. We conducted an experimental evolution study to investigate the combined effects of natural and sexual selection on the genital-arch lobes of male Drosophila simulans. Replicate populations were forced to evolve under lifetime monogamy (relaxed sexual selection) or lifetime polyandry (elevated sexual selection) and two temperature regimes, 25°C (relaxed natural selection) or 27°C (elevated natural selection) in a fully factorial design. We found that natural and sexual selection plus their interaction caused genital evolution. Natural selection caused some aspects of genital form to evolve away from their sexually selected shape, whereas natural and sexual selection operated in the same direction for other shape components. Additionally, sexual and natural selection tended to favour larger genitals. Thus we find that the underlying selection driving genital evolution is complex, does not only involve sexual selection, and that natural selection and sexual selection do not always act antagonistically. © 2013 House et al.

TI  - Testing for local adaptation and evolutionary potential along altitudinal gradients in rainforest Drosophila: beyond laboratory estimates
VL  - 23
IS  - 5
SP  - 1847-1860
AB  - Predicting how species will respond to the rapid climatic changes predicted this century is an urgent task. Species distribution models (SDMs) use the current relationship between environmental variation and species’ abundances to predict the effect of future environmental change on their distributions. However, two common assumptions of SDMs are likely to be violated in many cases: (i) that the relationship of environment with abundance or fitness is constant throughout a species’ range and will remain so in future and (ii) that abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, humidity) determine species’ distributions. We test these assumptions by relating field abundance of the rainforest fruit fly Drosophila birchii to ecological change across gradients that include its low and high altitudinal limits. We then test how such ecological variation affects the fitness of 35 D. birchii families transplanted in 591 cages to sites along two altitudinal gradients, to determine whether genetic variation in fitness responses could facilitate future adaptation to environmental change. Overall, field abundance was highest at cooler, high-altitude sites, and declined towards warmer, low-altitude sites. By contrast, cage fitness (productivity) increased towards warmer, lower-altitude sites, suggesting that biotic interactions (absent from cages) drive ecological limits at warmer margins. In addition, the relationship between environmental variation and abundance varied significantly among gradients, indicating divergence in ecological niche across the species’ range. However, there was no evidence for local adaptation within gradients, despite greater productivity of high-altitude than low-altitude populations when families were reared under laboratory conditions. Families also responded similarly to transplantation along gradients, providing no evidence for fitness trade-offs that would favour local adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of (i) measuring genetic variation in key traits under ecologically relevant conditions, and (ii) considering the effect of biotic interactions when predicting species’ responses to environmental change. © 2017 The Authors.

VL  - 91

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can be a passive response to fluctuating environmental conditions or an active and presumably adaptive (evolved) response selected for in different environments. Here we ask if the larval decision to enter diapause when reared on a host plant associated with a colder habitat is an active or a passive response to host-plant quality or suitability. We compare plasticity in larval propensity to enter diapause of the habitat generalist butterfly Leptidea sinapis and the meadow specialist Leptidea reali in a range of temperatures and long day length on a forest plant, Lathyrus linifolius, and a meadowassociated plant, Lathyrus pratensis. The warmer meadow habitat promotes direct development whereas the colder forest habitat is conducive to diapause. Larvae of L. sinapis had a higher propensity to enter diapause when reared on the forest plant L. linifolius across all temperatures. Conversely, the propensity of L. reali to enter diapause was consistently lower and did not differ between host plants. Larval growth rates were similar between and within butterfly species and between host plants. Hence, we conclude that larval pathway decision-making in L. sinapis is an active response mediated by information from their host plants. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Rapid acquisition of gigapascal-high-pressure resistance by Escherichia coli
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
AB  - Pressure and temperature are important environmental variables that influence living systems. However, while they vary over a considerable range on Earth and other planets, it has hardly been addressed how straightforwardly and to what extent cellular life can acquire resistance to extremes of these parameters within a defined genomic context and a limited number of generations. Nevertheless, this is a very pertinent question with respect to the penetration of life in allegedly inhospitable environments. In this study, directed evolution was used to reveal the potential of the nonsporulating and mesophilic model bacterium Escherichia coli to develop the ability to survive exposure to high temperature or pressure. While heat resistance could only marginally be increased, our data show that piezoresistance could readily and reproducibly be extended into the GPa range, thereby greatly exceeding the currently recognized maximum for growth or survival. © 2011 Vanlint et al.

TI  - Trait Associations across Evolutionary Time within a Drosophila Phylogeny: Correlated Selection or Genetic Constraint?
VL  - 8
IS  - 8
AB  - Traits do not evolve independently. To understand how trait changes under selection might constrain adaptive changes, phenotypic and genetic correlations are typically considered within species, but these capture constraints across a few generations rather than evolutionary time. For longer-term constraints, comparisons are needed across species but associations may arise because of correlated selection pressures rather than genetic interactions. Implementing a unique approach, we use known patterns of selection to separate likely trait correlations arising due to correlated selection from those reflecting genetic constraints. We examined the evolution of stress resistance in >90 Drosophila species adapted to a range of environments, while controlling for phylogeny. Initially we examined the role of climate and phylogeny in shaping the evolution of starvation and body size, two traits previously not examined in this context. Following correction for phylogeny only a weak relationship between climate and starvation resistance was detected, while all of the variation in the relationship between body size and climate could be attributed to phylogeny. Species were divided into three environmental groups (hot and dry, hot and wet, cold) with the expectation that, if genetic correlations underpin trait correlations, these would persist irrespective of the environment, whereas selection-driven evolution should produce correlations dependent on the environment. We found positive associations between most traits in hot and dry environments coupled with high trait means. In contrast few trait correlations were observed in hot/wet and cold environments. These results suggest trait associations are primarily driven by correlated selection rather than genetic interactions, highlighting that such interactions are unlikely to limit evolution of stress resistance. © 2013 Kellermann et al.

AB  - Here we demonstrate that ciliated protozoa can jettison mitochondria as intact organelles, releasing their contents to the extracellular space either in a soluble form, or in association with membrane vesicles at the cell periphery. The response is triggered by lateral clustering of GPI-anchored surface antigens, or by heat shock. In the first instance, extrusion is accompanied by elevated levels of intracellular calcium and is inhibited by Verapamil and BAPTA-AM arguing strongly for the involvement of calcium in triggering the response. Cells survive mitochondrial discharge raising the interesting possibility that extrusion is an early evolutionary adaptation to cell stress. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society.

VL  - 38
IS  - 10
SP  - 950-958
AB  - We hypothesize that under the predicted scenario of climate change epigenetically mediated environmental sex determination could become an epigenetic trap. Epigenetically regulated environmental sex determination is a mechanism by which species can modulate their breeding strategies to accommodate environmental change. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may play a key role in phenotypic plasticity and in the rapid adaptation of species to environmental change, through the capacity of organisms to maintain a non-genetic plastic memory of the environmental and ecological conditions experienced by their parents. However, inherited epigenetic variation could also be maladaptive, becoming an epigenetic trap. This is because environmental sex determination can alter sex ratios by increasing the survival of one of the sexes at the expense of negative fitness consequences for the other, which could lead not only to the collapse of natural populations, but also have an impact in farmed animal and plant species. © 2016 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Reliability of microbial (starter) strains in terms of quality, functional properties, growth performance, and robustness is essential for industrial applications. In an industrial fermentation process, the bacterium should be able to successfully withstand various adverse conditions during processing, such as acid, osmotic, temperature, and oxidative stresses. Besides the evolved defense mechanisms, stress-induced mutations participate in adaptive evolution for survival under stress conditions. However, this may lead to accumulation of mutant strains, which may be accompanied by loss of desired functional properties. Denning the effects of specific fermentation or processing conditions on the mutation frequency is an important step toward preventing loss of genome integrity and maintaining the productivity of industrial strains. Therefore, a set of Lactobacillus plantarum mutator reporter strains suitable for qualitative and quantitative analysis of lowfrequency mutation events was developed. The mutation reporter system constructed was validated by using chemical mutagenesis (N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanldlne) and by controlled expression of endogenous candidate mutator genes (e.g., a truncated derivative of the L. plantarum hexA gene). Growth at different temperatures, under low-pH conditions, at high salt concentrations, or under starvation conditions did not have a significant effect on the mutation frequency. However, incubation with sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide resulted in a 100-fold increase in the mutation frequency compared to the background mutation frequency. Importantly, when cells of L. plantarum were adapted to 42°C prior to treatment with sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide, there was a 10-fold increase in survival after peroxide treatment, and there was a concomitant 50-fold decrease in the mutation frequency. These results show that specific environmental conditions encountered by bacteria may significantly influence the genetic stability of strains, while protection against mutagenic conditions may be obtained by pretreatment of cultures with other, nonmutagenic stress conditions.

TI  - Estimates of volume and magma input in crustal magmatic systems from zircon geochronology: The effect of modeling assumptions and system variables
VL  - 4
AB  - Magma fluxes in the Earth’s crust play an important role in regulating the relationship between the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, the chemical evolution of magmatic systems, and the distribution of geothermal energy and mineral resources on our planet. Therefore, quantifying magma productivity and the rate of magma transfer within the crust can provide valuable insights to characterize the long-term behavior of volcanic systems and to unveil the link between the physical and chemical evolution of magmatic systems and their potential to generate resources. We performed thermal modeling to compute the temperature evolution of crustal magmatic intrusions with different final volumes assembled over a variety of timescales (i.e., at different magma fluxes). Using these results, we calculated synthetic populations of zircon ages assuming the number of zircons crystallizing in a given time period is directly proportional to the volume of magma at temperature within the zircon crystallization range. The statistical analysis of the calculated populations of zircon ages shows that the mode, median, and standard deviation of the populations varies coherently as function of the rate of magma injection and final volume of the crustal intrusions. Therefore, the statistical properties of the population of zircon ages can add useful constraints to quantify the rate of magma injection and the final volume of magmatic intrusions. Here, we explore the effect of different ranges of zircon saturation temperature, intrusion geometry, and wall rock temperature on the calculated distributions of zircon ages. Additionally, we determine the effect of undersampling on the variability of mode, median, and standards deviation of calculated populations of zircon ages to estimate the minimum number of zircon analyses necessary to obtain meaningful estimates of magma flux and final intrusion volume. © 2016 Caricchi, Simpson and Schaltegger.

When artificial selection is applied to a single component of a stress response, this selection may result in correlated responses in other stress responses, a phenomenon called cross-tolerance, which is ultimately controlled by the genetic correlations among traits. We selected for extreme responses to cold tolerance by selecting for chill-coma recovery time from a single temperate population of Drosophila melanogaster. Chill-coma recovery time is a common metric of low, but non-lethal, cold temperature tolerance. Replicated divergent artificial selection was applied to a genetically variable base population for 31 generations, resulting in two cold resistant, two cold susceptible, and two unselected control lines. To quantify the relationship between selection on chill-coma recovery and other metrics of thermal performance, we also measured survivorship after acute cold exposure, survivorship after chronic cold exposure, survivorship after cold exposure following a pre-treatment period (rapid cold hardening), starvation tolerance, and heat tolerance. We find that chill-coma recovery time is heritable within this population and that there is an asymmetric response to increased and decreased chill-coma recovery time. Surprisingly, we found no cross-tolerances between selection on chill-coma recovery time and the other environmental stress response traits. These results suggest that although artificial selection has dramatically altered chill-coma recovery time, the correlated response to selection on other stress response phenotypes has been negligible. The lack of a correlated response suggests that chill-coma recovery time in these selection lines is likely genetically independent from measures of cold survivorship tested here.

AB  - Timing of reproduction greatly influences offspring success and resulting population production. Explaining and predicting species' dynamics necessitates disentangling the intrinsic (genotypic) and extrinsic (climatic) factors controlling reproductive timing. Here we explore temporal and spatial changes in spawning time for 21 populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) across the species' range (40° to 80° N). We estimate spawning time using a physiologically relevant metric that includes information on fish thermal history (degree-days, DD). First, we estimate spawning DD among years (within populations) to show how recent changes in spawning time can be explained by local changes in temperature. Second, we employ spawning DD to identify temperature-independent trends in spawning time among populations that are consistent with parallel adaptive evolution and the evolutionary history of the species. Finally, we use our results to estimate spawning time under future climate regimes, and discuss the implications for cod ecology across the species' range. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 156
IS  - 4
SP  - 389-393
AB  - Water temperature is expected to rise on coral reefs due to global warming. Here, we have examined if increased temperature reduces the hypoxia tolerance of coral reef fish (measured as critical [O-2]), and if temperature acclimation in adults can change the resting rate of O-2 consumption and critical [O-2]. Two common species from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) were tested, Doederlein's cardinalfish (Ostorhinchus doederleini) and lemon damselfish (Pomacentrus moluccensis). In both species, a 3 degrees C rise in water temperature caused increased oxygen consumption and reduced hypoxia tolerance, changes that were not reduced by acclimation to the higher temperature for 7 to 22 days. Critical [O-2] increased by 71% in the cardinalfish and by 23% in the damselfish at 32 degrees C compared to 29 degrees C. The higher oxygen needs are likely to reduce the aerobic scope, which could negatively affect the capacity for feeding, growth and reproduction. The reduced hypoxia tolerance may force the fishes out of their nocturnal shelters in the coral matrix, exposing them to predation. The consequences for population and species survival could be severe unless developmental phenotypic plasticity within generations or genetic adaptation between generations could produce individuals that are more tolerant to a warmer future.

VL  - 6

SP  - 881-891
AB  - Climatic changes are projected to result in rapid adaptive events with considerable phenotypic shifts. In order to reconstruct the impact of increased mean water temperatures during past decades and to reveal possible thermal micro-evolution, we applied a resurrection ecology approach using dormant eggs of the freshwater keystone species Daphnia galeata. To this end, we compared the adaptive response of D. galeata clones from Lake Constance of two different time periods, 1965-1974 ("historical") versus 2000-2009 ("recent"), to experimentally increased temperature regimes. In order to distinguish between genetic versus environmentally induced effects, we performed a common garden experiment in a flow-through system and measured variation in life-history traits. Experimental thermal regimes were chosen according to natural temperature conditions during the reproductive period of D. galeata in Central European lakes, with one additional temperature regime exceeding the currently observable maximum (+2°C). Increased water temperatures were shown to significantly affect measured life-history traits, and significant "temperature × clonal age" interactions were revealed. Compared to historical clones, recent clonal lineages exhibited a shorter time to first reproduction and a higher survival rate, which may suggest temperature-driven micro-evolution over time but does not allow an explicit conclusion on the adaptive nature of such responses. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Species traits and phylogenetic conservatism of climate-induced range shifts in stream fishes
VL  - 5
AB  - Understanding climate-induced range shifts is crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, no general consensus has so far emerged about the mechanisms involved and the role of phylogeny in shaping species responses has been poorly explored. Here, we investigate whether species traits and their underlying phylogenetic constraints explain altitudinal shifts at the trailing and leading edges of stream fish species ranges. We demonstrate that these shifts are related to dissimilar mechanisms: whereas range retractions show some support for phylogenetic clustering due to a high level of conservatism in thermal safety margins, range expansions are underpinned by both evolutionarily conserved and labile traits, notably trophic position and life-history strategy, hence decreasing the strength of phylogenetic signal. Therefore, while climate change brings many difficulties in establishing a general understanding of species vulnerability, these findings emphasize how combining trait-based approaches in light of the species evolutionary history may offer new opportunities in facing conservation challenges. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - A comparative study of the short term cold resistance response in distantly related Drosophila species: The role of regucalcin and Frost
VL  - 6
IS  - 10
AB  - The molecular basis of short term cold resistance (indexed as chill-coma recovery time) has been mostly addressed in D. melanogaster, where candidate genes (Dca (also known as smp-30) and Frost (Fst)) have been identified. Nevertheless, in Drosophila, the ability to tolerate short term exposure to low temperatures evolved several times independently. Therefore, it is unclear whether variation in the same candidate genes is also responsible for short term cold resistance in distantly related Drosophila species. It should be noted that Dca is a candidate gene for cold resistance in the Sophophora subgenus only, since there is no orthologous gene copy in the Drosophila subgenus. Here we show that, in D. americana (Drosophila subgenus), there is a north-south gradient for a variant at the 5′ non-coding region of regucalcin (a Dca-like gene; in D. melanogaster the proteins encoded by the two genes share 71.9% amino acid identities) but in our D. americana F2 association experiment there is no association between this polymorphism and chill-coma recovery times. Moreover, we found no convincing evidence that this gene is up-regulated after cold shock in both D. americana and D. melanogaster. Size variation in the Fst PEST domain (putatively involved in rapid protein degradation) is observed when comparing distantly related Drosophila species, and is associated with short term cold resistance differences in D. americana. Nevertheless, this effect is likely through body size variation. Moreover, we show that, even at two hours after cold shock, when up-regulation of this gene is maximal in D. melanogaster (about 48 fold expression change), in D. americana this gene is only moderately up-regulated (about 3 fold expression change). Our work thus shows that there are important differences regarding the molecular basis of cold resistance in distantly related Drosophila species. © 2011 Reis et al.

TI  - Fathers modify thermal reaction norms for hatching success in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua
VL  - 474
SP  - 148-155
AB  - Climate-driven warming is altering marine ecosystems at an unprecedented rate and evolutionary adaptation may represent the last resort for many ectothermic organisms to avoid local extinction. The first step to elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes experience extremely high rates of mortality during early life stages. Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 degrees C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 12.5 degrees C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as indicated by significant paternity x temperature interactions and crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly significant and explained 56% and 44% of the observed variation in hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation stages (until 100% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming.

TI  - Understanding evolutionary impacts of seasonality: An introduction to the symposium
VL  - 57
IS  - 5
SP  - 921-933
AB  - Seasonality is a critically important aspect of environmental variability, and strongly shapes all aspects of life for organisms living in highly seasonal environments. Seasonality has played a key role in generating biodiversity, and has driven the evolution of extreme physiological adaptations and behaviors such as migration and hibernation. Fluctuating selection pressures on survival and fecundity between summer and winter provide a complex selective landscape, which can be met by a combination of three outcomes of adaptive evolution: genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging. Here, we have identified four important research questions with the goal of advancing our understanding of evolutionary impacts of seasonality. First, we ask how characteristics of environments and species will determine which adaptive response occurs. Relevant characteristics include costs and limits of plasticity, predictability, and reliability of cues, and grain of environmental variation relative to generation time. A second important question is how phenological shifts will amplify or ameliorate selection on physiological hardiness. Shifts in phenology can preserve the thermal niche despite shifts in climate, but may fail to completely conserve the niche or may even expose life stages to conditions that cause mortality. Considering distinct environmental sensitivities of life history stages will be key to refining models that forecast susceptibility to climate change. Third, we must identify critical physiological phenotypes that underlie seasonal adaptation and work toward understanding the genetic architectures of these responses. These architectures are key for predicting evolutionary responses. Pleiotropic genes that regulate multiple responses to changing seasons may facilitate coordination among functionally related traits, or conversely may constrain the expression of optimal phenotypes. Finally, we must advance our understanding of how changes in seasonal fluctuations are impacting ecological interaction networks. We should move beyond simple dyadic interactions, such as predator prey dynamics, and understand how these interactions scale up to affect ecological interaction networks. As global climate change alters many aspects of seasonal variability, including extreme events and changes in mean conditions, organisms must respond appropriately or go extinct. The outcome of adaptation to seasonality will determine responses to climate change. © The Author 2017.

VL  - 25

SP  - 473-484
AB  - Temperature is considered one of the most important mediators of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. However, the costs and benefits shaping the evolution of different thermal responses are poorly elucidated. One of the possible constraints to phenotypic plasticity is its intrinsic genetic cost, such as genetic linkage or pleiotropy. Genetic coupling of the thermal response curves for different life history traits may significantly affect the evolution of thermal sensitivity in thermally fluctuating environments. We used the collembolan Orchesella cincta to study if there is genetic variation in temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity in life history traits, and if the degree of temperature-induced plasticity is correlated across traits. Egg development rate, juvenile growth rate and egg size of 19 inbred isofemale lines were measured at two temperatures. Our results show that temperature was a highly significant factor for all three traits. Egg development rate and juvenile growth rate increased with increasing temperature, while egg size decreased. Line by temperature interaction was significant for all traits tested; indicating that genetic variation for temperature-induced plasticity existed. The degree of plasticity was significantly positively correlated between egg development rate and growth rate, but plasticity in egg size was not correlated to the other two plasticity traits. The findings suggest that the thermal plasticities of egg development rate and growth rate are partly under the control of the same genes or genetic regions. Hence, evolution of the thermal plasticity of traits cannot be understood in isolation of the response of other traits. If traits have similar and additive effects on fitness, genetic coupling between these traits may well facilitate the evolution of optimal phenotypes. However, for this we need to know the selective forces under field conditions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental investigation of a solar desalination prototype using the humidification dehumidification principle at the weather conditions of Calicut City. The prototype is designed and fabricated at the National Institute of Technology, Calicut to conduct the experimental investigation of the dynamic behaviour of the solar desalination unit during summer season (November, December & January) and during a typical day in December was carried out to study the temporal evolutions of the temperature of air and water and the relative humidity at the inlet and the outlet of each component of the system. The results showed excellent behavior of series of parabolic reflectors over flat plate solar collector and enhanced productivity, thermally efficient and simultaneously reaches a maximum temperature of more than 75°C in a short time. The running cost of the system is low as it consumes very small power to run a small air blower and a water pump reducing the final cost per liter of fresh water. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Mating speed and copulation duration respond rapidly to laboratory selection in Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae), but there is a lack of data on the evolutionary response to natural selection in the wild. Further, it is not clear whether body melanization and mating behavior are correlated traits. Accordingly, we tested whether variation in body color impacts on mating latency, copulation duration, and fecundity in latitudinal populations of D. melanogaster. We observed geographical variation (cline) for mating propensity, i.e., mating speed as well as copulation duration increased along latitude. Phenotypic plastic responses for body melanization at 17 and 25°C also showed significant correlations with mating latency and copulation duration. Within-population analysis based on assorted dark and light flies of five geographical populations showed significant positive correlations of copulation duration and fecundity with body melanization. To assess the role of males and/or females on mating speed and copulation duration, we used atypical body color strains (i.e., dark and light males of D. melanogaster) for no-choice mating tests. Our data showed a major influence of males for copulation duration and of females for mating speed. Furthermore, a difference in impact of body melanization on mating speed and copulation duration was demonstrated between species, i.e., low melanization in Drosophila ananassae Doleschall is correlated with lower mating speed and shorter copulation duration than in D. melanogaster. Geographical changes in mating propensity were significantly correlated with body melanization at three levels, i.e., within and between populations and between species. Thus, we have shown that a relationship exists between body melanization and mating success. Further, we found seasonal changes in temperature and humidity to confer selection pressures on mating-related traits. © 2011 The Authors.

VL  - 24
IS  - 7
SP  - 804-813
AB  - The evolutionary speed hypothesis is a mechanistic explanation for the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. The recently extended integrated evolutionary speed hypothesis (IESH) proposes that temperature, water availability, population size and spatial heterogeneity influence the rate of molecular evolution which, in turn, affects diversification. However, the evidence for some of the associations predicted by the IESH is not conclusive, and in some cases is contradictory. Location: The Neotropics. Methods: Using a comparative Bayesian method we tested the following predictions of the IESH: the association between the rate of molecular evolution and temperature (and elevation and latitude, as proxies), water availability (using precipitation and relative humidity as proxies), productivity and rate of diversification. We also accounted for the potential confounding effects of body size and UVB radiation. We tested these predictions separately in mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Results: Substitution rates of mitochondrial and nuclear genes were positively associated with temperature and negatively with elevation, while only the mitochondrial coding gene rate was associated with UVB radiation. However, when controlling for temperature, the association between substitution rate and elevation and UVB radiation disappeared, while a negative association with precipitation emerged. Moreover, diversification events were positively correlated with the rate of molecular evolution but only in mitochondrial genes. Main conclusions: Our results support two key predictions of the IESH. They highlight the important association between rate of molecular evolution and temperature within a recently diverged group and also confirm the positive association between molecular evolution and diversification rate, although only in mitochondrial genes. However, the lack of association between diversification and temperature and the low effect size of the relationship between substitution rates and diversification in mitochondrial genes emphasize the important role other factors, such as time, spatial heterogeneity and population size might have in the origin and maintenance of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Thermoregulation strategies in ants in comparison to other social insects, with a focus on red wood ants (Formica rufa group)
VL  - 2
AB  - Temperature influences every aspect of ant biology, especially metabolic rate, growth and development. Maintenance of high inner nest temperature increases the rate of sexual brood development and thereby increases the colony fitness. Insect societies can achieve better thermoregulation than solitary insects due to the former's ability to build large and elaborated nests and display complex behaviour. In ants and termites the upper part of the nest, the mound, often works as a solar collector and can also have an efficient ventilation system. Two thermoregulatory strategies could be applied. Firstly the ants use an increased thermal gradient available in the mound for brood relocation. Nurse workers move the brood according to the thermal gradients to ensure the ideal conditions for development. A precise perception of temperature and evolution of temperature preferences are needed to make the correct choices. A second thermoregulatory strategy used by mound nesting ants is keeping a high temperature inside large nests. The unique thermal and insulation properties of the nest material help to maintain stable conditions, which is the case of the Wood ant genus Formica. Ants can regulate thermal loss by moving nest aggregation and alternating nest ventilation. Metabolic heat produced by ant workers or associated micro organisms is an important additional source of heat which helps to maintain thermal homeostasis in the nest. © 2014 Kadochová Š and Frouz J.

VL  - 84

SP  - 43-53
AB  - Temperature is a primary determinant of insect and other ectotherm distribution and activity. Physiological and behavioral adaptations allow many insects to survive at subzero temperatures, yet the evolutionary influences on insect cold tolerance are unclear. Supercooling points, basal cold tolerance, coldtolerance strategy, and inducible cold tolerance from rapid coldhardening or acclimation were measured in a phylogenetically independent context in larvae of 27 phylogenetically diverse Drosophila species acquired from stock collections. Supercooling capacity is attributed primarily to physical factors, such as dry mass and water mass. Species of the obscura group were more resistant to acute cold tolerance than species of other groups within the genus, and plasticity in cold tolerance is constrained by phylogeny rather than by basal cold tolerance.The more cold-tolerant freeze-avoiding species appear to have arisen multiple times in Drosophila and are distinct from chillsusceptible species, which likely indicate the ancestral state. A phylogenetic influence is apparent on several measures of cold tolerance, which show considerable interspecific variation and indicate varying physiological mechanisms among Drosophila species when temperature limits are met. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Mountain pine beetle Voltinism and life history characteristics across latitudinal and elevational gradients in the western United States
VL  - 60
IS  - 3
SP  - 434-449
AB  - Substantial genetic variation in development time is known to exist among mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) populations across the western United States. The effect of this variation on geographic patterns in voltinism (generation time) and thermal requirements to produce specific voltinism pathways have not been investigated. The influence of voltinism on fitness traits, body size, and sex ratio is also unclear. We monitored mountain pine beetle voltinism, adult body size, sex ratio, and air temperatures at sites across latitudinal and elevational gradients in the western United States. With the exception of two sites at the coolest and warmest locations, the number of days required to complete a generation was similar. Thermal units required to achieve a generation, however, were significantly less for individuals at the coolest sites. Evolved adaptations explain this pattern, including developmental rates and thresholds that serve to synchronize cohorts and minimize cold-sensitive life stages in winter. These same adaptations reduce the capacity of mountain pine beetle at the warmest sites to take full advantage of increased thermal units, limiting the capacity for bivoltinism within the current realized distribution. Temperature was not correlated with adult size and sex ratio, and size was greatest in host trees other than lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.). Our results provide baseline information for evaluating population responses in a changing climate.

TI  - Simulation and modelling of the influence between main climatic parameters quantities and av erage soil temperature using artificial neural networks
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
SP  - 1119-1129
AB  - This paper proposes the modelling and simulation of monthly average soil temperature evolution considering the nonlinear influence of the following parameters: average air temperature, distance from the sea, height above sea level and average humidity from 2001-2010 period, measured in the following locations: Constanta Medgidia, Gura Portitei and Tulcea, in the south-eastern Romania. The importance of the present research comes from the establishment of an apparent influence of each input parameter over the evolution of average soil temperature and the determination of approximated values of these influences using neural networks as simulation methods. Soil temperature has an agro-meteorological importance whereas it influences plants, especially in the initial phase of vegetation sprouting, springing and matching (for grains). If the soil temperature during these phases is high, the seed growth is faster with the optimum amount of moisture. The soil temperature effects also the nutrient absorption by the plant root, the development of root system, the efficient exploitation of fertilisers in the soil, water circulation in the root system, evapotranspiration, etc. The method uses a feedforward with quick propagation - Levenberg Marquardt training algorithm. Following the data analysis, the training, the testing and validation steps the neural network determined the relative values of influence of climatic parameters over the average monthly soil temperature, considered in the artificial neural network training step. Also, effective artificial neural network training was achieved, according to the error values initially defined.

AB  - The paper by Battaglia and Protopapas (Stat Method Appl 2012) is stimulating. It gives an elegant mathematical generalization of autoregressive models (the nine types). It explains state-of-the-art model fitting techniques (genetic algorithm combined with fitness function and least squares). It is written in a fluent and authoritative manner. Important for having a wider impact: it is accessible to non-statisticians. Finally, it has interesting results on the temperature evolution over the instrumental period (roughly the past 200 years). These merits make this paper an important contribution to applied statistics as well as climatology. As a climate researcher, coming from Physics and having had an affiliation with a statistical institute only as postdoc, I re-analyse here three data series with the aim of providing motivation for model selection and interpreting the results from the climatological perspective. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 87

AB  - Adaptive plasticity may shift phenotypic traits close to a new optimum for directional selection and probably facilitates adaptive evolution in new environments. However, such plasticity has rarely been reported in life-history evolution, despite overwhelming evidence of life-history variation both among and within species. In this study, the temperatures experienced by gravid females of Scincella modesta were manipulated to identify maternally induced plasticity in reproductive traits and the significance of such changes in the evolution of life history. Consistent with the geographic pattern of life history, the study demonstrated that low temperatures delayed egg oviposition, resulting in a more advanced embryonic developmental stage at oviposition and shorter incubation periods compared with warm temperatures. In addition, females maintained at low temperatures produced larger eggs and hence heavier hatchlings than those at warm temperatures. This study demonstrated that environmental temperatures can induce plastic responses in egg retention and offspring size, and these maternally mediated changes in reproductive life history seem to be adaptive in the light of latitudinal clines of these traits in natural populations. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - A selective sweep on a deleterious mutation in CPT1A in Arctic populations
VL  - 95
IS  - 5
SP  - 584-589
AB  - Arctic populations live in an environment characterized by extreme cold and the absence of plant foods for much of the year and are likely to have undergone genetic adaptations to these environmental conditions in the time they have been living there. Genome-wide selection scans based on genotype data from native Siberians have previously highlighted a 3 Mb chromosome 11 region containing 79 protein-coding genes as the strongest candidates for positive selection in Northeast Siberians. However, it was not possible to determine which of the genes might be driving the selection signal. Here, using whole-genome high-coverage sequence data, we identified the most likely causative variant as a nonsynonymous G>A transition (rs80356779; c.1436C>T [p.Pro479Leu] on the reverse strand) in CPT1A, a key regulator of mitochondrial long-chain fatty-acid oxidation. Remarkably, the derived allele is associated with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and high infant mortality yet occurs at high frequency in Canadian and Greenland Inuits and was also found at 68% frequency in our Northeast Siberian sample. We provide evidence of one of the strongest selective sweeps reported in humans; this sweep has driven this variant to high frequency in circum-Arctic populations within the last 6-23 ka despite associated deleterious consequences, possibly as a result of the selective advantage it originally provided to either a high-fat diet or a cold environment. © 2014 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

VL  - 112

AB  - Previous morphological research has shown that the species Neoechinorhynchus salmonis, first described from Canada, is also widespread in the northern Asia, in different climatic zones. Analysis of data from samples collected in various parts of its area of distribution leads to a conclusion about the existing two life forms of this species, namely temperate and polar ones. The specimens of the latter at the adult stage develop at far greater rate and reach maturity being smaller in size. It results in morphological difference: in the temperate form, the maximal body length of males is 7.8 mm; of females - 15.0 mm, while in the polar form corresponding values are 4.5 and 7.8 mm (irrespective of host species). In the temperate form, in the course of maturing and growth of the adult worms, no seasonality was found which means a continuous replenishment of infection in the definitive hosts throughout a year. In the polar form, seasonal behavior of the intermediate hosts, the ostracods Cypria kolymensis, secures a heavy infection of the definitive hosts at the very beginning of the warm period (late June). In late August, the majority of parasites reach maturity and there are solid grounds to believe that adult worms are eliminated during the nearing wintering. In our opinion, the traits of the polar form are an adaptation to severe climatic conditions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

SP  - 4683-4695
AB  - Adaptation to different thermal environments has the potential to cause evolutionary changes that are sufficient to drive ecological speciation. Here, we examine whether climate-based niche divergence in lizards of the Plestiodon skiltonianus species complex is consistent with the outcomes of such a process. Previous work on this group shows that a mechanical sexual barrier has evolved between species that differ mainly in body size and that the barrier may be a by-product of selection for increased body size in lineages that have invaded xeric environments; however, baseline information on niche divergence among members of the group is lacking. We quantified the climatic niche using mechanistic physiological and correlative niche models and then estimated niche differences among species using ordination techniques and tests of niche overlap and equivalency. Our results show that the thermal niches of size-divergent, reproductively isolated morphospecies are significantly differentiated and that precipitation may have been as important as temperature in causing increased shifts in body size in xeric habitats. While these findings alone do not demonstrate thermal adaptation or identify the cause of speciation, their integration with earlier genetic and behavioral studies provides a useful test of phenotype– environment associations that further support the case for ecological speciation in these lizards. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Behavioural plasticity may compensate for climate change in a long-lived reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 152
SP  - 90-95
AB  - How are organisms responding to climate change? The rapidity with which climate is changing suggests that, in species with long generation times, adaptive evolution may be too slow to keep pace with climate change, and that alternative mechanisms, such as behavioural plasticity, may be necessary for population persistence. Species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be particularly threatened by climate change, because altered temperatures could skew sex ratios. We experimentally tested nest-site choice in the long-lived turtle Chrysemys picta to determine whether nesting behaviour can compensate for potential skews in sex ratios caused by rapid climate change. We collected females from five populations across the species' range and housed them in a semi-natural common garden. Under these identical conditions, populations differed in nesting phenology (likely due to nesting frequency), and in nest depth (possibly due to a latitudinal cline in female body size), but did not differ in choice of shade cover over the nest, nest incubation regime, or in resultant nest sex ratios. These results suggest that choice of nest sites with particular shade cover may be a behaviourally plastic mechanism by which turtles can compensate for change in climatic temperatures during embryonic development, provided that sufficient environmental variation in potential nest microhabitat is available.

VL  - 11

AB  - Gigantism - very large body size - is an ecologically important trait associated with competitive superiority. Although it has been studied in particular cases, the general conditions for the evolution and maintenance of gigantism remain obscure. I compiled sizes and dates for the largest species in 3 terrestrial and 7 marine trophic and habitat categories of animals from throughout the Phanerozoic. The largest species (global giants) in all categories are of post-Paleozoic age. Gigantism at this level appeared tens to hundreds of millions of years after mass extinctions and long after the origins of clades in which it evolved. Marine gigantism correlates with high planktic or seafloor productivity, but on land the correspondence between productivity and gigantism is weak at best. All global giants are aerobically active animals, not gentle giants with low metabolic demands. Oxygen concentration in the atmosphere correlates with gigantism in the Paleozoic but not thereafter, likely because of the elaboration of efficient gas-exchange systems in clades containing giants. Although temperature and habitat size are important in the evolution of very large size in some cases, the most important (and rare) enabling circumstance is a highly developed ecological infrastructure in which essential resources are abundant and effectively recycled and reused, permitting activity levels to increase and setting the stage for gigantic animals to evolve. Gigantism as a hallmark of competitive superiority appears to have lost its luster on land after the Mesozoic in favor of alternative means of achieving dominance, especially including social organization and coordinated food-gathering. © 2016 Geerat J.

TI  - Life-history and thermal tolerance traits display different thermal plasticities and relationships with temperature in the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica La Greca and Bacci (Dorvilleidae)
VL  - 438
SP  - 109-117
AB  - In order to gain insights into links between fitness and physiological function, the phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits and thermal tolerances has been investigated in a laboratory strain of the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica acclimated to a broad range of temperatures. Reproductive pairs were kept in isolation for two months at one of six temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), and survival and a number of life-history traits recorded. Tolerance to heat and cold was assessed in individuals that survived the acclimation period by measuring upper and lower thermal limits. Life-history and thermal tolerance traits showed different relationships with temperature: generally non-monotonic for life-history and monotonic for thermal limits. The thermal history of the strain used in the study seemed to be partly responsible for this pattern, affecting the thermal responses of most life-history traits, but not those of the upper and lower thermal limits. Survival correlated positively with tolerance to cold but not with heat tolerance. This result supports the idea that tolerance to heat is under stronger selection in O. labronica, resulting in a lower level of plasticity for this trait. Some life-history features positively co-varied with tolerance to heat (e.g. body size), whilst in other cases reproductive traits showed apparent trade-offs with thermal limits. In all cases correlations amongst traits were apparently driven by their relationship with temperature. Even if we found no evolutionary trade-offs among the thermal responses of life-history traits and thermal limits, the strategies evolved by organisms to cope with thermal variability result from the mutual interaction of these traits, which plays a key role in defining organisms' responses to temperature changes and fluctuations.

VL  - 181

SP  - 885-894
AB  - Oceanic islands are often inhabited by endemic species that have undergone substantial morphological evolutionary change due to processes of multiple colonizations from various source populations, dispersal, and local adaptation. Galápagos marine iguanas are an example of an island endemic exhibiting high morphological diversity, including substantial body size variation among populations and sexes, but the causes and magnitude of this variation are not well understood. We obtained morphological measurements from marine iguanas throughout their distribution range. These data were combined with genetic and local environmental data from each population to investigate the effects of evolutionary history and environmental conditions on body size and shape variation and sexual dimorphism. Our results indicate that body size and shape are highly variable among populations. Sea surface temperature and island perimeter, but not evolutionary history as depicted by phylogeographic patterns in this species, explain variation in body size among populations. Conversely, evolutionary history, but not environmental parameters or island size, was found to influence variation in body shape among populations. Finally, in all populations except one, we found strong sexual dimorphism in body size and shape in which males are larger, with higher heads than females, while females have longer heads than males. Differences among populations suggest that plasticity and/or genetic adaptation may shape body size and shape variation in marine iguanas. This study will help target future investigations to address the contribution of plasticity versus genetic adaptation on size and shape variation in marine iguanas. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

SP  - 165-179
AB  - Insects exchange information by signals transmitted between sender and receiver through air, solids or water. The privacy of multimodal communication is enabled by the various combinations of signal characteristics that are used in different behavioural contexts, at different times and in different ecological conditions. The environment significantly influences the communication processes: signals of different modalities are specifically modified by the transmission properties of the medium, temperature, humidity and by the noise produced by abiotic and biotic factors. Plants represent the natural environment of most insects giving them among other things food, shelter and substrate for reproduction. Despite many advantages, dense vegetation limits the communication distance: high frequency airborne sound is strongly attenuated, local air currents and complex plant architecture decrease the reliability of chemical signals for providing information on the location of the calling mate, visual and contact information exchange is efficient only at close distances. Polyphagous Pentatominae (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) feed exclusively on herbaceous plants and like most other plant-dwelling insects communicate along the plants using the substrate-borne component of their vibratory emissions. In order to increase the communication distance and optimize signal-to-noise ratio, stink bugs emit vibratory signals of low frequency and narrow-band 166characteristics that are best tuned with the transmission properties of plants, and have adapted their sensory system to operate within the group-specific narrow frequency communication window. The aim of the present chapter is to describe the impact of plants and abiotic and biotic factors on the different parameters of vibratory communication signals together with the various adaptations that have evolved in stink bugs in order to optimize information exchange in such conditions © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Selective Pressure Causes an RNA Virus to Trade Reproductive Fitness for Increased Structural and Thermal Stability of a Viral Enzyme
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
AB  - The modulation of fitness by single mutational substitutions during environmental change is the most fundamental consequence of natural selection. The antagonistic tradeoffs of pleiotropic mutations that can be selected under changing environments therefore lie at the foundation of evolutionary biology. However, the molecular basis of fitness tradeoffs is rarely determined in terms of how these pleiotropic mutations affect protein structure. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to study how antagonistic pleiotropy and protein function dictate a fitness tradeoff. We challenged populations of an RNA virus, bacteriophage Φ6, to evolve in a novel temperature environment where heat shock imposed extreme virus mortality. A single amino acid substitution in the viral lysin protein P5 (V207F) favored improved stability, and hence survival of challenged viruses, despite a concomitant tradeoff that decreased viral reproduction. This mutation increased the thermostability of P5. Crystal structures of wild-type, mutant, and ligand-bound P5 reveal the molecular basis of this thermostabilization-the Phe207 side chain fills a hydrophobic cavity that is unoccupied in the wild-type-and identify P5 as a lytic transglycosylase. The mutation did not reduce the enzymatic activity of P5, suggesting that the reproduction tradeoff stems from other factors such as inefficient capsid assembly or disassembly. Our study demonstrates how combining experimental evolution, biochemistry, and structural biology can identify the mechanisms that drive the antagonistic pleiotropic phenotypes of an individual point mutation in the classic evolutionary tug-of-war between survival and reproduction. © 2012 Dessau et al.

AB  - Technologies that enable thermal therapy treatments are now clinically viable and most ongoing hyperthermia clinical trials in oncology incorporate chemotherapy. Given the extensive list of chemotherapies that are enhanced by hyperthermia and the ability of thermosensitive nanomedicines to deliver increased amounts of drug to tumors, while not relying on the EPR effect, there is real opportunity for the clinical translation of thermosensitive nanomedicines. To realize this potential, improved thermosensitive nanomedicines encapsulating a wider range of drugs must be developed and advanced into clinical trials. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Humidity affects genetic architecture of heat resistance in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1180-1188
AB  - Laboratory experiments on Drosophila have often demonstrated increased heritability for morphological and life-history traits under environmental stress. We used parent-offspring comparisons to examine the impact of humidity levels on the heritability of a physiological trait, resistance to heat, measured as knockdown time at constant temperature. Drosophila melanogaster were reared under standard nonstressful conditions and heat-shocked as adults at extreme high or low humidity. Mean knockdown time was decreased in the stressful dry environment, but there was a significant sex-by-treatment interaction: at low humidity, females were more heat resistant than males, whereas at high humidity, the situation was reversed. Phenotypic variability of knockdown time was also lower in the dry environment. The magnitude of genetic correlation between the sexes at high humidity indicated genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in heat resistance. Heritability estimates based on one-parent-offspring regressions tended to be higher under desiccation stress, and this could be explained by decreased environmental variance of heat resistance at low humidity. There was no indication that the additive genetic variance and evolvability of heat resistance differed between the environments. The pattern of heritability estimates suggests that populations of D. melanogaster may have a greater potential for evolving higher thermal tolerance under arid conditions. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal biology of genus Liolaemus: A phylogenetic approach reveals advantages of the genus to survive climate change
VL  - 37

SP  - 579-586
AB  - The trends of body temperatures in the field (T-b) and preferred body temperatures in the laboratory (T-pref) of the genus Liolaemus relative to reproductive mode, air temperature (T-air), precipitation, latitude, and elevation were studied using phylogenetic comparative analysis. Results were discussed in the framework of the evolution of thermal physiology and vulnerability to global climate change. Reproductive mode affects T-b but not T-pref. Whereas T-b and T-pref showed a significant association with T-air, there was no relationship with latitude or elevation. In most liolaemids, T-pref is significantly higher than T-air and T-b pointing to a primitive condition of T-pref, probably related to earlier Miocene environments. Phylogenetic trends in the evolution of liolaemid thermal physiology provide a physiological explanation for the lowest rates of observed contemporary climate-forced extinctions and those forecasted under climate warming scenarios up to 2080. Liolaemids have a much higher T-pref than is expected for their environments, especially for viviparous members of the genus, in contrast to other viviparous taxa in the sister family the Phrynosomatidae, which have evolved much lower T-b (and T-pref) and currently experience a much higher rate of climate-forced extinction.

VL  - 314

SP  - 86-93
AB  - Phenotypic variation is a fundamental component of the process of evolution and understanding the factors that create this variation is critical to investigations of this process. We test the hypothesis that phenotypic variation created under natural incubation conditions will differ from that created under constant laboratory conditions in a reptile species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Using a split clutch design, we demonstrate that offspring morphology, behavior, and sex differed between hatchlings incubated in the field and those from the laboratory, but immune response did not. The interactions between different phenotypic parameters will ultimately determine how natural selection acts upon offspring, and consequently our data suggest that offspring developing under these differing conditions should have different fitnesses. The relationship between offspring sex and phenotype serves as the theoretical foundation on which most investigations into the evolution of TSD are built. Thus, it may be necessary to use natural incubation conditions to accurately examine how offspring sex relates to other phenotypic parameters if we are to understand the evolution of this sex determining mechanism.

AB  - Symbiosis is a fascinating and diverse phenomenon. The study of symbiosis is important to understanding ecology, as it helps us understand relationships between organisms and provides insight into co-evolution, mutualism, adaptation, and survival. Ecological studies are challenging to implement in K-12 classrooms because they often require multiple organisms (often very different in size) and complex environments that are difficult to replicate accurately (e.g., soil composition, temperature, pH, and humidity). These factors can make it difficult to study quantitative changes in ecosystems. We developed an inexpensive, quantitative experiment for classrooms that can be used to explore important aspects of microbial symbiosis, pathogenesis, and ecology, and that helps support more investigations in this area of education. The experiment is low-cost, designed for K-12 teachers and students, uses common materials, and teaches students about the exciting relationships among bacteria, worms, and insects. © 2017 National Association of Biology Teachers.

VL  - 40

AB  - The responses of organisms to temperature variations may be via short term responses of the phenotype (phenotypic plasticity), or they could involve long-term evolutionary change and adaptation (via selection) to the genotype. These could involve changes to the mean size of the animal or to the thermal reaction norm. We examined the effects of various temperatures (of 22, 25, 28, and 31°C) on development time, adult body size and preadult survivorship in three populations of the cockroach, Eupolyphaga sinensis (Walker), collected at different latitudes. We found substantial temperature-induced plasticity in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship, indicating that developmental temperatures have strong impacts on growth and life history traits of E. sinensis. Genetic differences for development time, body size, and preadult survivorship were detected among populations, and the three traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions, indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms. We also found that two populations seem to support the beneficial acclimation hypothesis whereas the third mid-latitude population does not. The results are likely because of differences in season length and voltinism, indicating that not only temperature regime but also its interactions with generation time (and development time), voltinism, and season length are likely to have considerable effects on insect development time and body size. Overall, changes in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship in E. sinensis can all be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Do sex, body size and reproductive condition influence the thermal preferences of a large lizard? A study in Tupinambis merianae
VL  - 53
SP  - 198-204
AB  - Body temperature is a key factor in physiological processes, influencing lizard performances; and life history traits are expected to generate variability of thermal preferences in different individuals. Gender, body size and reproductive condition may impose specific requirements on preferred body temperatures. If these three factors have different physiological functions and thermal requirements, then,the preferred temperature may represent a compromise that optimizes these physiological functions. Therefore, the body temperatures that lizards select in a controlled environment may reflect a temperature that maximizes their physiological needs. The tegu lizard Tupinambis merianae is one of the largest lizards in South America and has wide ontogenetic variation in body size and sexual dimorphism. In the present study we evaluate intraspecific variability of thermal preferences of T. merianae. We determined the selected body temperature and the rate at which males and females attain their selected temperature, in relation to body size and reproductive condition. We also compared the behavior in the thermal gradient between males and females and between reproductive condition of individuals. Our study show that T merianae selected body temperature within a narrow range of temperatures variation in the laboratory thermal gradient, with 36.24 +/- 1.49 degrees C being the preferred temperature. We observed no significant differences between sex, body size and reproductive condition in thermal preferences. Accordingly, we suggest that the evaluated categories of 1: merianae have similar thermal requirements. Males showed higher rates to obtain heat than females and reproductive females, higher rates than non-reproductive ones females. Moreover, males and reproductive females showed a more dynamic behavior in the thermal gradient. Therefore, even though they achieve the same selected temperature, they do it differentially.

TI  - Hsp70 protein levels and thermotolerance in Drosophila subobscura: A reassessment of the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis
VL  - 25
IS  - 4
SP  - 691-700
AB  - Theory predicts that geographic variation in traits and genes associated with climatic adaptation may be initially driven by the correlated evolution of thermal preference and thermal sensitivity. This assumes that an organism's preferred body temperature corresponds with the thermal optimum in which performance is maximized; hence, shifts in thermal preferences affect the subsequent evolution of thermal-related traits. Drosophila subobscura evolved worldwide latitudinal clines in several traits including chromosome inversion frequencies, with some polymorphic inversions being apparently associated with thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Here we show that flies carrying the warm-climate chromosome arrangement O 3+4 have higher basal protein levels of Hsp70 than their cold-climate O st counterparts, but this difference disappears after heat hardening. O 3+4 carriers are also more heat tolerant, although it is difficult to conclude from our results that this is causally linked to their higher basal levels of Hsp70. The observed patterns are consistent with the thermal co-adaptation hypothesis and suggest that the interplay between behaviour and physiology underlies latitudinal and seasonal shifts in inversion frequencies. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Much of the Earth's surface, both marine and terrestrial, is either periodically or permanently cold. Although habitats that are largely or continuously frozen are generally considered to be inhospitable to life, psychrophilic organisms have managed to survive in these environments. This is attributed to their innate adaptive capacity to cope with cold and its associated stresses. Here, we review the various environmental, physiological and molecular adaptations that psychrophilic microorganisms use to thrive under adverse conditions. We also discuss the impact of modern "omic" technologies in developing an improved understanding of these adaptations, highlighting recent work in this growing field. Eighty percent of the Earth's surface is extremely cold. Microorganisms that live in such habitats have evolved various strategies to cope with growth and survival in adverse conditions. These strategies, as well as the approaches used to identify them, are discussed here. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - A Comparison of Inbreeding Depression in Tropical and Widespread Drosophila Species
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - The evolutionary history of widespread and specialized species is likely to cause a different genetic architecture of key ecological traits in the two species groups. This may affect how these two groups respond to inbreeding. Here we investigate inbreeding effects in traits related to performance in 5 widespread and 5 tropical restricted species of Drosophila with the aim of testing whether the two species groups suffered differently from inbreeding depression. The traits investigated were egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and resistance to heat, cold and desiccation. Our results showed that levels of inbreeding depression were species and trait specific and did not differ between the species groups for stress resistance traits. However, for the life history traits developmental time and egg-to adult viability, more inbreeding depression was observed in the tropical species. The results reported suggest that for life history traits tropical species of Drosophila will suffer more from inbreeding depression than widespread species in case of increases in the rate of inbreeding e.g. due to declines in population sizes. © 2013 Bechsgaard et al.

AB  - Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are bacterial regulatory switches that facilitate conflicting outcomes for cells by promoting a pro-survival phenotypic adaptation and/or by directly mediating cell death, all through the toxin activity upon degradation of antitoxin. Intensive study has revealed specific details of TA module functions, but significant gaps remain about the molecular details of activation via antitoxin degradation used by different bacteria and in different environments. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge about the interaction of antitoxins with cellular proteases Lon and ClpP to mediate TA module activation. An understanding of these processes can answer long-standing questions regarding stochastic versus specific activation of TA modules and provide insight into the potential for manipulation of TA modules to alter bacterial growth. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - A cost of being large: Genetically large yellow dung flies lose out in intra-specific food competition
VL  - 25
IS  - 4
SP  - 875-884
AB  - Most life history traits are positively influenced by body size, while disadvantages of large size are poorly documented. To investigate presumed intrinsic costs of large body size in yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae), we allowed larvae from replicate lines artificially selected for small and large body size for 21 generations to compete directly with each other at 20°C (benign) and 25°C (stressful) and low and high food (dung) availability. Greater mortality of large line flies was evident at low food independent of temperature, suggesting a cost of fast growth and/or long development for genetically large flies during larval scramble competition under food limitation. Our results are congruent with a previous study assessing mortality when competing within body size lines, so no additional mechanisms affecting scramble or contest behavior of larvae need be invoked to explain the results obtained beyond the costs of longer development and faster growth. Thus, artificial selection producing larger yellow dung flies than occur in nature revealed some, albeit weak mortality costs of large body size that otherwise might have remained cryptic. We conclude, however, that these costs are insufficient to explain the evolutionary limits of large body size in this species given persistently strong fecundity and sexual selection favoring large size in both sexes. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

AB  - Thermal stress is a pervasive selective agent in natural populations that impacts organismal growth, survival, and reproduction. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a variety of putatively adaptive phenotypic responses to thermal stress in natural and experimental settings; however, accompanying assessments of fitness are typically lacking. Here, we quantify changes in fitness and known thermal tolerance traits in replicated experimental D. melanogaster populations following more than 40 generations of evolution to either cyclic cold or hot temperatures. By evaluating fitness for both evolved populations alongside a reconstituted starting population, we show that the evolved populations were the best adapted within their respective thermal environments. More strikingly, the evolved populations exhibited increased fitness in both environments and improved resistance to both acute heat and cold stress. This unexpected parallel response appeared to be an adaptation to the rapid temperature changes that drove the cycling thermal regimes, as parallel fitness changes were not observed when tested in a constant thermal environment. Our results add to a small, but growing group of studies that demonstrate the importance of fluctuating temperature changes for thermal adaptation and highlight the need for additional work in this area. © 2015 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

VL  - 9

SP  - 1-17
AB  - The endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia pipientis (wMel strain) has been successfully established in several populations of Aedes aegypti, the primary dengue vector. The virulent Wolbachia strain wMelPop is known to cause several pathological impacts (increased egg mortality, life shortening, etc.) reducing overall fitness in the mosquito Ae. aegypti. Increased egg mortality could substantially reduce egg banks in areas with a lengthy monsoonal dry season, and be employed to eliminate local populations. We tested this application under semi-field cage conditions. First, we determined that wMelPop infection significantly reduced the survival of desiccation-resistant eggs of the dengue vector Ae. aegypti, with shade and temperature having a significant impact; nearly all wMelPopinfected eggs failed to hatch after 6 and 10 weeks in summer and winter conditions, respectively. In laboratory selection experiments we found that egg desiccation resistance can be increased by selection, and that this effect of wMelPop infection is due to the nuclear background of the host rather than Wolbachia.We then conducted an invasion of wMelPop within a semi-field cage using sustained weekly releases of wMelPop infected mosquitoes, with fixation achieved after 9 weeks. The egg populations wMelPop infected and an uninfected control were then subjected to a simulated prolonged monsoonal dry season (2.5 months) before flooding to induce hatching. The wMelPop infected eggs suffered significantly greater mortality than the controls, with only 0.67% and 4.35%of respective infected and uninfected eggs held in 99% shade hatching after 80 days. These studies suggest that wMelPop could be used to locally eliminate populations of Ae. aegypti that are exposed to prolonged dry conditions, particularly if combined with vector control. © 2015 Ritchie et al.

AB  - This chapter focuses on evolutionary biology of the globally devastating pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina causing huge losses in many crops worldwide. It has been indicated as an emerging phytopathogen under high temperatures and drought stress. The chapter discusses about pathometry, basic morphological, cultural and physiological aspects of the pathogen. It summarizes various kinds of research activity in the past that were directed towards host range, variation in symptom expression and occurrence and distribution of this pathogen worldwide. Various abiotic factors responsible for the successful pathogenecity of the pathogen. The present discussion revolves around variability in the pathogen with reference to survival, dissemination and evolutionary potential of M. phaseolina that are critical for prevalence of the pathogen in future and predicting its potential threats to crop species. Various aspects of genetic resistance existing in the crop species and its potential for exploitation in managing this dreaded pathogen is also discussed. © 2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

TI  - How extreme temperatures impact organisms and the evolution of their thermal tolerance
VL  - 56
IS  - 1
SP  - 98-109
AB  - Synopsis Understanding the biological impacts of extreme temperatures requires translating meteorological estimates into organismal responses, but that translation is complex. In general, the physiological stress induced by a given thermal extreme should increase with the extreme's magnitude and duration, though acclimation may buffer that stress. However, organisms can differ strikingly in their exposure to and tolerance of a given extreme temperatures. Moreover, their sensitivity to extremes can vary during ontogeny, across seasons, and among species; and that sensitivity and its variation should be subject to selection. We use a simple quantitative genetic model and demonstrate that thermal extremes - even when at low frequency - can substantially influence the evolution of thermal sensitivity, particularly when the extremes cause mortality or persistent physiological injury, or when organisms are unable to use behavior to buffer exposure to extremes. Thermal extremes can drive organisms in temperate and tropical sites to have similar thermal tolerances despite major differences in mean temperatures. Indeed, the model correctly predicts that Australian Drosophila should have shallower latitudinal gradients in thermal tolerance than would be expected based only on gradients in mean conditions. Predicting responses to climate change requires understanding not only how past selection to tolerate thermal extremes has helped establish existing geographic gradients in thermal tolerances, but also how increasing the incidence of thermal extremes will alter geographic gradients in the future. © The Author 2016.

AB  - Low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionization represents an emerging technology in ambient mass spectrometry. LTP enables the solvent-free direct detection of a broad range of molecules and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). The low energy consumption and modest technical requirements of these ion sources favors their employment in mobile applications and as a means to upgrade existing mass analyzers. However, the broad adoption of LTP is hindered by the lack of commercial devices, and constructing personal devices is tricky. Improper setup can result in equipment malfunction or may cause serious damage to instruments due to strong electromagnetic fields or arcing. With this in mind, we developed a reproducible LTP probe, which is designed exclusively from commercial and 3D printed components. The plasma jet generated by the device has a diameter of about 200 μm, which is satisfactory for the ambient imaging of macroscopic samples. We coupled the 3D-LTP probe to an ion trap analyzer and demonstrated the functionality of the ion source by detecting organic and chemical compounds from pure reference standards, biological substances, and pharmaceutical samples. Molecules were primarily detected in their protonated form or as water/ammonium adducts. The identification of compounds was possible by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation spectra. The files necessary to reproduce the 3D parts are available from the project page (http://lababi.bioprocess.org/index.php/3d-ltp) under a dual license model, which permits reproduction of the probe and further community-driven development for noncommercial use ("peer production"). Our reproducible probe design thus contributes to a facilitated adaption and evolution of low-temperature plasma technologies in analytical chemistry. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Predator trait evolution alters prey community composition
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
AB  - Predators have potentially strong effects on prey abundance, growth, life histories, and behavior, but the net direction and strength of these effects depend on traits in the predator population. Trait evolution that occurs on ecological timescales is common and may affect species interactions. Using laboratory microcosms of a bacterivorous ciliate (Colpidium sp.) and a diverse community of bacteria, we tested the hypothesis that predator trait evolution in response to temperature variability and nutrient concentration alters the composition of the prey community using a two-phase experiment. The first phase consisted of a selection experiment, in which microcosm communities were randomly assigned to one of eight fully factorial treatments of high or low nutrients, variable or stable temperatures, and with or without Colpidium. The second phase was a reciprocal transplant experiment, in which a subsample of each microcosm community from the selection experiment was transferred to one of four common garden environments, consisting of all combinations of high or low nutrients and variable or stable temperature. Nutrient enrichment directly decreased bacterial species richness and altered the community composition, but also indirectly increased bacterial species richness through decreases in ciliate peak density and, subsequently, ciliate abundance. Moreover, the evolutionary effects of nutrient enrichment on predator traits were more pronounced in some contemporary common garden environments, and undetectable in others. Our findings suggest that historical and contemporary environments are equally important to consider in understanding how trait evolution affects community structure. © 2017 Holdridge et al.

TI  - Adaptation to fluctuating temperatures in an RNA virus is driven by the most stringent selective pressure
VL  - 9
IS  - 6
AB  - The frequency of change in the selective pressures is one of the main factors driving evolution. It is generally accepted that constant environments select specialist organisms whereas changing environments favour generalists. The particular outcome achieved in either case also depends on the relative strength of the selective pressures and on the fitness costs of mutations across environments. RNA viruses are characterized by their high genetic diversity, which provides fast adaptation to environmental changes and helps them evade most antiviral treatments. Therefore, the study of the adaptive possibilities of RNA viruses is highly relevant for both basic and applied research. In this study we have evolved an RNA virus, the bacteriophage Qβ, under three different temperatures that either were kept constant or alternated periodically. The populations obtained were analyzed at the phenotypic and the genotypic level to characterize the evolutionary process followed by the virus in each case and the amount of convergent genetic changes attained. Finally, we also investigated the influence of the pre-existent genetic diversity on adaptation to high temperature. The main conclusions that arise from our results are: i) under periodically changing temperature conditions, evolution of bacteriophage Qβ is driven by the most stringent selective pressure, ii) there is a high degree of evolutionary convergence between replicated populations and also among populations evolved at different temperatures, iii) there are mutations specific of a particular condition, and iv) adaptation to high temperatures in populations differing in their pre-existent genetic diversity takes place through the selection of a common set of mutations. © 2014 Arribas et al.

VL  - 25

SP  - 230-236
AB  - A challenge for improving disease resistance in fish through genetics is to understand specificity of resistance and whether selection for one pathogen alters the response to unrelated pathogenicmicroorganisms. Adult Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss that had been bred for differential susceptibility to Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) and designated ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-S (susceptible), and ARS-Fp-C (control line), as well as a pool of commercial-stock Rainbow Trout, were intraperitoneally challenged with Weissella sp. NC36. Clinical signs, survival, and innate mechanisms affecting disease resistance were monitored over 9 d. Acute disease signs included exophthalmia associated with retrobulbar inflammation and hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and mild to moderate granulomatous pericarditis. The ARS-Fp-R line did not demonstrate significant survival differences over a 9-d period compared with the ARS-Fp-C and ARS-Fp-S lines (P ≥ 0.09) indicating that during the acute phase of disease, the resistance factors that limit BCWD do not confer cross protection against Weissella sp. NC36. The linear effect of body weight at challenge was statistically significant, as each 10-g increase in body weight increased the hazard of death by 1% (P = 0.02). Bacterial loads on day 3, assessed by splenic and cerebral CFU counts, did not differ between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S trout and there was no correlation between CFU counts and body weight. These findings help elucidate the specificity of disease resistance in selectively bred lines and contribute to our understanding of disease caused by Weissella sp., a recently described pathogen found in cultured Rainbow Trout. © American Fisheries Society 2013.

TI  - The biochemical basis of life history adaptation: Molecular and enzymological causes of NADP +-isocitrate dehydrogenase activity differences between morphs of gryllus firmus that differ in lipid biosynthesis and life history
VL  - 28

SP  - 3381-3393
AB  - Although whole-organism aspects of life-history physiology are well studied and molecular information (e.g., transcript abundance) on life-history variation is accumulating rapidly, much less information is available on the biochemical (enzymological) basis of life-history adaptation. The present study investigated the biochemical and molecular causes of specific activity differences of the lipogenic enzyme, NADP +-isocitrate dehydrogenase, between genetic lines of the wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus, which differ in lipid biosynthesis and life history. With one exception, variation among 21 Nadp +-Idh genomic sequences, which spanned the entire coding sequence of the gene, was restricted to a few synonymous substitutions within and among replicate flight-capable or flightless lines. No NADP +-IDH electromorph variation was observed among individuals within or among lines as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Nor did any NADP +-IDH kinetic or stability parameter, such as KM for substrate or cofactor, kcat, or thermal denaturation, differ between flight-capable and flightless lines. By contrast, line differences in NADP +-IDH-specific activity strongly covaried with transcript abundance and enzyme protein concentration. These results demonstrate that NADP +-IDH-specific activity differences between artificially selected lines of G. firmus are due primarily, if not exclusively, to genetic variation in regulators of NADP +-IDH gene expression, with no observed contribution from altered catalytic efficiency of the enzyme due to changes in amino acid sequence or posttranslational modification. Kinetic analyses indicate that in vitro differences in enzyme-specific activity between flight-capable and flightless lines likely occur in vivo. This study constitutes the most comprehensive analysis to date of the biochemical and molecular causes of naturally occurring genetic variation in enzyme activity that covaries strongly with life history. © 2011 The Author.

VL  - 43

SP  - 151-154
AB  - Primitive melt inclusions in chrome spinel from the Ogasawara Archipelago (Japan) compose two discrete groups of high-SiO2, high-MgO (high-Si) and low-SiO2, low-MgO (low-Si) boninitic suites, with ultra-depleted dish- and V-shaped, and less-depleted flat, rare earth element patterns. The most magnesian melt inclusions of each geochemical type were used to estimate the temperature-pressure conditions for primary boninites, which range from 1345 °C at 0.56 GPa to 1421 °C at 0.85 GPa for the 48-46 Ma low-Si and high-Si boninites, and 1381 °C at 0.85 GPa for the 45 Ma low-Si boninite. The onset of the Pacific slab subduction at 52 Ma forced upwelling of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt mantle (DMM) to yield proto-arc basalt (PAB). With the rise of DMM, refractory harzburgite ascended without melting. At 48-46 Ma, introduction of slab fluids induced melting of the PAB residue and high-temperature harzburgite, resulting in the low-Si and high-Si boninites, respectively. Meanwhile, convection within the mantle wedge brought the less-depleted residue of PAB and DMM into the region fluxed by slab fluids, which melted to yield the less-depleted low-Si boninite at 45 Ma, and fertile arc basalts, respectively. © 2015 Geological Society of America.

TI  - Negative effects of pesticides under global warming can be counteracted by a higher degradation rate and thermal adaptation
VL  - 54
IS  - 6
SP  - 1847-1855
AB  - An alarming finding for biodiversity is that global warming and pesticides often interact synergistically. Yet, this synergism may not capture the full picture because two counteracting processes may reduce the higher impact of pesticides under warming: higher pesticide degradation in the environment and thermal adaptation of populations. We tested for the effects of warming and multiple pulses of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on life history and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. To assess whether thermal adaptation is able to mitigate the impact of the pesticide under future warming, we exposed replicated populations from a colder, high latitude and from a warmer, low latitude in a common garden rearing experiment at 20 and 24 °C (the respective mean summer water temperatures at both latitudes). At the higher temperature pesticide degradation was higher, leading to less accumulation after multiple pulses compared to the lower temperature. Accordingly, the pesticide caused less mortality and less oxidative damage at the higher temperature. This contradicts the general belief (based on studies that kept pesticide concentrations constant) of a higher impact of pesticides under warming. Furthermore, the reduction of the impact of the pesticide at the higher temperature was more pronounced in the warm-adapted low-latitude populations, indicating a counteracting role of thermal adaptation. Policy implications. Our findings provide proof-of-principle for two key insights that will allow improving ecological risk assessment of pesticides under global warming: (i) higher pesticide degradation in the environment under warming may temper the impact of multiple pesticide pulses; (ii) gradual thermal evolution may further reduce the impact of pesticides at high latitudes under global warming. This knowledge can be very important for policy makers to arrive at a more realistic forecasting of the impacts of chemical pollution and climate change interactions on organisms. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Temperature adaptation in Chrysomya megacephala and Chrysomya pinguis, two blow fly species of forensic significance
VL  - 152
IS  - 2
SP  - 100-107
AB  - Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is a common and forensically important blow fly species in the Oriental region. However, in the higher mountain regions and on winter days, its habitats are occupied by a closely related species, Chrysomya pinguis (Walker). The resources that the two species employ to survive are very similar and competition between the species may be one of the factors that trigger differentiation of their behaviors. We conducted experiments to examine how these two closely related species may have adapted to different temperature regimes to avoid competition. Several adult and immature parameters were assessed, such as fecundity, locomotor ability, hatching ratio, larval survivorship, and eclosion ratio. Results indicate that species show specific diapause at high temperature (38 °C), larval survivorship of Ch. megacephala was significantly better than that of Ch. pinguis. Conversely, at low temperature (15 °C), adult locomotor ability was better for Ch. pinguis than for Ch. megacephala. The results indicate that the two species may have evolved different temperature adaptation strategies to avoid competition. In mixed-species larval rearing experiments, competition between Ch. pinguis and Ch. megacephala was observed: at higher temperature (30 °C), the immature performance index of Ch. megacephala was significantly increased when compared to that in single-species culture, whereas the index of Ch. pinguis was decreased. These data are consistent with the idea that tolerance for higher temperature conditions would allow larvae of Ch. megacephala to gain a competitive advantage over Ch. pinguis in certain habitats. These results may help to explain their current distribution in the environment and provide more biological information on these forensically important species. © 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

VL  - 35

SP  - 366-371
AB  - Organisms can respond to variation in temperature through the direct effect of temperature on phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity), or through long-term adaptation to temperature (and thus evolution of either mean size or thermal reaction norm). We examined the effects of various temperatures (of 20 and 30 degrees C) on development time, adult body size (body length and body width) and pre-adult survivorship in six populations of Chrysomya megacephala, collected at different latitudes. We found that temperature changes induced substantial plasticity in terms of development time, body size and pre-adult survivorship. indicating that developmental temperature significantly affects growth and life history traits of C. megacephala. We also detected genetic differences among populations for body size and development time, and these two traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions, indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms. The latitude of origin of the different populations (and hence mean temperature regimes in the environments from where the populations originated) did not appear to fully explain these genetic differences. In short, changes in development time and body size in C. megacephala can be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Body size, swimming speed, or thermal sensitivity? Predator-imposed selection on amphibian larvae
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Many animals rely on their escape performance during predator encounters. Because of its dependence on body size and temperature, escape velocity is fully characterized by three measures, absolute value, size-corrected value, and its response to temperature (thermal sensitivity). The primary target of the selection imposed by predators is poorly understood. We examined predator (dragonfly larva)-imposed selection on prey (newt larvae) body size and characteristics of escape velocity using replicated and controlled predation experiments under seminatural conditions. Specifically, because these species experience a wide range of temperatures throughout their larval phases, we predict that larvae achieving high swimming velocities across temperatures will have a selective advantage over more thermally sensitive individuals. Results: Nonzero selection differentials indicated that predators selected for prey body size and both absolute and size-corrected maximum swimming velocity. Comparison of selection differentials with control confirmed selection only on body size, i.e., dragonfly larvae preferably preyed on small newt larvae. Maximum swimming velocity and its thermal sensitivity showed low group repeatability, which contributed to non-detectable selection on both characteristics of escape performance. Conclusions: In the newt-dragonfly larvae interaction, body size plays a more important role than maximum values and thermal sensitivity of swimming velocity during predator escape. This corroborates the general importance of body size in predator-prey interactions. The absence of an appropriate control in predation experiments may lead to potentially misleading conclusions about the primary target of predator-imposed selection. Insights from predation experiments contribute to our understanding of the link between performance and fitness, and further improve mechanistic models of predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics. © 2015 Gvoždík and Smolinský.

VL  - 21
SP  - 87-100
AB  - Hot stamping process has been increasingly applied for producing automotive parts with ultra-high strength property. Hereby, reduction of car body weight and increasing crashworthiness of new generation vehicles could be simultaneously achieved. In this work, a direct hot stamping of the boron alloy steel was investigated by experiment and FE simulation. Temperature evolutions of blank and dies were gathered during the experiments and verified with FE results. Metallographic analysis, hardness measurement and tensile test were performed for different locations of formed samples. Based on time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagram, local emerged microstructure constituents and corresponding distributed hardness values of the stamped parts were predicted. Additionally, quenching tests under various media were carried out for the examined boron steel. Determined tensile stress-strain curves from each cooling condition were described using Voce hardening equation. Relationships between hardness and Voce model parameters were established. Then, developed constitutive equations were used in combination with the obtained FE results to evaluate local mechanical properties of hot stamped samples. It was found that calculated stress-strain responses for different areas fairly agreed with those from the experiments. © 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers.

VL  - 317

SP  - 185-193
AB  - We studied the variation of thermal parameters of Odontophrynus occidentalis between season (wet and dry) in the Monte desert (Argentina). We measured body temperatures, microhabitat temperatures, and operative temperatures; while in the laboratory, we measured the selected body temperatures. Our results show a change in the thermal parameters of O. occidentalis that is related to environmental constraints of their thermal niche. Environmental thermal constraints are present in both seasons (dry and wet), showing variations in thermal parameters studied. Apparently imposed environmental restrictions, the toads in nature always show body temperatures below the set point. Acclimatization is an advantage for toads because it allows them to bring more frequent body temperatures to the set point. The selected body temperature has seasonal intraindividual variability. These variations can be due to thermo-sensitivity of toads and life histories of individuals that limits their allocation and acquisition of resources. Possibly the range of variation found in selected body temperature is a consequence of the thermal environmental variation along the year. These variations of thermal parameters are commonly found in deserts and thermal bodies of nocturnal ectotherms. The plasticity of selected body temperature allows O. occidentales to have longer periods of activity for foraging and reproduction, while maintaining reasonable high performance at different temperatures. The plasticity in seasonal variation of the thermal parameters has been poorly studied, and is greatly advantageous to desert species during changes in both seasonal and daily temperature, as these environments are known for their high environmental variability.

TI  - Effect of early temperature treatments on sex differentiation in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus lines selected for high and low thermo-sensitivity
VL  - 316
IS  - 1
SP  - 139-142
AB  - The phenotypic sex in Nile tilapia is determined through major and minor genetic factors as well as environmental factors, such as temperature. Temperature treatments at 36 degrees C applied from 10 days post fertilisation for at least 10 days are known to influence the phenotypic sex. Recently a second window of temperature responsiveness was identified. Early rearing temperature (34-36 degrees C) applied from 12-52 h post fertilisation proved to exert an effect on the phenotypic sex in all-female progenies (XX). To study a possible correlation between the effect of early (12-52 h post fertilisation) and late [10-20 days post fertilisation (dpf)] temperature treatments on the phenotypic sex Nile tilapia, the present study investigates the influence of early rearing temperatures using mixed sex (XX/XY) progenies with predefined temperature responsiveness for the period from 10-20 dpf. The brood stock which produced the progenies for this experiment was derived from families of selected lines showing a strong or weak responsiveness of the male proportion towards a temperature treatment of 36 degrees C from 10-20 dpf. Sires and dams were chosen for the present experiment if the sex ratio in temperature treated groups showed male percentages of >90% in the high-line and <60% males, in the low-line. Three progenies obtained from each line were subjected to an early temperature treatment at 34 degrees C, 35 degrees C or 36 degrees C starting at 12 h post fertilisation, whereas the corresponding full sib control groups were kept at 28 C throughout the experiment. The experimental temperatures were reached within 5 h and were applied until hatching (52 +/- 3 h). Temperatures above 34 degrees C led to total mortalities in all progenies tested (n = 12 batches), whereas temperatures of 34 degrees C allowed survival rates that were comparable to those of the controls after nine days, except for progenies from the high-line. Irrespective of the line the progenies belonged to, the sex ratios were not affected by the early temperature treatment starting at 12 h post fertilisation. In conclusion, the temperature responsiveness towards early and late temperature treatments seems not to be correlated and might be dependent on the genotypic sex of the progenies. More studies are needed including information on the temperature responsiveness during both stages (before hatching and during sex differentiation), the genetic sex of the offspring, timing of temperature treatments as well as pedigree information to improve our understanding of early larval temperature treatment effects on the phenotypic sex.

VL  - 155
SP  - 394-400
AB  - Background Exposures to extreme ambient temperature and air pollution are linked to adverse birth outcomes, but the associations with small for gestational age (SGA) and term low birthweight (tLBW) are unclear. We aimed to investigate exposures to site-specific temperature extremes and selected criteria air pollutants in relation to SGA and tLBW. Methods We linked medical records of 220,572 singleton births (2002–2008) from 12 US sites to local temperature estimated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model, and air pollution estimated by modified Community Multiscale Air Quality models. Exposures to hot (>95th percentile) and cold (<5th percentile) were defined using site-specific distributions of daily temperature over three-month preconception, each trimester, and whole-pregnancy. Average concentrations of five criteria air pollutants and six fine particulate matter constituents were also calculated for these pregnancy windows. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations calculated the relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals for SGA (weight <10th percentile conditional on gestational age and sex) and tLBW (≥37 weeks and <2500 g) associated with an interquartile range increment of air pollutants, and cold or hot compared to mild (5–95th percentile) temperature. Models were adjusted for maternal demographics, lifestyle, and clinical factors, season, and site. Results Compared to mild temperature, cold exposure during trimester 2 [RR: 1.21 (1.05–1.38)], trimester 3 [RR: 1.18 (1.03–1.36)], and whole-pregnancy [RR: 2.57 (2.27–2.91)]; and hot exposure during trimester 3 [RR: 1.31 (1.15–1.50)] and whole-pregnancy [RR: 2.49 (2.20–2.83)] increased tLBW risk. No consistent association was observed between temperature and SGA. Air pollutant analyses were generally null but preconception elemental carbon was associated with a 4% increase in SGA while dust particles increased tLBW by 10%. Particulate matter ≤10 µm in the second trimester and whole pregnancy also appeared related to tLBW. Conclusions Our findings suggest prenatal exposures to extreme ambient temperature relative to usual environment may increase tLBW risk. Given concerns related to climate change, these findings merit further investigation. © 2017

In this approach, the results of a computerized wear prediction model are examined through sensitivity analysis and a model validation that utilizes the Monte Carlo (MC) method. Extensive computational results that take into account the uncertainty and variability in the input data are presented to gain insight into the evolution of temperature and wear during the engagement process.

TI  - Thermal history of the H-chondrite parent body: Implications for metamorphic grade and accretionary time-scales
VL  - 119
SP  - 302-321
AB  - Multiple temperature-age constraints for eight H-chondrite samples have been used to provide insight into the thermal history of their parent-body through combination with numerical models of thermal evolution assuming internal heating by Al-26 and conductive cooling. The effect of spreading accretion out over time is the principal focus of this work. A wide range of body size and date of accretion is systematically tested for different values of accretion rate in order to quantify and illustrate the parameter space that is consistent with the available thermo-chronological data. We conclude that the H-chondrite samples considered have a thermal history consistent with a parent body that at some stage had a concentric 'onion-shell' internal structure. That body had a radius no larger than 130 km, and accretion most probably took place over a time interval on the order of 0.0-0.2 Myr, approximately 2 Myr after CAI condensation. In any case, the time interval of accretion is unlikely to have been more than 0.5 Myr supporting evidence in favour of rapid accretion, possibly through reassembly of the fragments of an earlier generation of bodies. Furthermore, the H-chondrites studied here are inferred to have come from a wide depth range within the body where they experienced metamorphism, indicating that preservation of the onion-shell structure is unlikely. The presence of an insulating regolith does not modify this conclusion, as appropriate thermal histories for the three H6 samples considered cannot be reproduced at depths near the surface. Asteroid 6-Hebe may be the parent body of the H-chondrites, but the high bulk density of the latter is difficult to reconcile with a 'rubble-pile' structure of pure H-chondrite material. Finally, optimized thermal histories are used to constrain the temperatures characterizing boundaries between petrological types (800, 1000, and 1140 K for the H3/4, H4/5, and H5/6 boundaries respectively). In detail, the type 6 samples studied here are inferred to have experienced a similar peak temperature (on the order of 1180 K), but spent different times at that temperature, while samples of lower metamorphic grade experienced different peak temperature, but spent more or less the same time within 10 K of peak temperature (on the order of 1 Ma). These results constitute a quantitative framework within which variations in petrographic and textural properties may be interpreted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 36

SP  - 507-514
AB  - The ability of hatchling turtles to detect environmental temperature differences and to effectively select preferred temperature is a function that critically impacts survival. In some turtle species, temperature preference may be influenced by embryonic and post-hatching conditions, such as egg-incubation and acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of embryonic incubation temperature (27.5 degrees C, 30 degrees C) and acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 32 Chrysemys picta bellii (Reptilia: Emydidae) hatchlings in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) control tests. Among 10-11 month old hatchlings, acclimation temperature and egg-incubation temperature influenced temperature selection and movement patterns. Acclimation temperature affected activity and movement: in thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 20 degrees C. Acclimation temperature also affected temperature selection: 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected a specific temperature during gradient tests, but 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles did not. Among 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles, egg-incubation temperature was inversely related to selected temperature: hatchling turtles incubated at 27.5 degrees C selected the warmest temperature available (34 degrees C); individuals incubated at 30 degrees C selected the coldest temperature (14 degrees C). These results suggest that interactions of environmental conditions may influence post-hatching thermo-regulatory behavior in C. picta bellii, a factor that ultimately affects fitness.

AB  - The ability to enter reproductive and larval diapauses should be taken into account when natural populations of the blowfly Calliphora vicina are selected for laboratory rearing. The reproductive diapause occurring at 20-25° in some females retards their maturation and decreases the reproductive activity of the laboratory strain. On the other hand, diapausing females conditioned by low temperature may be used for temporary conservation of the strain. However, keeping the diapausing larvae is the most reliable way of storage. The endogenous variation of the incidence of larval (from 0 to 100%) and reproductive (from 0 to 55%) diapauses was observed in successive generations of several laboratory strains developing under constant photoperiodic and temperature conditions. The significance of such endogenous processes for interpretation of experimental data is discussed. For over 20 years of laboratory breeding of C. vicina, cases of strain depression were observed, when the number of the egg rafts decreased and then oviposition ceased, abnormal puparia appeared, the flies hardly emerged, etc. Such depressed strains may be revived by changing the photoperiodic regime. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

AB  - Parasite intensity dynamics can be strongly affected by ecosystem abiotic components. We conducted this study to investigate how the intensity of Argulus sp. is influenced by physicochemical factors in three water bodies - river, fish farm, and reservoir - and to find the occurrence of Argulus sp. under different conditions. Argulus sp. specimens were collected using different methods - gill-netting 30∈×∈1.5 m, 40 mm mesh monofilament net and set from a small boat, beach seining and plankton net - from July 2010 until Jun 2011 at Guangdong province, China. Main water parameters taken for the assessment consisting of temperature, pH, DO, biochemical oxygen demand of 5 days (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH 4 +, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The results show that the ratio of female to male Argulus sp. during the studied period was 2.3:1. The presence and intensity of Argulus sp. were temperature-dependent and variable; pH values were lower than standers with high intensity of Argulus sp. Argulus sp. has the ability to live in low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. Relatively high concentrations of BOD5, COD, NH 4 +, TN and TP were detected with related variable intensity of Argulus sp., which is supposed to be a freshwater fish ectoparasite found in polluted ecosystems. It is concluded that the fish ectoparasite Argulus sp. have a strong potency of genetic adaptation impacted by environmental factors. However, this needs further study in order to gain insight into the question of the likelihood of adaptation to abiotic factors' variation. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

However, seasonal variations exhibit large scale geographical divergences caused by a whole suite of factors such as solar radiation, ocean currents, extent of continents, and topography. Realizing these contributions in driving patterns of overall seasonality may help advance our understanding of the kinds of evolutionary adaptations we should expect at a global scale. Here, we introduce a new concept and provide the data describing the overall degree of seasonality, based on its two major components—amplitude and predictability. Using global terrestrial datasets on temperature, precipitation and primary productivity, we show that these important seasonal factors exhibit strong differences in their spatial patterns with notable asymmetries between the southern and the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that seasonality is highly diverse across latitudes as well as longitudinal gradients. This indicates that using a direct measure of seasonality and its components, amplitude and predictability, may yield a better understanding of how organisms are adapted to seasonal environments and provide support for predictions on the consequences of rapid environmental change. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Genetic variations in tibetan populations and high-altitude adaptation at the Himalayas
VL  - 28

AB  - Modern humans have occupied almost all possible environments globally since exiting Africa about 100,000 years ago. Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at >3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations. © 2010 The Author.

TI  - Low temperature and low salinity drive putatively adaptive growth differences in populations of threespine stickleback
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Colonisation can expose organisms to novel combinations of abiotic and biotic factors and drive adaptive divergence. Yet, studies investigating the interactive effects of multiple abiotic factors on the evolution of physiological traits remain rare. Here we examine the effects of low salinity, low temperature, and their interaction on the growth of three North American populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In northerate freshwater habitats, stickleback populations experience a combination of low salinity and low winter temperatures that are not experienced by the ancestral marine and anadromous populations. Here we show that both salinity and temperature, and their interaction, have stronger negative effects on marine and anadromous populations than a freshwater population. Freshwater stickleback showed only a ~20% reduction in specific growth rate when exposed to 4 °C, while marine and anadromous stickleback showed sharp declines (82% and 74% respectively) under these conditions. The modest decreases in growth in freshwater stickleback in fresh water in the cold strongly suggest that this population has the capacity for physiological compensation to offset the negative thermodynamic effects of low temperature on growth. These results are suggestive of adaptive evolution in response to the interactive effects of low salinity and low temperature during freshwater colonisation. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Smolting is a hormone-driven developmental process that is adaptive for downstream migration and ocean survival and growth in anadromous salmonids. Smolting includes increased salinity tolerance, increased metabolism, downstream migratory and schooling behavior, silvering and darkened fin margins, and olfactory imprinting. These changes are promoted by growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor I, cortisol, thyroid hormones, whereas prolactin is inhibitory. Photoperiod and temperature are critical environmental cues for smolt development, and their relative importance will be critical in determining responses to future climate change. Most of our knowledge of the environmental control and endocrine mediation of smolting is based on laboratory and hatchery studies, yet there is emerging information on fish in the wild that indicates substantial differences. Such differences may arise from differences in environmental stimuli in artificial rearing environments, and may be critical to ocean survival and population sustainability. Endocrine disruptors, acidification and other contaminants can perturb smolt development, resulting in poor survival after seawater entry. © 2010.

TI  - Temperature dependent sex ratios in selected lines and crosses with a YY-male in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)
VL  - 318
IS  - 1
SP  - 79-84
AB  - Sex determination in Nile tilapia is very labile. It was shown that the sex ratio in temperature treated groups (36 degrees C.10 days) of Oreochromis niloticus can be selected for as a quantitative trait. The standardized test procedure involved the artificial reproduction of breeders with nine days of egg incubation at 28 degrees C and subsequent testing of fry at an elevated temperature of 36 degrees C for 10 days. Family selection was carried out upon the male percentages in treatment groups (high-line>80%, low-line<60%). Selected candidates were taken from corresponding full sib control groups, which were kept at 28 degrees C. After two generations of divergent selection for the male proportion in temperature treated groups, male percentages of 90% and 54% were obtained in the high- and low-line, respectively. Herein, the data for a third generation of selection are presented. Twelve families in the high-line and 20 in the low-line were tested. Average male percentages in the treatment groups of 92.7% and 50.4% were obtained. After three generations of selection the cumulated realized heritabilities for the temperature dependent sex ratio were 0.63 in the high- and 0.84 in the low-line, still indicating good potential for selection. Two families in the high-line exhibited only males, whereas in the low-line two families showed a feminising effect in the treatment groups. Generally elevated temperatures (>34 degrees C) are considered to be masculinising in Nile tilapia, feminising effects so far have only been reported in genetic all-male progenies (YY, XY). In the third generation of selection, it could be shown that elevated temperatures might take over a feminising role through selection in genetically mixed sex (XX/XY) progenies. Consequently both, temperature-masculinising and -feminising genes, exist in the same population and can be accumulated through selection. However, the load of temperature-masculinising genes of dams from the high- or low-line had no effect on mean sex ratios in temperature treated groups when a YY-male was used as a sire. From an evolutionary point of view, the prevalence of both temperature-masculinising and -feminising effects might allow the sex ratio to equilibrate at the population level if random mating occurs. This in turn might counteract the evolution of sex chromosomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Strong geographical variation in wing aspect ratio of a damselfly, Calopteryx maculata (Odonata: Zygoptera)
VL  - 2015
IS  - 8
AB  - Geographical patterns in body size have been described across a wide range of species, leading to the development of a series of fundamental biological rules. However, shape variables are less well-described despite having substantial consequences for organism performance. Wing aspect ratio (AR) has been proposed as a key shape parameter that determines function in flying animals, with high AR corresponding to longer, thinner wings that promote high manoeuvrability, low speed flight, and low AR corresponding to shorter, broader wings that promote high efficiency long distance flight. From this principle it might be predicted that populations living in cooler areas would exhibit low AR wings to compensate for reduced muscle efficiency at lower temperatures. I test this hypothesis using the riverine damselfly, Calopteryx maculata, sampled from 34 sites across its range margin in North America. Nine hundred and seven male specimens were captured from across the 34 sites (mean = 26.7 ± 2.9 SE per site), dissected and measured to quantify the area and length of all four wings. Geometric morphometrics were employed to investigate geographical variation in wing shape. The majority of variation in wing shape involved changes in wing aspect ratio, confirmed independently by geometric morphometrics and wing measurements. There was a strong negative relationship between wing aspect ratio and the maximum temperature of the warmest month which varies fromwest-east inNorth America, creating a positive relationship with longitude. This pattern suggests that higher aspect ratio may be associated with areas in which greater flight efficiency is required: regions of lower temperatures during the flight season. I discussmy findings in light of research of the functional ecology of wing shape across vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. © 2015 Hassall.

TI  - Response to selection for bacterial cold water disease resistance in rainbow trout
VL  - 88

SP  - 1936-1946
AB  - A family-based selection program was initiated at the National Center for Cool and Cold Wa-ter Aquaculture in 2005 to improve resistance to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) in rainbow trout. The objective of this study was to estimate response to 2 generations of selection. A total of 14,841 juvenile fish (BW = 3.1 g; SD = 1.1 g) from 230 full-sib families and 3 randomly mated control lines were challenged intraperitoneally with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the bacterium that causes BCWD, and mortalities were observed for 21 d. Selection was applied to family EBV derived from a proportional hazards frailty (animal) model while constraining rate of inbreeding to ≤1% per generation. After adjusting for nongenetic effects, survival rate of select-line families increased by 24.6 ± 6.8 and 44.7 ± 6.7 (cumulative) percentage points after 1 and 2 generations of selection, respectively (P < 0.01). Genetic trend, estimated from a linear animal model that fit genetic group effects, was 19.0 ± 4.1 percentage points per generation and approached significance (P = 0.07). Heritability estimates from the proportionalhazards frailty model and linear animal model were similar (0.22 and 0.23, respectively), and family EBV from both models were highly correlated (-0.92). Accuracy of selection, estimated as the correlation between mid-parent EBV and progeny survival rate, was 0.20 (P < 0.01) for the proportional-hazards frailty model and 0.18 (P = 0.01) for the linear animal model. Accuracy estimates were not different (P = 0.81) between the models. This study demonstrates that selective breeding can be effective for improving resistance to experimental BCWD challenge in rainbow trout. ©2010 American Society of Animal Science.

TI  - Transcriptome responses to heat and cold-stress in ladybirds (Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulasnt) analyzed by deep-sequencing
VL  - 48
AB  - Background: Changed temperature not only threaten agricultural production, but they also affect individual biological behavior, population and community of many insects, and consequently reduce the stability of our ecosystem. Insect’s ability to respond to temperature stress evolved through a complex adaptive process, thus resulting in varied temperature tolerance among different insects. Both high and low extreme temperatures are detrimental to insect development since they constitute an important abiotic stress capable of inducing abnormal biological responses. Many studies on heat or cold tolerance of ladybirds have focused on measurements of physiological and biochemical indexes such as supercooling point, higher/lower lethal temperatures, survival rate, dry body weight, water content, and developmental duration. And studies of the molecular mechanisms of ladybird responses to heat or cold stress have focused on single genes, such as those encoding heat shock proteins, but has not been analyzed by transcriptome profiling. Results: In this study, we report the use of Digital Gene Expression (DGE) tag profiling to gain insight into transcriptional events associated with heat- and cold-stress in C. montrouzieri. About 6 million tags (49 bp in length) were sequenced in a heat stress group, a cold stress group and a negative control group. We obtained 687 and 573 genes that showed significantly altered expression levels following heat and cold shock treatments, respectively. Analysis of the global gene expression pattern suggested that 42 enzyme-encoding genes mapped to many Gene Ontology terms are associated with insect’s response to heat- and cold-stress. Conclusions: These results provide a global assessment of genes and molecular mechanisms involved in heat and cold tolerance. © 2015 Zhang et al.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, a small estuarine animal, has emerged as a powerful model system for field and laboratory studies of development, evolution, genomics, molecular biology and toxicology. Here we describe how to collect Nematostella, culture it through its entire sexual life cycle and induce regeneration for the production of clonal stocks. In less than 1 h at a suitable field site, a researcher on foot can collect hundreds of individual anemones. In a few months, it is possible to establish a laboratory colony that will be reliable in generating hundreds or thousands of fertilized eggs on a roughly weekly schedule. By inducing regeneration roughly every 2 weeks, in less than 6 months, one can establish a clonal stock consisting of hundreds of genetically identical anemones. These results can be achieved very inexpensively and without specialized equipment. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biocomplexity in populations of european anchovy in the adriatic sea
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
AB  - The sustained exploitation of marine populations requires an understanding of a species' adaptive seascape so that populations can track environmental changes from short- and long-term climate cycles and from human development. The analysis of the distributions of genetic markers among populations, together with correlates of life-history and environmental variability, can provide insights into the extent of adaptive variation. Here, we examined genetic variability among populations of mature European anchovies (n = 531) in the Adriatic (13 samples) and Tyrrhenian seas (2 samples) with neutral and putative non-neutral microsatellite loci. These genetic markers failed to confirm the occurrence of two anchovy species in the Adriatic Sea, as previously postulated. However, we found fine-scale population structure in the Adriatic, especially in northern areas, that was associated with four of the 13 environmental variables tested. Geographic gradients in sea temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen appear to drive adaptive differences in spawning time and early larval development among populations. Resolving adaptive seascapes in Adriatic anchovies provides a means to understand mechanisms underpinning local adaptation and a basis for optimizing exploitation strategies for sustainable harvests. © 2016 Ruggeri et al.

TI  - Isomer residual ratio of odd-odd isotope Ta-180 in supernova nucleosynthsis
VL  - 1238
SP  - 222-224
AB  - The nucleosynthesis of 180Ta has remained an unsolved problem and as its origin many nucleosynthesis mechanisms have been proposed. This isotope has the unique feature that the naturally occurring abundance of 180Ta is actually a meta-stable isomer (half-life of ≥ 10 15 yr), while the ground state is a 1+ unstable state which β -decays with a half-life of only 8.15 hr. We have made a new time-dependent calculation of 180Ta meta-stable isomer residual ratio after supernova neutrino-induced reactions. This residual isomer ratio is crucial for understanding the production and survival of this naturally occurring rare isotope. We have constructed a new model under temperature evolution after type II supernova explosion. We include the explicit linking between the isomer and all known excited states and found that the residual ratio is insensitive to astrophysical parameters such as neutrino energy spectrum, explosion energy, decay time constant. We find that the explicit time evolution of the synthesis of 180Ta avoids the overproduction relative to 138La for a neutrino process neutrino temperature of 4 MeV. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

TI  - Interactions among thermal parameters determine offspring sex under temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 278
IS  - 1703
SP  - 256-265
AB  - In many animals, temperatures experienced by developing embryos determine offspring sex (e.g. temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD), but most studies focus strictly on the effects of mean temperature, with little emphasis on the importance of thermal fluctuations. In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios. © 2010 The Royal Society.

TI  - Analysis of Vanadium-Bearing Titanomagnetite Sintering Process by Dissection of Sintering Bed
VL  - 18

SP  - 8-15+36
AB  - Many problems appear in the sintering process of vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite, such as high energy consumption and low productivity; sinter quality is also very poor for its low tumble strength and high reduction degradation. Sinter productivity and quality are dominated by bed permeability and mineralogy structure, which are highly influenced by the thermal state of sintering bed, so the sintering process of titanomagnetite is researched by bed dissection in this work. Temperature evolution curves of sinter materials were measured, and the results show that melting duration, peak temperature duration and sintering temperature of different layers differ greatly from each other; flame front speed and vertical sintering speed of bed lower region are much smaller than those of bed upper region. Simultaneously, sinter samples were collected from different layers, and their mineralogy characteristics are analyzed; sinters from bed lower region have poor mineralogy structure, and the amounts of perovskite and dicalcium silicate increase intensively, which are bad for sinter strength and reduction degradation property. Measures are proposed to improve the quality and productivity of titanomagnetite sinter. © 2011 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

VL  - 311
SP  - 231
AB  - Under anaerobic conditions, plants apply a wide spectrum of precise adaptive strategies responding to several critical challenges. The ability of efficiently sensing the oxygen presence demonstrates the existence of both direct and indirect ways of perception. The subsequent coordinate metabolic reassessment is currently under study. The complex molecular response implicates not only transcriptional and translational regulation of specific genes but also posttranscriptional and posttranslational regulatory mechanisms, each and all integrating the metabolic settings. Furthermore, the accumulation of typical metabolites during low oxygen stress condition is a key factor that suggests some critical topics in the regulation of metabolic pathways. Here, we summarize the main routes for adaptive behavior during oxygen depletion, from oxygen availability perception to recently discovered molecular mechanisms and metabolic adaptations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Unanticipated discovery of two rare gastropod molluscs from recently located hydrothermally influenced areas in the Okinawa Trough
VL  - 2017
IS  - 12
AB  - Background. The deep-sea hydrothermal vent is one of the most 'extreme' environments in the marine realm. Few species are capable of inhabiting such ecosystems, despite extremely high productivity there supported by microbial chemosynthesis, leading to high biomass and low species richness. Although gastropod molluscs are one of the main constituents of megafaunal communities at vent ecosystems, most species belong to several typical families (e.g., Provannidae, Peltospiridae, Lepetodrilidae) specialised and adapted to life at vents. Methods. During recent surveys of Okinawa Trough hydrothermal vent systems, two snails atypical of vent ecosystems were unexpectedly found in newly discovered hydrothermally influenced areas. Shell and radular characteristics were used to identify the gastropods morphologically. Results. One species was a vetigastropod, the calliostomatid Tristichotrochus ikukoae (Sakurai, 1994); and the other was a caenogastropod, the muricid Abyssotrophon soyoae (Okutani, 1959). Both gastropods were previously only known from regular nonchemosynthetic deep-sea and very rare-only two definitive published records exist for T. ikukoae and three for A. soyoae. The radula formula of Tristichotrochus ikukoae is accurately reported for the first time and based on that it is returned to genus Otukaia. For both species, barcode sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were obtained and deposited for future references. Discussion. These new records represent the second record of calliostomatids from vents (third from chemosynthetic ecosystems) and the third record of muricids from vents (tenth from chemosynthetic ecosystems), and extend the distribution of both species to the southwest. Neither family has been recorded at chemosynthetic ecosystems in the western Pacific. Both were from weakly diffuse flow areas not subject to high temperature venting but were nevertheless associated with typical vent-reliant taxa such as Lamellibrachia tubeworms and Bathymodiolus mussels. These new records show that these species are capable of tolerating environmental stress associated with weak hydrothermally influenced areas, despite not being vent endemic species, adding to the list of known vent/non-vent species intersections. This signifies that such weakly influenced areas may provide key habitats for them, and that such areas may play a role in the evolution of biological adaptations to 'extreme' chemosynthetic ecosystems. © 2017 Chen et al.

TI  - Survival, growth, and morphology of blue king crabs: Effect of ocean acidification decreases with exposure time
VL  - 74
IS  - 4
SP  - 1033-1041
AB  - Ocean acidification is an altering marine carbonate chemistry resulting in potential effects to marine life. In this study, we determine the effects of decreased pH on the morphology, growth, and survival of juvenile blue king crab, Paralithodes platypus. Crabs were reared at three pH levels: ambient (control, pH ∼8.1), pH 7.8, and pH 7.5, for 1 year and monitored for morphological changes, survival, and growth. Exposure to seawater at pH 7.8 had no effect on morphology or mortality and had only a minor effect on growth compared with the ambient treatment. However, exposure to seawater at pH 7.5 substantially increased mortality and decreased growth compared with the ambient treatment. The best fit model of mortality rate at pH 7.5 showed an initially high mortality rate, which dropped to become comparable to the mortality rate in the other treatments. This suggests phenotypic variability or plasticity in juveniles and may indicate acclimation by blue king crab to ocean acidification. As such, blue king crab may have scope for evolutionary adaptation in response to gradually changing pH levels. However, effects on other life-history stages, sub-lethal effects, carryover or transgenerational effects, and interactions with other stressors, such as increased temperature, still need to be investigated. © 2017 Oxford University Press .

AB  - Despite the recognition that some species might quickly adapt to new conditions under climate change, demonstrating and predicting such a fundamental response is challenging. Morphological variations in response to climate may be caused by evolutionary changes or phenotypic plasticity, or both, but teasing apart these processes is difficult. Here, we built on the number of thoracic vertebrae (NTV) in ectothermic vertebrates, a known genetically based feature, to establish a link with body size and evaluate how climate change might affect the future morphological response of this group of species. First, we show that in old-world salamanders, NTV variation is strongly related to changes in body size. Secondly, using 22 salamander species as a case study, we found support for relationships between the spatial variation in selected bioclimatic variables and NTV for most of species. For 44% of species, precipitation and aridity were the predominant drivers of geographical variation of the NTV. Temperature features were dominant for 31% of species, while for 19% temperature and precipitation played a comparable role. This two-step analysis demonstrates that ectothermic vertebrates may evolve in response to climate change by modifying the number of thoracic vertebrae. These findings allow to develop scenarios for potential morphological evolution under future climate change and to identify areas and species in which the most marked evolutionary responses are expected. Resistance to climate change estimated from species distribution models was positively related to present-day species morphological response, suggesting that the ability of morphological evolution may play a role for species' persistence under climate change. The possibility that present-day capacity for local adaptation might help the resistance response to climate change can be integrated into analyses of the impact of global changes and should also be considered when planning management actions favouring species persistence. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Microbial symbioses, in which microbes have either positive (mutualistic) or negative (parasitic) impacts on host fitness, are integral to all aspects of biology, from ecology to human health. In many well-studied cases, microbial symbiosis is characterized by a specialized association between a host and a specific microbe that provides it with one or more beneficial functions, such as novel metabolic pathways or defense against pathogens. Even in relatively simple associations, symbiont-derived benefits can be context dependent and influenced by other host-associated or environmental microbes. Furthermore, naturally occurring symbioses are typically complex, in which multiple symbionts exhibit coordinated, competing, or independent influences on host physiology, or in which individual symbionts affect multiple interacting hosts. Here we describe research on the mechanisms and consequences of multipartite symbioses, including consortia in which multiple organisms interact with the host and one another, and on conditional mutualists whose impact on the host depends on additional interacting organisms. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Potential impacts of genetically modified (GM) animals in natural environments are explored in a framework of regulatory evolution. Transgenic growth hormone animals express remarkable alterations and plasticity in development, physiology and behavior in response to environmental factors (nutrition, temperature, photoperiod), suggesting that standard laboratory assessments are likely to underestimate their evolutionary potential. Sexual selection is examined in the context of female self-referent appraisal of male fitness that reflects performance in the species-specific niche. Wild-type females may recognize and discriminate against GM males (the Transparent Genome Hypothesis) but if accepted as mates, pleiotropic disruption associated with GMs may reduce fitness of the natural population (the Trojan Gene Hypothesis). Alternatively, facilitation of regulatory evolution by sexual reproduction (recombination and segregation) may derive modifier selection, masking, integration, or niche shifts. Other aspects explored include mutation theory, purging, pleiotropy, epigenetics and plasticity, behavior and the Bruce effect, and mismatch of genetic or epigenetic background between GM stock and natural populations. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Swimming is a physical activity performed in an environment where human beings are not adapted from an evolutionary point of view. For this reason, swimming for humans is considered an ontogenetic movement and not a phylogenetic one such as walking or running on land. Locomotion into the water has some very specific characteristics for the human being, since the body experiences a situation of hydrostatic microgravity which in most cases enables flotation. Flotation capacity is affected by the physicochemical properties of the water (temperature and osmolarity) and by the body characteristics of the immersed person. In this situation: (1) joints no longer experience the load implied by supporting body weight on land, (2) blood flows more easily, and (3) the type of muscular work is basically concentric. Body balance is other important aspects to take into account, especially in swimmers with amputated limbs or limbs paralysis. Finally, the thermoregulatory response of the human body to changes in water temperature is also considered a useful and extended recovery method. © JPES.

VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 177-183
AB  - Phenotypic traits of hatchling reptiles are strongly influenced by incubation regimes (e.g. of temperature and moisture), suggesting that maternal choice of suitable nest-sites should be under intense selection. Our laboratory incubation of 209 eggs (17 clutches) from wild-caught Swedish grass snakes (Natrix natrix) showed that scale abnormalities (half-scales on one side of the body, often reflecting lateral asymmetry in the number of ribs) occurred more frequently if eggs were incubated under cooler conditions. Especially at low incubation temperatures, individuals with scale asymmetries took longer to hatch than did symmetric conspecifics, were smaller in body length at hatching and were slower in trials of locomotor speed. Anti-predator tactics also covaried with scale asymmetry. These patterns suggest that individuals with asymmetric scales should have lower fitness and hence should rarely survive to adulthood in the wild. We tested this prediction by examining 201 field-collected snakes from museum collections. As predicted, scale asymmetries were seen primarily in small snakes, and rarely in larger animals. We interpret these data to suggest that scale asymmetries in this species offer an index of developmental instability and that fitness disadvantages to disrupted embryogenesis impose selection against suboptimal nest-site choice by females. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal optimality of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide and underlying mechanisms
VL  - 194

SP  - 775-783
AB  - It is well established that individual organisms can acclimate and adapt to temperature to optimize their functioning. However, thermal optimization of ecosystems, as an assemblage of organisms, has not been examined at broad spatial and temporal scales. Here, we compiled data from 169 globally distributed sites of eddy covariance and quantified the temperature response functions of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), an ecosystem-level property, to determine whether NEE shows thermal optimality and to explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that the temperature response of NEE followed a peak curve, with the optimum temperature (corresponding to the maximum magnitude of NEE) being positively correlated with annual mean temperature over years and across sites. Shifts of the optimum temperature of NEE were mostly a result of temperature acclimation of gross primary productivity (upward shift of optimum temperature) rather than changes in the temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration. Ecosystem-level thermal optimality is a newly revealed ecosystem property, presumably reflecting associated evolutionary adaptation of organisms within ecosystems, and has the potential to significantly regulate ecosystem-climate change feedbacks. The thermal optimality of NEE has implications for understanding fundamental properties of ecosystems in changing environments and benchmarking global models. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - In this chapter we argue that reproductive science in its broadest sense has never been more important in terms of its value to conservation biology, which itself is a synthetic and multidisciplinary topic. Over recent years the place of reproductive science in wildlife conservation has developed massively across a wide and integrated range of cutting edge topics. We now have unprecedented insight into the way that environmental change affects basic reproductive functions such as ovulation, sperm production, pregnancy and embryo development through previously unsuspected influences such as epigenetic modulation of the genome. Environmental change in its broadest sense alters the quality of foodstuffs that all animals need for reproductive success, changes the synchrony between breeding seasons and reproductive events, perturbs gonadal and embryo development through the presence of pollutants in the environment and drives species to adapt their behaviour and phenotype. In this book we explore many aspects of reproductive science and present wide ranging and up to date accounts of the scientific and technological advances that are currently enabling reproductive science to support conservation biology. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Production ratio of meta-stable isomer in Ta-180 by neutrino-induced reactions
VL  - 1235
SP  - 242-246
AB  - The nucleosynthesis of 180Ta has remained an unsolved problem and as its origin many nucleosynthesis mechanisms have been proposed. This isotope has the unique feature that the naturally occurring abundance of 180Ta is actually a meta-stable isomer (half-life of ≥ 10 15 yr), while the ground state is a 1+ unstable state which β-decays with a half-life of only 8.15 hr. We have made a new time-dependent calculation of 180Ta meta-stable isomer residual ratio after supernova neutrino-induced reactions. This isomer residual ratio is crucial for understanding the production and survival of this naturally occurring rare isotope. We have constructed a new model under temperature evolution after type II supernova explosion. We include the explicit linking between the isomer and all known excited states and found that the residual ratio is insensitive to astrophysical parameters such as neutrino energy spectrum, explosion energy, decay time constant. We find that the explicit time evolution of the synthesis of 180Ta avoids the overproduction relative to 138La for a neutrino process neutrino temperature of 4 MeV. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

VL  - 24

AB  - Physiological and evolutionary responses underlying thermal adaptation and acclimation are often investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Such studies may fail to assess ecologically relevant parameters as they do not account for the complexity of the natural environment. 2. We investigated a population of Drosophila melanogaster for performance at low temperature conditions in the field using release recapture assays and in the laboratory using standard cold resistance assays. The aim of the study was to get a better understanding of the nature and underlying mechanisms of the trait measured in field recapture studies and the association between field performance and fitness measures estimated in the laboratory. 3. We performed one generation of selection on the ability to reach a resource at low temperature under field conditions. Flies that reached a resource ('mobile') and those that never left the release site ('stationary') were reared to the F1 and F2 generation in the laboratory. Subsequent field releases with these flies demonstrated a clear genetic differentiation between mobile and stationary flies in their ability to reach resources at low temperatures in the field. This indicates that mobility at low temperature is under additive genetic influence. In contrast mobile and stationary flies were generally indistinguishable when tested in standard laboratory tests of cold performance. The genetic differentiation between the two sub-populations was not linked to allelic variation in known candidate genes for cold adaptation. However, using transcriptomics we identified new candidate genes (transcripts) and pathways that differed between the mobile and stationary flies. 4. The current study reveals an irregular relationship between cold performance in the field and in the laboratory. Based on these results, we suggest that the ecological relevance of laboratory assays should be evaluated more critically in studies of thermal adaptation and hardening/acclimation. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Screening of technological and probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Algerian traditional fermented milk products
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
SP  - 2451-2457
AB  - A total of 208 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from Algerian traditional fermented milk (Jben, Klila, Raib and Lben), in order to evaluate their technological and probiotic properties. These strains were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes using agar well diffusion technique. Only 11 strains were retained, they were also characterised in respect to their technological properties. The retained strains were identified by analyses of the 16S rDNA gene as; Lb. curvatus (1 strain), Ln. mesenteroides subsp mesenteroides (1 strain), Lb. plantarum (3 strains), Lb. brevis (2 strain), Lactobacillus acidophilus (2 strains), and Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis (2 strains). All the antimicrobial compounds produced by the selected lactic acid bacteria were fully or partially inactivated by the proteolytic enzymes. The compounds were heat stable up to 100°C for 20 min, and were active from pH 3.0 to 10.0. The enzymatic potential of the strains evaluated with API ZYM system show that all strains exhibited high leucine, cystine aminopeptidase and β-Galactosidase activities. Lactococcus strains were those that showed the greatest degree of proteolytic activity, however very low lipolytic and amylolytic capacity was detected for same strains. Two out of the 11 selected strains showed moderate survival rates under simulated gastric, however all tested strains showed a high stability under intestinal conditions. According to the results, the selected LAB strains could be used as potential probiotics to a possible inhibition of food-borne pathogenic bacteria and also would be of considerable interest to use as starter culture. © All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 68

SP  - 2184-2196
AB  - Intralocus sexual conflict (IaSC) occurs when selection at a given locus favors different alleles in males and females, placing a fundamental constraint on adaptation. However, the relative impact of IaSC on adaptation may become reduced in stressful environments that expose conditionally deleterious mutations to selection. The genetic correlation for fitness between males and females (rMF) provides a quantification of IaSC across the genome. We compared IaSC at a benign (29°C) and a stressful (36°C) temperature by estimating rMFs in two natural populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus using isofemale lines. In one population, we found substantial IaSC under benign conditions signified by a negative rMF (-0.51) and, as predicted, a significant reduction of IaSC under stress signified by a reversed and positive rMF (0.21). The other population displayed low IaSC at both temperatures (rMF: 0.38; 0.40). In both populations, isofemale lines harboring alleles beneficial to males but detrimental to females at benign conditions tended to show overall low fitness under stress. These results offer support for low IaSC under stress and suggest that environmentally sensitive and conditionally deleterious alleles that are sexually selected in males mediate changes in IaSC. We discuss implications for adaptive evolution in sexually reproducing populations. © 2014 The Author(s). Evolution © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Shifts in phenology and distribution in response to both recent and paleontological climate changes vary markedly in both direction and extent among species. These individualistic shifts are inconsistent with common forecasting techniques based on environmental rather than biological niches. What biological details could enhance forecasts? Organismal characteristics such as thermal and hydric limits, seasonal timing and duration of the life cycle, ecological breadth and dispersal capacity, and fitness and evolutionary potential are expected to Influence climate change impacts. We review statistical and mechanistic approaches for incorporating traits in predictive models as well as the potential to use phylogeny as a proxy for traits. Traits generally account for a significant but modest fraction of the variation in phenological and range shifts. Further assembly of phenotypic and phylogenetic data coupled with the development of mechanistic approaches is essential to improved forecasts of the ecological consequences of climate change. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

SP  - 133-146
AB  - One of the most pressing questions in coral reef biology today is “Will reef-building corals survive climate change?” Critical to this question is the rate at which climate change is progressing and whether that rate will be matched or exceeded by the ability of corals to acclimatize and adapt in their upper stress tolerance limits. The emerging field of genomics (i.e., genome scale genetics) holds great promise for investigation of the raw material needed for coral acclimatization and adaptation to climate change: variation in the gene sequences and activity of the molecular response pathways enabling corals and Symbiodinium to maintain key biological functions under environmental stress. A growing number of studies of gene expression signatures and gene frequency distributions are finding a diverse array of potential targets both for acclimatization potential and adaptive natural selection in climate change resistance. Additionally, research is consistently finding greater acclimatization and adaptive potential than previously thought, which when incorporated into models of coral survival in the future significantly improves the short-term outlook for reef persistence. Much remains to be determined about the extent of relevant phenotypic diversity in coral thermal tolerance and resistance to ocean acidification as well as the relative contributions of the coral host, Symbiodinium, and associated microbes to increased stress resistance. However, application of these new technologies to the question of coral climate change survival provides new evidence that evolutionary accumulation of adaptive diversity and phenotypic plasticity may give corals increased potential for persistence in the Anthropocene. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

AB  - In this work, tunnelling junction sensors (TJS) are proposed for monitoring the curing of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP). Tunnelling junction sensors are very sensitive to temperature changes; therefore they are suitable for this application. TJS are manufactured by Low-Pressure Chemical Vapour Deposition (LPCVD) and electronically characterized to obtain their V(I) diagram. One sensor is embedded on a carbon-epoxy plate for measuring temperature evolution during composite's autoclave cycle. By means of a temperature-voltage-time curve, the evolution of sensor's signal related to temperature changes can be tracked. The main goals are to verify the viability to apply this technology to composite's curing process and to provide a first approach of the initial state of the composite plate by verifying the temperatures at each curing stage. Both purposes were achieved and help to better understand the composite polymerization process, which has a strong influence on the composite's mechanical performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 26

SP  - 2254-2266
AB  - Preserving intraspecific genetic diversity is essential for long-term forest sustainability in a climate change scenario. Despite that, genetic information is largely neglected in conservation planning, and how conservation units should be defined is still heatedly debated. Here, we use maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), an outcrossing long-lived tree with a highly fragmented distribution in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, to prove the importance of accounting for genetic variation, of both neutral molecular markers and quantitative traits, to define useful conservation units. Six gene pools associated to distinct evolutionary histories were identified within the species using 12 microsatellites and 266 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, height and survival standing variation, their genetic control, and plasticity were assessed in a multisite clonal common garden experiment (16 544 trees). We found high levels of quantitative genetic differentiation within previously defined neutral gene pools. Subsequent cluster analysis and post hoc trait distribution comparisons allowed us to define 10 genetically homogeneous population groups with high evolutionary potential. They constitute the minimum number of units to be represented in a maritime pine dynamic conservation program. Our results uphold that the identification of conservation units below the species level should account for key neutral and adaptive components of genetic diversity, especially in species with strong population structure and complex evolutionary histories. The environmental zonation approach currently used by the pan-European genetic conservation strategy for forest trees would be largely improved by gradually integrating molecular and quantitative trait information, as data become available. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Genetic variation in winter barley and selection of high yielding lines
VL  - 49
IS  - 6
SP  - 481-488
AB  - Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important crop with excellent nutritious feed and food grain. Winter barley, in particular, is predominantly grown in highland under rainfed systems due to its ability to tolerate cold. However, it has low productivity due to complex genetic mechanisms and limitations in determining an optimal environment for its selection and evaluation. This study evaluated the genetic variability, heritability and genetic gain for yield in barley, using preliminary un-replicated yield trials in 2011 at two locations and followed by replicated sets of yield trials in 2012, all in Syria. Significant genotypic variability was found at both stages of the evaluation/selection. During 2011, the best linear unbiased predictor means of test genotypes adjusted for spatial variability were found in the range of 1.75-3.75 t/ha at Tel Hadya and 0.03-1.58 t/ha at Breda. A set of 22 advanced yield trials comprising a total of 601 lines at Tel Hadya in 2012 yielded in the range of 1.85- 3.13 t/ha. Based on the mean over these set of trials, the highest heritable trait was days to heading (broad-sense heritability on mean-basis= 0.64) followed by yield (the heritability = 0.30). The yield gain due to selection, at 20% intensity of selection, was 5.66% at Tel Hadya and 27.1% at Breda in 2011 using un-replicated genetic material, while it was 7.01 % for the replicated trials at Tel Hadya in 2012. We recommend use of the best lines selected in 2012 at Tel Hadya for further exploitation in genotype × environment interaction studies for high yield and specific and broad adaptation.

TI  - Multiple adaptations to polar and alpine environments within cyanobacteria: A phylogenomic and Bayesian approach
VL  - 6
AB  - Cyanobacteria are major primary producers in the polar and alpine regions contributing significantly to nitrogen and carbon cycles in the cryosphere. Recent advancements in environmental sequencing techniques have revealed great molecular diversity of microorganisms in cold environments. However, there are no comprehensive phylogenetic analyses including the entire known diversity of cyanobacteria from these extreme environments. We present here a global phylogenetic analysis of cyanobacteria including an extensive dataset comprised of available small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene sequences of cyanobacteria from polar and high altitude environments. Furthermore, we used a large-scale multi-gene (135 proteins and 2 ribosomal RNAs) genome constraint including 57 cyanobacterial genomes. Our analyses produced the first phylogeny of cold cyanobacteria exhibiting robust deep branching relationships implementing a phylogenomic approach. We recovered several clades common to Arctic, Antarctic and alpine sites suggesting that the traits necessary for survival in the cold have been acquired by a range of different mechanisms in all major cyanobacteria lineages. Bayesian ancestral state reconstruction revealed that 20 clades each have common ancestors with high probabilities of being capable of surviving in cold environments. © 2015 Chrismas, Anesio and Sánchez-Baracaldo.

TI  - Escherichia coli populations in unpredictably fluctuating environments evolve to face novel stresses through enhanced efflux activity
VL  - 28
IS  - 5
SP  - 1131-1143
AB  - There is considerable understanding about how laboratory populations respond to predictable (constant or deteriorating environment) selection for single environmental variables such as temperature or pH. However, such insights may not apply when selection environments comprise multiple variables that fluctuate unpredictably, as is common in nature. To address this issue, we grew replicate laboratory populations of Escherichia coli in nutrient broth whose pH and concentrations of salt (NaCl) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were randomly changed daily. After ~170 generations, the fitness of the selected populations had not increased in any of the three selection environments. However, these selected populations had significantly greater fitness in four novel environments which have no known fitness-correlation with tolerance to pH, NaCl or H2O2. Interestingly, contrary to expectations, hypermutators did not evolve. Instead, the selected populations evolved an increased ability for energy-dependent efflux activity that might enable them to throw out toxins, including antibiotics, from the cell at a faster rate. This provides an alternate mechanism for how evolvability can evolve in bacteria and potentially lead to broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance, even in the absence of prior antibiotic exposure. Given that environmental variability is increasing in nature, this might have serious consequences for public health. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Climate variability slows evolutionary responses of Colias butterflies to recent climate change
VL  - 282
IS  - 1802
AB  - How does recent climatewarming and climate variability alter fitness, phenotypic selection and evolution in natural populations?We combine biophysical, demographic and evolutionary models with recent climate data to address this question for the subalpine and alpine butterfly, Colias meadii, in the southern Rocky Mountains. We focus on predicting patterns of selection and evolution for a key thermoregulatory trait, melanin (solar absorptivity) on the posterior ventral hindwings, which affects patterns of body temperature, flight activity, adult and egg survival, and reproductive success in Colias. Both mean annual summer temperatures and thermal variability within summers have increased during the past 60 years at subalpine and alpine sites. At the subalpine site, predicted directional selection on wing absorptivity has shifted from generally positive (favouring increased wing melanin) to generally negative during the past 60 years, but there is substantial variation among years in the predicted magnitude and direction of selection and the optimal absorptivity. The predicted magnitude of directional selection at the alpine site declined during the past 60 years and varies substantially among years, but selection has generally been positive at this site. Predicted evolutionary responses to mean climate warming at the subalpine site since 1980 is small, because of the variability in selection and asymmetry of the fitness function. At both sites, the predicted effects of adaptive evolution on mean population fitness are much smaller than the fluctuations in mean fitness due to climate variability among years. Our analyses suggest that variation in climate within and among years may strongly limit evolutionary responses of ectotherms to mean climate warming in these habitats. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Are latitudinal clines in body size adaptive?
VL  - 119
IS  - 9
SP  - 1387-1390
AB  - Body size of animals often increases with increasing latitude. These latitudinal clines in body size have interested biologists for over 150 years. However, the mechanisms that generate these clines in size are still unclear, though latitudinal gradients in temperature appear to play an important role. More importantly, many studies that examine latitudinal clines in body size and the mechanisms responsible for these clines use phenotypic data, confounding genetic (adaptive) and non-genetic (plasticity) sources of variation. Yet, most of these studies make adaptive conclusions based on phenotypic measures of size. Here I show the dangers of making adaptive inferences from phenotypic measures of size. In addition, I use a specific form of plasticity in body size of ectotherms, called the temperature-size rule, to illustrate how confusion about genetic and non-genetic contributions to phenotypic variation has hampered progress in understanding the evolution of latitudinal clines in size. Field-based measurements of body size can no doubt be influenced by plasticity, but demonstrating that latitudinal clines have a genetic basis is necessary to show that these patterns are adaptive. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptive capacity of the habitat modifying sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to ocean warming and ocean acidification: Performance of early embryos
VL  - 7
IS  - 8
AB  - Background: Predicting effects of rapid climate change on populations depends on measuring the effects of climate stressors on performance, and potential for adaptation. Adaptation to stressful climatic conditions requires heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance present in populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: We quantified genetic variation in tolerance of early development of the ecologically important sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii to near-future (2100) ocean conditions projected for the southeast Australian global change hot spot. Multiple dam-sire crosses were used to quantify the interactive effects of warming (+2-4°C) and acidification (-0.3-0.5 pH units) across twenty-seven family lines. Acidification, but not temperature, decreased the percentage of cleavage stage embryos. In contrast, temperature, but not acidification decreased the percentage of gastrulation. Cleavage success in response to both stressors was strongly affected by sire identity. Sire and dam identity significantly affected gastrulation and both interacted with temperature to determine developmental success. Positive genetic correlations for gastrulation indicated that genotypes that did well at lower pH also did well in higher temperatures. Conclusions/Significance: Significant genotype (sire) by environment interactions for both stressors at gastrulation indicated the presence of heritable variation in thermal tolerance and the ability of embryos to respond to changing environments. The significant influence of dam may be due to maternal provisioning (maternal genotype or environment) and/or offspring genotype. It appears that early development in this ecologically important sea urchin is not constrained in adapting to the multiple stressors of ocean warming and acidification. The presence of tolerant genotypes indicates the potential to adapt to concurrent warming and acidification, contributing to the resilience of C. rodgersii in a changing ocean. © 2012 Foo et al.

TI  - Evolution of marginal populations of an invasive vine increases the likelihood of future spread
VL  - 209
IS  - 4
SP  - 1773-1780
AB  - The prediction of invasion patterns may require an understanding of intraspecific differentiation in invasive species and its interaction with climate change. We compare Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) plants from the core (100-150 yr old) and northern margin (< 65 yr old) of their North American invaded range to determine whether evolution during invasion increases the probability of future expansion. Plants from populations in the core and margin were compared in two sites beyond the northern range edge to assess their potential to invade novel areas. Data were compared with previous work to assess the effect of latitudinal climate on L. japonica spread. Winter survival in current climates was modeled and projected for future climates to predict future spread. Margin plants were larger and had 60% greater survival than core plants at sites beyond the northern range edge. Overall, winter survival decreased with increasing latitude and decreasing temperature, and was greater in margin plants than core plants. Models suggested that greater winter tolerance in margin populations has increased L. japonica's northward spread by 76 km, and that this survival advantage will persist under future climates. These results demonstrate that evolution during invasion may increase spread beyond predictions using increasing global temperatures alone. © 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

AB  - The large diversity of marine microorganisms harboured by oceans plays an important role in planet sustainability by driving globally important biogeochemical cycles; all primary and most secondary production in the oceans is performed by microorganisms. The largest part of the planet is covered by cold environments; consequently, cold-adapted microorganisms have crucial functional roles in globally important environmental processes and biogeochemical cycles cold-adapted extremophiles are a remarkable model to shed light on the molecular basis of survival at low temperature. The indigenous populations of Antarctic and Arctic microorganisms are endowed with genetic and physiological traits that allow them to live and effectively compete at the temperatures prevailing in polar regions. Some genes, e.g. glycosyltransferases and glycosylsynthetases involved in the architecture of the cell wall, may have been acquired/retained during evolution of polar strains or lost in tropical strains. This present work focusses on temperature and its role in shaping microbial adaptations; however, in assessing the impacts of climate changes on microbial diversity and biogeochemical cycles in polar oceans, it should not be forgotten that physiological studies need to include the interaction of temperature with other abiotic and biotic factors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Adaptive mechanisms of freeze avoidance in plants: A brief update
VL  - 99
SP  - 133-140
AB  - Freeze avoidance has evolved in plants in response to selection pressures brought about by exposure to freezing temperatures. It is a multifaceted adaptive mechanism with many attributes. Despite the prevalence of freeze avoidance as an adaptive mechanism, little research has been devoted in recent times to understanding the underlying mechanisms and regulation of freeze avoidance. Therefore, there is no shortage of questions that need to be addressed. Inherent in understanding how plants respond to freezing temperatures is the need to also understand the properties of water at different temperatures and how the interaction of water with biological substances affects these properties. This review provides an overview of the subject of biological ice nucleation and propagation and how various aspects of plant structure and composition can affect the freezing process. Deep supercooling of plant tissues represents the most extreme example of freeze avoidance. The potential role of anti-nucleating substances in defining the ability to deep supercool is also discussed. The importance of studying intact plants in their natural environments is emphasized. Although, this adds a high degree of complexity to investigations, it is in this context that adaptive mechanisms have evolved and play a role in the biology and survival of plants. © 2013.

TI  - Magma chamber stability in arc and continental crust
VL  - 190
IS  - 3
SP  - 249-270
AB  - The growth and thermo-mechanical stability of magma chambers in Earth's crust dictate the dynamics of volcanism at the surface, and the organization of volcanic plumbing at depth. We analyze a model of magma chamber evolution in which volumetric growth is governed by the mechanical focusing of rising dikes by the magma chamber, "magmatic lensing," as well as melting and assimilation of country rock. This modeling framework emphasizes the two-way coupling between chamber stresses and thermal evolution with specific compositions of intruding magma and country rock. We consider as end member compositional scenarios a "wet" environment magma chamber, in which basalt with 2 wt.% H2O intrudes an amphibolitic country rock, and a "dry" chamber consisting of anhydrous basalt intruding tonalitic country rocks. Magma chambers that erupt, freeze, or reach dynamic equilibrium in the crust occupy distinct regions of a parameter space that measures the relative importance of depth, chamber pressurization, Wall rock viscoelastic rheology, and thermal viability. Lower crustal melt flux is the most important factor controlling chamber stability, but chamber depth and composition also help determine long-term dynamical behavior. In general, interactions between thermal and mechanical processes exert first-order control on chamber stability, defining four distinct regimes of magma chamber dynamics. In addition to thermally and mechanically unstable (freezing and eruptive) chambers, we find steady-state thermally viable chamber volumes are possible as well as a range of parameters for which chamber growth is roughly exponential in time and mechanically stable (no eruption occurs). Long-lived (>1 Ma) chambers generally result from lower crustal melt flux values that range from similar to 10(-4) to similar to 10(-1) m(3)/m(2)/yr for 20 and 40 km deep chambers and both compositional end members used in this study. However chambers become considerably less stable in cool shallow environments, particularly with anhydrous compositions of magma and country rock. Model predictions in this framework suggest that a range of observed intrusive structures in Earth's crust may be the result of magma chambers in different, clearly defined dynamical regimes.

TI  - Adaptation of the spiders to the environment: The case of some Chilean species
VL  - 6
AB  - Spiders are small arthropods that have colonized terrestrial environments. These impose three main problems: (i) terrestrial habitats have large fluctuations in temperature and humidity; (ii) the internal concentration of water is higher than the external environment in spiders, which exposes them continually to water loss; and (iii) their small body size determines a large surface/volume ratio, affecting energy exchange and influencing the life strategy. In this review we focus on body design, energetic, thermal selection, and water balance characteristics of some spider species present in Chile and correlate our results with ecological and behavioral information. Preferred temperatures and critical temperatures of Chilean spiders vary among species and individuals and may be adjusted by phenotypic plasticity. For example in the mygalomorph high-altitude spider Paraphysa parvula the preferred temperature is similar to that of the lowland spider Grammostola rosea; but while P. parvula shows phenotypic plasticity, G. rosea does not. The araneomorph spiders Loxosceles laeta and Scytodes globula have greater daily variations in preferred temperatures at twilight and during the night, which are set to the nocturnal activity rhythms of these species. They also present acclimation of the minimum critical temperatures. Dysdera crocata has a low preferred temperature adjusted to its favorite prey, the woodlouse. Spider metabolic rate is low compared to other arthropods, which may be associated with its sit and wait predatory strategy particularly in primitive hunter and weavers. In mygalomorph spiders the respiratory system is highly optimized with high oxygen conductance, for example G. rosea needs only a difference of 0.12-0.16 kPa in the oxygen partial pressure across the air-hemolymph barrier to satisfy its resting oxygen consumption demands. Water loss is a significant stress for spiders. Paraphysa parvula shows an evaporative water loss 10 times more than usual when the temperature approaches 40°C and the participation of book lungs in this loss is about 60%. This species and others show seasonal changes in water loss accounted for by changes in cuticle permeability. The case of Chilean spiders shows how the ecophysiology in spiders is associated to their design and body size and how is affected by fluctuating Mediterranean environments, suggesting that the adaptive process can be seen as a route of optimizing the use of energy to cope with environmental restrictions imposed by the interaction with the terrestrial environment and lifestyle. © 2015 Canals, Veloso and Solís.

TI  - Adaptation of bacillus subtilis cells to archean-like uv climate: Relevant hints of microbial evolution to remarkably increased radiation resistance
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
SP  - 605-615
AB  - In a precursory study for the space experiment ADAPT ("Molecular adaptation strategies of microorganisms to different space and planetary UV climate conditions"), cells of Bacillus subtilis 168 were continuously cultured for 700 generations under periodic polychromatic UV irradiation (200-400 nm) to model the suggested UV radiation environment on early Earth at the origin of the first microbial ecosystem during the Archean eon when Earth lacked a significant ozone layer. Populations that evolved under UV stress were about 3-fold more resistant than the ancestral and non-UV-evolved populations. UV-evolved cells were 7-fold more resistant to ionizing radiation than their non-UV-exposed evolved relatives and ancestor. In addition to the acquired increased UV resistance, further changes in microbial stress response to hydrogen peroxide, increased salinity, and desiccation were observed in UV-evolved cells. This indicates that UV-sensitive ancestral cells are capable of adapting to periodically applied UV stress via the evolution of cells with an increased UV resistance level and further enhanced responses to other environmental stressors, which thereby allows them to survive and reproduce under extreme UV radiation as a selection pressure. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2010.

AB  - Microbial consortia may harbour an array of resistance mechanisms that facilitate survival under harsh conditions, including antifreeze and ice-nucleation proteins. Antifreeze proteins lower freezing points as well as inhibit the growth of large, potentially damaging ice crystals from small ice embryos. In contrast, ice-nucleation proteins prevent supercooling and allow ice formation at high, sub-zero temperatures. Psychrophiles and psychrotolerant microbes are typically sought in extremely cold environments. However, given that geography is unlikely to present an insurmountable barrier to microbial dispersal, we reasoned that species with low-temperature adaptations should also be present, although rare, in more temperate environments. In consequence, the challenge then becomes one of selecting for rare microbes present in a larger community. Following the introductory commentary, we demonstrate that both freeze-thaw survival and ice-affinity selection can be used to identify microbes, which demonstrate low-temperature resistance, from enrichments derived from temperate environments. Selection resulted in a drastic decrease in cell abundance and diversity, allowing the isolation of a subset of resistant microbes. Depending on the origin of the consortia, these resistant microbes demonstrated cross-tolerance to osmotic stress, or a high proportion of antifreeze and/or ice-nucleation protein activities. Both types of ice-associating proteins presumably facilitate microbial survival at low temperatures. These proteins, as well as molecules that maintain osmotic balance, are also of commercial interest, with applications in the food, energy and medical industries. In addition, the resistant phenotypes described here provide a glimpse into the breadth of strategies microbes use to survive and thrive at low temperatures. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Climate change is a key driver of the accelerating environmental change affecting populations around the world. Many of these changes and our response to them can affect respiratory health. This is an expert opinion review of recent peer-reviewed literature, focused on more recent medical journals and climate-health relevant modeling results from non-biomedical journals pertaining to climate interactions with air pollution. Global health impacts in low resource countries and migration precipitated by environmental change are addressed. The major findings are of respiratory health effects related to heat, air pollution, shifts in infectious diseases and allergens, flooding, water, food security and migration. The review concludes with knowledge gaps and research need that will support the evidence-base required to address the challenges ahead. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

TI  - Reproductive success is strongly related to local and regional climate in the Arctic snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis)
VL  - 38

SP  - 393-400
AB  - Global climate change is regarded as one of the major threats to biodiversity. Both local and regional climate parameters can have strong effects on ecological processes affecting the survival and reproduction of plants and animals. High Arctic ecosystems are characterized by low species diversity and the local species have often evolved specific adaptations to the harsh Arctic environment. Here, we investigate the effect of local and regional climate parameters on snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) reproductive success in the Arctic using a long-term dataset of 15 years. We found strong relationships between both local weather and the Arctic oscillation (AO), a regional climate index, with several breeding parameters. Onset of breeding was earlier in years with high spring temperatures and later in years with high AO index the preceding winter. Importantly, high AO winter index also increased the number of successful fledglings the following summer, possibly mediated via spring phenology. Nestling weight was negatively associated with the AO index during the breeding season. The strong effects of local and regional climate suggest that the ongoing global climate change could potentially have a large effect on this Arctic passerine population. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Environmental control of phase transition and polyp survival of a massive-outbreaker jellyfish
VL  - 5
IS  - 11
AB  - A number of causes have been proposed to account for the occurrence of gelatinous zooplankton (both jellyfish and ctenophore) blooms. Jellyfish species have a complex life history involving a benthic asexual phase (polyp) and a pelagic sexual phase (medusa). Strong environmental control of jellyfish life cycles is suspected, but not fully understood. This study presents a comprehensive analysis on the physicochemical conditions that control the survival and phase transition of Cotylorhiza tuberculata; a scyphozoan that generates large outbreaks in the Mediterranean Sea. Laboratory experiments indicated that the influence of temperature on strobilation and polyp survival was the critical factor controlling the capacity of this species to proliferate. Early life stages were less sensitive to other factors such as salinity variations or the competitive advantage provided by zooxanthellae in a context of coastal eutrophication. Coherently with laboratory results, the presence/absence of outbreaks of this jellyfish in a particular year seems to be driven by temperature. This is the first time the environmental forcing of the mechanism driving the life cycle of a jellyfish has been disentangled via laboratory experimentation. Projecting this understanding to a field population under climatological variability results in a pattern coherent with in situ records. © 2010 Prieto et al.

TI  - Genetic improvement of host-seeking ability in the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora toward the Red Palm Weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus
VL  - 100
SP  - 29-36
AB  - Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (red palm weevil) is highly susceptible to infection by the entomopathogenic nematodes Steinernema carpocapsae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora. However, to reach and penetrate the insect in its habitat with good efficacy, the nematode infective juveniles (IJs) need to move through the tunnels bored by the feeding insect larvae in the tree trunk. We used a genetic-improvement approach to enhance host-seeking ability (HSA) of these nematode species' IJs. The IJs were allowed to move through a 45-cm L-shaped tube toward red palm weevil larvae. The IJs which reached within 5 cm of the insect larvae were collected and reared. Selection cycles were repeated 15 times. The HSA of S. carpocapsae IJs was enhanced 11-fold (from 3.7 to 39.8% of all IJs reaching proximity of the larvae) and 8.5-fold (from 2.3 to 19.7%) for H. bacteriophora after 10 cycles of selection. Further selections (cycles 11-15) had no significant impact on improving HSA. HSA of the selected lines was highly specific to R. ferrugineus larvae. Selection for improved HSA also enhanced infectivity to R. ferrugineus, Galleria mellonella and Spodoptera littoralis. In addition, it enhanced host penetration 2.7-fold for S. carpocapsae and 1.5-fold for H. bacteriophora, and desiccation tolerance improved 1.2- and 1.7-fold, respectively. Heat tolerance and fecundity of the selected lines were somewhat reduced (MT50 by factors of 1.02 and 1.2 and fecundity by factors of 0.93 and 0.99, respectively) as compared to the foundation population. Improved HSA with substantial improvement of other traits may enhance field performance of these biocontrol agents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Loss of evolutionary resistance by the oligochaete limnodrilus hoffmeisteri to a toxic substance - Cost or gene flow?
VL  - 64
IS  - 1
SP  - 152-165
AB  - The oligochaete Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri at Foundry Cove (FC), New York evolved genetic resistance to cadmium (Cd) and lost resistance after contaminated sediments were removed by dredging. Selection (on survival time in dissolved Cd) was used to generate tolerance to evaluate fitness cost, the commonplace expectation for evolutionary reversal. The hypothesis that gene flow from neighboring populations could "swamp" resistance was addressed by 16S rDNA sequences. In disagreement with the cost hypothesis, selected-Cd tolerant worms and controls showed no difference in total fecundity or growth rate in environments. Highly-Cd-tolerant worms of the FC-selected population grew rapidly at different temperatures and showed no growth impairment in the presence of Cd, indicating metabolically efficient resistance. Genetic structure at FC was consistent with invasion of genotypes from an adjacent population in the time since dredging. Applying selection to lines from FC and a reference site, demonstrated a more rapid increase in Cd tolerance in FC-origin lines, indicating standing allelic variation for resistance at FC (despite phenotypic erosion). The selection experiment supports the view that resistance is simply controlled - probably by one allele of large effect. Whether such rapid "readaptation" could occur naturally is an important question for understanding broad effects of pollutants. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Resilience to extreme temperature events: Acclimation capacity and body condition of a polymorphic fish in response to thermal stress
VL  - 111
IS  - 3
SP  - 504-510
AB  - Considerable attention has been given to the potential impacts of global climate change on biodiversity. In the present study, we combine understudied themes by examining the ability of a freshwater fish (polymorphic for heat-sensitivity) to respond to short-term thermal stress mimicking an extreme temperature event. We simultaneously measured the effect of thermal stress on the body condition of heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant forms to evaluate an existing hypothesis regarding the underlying mechanism by which temperature affects the maintenance of genetic variation in this species. Surprisingly, the heat-sensitive allelic variant increased in body condition equally as much as a heat-tolerant variant under acute heat stress. More importantly, the heat-sensitive variant exhibited a significant response to thermal stress, with an upward shift of greater than 2 degrees C in critical thermal maximum. Our findings suggest a complexity to the relationship between thermal stress and male body condition that may depend on an interaction with other factors such as resource level. Although the evolutionary fate of species with respect to climate change is typically evaluated in terms long-term adaptive response, short-term selection events could drastically reduce fitness and reduce evolutionary potential. Our results suggest that heat-sensitive species may have considerably greater resilience to the short-term, extreme perturbations to the environment that are expected under climate change.

TI  - Genetic variation of Lymnaea stagnalis tolerance to copper: A test of selection hypotheses and its relevance for ecological risk assessment
VL  - 205
SP  - 209-217
AB  - The use of standardized monospecific testing to assess the ecological risk of chemicals implicitly relies on the strong assumption that intraspecific variation in sensitivity is negligible or irrelevant in this context. In this study, we investigated genetic variation in copper sensitivity of the freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis, using lineages stemming from eight natural populations or strains found to be genetically differentiated at neutral markers. Copper-induced mortality varied widely among populations, as did the estimated daily death rate and time to 50% mortality (LT50). Population genetic divergence in copper sensitivity was compared to neutral differentiation using the QST-FST approach. No evidence for homogenizing selection could be detected. This result demonstrates that species-level extrapolations from single population studies are highly unreliable. The study provides a simple example of how evolutionary principles could be incorporated into ecotoxicity testing in order to refine ecological risk assessment. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Application of electric current in Friction Stir Welding
VL  - 1
SP  - 185-189
AB  - Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively new joining technique and has many applications. In FSW, heat generated due to friction between FSW tool and work-piece material softens the material and allows the materials in work-pieces to be stirred and joined together. FSW allows the work-pieces to be joined without reaching the melting point of the material, thus resulting in better welds. However, a large amount of mechanical energy has to be consumed for FSW of highstrength, difficult-to-weld metals such as titanium alloys. Hence, new FSW methods should be investigated to reduce the required energy. In this study, an innovative electrically enhanced friction stir welding (EEFSW) has been developed. Electric current is passed in welding coupons of Aluminum 6061 plates and its effect on welding process and welds are examined. The results indicate that, with the aid of electric current, improvement in welding speed and reduction in energy consumption is obtainable, which enhances the productivity and widens the range of applications of FSW. Weld properties are found to be affected by the introduced current as well. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

VL  - 61

SP  - 3297-3303
AB  - During the growth of thin metal films on dielectric substrates at a given deposition temperature Td, the film's morphology is conditioned by the magnitude and asymmetry of up- and downhill diffusion. Any severe change of this mechanism leads to a growth instability, which induces an alteration of the thin film morphology. In order to study this mechanism, ultrathin Pt films were deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto yttria-stabilized zirconia single crystals at different deposition temperatures. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and standard image analysis techniques. The experimentally obtained morphologies are compared to simulated thin film structures resulting from a two-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo approach. Two main observations have been made: (i) thin Pt films deposited onto ZrO 2 undergo a growth transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth at Td &gt; 573 K. The growth transition and related morphological changes are a function of the deposition temperature; and (ii) a critical cluster size of iâ̂- = 4 in combination with an asymmetric Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier favoring the uphill diffusion of atoms allows for a computational reproduction of the experimentally obtained film morphologies. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI  - Gene expression plasticity evolves in response to colonization of freshwater lakes in threespine stickleback
VL  - 23

SP  - 3226-3240
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to facilitate individual survival and/or evolve in response to novel environments. Plasticity that facilitates survival should both permit colonization and act as a buffer against further evolution, with contemporary and derived forms predicted to be similarly plastic for a suite of traits. On the other hand, given the importance of plasticity in maintaining internal homeostasis, derived populations that encounter greater environmental heterogeneity should evolve greater plasticity. We tested the evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity in coastal British Columbian postglacial populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) that evolved under greater seasonal extremes in temperature after invading freshwater lakes from the sea. Two ancestral (contemporary marine) and two derived (contemporary freshwater) populations of stickleback were raised near their thermal tolerance extremes, 7 and 22 °C. Gene expression plasticity was estimated for more than 14 000 genes. Over five thousand genes were similarly plastic in marine and freshwater stickleback, but freshwater populations exhibited significantly more genes with plastic expression than marine populations. Furthermore, several of the loci shown to exhibit gene expression plasticity have been previously implicated in the adaptive evolution of freshwater populations, including a gene involved in mitochondrial regulation (PPARAa). Collectively, these data provide molecular evidence that highlights the importance of plasticity in colonization and adaptation to new environments. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Climatic warming increases voltinism in european butterflies and moths
VL  - 277
IS  - 1685
SP  - 1281-1287
AB  - Climate change is altering geographical ranges, population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms. For ectotherms, increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates, activity patterns and developmental rates. Consequently, in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming. However, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, the number of generations (voltinism) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality, since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation. Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century, I report changes in the voltinism of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe. A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980, and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980. Expected ecological consequences are diverse. Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry. However, disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness, potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern. The ability of species to adapt evolutionarily to a changing environment may be facilitated by increased voltinism. © 2009 The Royal Society.

SP  - 331-335
AB  - A viviparous lizard, Eremias multiocellata, was used to investigate the possible sexual and ontogenetic effects on selected body temperature, thermal tolerance range and the thermal dependence of locomotor performance. We show that adults are sexually dimorphic and males have larger bodies and heads than females. Adults selected higher body temperatures (34.5 vs. 32.4 degrees C) and could tolerate a broader range of body temperatures (8.1-46.8 vs. 9.1-43.1 degrees C) than juveniles. The sprint speed and maximum sprint distance increased with temperature from 21 degrees C to 33 degrees C, but decreased at 36 degrees C and 39 degrees C in both juveniles and adults. Adults ran faster and longer than juveniles at each tested temperature. Adult locomotor performance was not correlated with snout-vent length (SVL) or sex, and sprint speed was positively correlated with hindlimb length. juvenile locomotor performance was positively correlated with both SVL and hindlimb length. The ontogenetic variation in selected body temperature, thermal tolerance and locomotor performance in E. multiocellata suggests that the effects of morphology on temperature selection and locomotor performance vary at different ontogenetic stages.

TI  - Transient turbid water mass reduces temperature-induced coral bleaching and mortality in Barbados
VL  - 2016
IS  - 6
AB  - Global warming is seen as one of the greatest threats to the world's coral reefs and, with the continued rise in sea surface temperature predicted into the future, there is a great need for further understanding of how to prevent and address the damaging impacts. This is particularly so for countries whose economies depend heavily on healthy reefs, such as those of the eastern Caribbean. Here, we compare the severity of bleaching and mortality for five dominant coral species at six representative reef sites in Barbados during the two most significant warm-water events ever recorded in the eastern Caribbean, i.e., 2005 and 2010, and describe prevailing island-scale sea water conditions during both events. In so doing, we demonstrate that coral bleaching and subsequent mortality were considerably lower in 2010 than in 2005 for all species, irrespective of site, even though the anomalously warm water temperature profiles were very similar between years. We also show that during the 2010 event, Barbados was engulfed by a transient dark green turbid water mass of riverine origin coming from South America. We suggest that reduced exposure to high solar radiation associated with this transient water mass was the primary contributing factor to the lower bleaching and mortality observed in all corals. We conclude that monitoring these episodic mesoscale oceanographic features might improve risk assessments of southeastern Caribbean reefs to warm-water events in the future. © 2016 Oxenford and Vallés.

AB  - Climate change and global warming are important phenomena and do not mean the same thing as is wrongly conceived by some individuals. However, the link between the two is strong and one, global warming is strictly an average increase in the temperature of the atmosphere near the earth’s surface and in the troposphere, while the other, climate change is more diverse and refers to any significant change in measures of climate such as temperature, precipitation, or wind lasting for a long period of time usually several years. Climate change could thus be an increase or decrease in temperature. The most important of the two terms which is under spotlight is global warming, an increase in temperature which has been blamed largely to greenhouse effect. There can no longer be any doubt that the earth’s climate is changing. It is now obvious that even the most hardened sceptics are starting to waiver in their convictions. Climate has been thrown completely out of kilter and each day brings fresh proof such as frequent and more violent cyclones in the Caribean, floods in Africa, the Philippines, the gradual sinking of Islands in the Pacific, heat waves in Europe and the melting of glaciers. There is increase in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and rising global average sea level. Impacts of global warming include the emergence and re-emergence of some parasitic infections and diseases. © Atehmengo et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 29-37
AB  - Burrow use is an important component of the behavioral repertoire of many terrestrial reptiles. The availability and/or selection of suitable burrows within the environment may have consequences for fitness as retreat site selection can affect the physiology and ecology of an animal. Thermal behavior and microhabitat selection may vary with respect to ambient temperatures, humidity levels, and the digestive state of the organism. To understand behavioral and physiological regulation mechanisms, we investigated the thermal biology of the Tuatara, Sphenodon punctatus, a medium-sized reptile that use underground burrows as general shelter. We gave captive, juvenile Tuatara a series of choices between burrows varying in temperature and humidity while in a fed or post-absorptive state. We did this to test hypotheses that Tuatara choose burrows based on temperature and humidity, and that those choices may change with the metabolic requirements of digestion. Tuatara selected warm temperatures regardless of digestive state, humidity, or time of the day. However, there was a clear diel trend in thermoregulatory behavior with Tuatara maintaining warmer body temperatures and using warmer parts of the gradient during the day. Tuatara were outside their burrows and moved about the thermal gradient more often during the night. Tuatara selected higher temperatures on the gradient under the dry treatment than they did in the humid treatment. However, Tuatara were outside their burrows in greater numbers under the humid treatment compared to the dry. Digestive state had no discernable effect on either temperatures selected or burrow use. This study provides experimental evidence that reptiles are capable of adjusting their habitat selection behavior in response to differing humidity constraints. © 2013. Ilse Corkery.

VL  - 19

SP  - 1466-1475
AB  - Population response to anthropogenic activities will be influenced by prior adaptation to environmental conditions. We tested how parasite-resistant and -susceptible strains of the freshwater snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, responded to cadmium and elevated temperature challenges after having been exposed to low-level cadmium continuously for multiple generations. Snails exposed to cadmium for three generations were removed for the fourth generation, and challenged in the fifth generation with (1) chronic cadmium exposure over the entire life cycle; (2) lethal cadmium exposure of adults; and (3) elevated temperature challenge of adults. The parasite susceptible NMRI strain is more cadmium tolerant than the parasite resistant BS90 strain and remained more tolerant than BS90 throughout this study. Additionally, NMRI exhibited greater adaptive capacity for cadmium than BS90 and became more tolerant of both chronic and lethal cadmium challenges, while BS90 became more tolerant of lethal cadmium challenge only. Fitness costs, reflected in population growth rate, were not apparent in fifth generation snails maintained in control conditions. However, costs were latent and expressed as decreased tolerance to a secondarily imposed temperature stress. Adaptation to prior selection pressures can influence subsequent adaptation to anthropogenic stresses and may have associated costs that reduce fitness in novel environments. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - The genetic enhancement of wild animals and plants for characteristics that benefit human populations has been practiced for thousands of years, resulting in impressive improvements in commercially valuable species. Despite these benefits, genetic manipulations are rarely considered for noncommercial purposes, such as conservation and restoration initiatives. Over the last century, humans have driven global climate change through industrialization and the release of increasing amounts of CO2, resulting in shifts in ocean temperature, ocean chemistry, and sea level, as well as increasing frequency of storms, all of which can profoundly impact marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems that have suffered massive declines in health and abundance as a result of these and other direct anthropogenic disturbances. There is great concern that the high rates, magnitudes, and complexity of environmental change are overwhelming the intrinsic capacity of corals to adapt and survive. Although it is important to address the root causes of changing climate, it is also prudent to explore the potential to augment the capacity of reef organisms to tolerate stress and to facilitate recovery after disturbances. Here, we review the risks and benefits of the improvement of natural and commercial stocks in noncoral reef systems and advocate a series of experiments to determine the feasibility of developing coral stocks with enhanced stress tolerance through the acceleration of naturally occurring processes, an approach known as (human)-assisted evolution, while at the same time initiating a public dialogue on the risks and benefits of this approach.

AB  - In a previous study we had shown that 55 generations of selection for faster egg-to-adult development in fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster results in shortening of pre-adult duration by similar to 29-h (similar to 12.5%) and speeding-up of circadian clock period (tau) by similar to 0.5-h, implying a positive correlation between development time and tau. In Drosophila, change in ambient temperature is known to alter the rate of pre-adult development but not the speed of circadian clocks whereas 12:12-h warm/cold (WC) cycles are likely to alter both pre-adult development rate and tau (via entrainment). To study the effect of overall speeding-up/slowing-down of pre-adult development and circadian clocks on the selection-mediated difference in pre-adult development time, we subjected developing flies to the following conditions: (i) different ambient temperatures (18, 25 and 29 degrees C) under constant darkness (DD) to alter the rate of pre-adult development, or (ii) cyclic WC conditions (WC1-25:18 or WC2-29:25 degrees C) to alter rate of development and tau. The results revealed that the selected (FD) stocks develop faster than controls (BD) by similar to 52, 28 and 21-h, at 18,25 and 29 degrees C, respectively, and by 28 and 26-h under WC1 and WC2, respectively. The tau of activity/rest rhythm decreased considerably at 18 degrees C but it did not differ between the FD and BD flies, which suggests a break-down of correlation between development time and tau, seen under their normal rearing conditions (constant darkness - DD at 25 degrees C). While the absolute difference in development time between FD and BD stocks increased or decreased under cooler or warmer conditions, the relative difference in their pre-adult development time remained largely unaltered. These results suggest that manipulations in ambient conditions independently changes development time and tau, resulting in a breakdown of the genetic correlation between them. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Does metabolic rate and evaporative water loss reflect differences in migratory strategy in sexually dimorphic hoverflies?
VL  - 190
SP  - 61-67
AB  - A typical explanation for ecologically stable strategies that apply to only a proportion of a population, is bet hedging, where increased reproductive success offsets reduced reproductive rate. One such is partial migration, where only a proportion of a population moves seasonally to avoid inclement climatic conditions. Bet hedging may overlook unseen costs to maintain broad physiological resilience, implied by encountering a breadth of environmental conditions. We investigated the physiological correlates of partial migration by measuring standard metabolic rates, and rates of evaporative water loss, and then estimating upper and lower thermal tolerance in males and females of two hoverfly species, Episyrphus balteatus and Eristalis tenax. In central Europe, females of these species may either migrate or overwinter, whereas males may migrate south to the Mediterranean, but have not been found overwintering. Both species were sexually dimorphic; female Ep. balteatus were lighter than males, but female Er. tenax were heavier than males. While allometrically- corrected metabolic rate in both species increased with temperature, the most parsimonious models included no sex-specific differences in metabolic rate for either species. Evaporative water loss of both species also increased with temperature, but was higher for females of both species than males. Assuming that resting metabolism is congruent with the activity requirements of migration, highly consistent thermal tolerance and metabolic rate suggests that any given fly could migrate, although water loss patterns suggest that females may be less well-adapted to Mediterranean climates. We infer that partial migration probably results from the imperatives of their reproductive strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - CRYOPRESERVATION of ONAGER (EQUUS HEMIONUS ONAGER) EPIDIDYMAL SPERMATOZOA
VL  - 46
IS  - 3
SP  - 517-525
AB  - Genetic diversity is a primary component of adaptive evolution, and its loss or reduction can decrease the long-term survival probability of populations. Utilization of cryopreserved semen may be considered a perfect tool to improve genetic diversity, reduce inbreeding, and avoid animal translocation for breeding. The present study aimed at finding a reliable epididymal sperm freezing protocol for the critically endangered onager (Equus hemionus onager). Six testicles from three animals were processed postmortem. The effects of two transportation temperatures (22 degrees C and 4 degrees C; testicles submerged in saline), two cryopreservation techniques (conventional liquid nitrogen vapor freezing in straws and directional freezing in 8-ml HollowTubes (TM)), and two postthaw incubation temperatures (22 degrees C and 37 degrees C; evaluated after 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hr) were tested in a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design. Sperm samples were evaluated for motility, viability, acrosome integrity, and sperm morphology. The resulting optimal freezing protocol includes transportation of testicles at 4 degrees C, cryopreservation by directional freezing, and, if needed, postthaw incubation at 22 degrees C. With this combination of transportation temperature and cryopreservation technique, the authors obtained the following postthaw values normalized to prefreezing values: 60.3 +/- 8.8% motility, 60.7 +/- 13.3% viability, 75.3 +/- 9.5% acrosome integrity, and 94.7 +/- 2.9% normal morphology (excluding defects due to the epididymal origin of the sperm). After incubation at 22 degrees C, motility values for the above combination were 40 +/- 5.7%, 30.3 +/- 5.2%, 28.3 +/- 4.4%, and 16.7 +/- 4.4% for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 hr, respectively. In conclusion, with this protocol, good quality semen can be stored for future use in artificial inseminations when and where needed.

TI  - Selection of trichogramma pretiosum lineages for control of grapholita molesta in peach
VL  - 94
IS  - 3
SP  - 398-403
AB  - Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is one of the main pests of peach trees in Brazil, causing fruit losses of 35%. Among possible biological control agents, Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) has been found in peach orchards. Our objectives were to study the rearing of T. pretiosum in eggs of G. molesta and Anagasta kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and select lineages of this parasitoid that have the potential to control G. molesta. Selection of best lineages was made from 5 populations of T. pretiosum collected from organically-cultivated peach orchards. The study was done under controlled temperature (25 ± 2°C), relative humidity (70 ± 10%) and 14:10 h (light:dark) photoperiod conditions. Grapholita molesta eggs were found to be adequate hosts for the development of T. pretiosum, and the parameters for number of parasitized eggs, percent parasitized eggs, and sex ratio were similar to those for A. kuehniella eggs. The highest rate of parasitism of G. molesta eggs occurred in eggs with up to 48 h of embryonic development. Among the lineages of T. pretiosum that were collected, HO8, PO8, PEL, and L3M showed the best biological performance and are therefore indicated for semi-field and field studies for biological control of oriental fruit moth.

TI  - Fire usage and ancient hominin detoxification genes: Protective ancestral variants dominate while additional derived risk variants appear in modern humans
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
AB  - Studies of the defence capacity of ancient hominins against toxic substances may contribute importantly to the reconstruction of their niche, including their diets and use of fire. Fire usage implies frequent exposure to hazardous compounds from smoke and heated food, known to affect general health and fertility, probably resulting in genetic selection for improved detoxification. To investigate whether such genetic selection occurred, we investigated the alleles in Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans at gene polymorphisms well-known to be relevant from modern human epidemiological studies of habitual tobacco smoke exposure and mechanistic evidence. We compared these with the alleles in chimpanzees and gorillas. Neanderthal and Denisovan hominins predominantly possess gene variants conferring increased resistance to these toxic compounds. Surprisingly, we observed the same in chimpanzees and gorillas, implying that less efficient variants are derived and mainly evolved in modern humans. Less efficient variants are observable from the first early Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers onwards. While not clarifying the deep history of fire use, our results highlight the long-term stability of the genes under consideration despite major changes in the hominin dietary niche. Specifically for detoxification gene variants characterised as deleterious by epidemiological studies, our results confirm the predominantly recent appearance reported for deleterious human gene variants, suggesting substantial impact of recent human population history, including pre-Holocene expansions. © 2016 Aarts et al.

TI  - Survival and innovation: The role of mutational robustness in evolution
VL  - 119
SP  - 254-261
AB  - Biological systems are resistant to perturbations caused by the environment and by the intrinsic noise of the system. Robustness to mutations is a particular aspect of robustness in which the phenotype is resistant to genotypic variation. Mutational robustness has been linked to the ability of the system to generate heritable genetic variation (a property known as evolvability). It is known that greater robustness leads to increased evolvability. Therefore, mechanisms that increase mutational robustness fuel evolvability. Two such mechanisms, molecular chaperones and gene duplication, have been credited with enormous importance in generating functional diversity through the increase of system's robustness to mutational insults. However, the way in which such mechanisms regulate robustness remains largely uncharacterized. In this review, I provide evidence in support of the role of molecular chaperones and gene duplication in innovation. Specifically, I present evidence that these mechanisms regulate robustness allowing unstable systems to survive long periods of time, and thus they provide opportunity for other mutations to compensate the destabilizing effects of functionally innovative mutations. The findings reported in this study set new questions with regards to the synergy between robustness mechanisms and how this synergy can alter the adaptive landscape of proteins. The ideas proposed in this article set the ground for future research in the understanding of the role of robustness in evolution. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

TI  - Microgeographic Adaptation of Wood Frog Tadpoles to an Apex Predator
VL  - 105
IS  - 3
SP  - 451-461
AB  - Rapid adaptation of defenses can alter ecological dynamics following introduction of a new predator. We tested for local adaptation in Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) populations that face varying selection from an apex predator, the Marbled Salamander (Ambystoma opacum), which is expanding its distribution in the study region. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with Wood Frog eggs and tadpoles and tested survival of tadpoles when exposed to Marbled Salamander larvae in experimental predation trials. We also evaluated life history, behavioral, and morphological trait variation with respect to origin and transplant environments. We found that tadpoles from populations exposed to high risk from Marbled Salamanders survived better when raised in high-risk environments than tadpoles from low-risk populations. However, tadpoles from high-risk environments experienced lower survival than those from low-risk environments when raised in low-risk environments. Development rate, activity, and morphology differed among populations and environments. Faster development of high-risk populations in high-risk environments and activity patterns best explained observed survival differences. These results suggest that tadpoles have evolved adaptive plasticity at microgeographic scales in response to a mosaic of varying predation risk. Fine-scaled evolution of prey survival and local gene flow could enhance the resilience of Wood Frogs to this predator expansion. As warming winters allow Marbled Salamanders to increase in abundance and distribution, the rapid and fine-scaled evolution of their prey could mediate predicted changes to temporary pond communities and ecosystems. Rapid prey evolution might often promote ecological resilience to predator introductions. © 2017 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

TI  - A review of temperature, pH, and other factors that influence the survival of Salmonella in mayonnaise and other raw egg products
VL  - 5
IS  - 4
AB  - Salmonellosis is one of the main causes of foodborne illnesses worldwide, with outbreaks predominately linked to contamination of eggs and raw egg products, such as mayonnaise. This review explores previous studies that have investigated Salmonella control mechanisms utilized in the production of raw egg mayonnaise and other food products. Apart from the use of pasteurized eggs, the main control mechanism identified is the pH of the raw egg products, which plays an important role in the consistency and stability while affecting the survival of Salmonella spp. However, currently there is no consensus regarding the critical pH limit for the control of Salmonella. The effectiveness of pH as a control mechanism is influenced by the type of acid used, with the effectiveness of lemon juice compared with vinegar highly debated. Additionally, Salmonella susceptibility to pH stresses may also be influenced by storage temperature (in some studies refrigeration temperatures protected Salmonella spp. from acidulants) and is further complicated by the development of Salmonella cross-tolerance-induced responses, pH homeostasis achieved by the cellular antiport and symport systems, and acid tolerance response (ATR). These mechanisms all provide Salmonella with an added advantage to ensure survival under various pH conditions. Other confounding factors include the fat content, and the addition of NaCl, garlic and plant essential oils (PEOs) from mint, cinnamon, cardamom and clove. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Dynamic digestive physiology of a female reproductive organ in a polyandrous butterfly
VL  - 218
IS  - 10
SP  - 1548-1555
AB  - Reproductive traits experience high levels of selection because of their direct ties to fitness, often resulting in rapid adaptive evolution. Much of the work in this area has focused on male reproductive traits. However, a more comprehensive understanding of female reproductive adaptations and their relationship to male characters is crucial to uncover the relative roles of sexual cooperation and conflict in driving co-evolutionary dynamics between the sexes. We focus on the physiology of a complex female reproductive adaptation in butterflies and moths: a stomach-like organ in the female reproductive tract called the bursa copulatrix that digests the male ejaculate (spermatophore). Little is known about how the bursa digests the spermatophore. We characterized bursa proteolytic capacity in relation to female state in the polyandrous butterfly Pieris rapae. We found that the virgin bursa exhibits extremely high levels of proteolytic activity. Furthermore, in virgin females, bursal proteolytic capacity increases with time since eclosion and ambient temperature, but is not sensitive to the pre-mating social environment. Post copulation, bursal proteolytic activity decreases rapidly before rebounding toward the end of a mating cycle, suggesting active female regulation of proteolysis and/or potential quenching of proteolysis by male ejaculate constituents. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we report identities for nine proteases actively transcribed by bursal tissue and/or expressed in the bursal lumen that may contribute to observed bursal proteolysis. We discuss how these dynamic physiological characteristics may function as female adaptations resulting from sexual conflict over female remating rate in this polyandrous butterfly. © 2015 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Geographic determinants of gene flow in two sister species of tropical andean frogs
VL  - 105
IS  - 2
SP  - 216-225
AB  - Complex interactions between topographic heterogeneity, climatic and environmental gradients, and thermal niche conservatism are commonly assumed to indicate the degree of biotic diversification in montane regions. Our aim was to investigate factors that disrupt gene flow between populations and to determine if there is evidence of downslope asymmetric migration in highland frogs with wide elevational ranges and thermal niches. We determined the role of putative impediments to gene flow (as measured by least-cost path (LCP) distances, topographic complexity, and elevational range) in promoting genetic divergence between populations of 2 tropical Andean frog sister species (Dendropsophus luddeckei, N = 114; Dendropsophus labialis, N = 74) using causal modeling and multiple matrix regression. Although the effect of geographic features was species specific, elevational range and LCP distances had the strongest effect on gene flow, with mean effect sizes (Mantel r and regression coefficients β), between 5 and 10 times greater than topographic complexity. Even though causal modeling and multiple matrix regression produced congruent results, the latter provided more information on the contribution of each geographic variable. We found moderate support for downslope migration. We conclude that the climatic heterogeneity of the landscape, the elevational distance between populations, and the inability to colonize suboptimal habitats due to thermal niche conservatism influence the magnitude of gene flow. Asymmetric migration, however, seems to be influenced by life history traits. © The American Genetic Association 2013.

TI  - Niche evolution and thermal adaptation in the temperate species Drosophila americana
VL  - 27

SP  - 1549-1561
AB  - The study of ecological niche evolution is fundamental for understanding how the environment influences species' geographical distributions and their adaptation to divergent environments. Here, we present a study of the ecological niche, demographic history and thermal performance (locomotor activity, developmental time and fertility/viability) of the temperate species Drosophila americana and its two chromosomal forms. Temperature is the environmental factor that contributes most to the species' and chromosomal forms' ecological niches, although precipitation is also important in the model of the southern populations. The past distribution model of the species predicts a drastic reduction in the suitable area for the distribution of the species during the last glacial maximum (LGM), suggesting a strong bottleneck. However, DNA analyses did not detect a bottleneck signature during the LGM. These contrasting results could indicate that D. americana niche preference evolves with environmental change, and thus, there is no evidence to support niche conservatism in this species. Thermal performance experiments show no difference in the locomotor activity across a temperature range of 15 to 38 °C between flies from the north and the south of its distribution. However, we found significant differences in developmental time and fertility/viability between the two chromosomal forms at the model's optimal temperatures for the two forms. However, results do not indicate that they perform better for the traits studied here in their respective optimal niche temperatures. This suggests that behaviour plays an important role in thermoregulation, supporting the capacity of this species to adapt to different climatic conditions across its latitudinal distribution. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Examination of parental effect on the progeny diapause by reciprocal cross test in the cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi
VL  - 11
AB  - The cabbage beetle, Colaphellus bowringi Baly (Coleoptera:Chrysomelidae), a serious pest of crucifers in China, undergoes summer or winter diapause in the soil as an adult. In the present study, the incidence of diapause were measured in reciprocal crosses between a high-diapause strain (HD strain) and a laboratory-selected nondiapausing strain (ND strain) under different photoperiods and temperatures, to explore parental influences on the progeny diapause. Sensitivity to photoperiod in the selected nondiapausing strain was nearly eliminated at 25 degrees C, whereas sensitivity to temperature of the selected nondiapausing strain was retained under continuous darkness at 20 and 22 degrees C. Reciprocal crosses between the HD strain and the ND strain showed that the incidence of diapause in the progeny was always intermediate to that of the parents under different photoperiods and temperatures, suggesting that diapause induction was determined by both female and male parents. There was a significant effect of temperature; temperature interacted with reciprocal cross on diapause induction, whereas no significant effect of reciprocal cross was demonstrated. The incidence of diapause in female(ND) x male(HD) was the same as in female(HD) x male(ND) under continuous darkness at 18 degrees C (100%) and 26 degrees C (0%), but the former was higher than that in female(HD) x male(ND) under continuous darkness at 22 degrees C, suggesting that female parent does not exhibit strong influence on the diapause response to temperature. There was a significant effect of photoperiod and reciprocal cross on diapause induction, whereas no significant interactive effect on diapause induction was demonstrated. Incidence of diapause in female(HD) x male(ND) was always higher than in female(ND) x male(HD) at 25 degrees C and 12:12 L:D, 14:10 L:D, and 16:8 L:D, suggesting a strong maternal influence on the diapause response to photoperiod, though a significant difference was observed only at 14:10 L:D. Our results support the idea that diapause induction is determined by both female and male parents. However, results also indicated that a strong maternal influence on diapause was exhibited only in response to photoperiod.

TI  - Recovery from hybrid breakdown in a marine invertebrate is faster, stronger and more repeatable under environmental stress
VL  - 29
IS  - 9
SP  - 1793-1803
AB  - Understanding how environmental stress alters the consequences of hybridization is important, because the rate of hybridization and the likelihood of hybrid speciation both appear elevated in harsh, disturbed or marginal habitats. We assessed fitness, morphometrics and molecular genetic composition over 14 generations of hybridization between two highly divergent populations of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus. Replicated, experimental hybrid populations in both control and high-salinity conditions showed a decline in fitness, followed by a recovery. Recovery was faster in the salinity stress treatment, returning to parental levels up to two generations earlier than in the control. This recovery was stable in the high-salinity treatment, whereas in the control treatment, fitness dropped back below parental levels at the final time point. Recovery in the high-salinity treatment was also stronger in terms of competitive fitness and heat-shock tolerance. Finally, consequences of hybridization were more repeatable under salinity stress, where among-replicate variance for survivorship and molecular genetic composition was lower than in the control treatment. In a system with low effective population sizes (estimates ranged from 17 to 63), where genetic drift might be expected to be the predominate force, strong selection under harsh environmental conditions apparently promoted faster, stronger and more repeatable recovery from depressed hybrid fitness. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Annual killifish adaptations to ephemeral environments: Diapause i in two austrolebias species
VL  - 246
IS  - 11
SP  - 848-857
AB  - Background: Many organisms are able to survive in extreme environments by entering a state of dormancy. In dormancy, vital activities are reduced until environmental conditions are compatible with active life. Annual killifishes show a special developmental pattern characterized by a phase of dispersion-reaggregation of the blastomeres that separates epiboly from organogenesis, and the capability to enter dormancy in diapause. High tolerance to environmental stress confers annual killifish embryos the condition of extremophiles. At present, the questions of our research group are focused on the understanding of the mechanisms involved in diapause regulation through an interdisciplinary approach. As a first step, it is necessary to characterize diapauses at morphological and physiological levels and to evaluate induction cues under laboratory conditions. In this context, we characterized diapause I in two Austrolebias species. Results: Our experimental approach to induce diapause I was successful and revealed the co-existence of two diapause I phenotypes named A and B instead of one. These phenotypes showed a tendency for lower total extractable RNA content compared with active developmental stages (80–100% epiboly and early reaggregate). Conclusions: These phenotypes are alternative diapause I stages and may have ecological relevance because both were found in embryos in natural ponds.

TI  - A 3D thermo-mechanical model to study plate distortions during quenching process
AB  - Flatness defects such as edge waves, center buckles, longbows and crossbows are can easily be created during water cooling. The mechanism of flatness deterioration due to water cooling is not well understood. It causes operational trouble and can result in poor quality of product and productivity loss for repairing. ArcelorMittal Global R&D has developed a three dimensions finite element model to understand the link between cooling process and flatness. The model is developed to support the design of new quench investments and to improve the quench practices. The 3D model developed with Abaqus is able to predict the evolution of plate temperature, thermal stresses, strains, and distortions all along the cooling process. The cooling device is represented by top and bottom movable surfaces where a heat flux depending on width, length and temperature is applied. The effect of phase transformation is at first represented by a variation of thermal expansion coefficient. It is used to evaluate the effect of an unsymmetrical cooling along various directions. The first results show that the shape obtained by the model is comparable to real shape plate. Final distortion for thick and thin plates is presented. The effect of platen rolls is also commented.

TI  - Response of coral assemblages to thermal stress: Are bleaching intensity and spatial patterns consistent between events?
VL  - 185
IS  - 6
SP  - 5031-5042
AB  - Mass bleaching events resulting in coral mortality are among the greatest threats to coral reefs, and are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with global warming. Achieving a better understanding of the consistency of the response of coral assemblages to thermal stress, both spatially and temporally, is essential to determine which reefs are more able to tolerate climate change. We compared variations in spatial and taxonomic patterns between two bleaching events at the scale of an island (Moorea Island, French Polynesia). Despite similar thermal stress and light conditions, bleaching intensity was significantly lower in 2007 (approximately 37 % of colonies showed signs of bleaching) than in 2002, when 55 % of the colonies bleached. Variations in the spatial patterns of bleaching intensity were consistent between the two events. Among nine sampling stations at three locations and three depths, the stations at which the bleaching response was lowest in 2002 were those that showed the lowest levels of bleaching in 2007. The taxonomic patterns of susceptibility to bleaching were also consistent between the two events. These findings have important implications for conservation because they indicate that corals are capable of acclimatization and/or adaptation and that, even at small spatial scales, some areas are consistently more susceptible to bleaching than others. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Heat-stress survival in the pre-adult stage of the life cycle in an intercontinental set of recombinant inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 216
IS  - 15
SP  - 2953-2959
AB  - In insects, pre-adult stages of the life cycle are exposed to variation in temperature that may differ from that in adults. However, the genetic basis for adaptation to environmental temperature could be similar between the pre-adult and the adult stages of the life cycle. Here, we tested quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress survival in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, with and without a mild-heat-stress pre-treatment. Two sets of recombinant inbred lines derived from lines artificially selected for high and low levels of knockdown resistance to high temperature in young flies were used as the mapping population. There was no apparent increase in heat-shock survival between heat-pretreated and non-pretreated larvae. There was a positive correlation between the two experimental conditions of heat-shock survival (with and without a heat pre-treatment) except for males from one set of lines. Several QTL were identified involving all three major chromosomes. Most QTL for larval thermotolerance overlapped with thermotolerance QTL identified in previous studies for adults, indicating that heat-stress resistance is not genetically independent between life cycle stages because of either linkage or pleiotropy. The sign of the effects of some QTL alleles differed both between the sexes and between life stages. © 2013. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - The effect of historical legacy on adaptation: Do closely related species respond to the environment in the same way?
VL  - 25
IS  - 8
SP  - 1636-1649
AB  - The many documented examples of parallel and convergent evolution in similar environments are strong evidence for the role of natural selection in the evolution of trait variation. However, species may respond to selection in different ways; idiosyncrasies of their evolutionary history may affect how different species respond to the same selective pressure. To determine whether evolutionary history affects trait-environment associations in a recently diverged lineage, we investigated within-species trait-environment associations in the white proteas, a closely related monophyletic group. We first used manovas to determine the relative importance of shared response to selection, evolutionary history and unique responses to selection on trait variation. We found that on average, similar associations to the environment across species explained trait variation, but that the species had different mean trait values. We also detected species-specific associations of traits with the environmental gradients. To identify the traits associated uniquely with the environment, we used a structural equation model. Our analysis showed that the species differed in how their traits were associated with each of the environmental variables. Further, in the cases of two root traits (root mass and root length/mass ratio), two species differed in the direction of their associations (e.g. populations in one species had heavier roots in warmer areas, and populations in the other species had lighter roots in warmer areas). Our study shows that even in a closely related group of species, evolutionary history may have an effect on both the size and direction of adaptations to the environment. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 13
IS  - 3
SP  - 228-233
AB  - In fish, haemoglobin adaptations govern survival and biodiversity under specific environmental conditions and physiological requirements. The study of haemoglobins is aimed at identifying key links between molecular and eco-physiological adaptations. Differences in haemoglobin properties arise from the interaction of the heme with specific residues in the primary structure, but modulation in regulatory processes and altered protein synthesis may be additional adaptations in response to environmental changes. Fish experience variations in oxygen availability, salinity, ionic composition, pH and temperature. Compared to the dominant suborder Notothenioidei in Antarctica, many Arctic species possess multiple haemoglobins with different functional properties, which might be selectively and differentially expressed to secure oxygen unloading in peripheral tissues including swim bladder and retina, suggesting a mechanism of labour sharing. Haemoglobin polymorphism may further increase the repertoire of oxygen-binding tetramers, as documented in Atlantic cod widely distributed in Arctic and temperate North Atlantic waters. This ecologically and economically important species copes with fluctuating physico-chemical conditions affecting oxygen availability, demand and binding properties by displaying novel regulatory and structural polymorphisms in the main β1 subunit. The tetraploid salmonid genome harbours more α and β globin genes than any other teleost examined, and thermal stress activates several subunits in Arctic charr, the most northern-living freshwater fish. Thus, the success of Arctic fish seem governed by evolutionary adaptation to waters having variable low temperatures and by plasticity to environmental and human-induced habitat changes. Current knowledge of the molecular and functional diversity of haemoglobins in Arctic fish is summarised and compared with Antarctic fish in this review. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 113

SP  - 33-38
AB  - Females of several lizard species modify their body temperature during pregnancy, probably in connection with the optimisation of hatchling phenotypes. We studied variations in the temperature selected by gravid females compared with those selected by males and non-gravid females in an oviparous population of Zootoca vivipara (Jacquin, 1797) (Squamata: Lacertidae) of Northern Spain and examined the effects of incubation temperature on the phenotypic variation of hatchlings. Cloacal temperatures of gravid females active in the field were lower than those of males and non-gravid females, as well as the temperatures selected in a thermal gradient created in the laboratory (mean s.d.: 32.33 +/- 1.27 degrees C for gravid females; 34.05 +/- 1.07 degrees C for males and non-gravid females). Effects of temperature were assessed by incubating eggs at five constant temperatures (21, 25, 29, 32 and 34 degrees C). Incubation time decreased as temperature increased, following a negative exponential function. Incubation temperatures also affected the hatchlings' morphology: hatchlings incubated at 34 degrees C had shorter heads than those from other temperatures. Survival at 34 degrees C (58%) was significantly lower than at the other temperatures (mean 93%). Pregnant females select lower body temperature, approaching the temperatures that optimise hatchling phenotypes, according to predictions of the maternal manipulation hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. The shift in preferred temperature by pregnant females would result in only a very short delay, if any, of hatching time and, because the temperature selected by pregnant females is much higher than average temperatures recorded in natural nests of Z. vivipara, egg retention considerably shortens incubation time, according to predictions of the cold-climate hypothesis. Our experimental results indicate that the two main hypotheses on the evolution of viviparity are compatible in our study model. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

VL  - 38

SP  - 434-439
AB  - In many ectotherms, selection of environmental thermal niches may positively affect growth, nutrient assimilation rates, immune system function, and ultimately survival. Temperature preference in some turtle species may be influenced by environmental conditions, including acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of acclimation temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 14 juvenile Malaclemys terrapin (Reptilia: Emydidae) in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (22 degrees C, 27 degrees C) control tests. Among 8-10 month old terrapins, acclimation temperature influenced activity and movement patterns but did not affect temperature selection. In thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, turtles acclimated to 27 degrees C used more tank chambers and relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 22 C. However, acclimation temperature did not affect temperature selection: both 22- and 27 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected the warmest temperature (34 degrees C), and avoided the other temperatures available, during thermal gradient tests. These results suggest that young M. terrapin are capable of detecting small temperature increments and prefer warm temperatures that may positively influence growth and metabolism.

TI  - Seasonal time constraints reduce genetic variation in life-history traits along a latitudinal gradient
VL  - 85
IS  - 1
SP  - 187-198
AB  - Time constraints cause strong selection on life-history traits, because populations need to complete their life cycles within a shorter time. We therefore expect lower genetic variation in these traits in high- than in low-latitude populations, since the former are more time-constrained. The aim was to estimate life-history traits and their genetic variation in an obligately univoltine damselfly along a latitudinal gradient of 2730 km. Populations were grown in the laboratory at temperatures and photoperiods simulating those at their place of origin. In a complementary experiment, individuals from the same families were grown in constant temperature and photoperiod that mimicked average conditions across the latitude. Development time and size was faster and smaller, respectively, and growth rate was higher at northern latitudes. Additive genetic variance was very low for life-history traits, and estimates for egg development time and larval growth rate showed significant decreases towards northern latitudes. The expression of genetic effects in life-history traits differed considerably when individuals were grown in constant rather than simulated and naturally variable conditions. Our results support strong selection by time constraints. They also highlight the importance of growing organisms in their native environment for correct estimates of genetic variance at their place of origin. Our results also suggest that the evolutionary potential of life-history traits is very low at northern compared to southern latitudes, but that changes in climate could alter this pattern. © 2016 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Long-Term Responses of the Endemic Reef-Builder Cladocora caespitosa to Mediterranean Warming
VL  - 8
IS  - 8
AB  - Recurrent climate-induced mass-mortalities have been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea over the past 15 years. Cladocora caespitosa, the sole zooxanthellate scleractinian reef-builder in the Mediterranean, is among the organisms affected by these episodes. Extensive bioconstructions of this endemic coral are very rare at the present time and are threatened by several stressors. In this study, we assessed the long-term response of this temperate coral to warming sea-water in the Columbretes Islands (NW Mediterranean) and described, for the first time, the relationship between recurrent mortality events and local sea surface temperature (SST) regimes in the Mediterranean Sea. A water temperature series spanning more than 20 years showed a summer warming trend of 0.06°C per year and an increased frequency of positive thermal anomalies. Mortality resulted from tissue necrosis without massive zooxanthellae loss and during the 11-year study, necrosis was recorded during nine summers separated into two mortality periods (2003-2006 and 2008-2012). The highest necrosis rates were registered during the first mortality period, after the exceptionally hot summer of 2003. Although necrosis and temperature were significantly associated, the variability in necrosis rates during summers with similar thermal anomalies pointed to other acting factors. In this sense, our results showed that these differences were more closely related to the interannual temperature context and delayed thermal stress after extreme summers, rather than to acclimatisation and adaption processes. © 2013 Kersting et al.

TI  - Hydrolytic fitness of N‐glycosyl bonds: comparing the deglycosylation kinetics of modified, alternative, and native nucleosides
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 173-180
AB  - Nature's selection of the contemporary nucleobases in RNA and DNA continues to intrigue the origin of life community. While the prebiotic synthesis of the N‐glycosyl bond has historically been a central area of investigation, variations in hydrolytic stability among the N‐glycosyl bonds may have presented an additional selection pressure that contributed to nucleobase and nucleoside evolution. To experimentally probe this hypothesis, a systematic kinetic analysis of the hydrolytic deglycosylation reactions of modified, alternative, and native nucleosides was undertaken. Rate constants were measured as a function of temperature (at pH 1) to produce Arrhenius and Eyring plots for extrapolation to 37°C and determination of thermodynamic activation parameters. Rate enhancements based on the differences in reaction rates of deoxyriboglycosidic and riboglycosidic bonds were found to vary under the same conditions. Rate constants of deoxynucleosides were also measured across the pH range of 1–3 (at 50°C), which highlighted how simple changes to the heterocycle alone can lead to a significant variation in deglycosylation rates. The contemporary nucleosides exhibited the slowest deglycosylation rates in comparison with the nonnative/alternative nucleosides, which we suggest as experimental support for nature's selection of the fittest N‐glycosyl bonds.

TI  - Surface immobilization of Rhizopus oryzae (ATCC 96382) for enhanced production of lipase enzyme by multiple responses optimization
VL  - 7
SP  - S285-S295
AB  - A modified Response Surface Methodology was used for the optimization of lipase production by immobilized cells of Rhizopus oryzae (ATCC 96382). Multiple responses optimization strategy was adopted to optimize process condition of surface immobilization technique for the optimization of lipase productivity. Five parameters, pH, Temperature, revolutions per minute, olive oil and glucose were considered, and their effect was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively by using a modified central composite design approach and model validation. The second order regression equation was developed for the three yield parameters are Y P/B, Y L/P and Y L/B, where Y is the yield parameter at their corresponding values of L: Lipase (U/mL), P: Protein (mg/mL) and B: Biomass (mg/mL). The regression equation was fitted and model fit (R 2) was 0.604 (Y P/B), 0.746 (Y L/P) and 0.618 (Y L/B), respectively showing an effective fit. Further, the model was validated theoretically and experimentally at higher level of production. Different growth patterns were observed during 120 h of fermentation period. © 2012 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Forecasting extinction risk of ectotherms under climate warming: An evolutionary perspective
VL  - 26
IS  - 6
SP  - 1324-1338
AB  - It has been postulated that climate warming may pose the greatest threat species in the tropics, where ectotherms have evolved more thermal specialist physiologies. Although species could rapidly respond to environmental change through adaptation, little is known about the potential for thermal adaptation, especially in tropical species. In the light of the limited empirical evidence available and predictions from mutation-selection theory, we might expect tropical ectotherms to have limited genetic variance to enable adaptation. However, as a consequence of thermodynamic constraints, we might expect this disadvantage to be at least partially offset by a fitness advantage, that is, the 'hotter-is-better' hypothesis. Using an established quantitative genetics model and metabolic scaling relationships, we integrate the consequences of the opposing forces of thermal specialization and thermodynamic constraints on adaptive potential by evaluating extinction risk under climate warming. We conclude that the potential advantage of a higher maximal development rate can in theory more than offset the potential disadvantage of lower genetic variance associated with a thermal specialist strategy. Quantitative estimates of extinction risk are fundamentally very sensitive to estimates of generation time and genetic variance. However, our qualitative conclusion that the relative risk of extinction is likely to be lower for tropical species than for temperate species is robust to assumptions regarding the effects of effective population size, mutation rate and birth rate per capita. With a view to improving ecological forecasts, we use this modelling framework to review the sensitivity of our predictions to the model's underpinning theoretical assumptions and the empirical basis of macroecological patterns that suggest thermal specialization and fitness increase towards the tropics. We conclude by suggesting priority areas for further empirical research. © 2012 British Ecological Society.

AB  - The integrated steelmaking cycle based on the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BOF) route plays an important role in the production of plain and ultra-low carbon steel, especially for deep drawing operations. BOF steelmaking is based on the conversion of cast iron in steel by impinging oxygen on the metal bath at supersonic speed. In order to avoid the addition of detrimental chemical elements owing to the introduction of uncontrolled scrap and in order to decrease environmental impact caused by the intensive use of coke for the production of cast iron, HBI (hot briquetted iron) can be used as a source of metal and a fraction of cast iron. Forty industrial experimental tests were performed to evaluate the viability of the use of HBI in BOF. The experimental campaign was supported by a thermal prediction model and realized through the estimation of the oxidation enthalpy. Furthermore, the process was thermodynamically analyzed based on oxygen potentials using the off-gas composition and the bath temperature evolution during the conversion as reference data. © 2017 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute

TI  - Functional characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii Lacking the RNA chaperone Hfq
VL  - 8
AB  - The RNA chaperone Hfq is involved in the riboregulation of diverse genes via small RNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that Hfq contributes to the stress response and the virulence of several pathogens, and the roles of Hfq vary among bacterial species. Here, we attempted to elucidate the role of Hfq in Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978. In the absence of hfq, A. baumannii exhibited retarded cell growth and was highly sensitive to environmental stress, including osmotic and oxidative pressure, pH, and temperature. Compared to the wild-type, the Hfq mutant had reduced outer membrane vesicles secretion and fimbriae production as visualized by atomic force microscopy. The absence of hfq reduced biofilm formation, airway epithelial cell adhesion and invasion, and survival in macrophage. Further, the hfq mutant induced significantly higher IL-8 levels in airway epithelial cells, which would promote bacterial clearance by the host. In addition to results similar to those reported for other bacteria, our findings demonstrate that Hfq is required in the regulation of the iron-acquisition system via downregulating the bauA and basD genes, the stress-related outer membrane proteins carO, A1S_0820, ompA, and nlpE, and the stress-related cytosolic proteins uspA and groEL. Our data indicate that Hfq plays a critical role in environmental adaptation and virulence in A. baumannii by modulating stress responses, surface architectures, and virulence factors. This study is the first to illustrate the functional role of Hfq in A. baumannii. © 2017 Kuo, Chao, Liao, Hsu, Chang, Tung, Chen and Liou.

AB  - A new CMOS bandgap reference which is optimized by adaptive GA(genetic algorithm) is presented in this paper. During the optimization of the parameters, according to the different specifications, the idea which looks on secondary targets as the boundary restrictions is proposed, so that the problem of multi-objective normalization is solved. The secondary optimizing method about "coarse adjusting initially, meticulous adjusting successively" is proposed in the optimization based on adaptive Genetic Algorithm. The simulation results which have reached the leading standard of industry indicate the advantage and validity of the method comparing with other method used in the design of bandgap references. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

VL  - 7
IS  - 10
AB  - Life history theory attempts to account for how organisms lead their lives, balancing the conflicting demands of reproduction and survival. Here, we track the genomic and phenotypic evolution of the bacteriophage virus T7 across a postulated fecundity/longevity constraint. We adapted T7 to a challenging survival environment (6M urea). Our evolved strain displayed a significant improvement in propagule survival, coupled with a significant loss of fecundity (reduced growth rate on host cells). However, the increased resistance to urea did not generalise to increased resistance against temperature stress, highlighting that propagule durability is environment dependent. Previous comparative studies predicted that changes in propagule resistance would be mediated by changes in capsid proteins or gene deletions. In contrast, we found that point mutations in internal core protein genes (6.7 and 16) were responsible for the increased urea resistance of our evolved strain. Prior to the emergence of the 6.7 and 16 mutations, a distinct set of 5-point mutations peaked at over 20% prevalence before attenuating, suggestive of negative epistatic interactions during adaptation. Our results illustrate that parasites can adapt to specific transmission environments, and that this adaptation can impose costs on the subsequent ability to exploit host cells, potentially constraining durable parasites to lower virulence. © 2012 Heineman and Brown.

TI  - Body size in freshwater planktonic crustaceans: An overview of extrinsic determinants and modifying influences of biotic interactions
VL  - 668
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-108
AB  - In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks & Dodson (Science 150:28-35, 1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general, however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey species, which are accordingly often 'size-trapped' between contrasting selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent. Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity, etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions. Complex underlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances. Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified. In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans, contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for further investigation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Seasonal shifts in the life cycle of the ponto-caspian invader Limnomysis benedeni (Crustacea: Mysida): A physiological adaptation?
VL  - 673
IS  - 1
SP  - 193-204
AB  - The mysid Limnomysis benedeni, one of the most important ponto-caspian invaders, was found in Lake Constance (southern Germany) in 2006. As part of larger studies to evaluate the effects of L. benedeni on the ecosystem, we studied its life-cycle strategies over an entire seasonal cycle in intervals of 3-5 weeks, addressing factors (predation, temperature) which we expected to be most important triggers of the observed changes. The size class distribution and the reproductive pattern indicated that the life cycle of L. benedeni changes seasonally. During winter (November to March), the mysid invested energy in growth and delayed reproduction until April, when the population was dominated by adults. In summer (June to September), the adults reproduced at a smaller body size and the population was disproportionately dominated by juveniles. In a mesocosm experiment that excluded fish predators, the mysids followed the same seasonal patterns of growth and energy investment as in the field population, but the size class distribution differed. Even in summer, the population in the mesocosm was dominated by adults. Stomach analyses of fish showed that L. benedeni is preyed upon by juvenile Perca fluviatilis, which fed size selectively on larger mysids. In conclusion, our results suggest predation was the reason for the dominance of juveniles and the observed size class distribution in summer. In contrast, the smaller adults in summer were most likely a physiological adaptation, perhaps evolved to avoid predation or as a reaction on metabolic losses at higher temperatures. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Modeling of steel slab reheating process in a walking beam reheating furnace
VL  - 2
AB  - Slab reheating is a very important step in steel product manufacturing. A small improvement in reheating efficiency can translate into big savings to steel mills in terms of fuel consumption and productivity. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been employed in conducting numerical simulations of the slab reheating furnace operation. However, a full industrial scale three-dimensional (3D) simulation of a slab reheating furnace, while comprehensive, is not an efficient way to conduct broad studies of the slab heating process. In this paper, a comprehensive two-dimensional (2D) numerical heat transfer model for slab reheating in a walking beam furnace was developed using the finite difference method. The 2D heat transfer model utilizes the heat transfer coefficients derived from a 3D reheating furnace CFD model which was validated by using mill instrumented slab trials. The 2D heat transfer model is capable of predicting slab temperature evolutions during the reheating processes based on the real time furnace conditions and steel physical properties. The 2D model was validated by using mill instrumented slab trials and production data. Good agreement between the model predictions and production data was obtained. Copyright © 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Fishery-induced evolution provides insights into adaptive responses of marine species to climate change
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 217-224
AB  - Climate change challenges marine species with seawater that is warmer, with less oxygen and lower pH. To date, most climate-change studies have focused on organisms' acclimation or shifts in distribution; relatively little is known about the capacity of marine species to respond through evolution. We propose that important insights can be gained from recent studies of fishery-induced evolution (FIE), which show that increased adult mortality from fishing leads to rapid changes in growth and reproduction schedules. These changes consistently involve evolution of "faster" life histories: earlier maturation at smaller sizes and shorter life spans. In the ocean, coupled effects of higher temperatures and reduced oxygen also differentially affect larger or older individuals, so expected evolutionary consequences of climate change are qualitatively similar to those of FIE. This general pattern will apply to large numbers of marine species and has important implications for conservation and management. © The Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 44

SP  - 1632-1638
AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) participates in the modulation of the cellular development, differentiation and proliferation in various vertebrate tissues. Therefore, variations in IGF-I gene are good candidates as growth regulators. In this study, a novel 79-bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was identified in 3'-flanking region of IGF-I gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing approaches in common carp Cyprinus carpio. To gain insight into the association of the 79-bp I/D polymorphism with growth-related traits, a total of 747 individuals from Heilongjiang carp Cyprinus cario haematopterus (YL) (n = 263), selective line of German mirror carp Cyprinus carpio L. mirror (JL) (n = 229), and cold-resistance line of Hebao red carp Cyprinus carpio var. wuyuanensis (HL) (n = 255) were genotyped. The DD genotype of the polymorphism was significantly associated with higher body length (135), body weight (325, 385, and 445 days), net weight (445 days) and lower overwintering body loss rate in JL. In addition, in pooled population (YL+JL+HL), fish with DD genotype also showed significantly higher body weight (445 days) and net weight (445 days) than those with II genotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel polymorphism in IGF-I gene could be considered as a potential genetic marker for selection of growth performance in common carp. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Survival of amorphous water ice on centaurs
VL  - 144
IS  - 4
AB  - Centaurs are believed to be Kuiper Belt objects in transition between Jupiter and Neptune before possibly becoming Jupiter family comets. Some indirect observational evidence is consistent with the presence of amorphous water ice in Centaurs. Some of them also display a cometary activity, probably triggered by the crystallization of the amorphous water ice, as suggested by Jewitt and this work. Indeed, we investigate the survival of amorphous water ice against crystallization, using a fully three-dimensional thermal evolution model. Simulations are performed for varying heliocentric distances and obliquities. They suggest that crystallization can be triggered as far as 16AU, though amorphous ice can survive beyond 10AU. The phase transition is an efficient source of outgassing up to 10-12AU, which is broadly consistent with the observations of the active Centaurs. The most extreme case is 167P/CINEOS, which barely crystallizes in our simulations. However, amorphous ice can be preserved inside Centaurs in many heliocentric distance-obliquity combinations, below a ∼5-10m crystallized crust. We also find that outgassing due to crystallization cannot be sustained for a time longer than 10 4-10 4 years, leading to the hypothesis that active Centaurs might have recently suffered from orbital changes. This could be supported by both observations (although limited) and dynamical studies. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The buried and exhumed tapestries of Dorothy Clews and Linda Wallace unearth the transformative power of nature. Her response spawned an ongoing project in which both artists have woven tapestries for the sole purpose of planting, exhuming, and then considering the expressive potential of the partially decayed textiles. The buried wool and linen tapestries contain woven images of seeds. Wallace refers to 'implanting' the tapestries into the soil, and she measures the time they spend in the ground in 'trimesters.' Wallace tended the buried tapestries by monitoring the soil temperature, hours of sunshine, and rainfall. The repetitive nature of couching and the resulting accumulation of small stitches echo Wallace's drawing style, in which layers of fine pencil strokes coalesce to form an image. She compares the accelerated change at the tapestry's edges to the liminal zones between ecosystems, zones known for greater biological productivity and potential for evolutionary transformation.

TI  - Climate Change or Urbanization? Impacts on a Traditional Coffee Production System in East Africa over the Last 80 Years
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Global environmental changes (GEC) such as climate change (CC) and climate variability have serious impacts in the tropics, particularly in Africa. These are compounded by changes in land use/land cover, which in turn are driven mainly by economic and population growth, and urbanization. These factors create a feedback loop, which affects ecosystems and particularly ecosystem services, for example plant-insect interactions, and by consequence agricultural productivity. We studied effects of GEC at a local level, using a traditional coffee production area in greater Nairobi, Kenya. We chose coffee, the most valuable agricultural commodity worldwide, as it generates income for 100 million people, mainly in the developing world. Using the coffee berry borer, the most serious biotic threat to global coffee production, we show how environmental changes and different production systems (shaded and sun-grown coffee) can affect the crop. We combined detailed entomological assessments with historic climate records (from 1929-2011), and spatial and demographic data, to assess GEC's impact on coffee at a local scale. Additionally, we tested the utility of an adaptation strategy that is simple and easy to implement. Our results show that while interactions between CC and migration/urbanization, with its resultant landscape modifications, create a feedback loop whereby agroecosystems such as coffee are adversely affected, bio-diverse shaded coffee proved far more resilient and productive than coffee grown in monoculture, and was significantly less harmed by its insect pest. Thus, a relatively simple strategy such as shading coffee can tremendously improve resilience of agro-ecosystems, providing small-scale farmers in Africa with an easily implemented tool to safeguard their livelihoods in a changing climate. © 2013 Jaramillo et al.

VL  - 62

SP  - 457-U136
AB  - The abiotic conditions of the desert habitat fluctuate in a circadian rhythm of hot days and cold nights. Species living in desert habitats evolved many adaptations to increase their chances of survival. However, abiotic conditions in xerothermic habitats of a temperate climate are much different. Diurnal fluctuations are not as strong, but animals have to cope with seasonal changes and hibernate during the winter, which may potentially influence their adaptations to critical temperature conditions. We attempted to assess heat resistance adaptations using the example of a widely distributed xerothermic ant Formica cinerea. Using Real-Time PCR, we measured the expression of three heat shock protein genes (Hsp60, Hsp75, Hsp90) and assessed the adaptations of F. cinerea to enable foraging in risk prone conditions. The analysis of gene expression using the Generalized Linear Model surprisingly indicated that there was no significant effect of temperature when comparing workers from the control (23 degrees C) with workers foraging on the surface of hot sand (47-54 degrees C). As a next step we tried to estimate the threshold of a thermal resistance with the use of thermal chambers. Expression of all Hsps genes increase compare to the control group, expression of Hsp60 and Hsp90 continued up to 45 degrees C.

TI  - First-Step mutations during adaptation restore the expression of hundreds of genes
VL  - 33
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-39
AB  - The temporal change of phenotypes during the adaptive process remains largely unexplored, as do the genetic changes that affect these phenotypic changes. Here we focused on three mutations that rose to high frequency in the early stages of adaptation within 12 Escherichia coli populations subjected to thermal stress (42°C). All the mutations were in the rpoB gene, which encodes the RNA polymerase beta subunit. For each mutation, we measured the growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) of clones at 42°C. We also compared growth and gene expression with their ancestor under unstressed (37°C) and stressed conditions (42°C). Each of the three mutations changed the expression of hundreds of genes and conferred large fitness advantages, apparently through the restoration of global gene expression from the stressed toward the prestressed state. These three mutations had a similar effect on gene expression as another single mutation in a distinct domain of the rpoB protein. Finally, we compared the phenotypic characteristics of one mutant, I572L, with two high- Temperature adapted clones that have this mutation plus additional background mutations. The background mutations increased fitness, but they did not substantially change gene expression. We conclude that early mutations in a global transcriptional regulator cause extensive changes in gene expression, many ofwhichare likely under positive selection for their effect in restoring the prestress physiology. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary potential of organisms to adapt to a changing climate, and the fitness consequences of temperature fluctuations, are critical to forecasting the future of biodiversity. Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 138C and 308C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 178 of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 88C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 14

SP  - 34-37
AB  - Introduction: Heat stroke is a classic form of hyperthermia, traditionally defined as dysfunction of the central nervous system and core temperature above 40°C. The thermal cytotoxicity caused by excessive and unregulated increase in temperature is responsible for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and coagulopathy, with a consequent risk of multiorgan failure. Clinical case: We present the case of a 13 year-old adolescent with partial seizures in hyperthermia. Investigation revealed positive blood culture for E. coli. CNS infection and pyelonephritis were excluded. The diagnosis of thermal dysregulation was confirmed after watching the first peripheral blood smear performed at the entrance of the ER with viewing the botryoid nuclei characteristic of the excessive rise in body temperature. The evolution was favourable, with no long-term neurological sequelae. Conclusion: The morbidity and mortality associated with heat stroke are inversely proportional to the speed with which it starts cooling. It's vital thinking about this diagnosis at an early stage, with early and appropriate treatment.

VL  - 12

AB  - The design and control of untethered microrobotic agents has drawn a lot of attention in recent years. This technology truly possesses the potential to revolutionize the field of minimally invasive surgery and microassembly. However, miniaturization and reliable actuation of micro-fabricated grippers are still challenging at sub-millimeter scale. In this study, we design, manufacture, characterize, and control four similarly-structured semi-rigid thermore-sponsive micro-grippers. Furthermore, we develop a closed loop-control algorithm to demonstrate and compare the performance of the said grippers when moving in hard-to-reach and unpredictable environments. Finally, we analyze the grasping characteristics of three of the presented designs. Overall, not only does the study demonstrate motion control in unstructured dynamic environments - at velocities up to 3.4, 2.9, 3.3, and 1 body-lengths/s with 980, 750, 250, and 100 μm-sized grippers, respectively - but it also aims to provide quantitative data and considerations to help a targeted design of magnetically-controlled thin micro-grippers. © 2017 Ongaro et al.

TI  - Experimental natural substrate preference of southern king crab Lithodes santolla larvae
VL  - 411
SP  - 70-77
AB  - Notwithstanding the commercial importance of Lithodes santolla in the southern tip of South America, little is known about settlement habitat and behavior of their larvae. Such information is relevant for understanding its life history and for management and development of fishery-stock enhancement programs. The aims of this study were to determine the natural substrata that larval stages, zoeae and megalopa select for recruitment, and the effects of megalopa density and diurnal-nocturnal phase on such selection. Different laboratory experiments with durations of 8 h to 4 weeks were performed in 6-L round containers with their bottoms divided in four equal portions, each filled with sand, gravel, cobble and broken shell as substrata. Containers were kept in a cold room at 7.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C and under 12:12 h light and dark photoperiod. Trials began with the release of larvae of different stages in the center of the containers. After different time periods, proportions of larvae swimming or settled on each substrate were determined. Larvae selected and settled on natural substrata immediately after being placed into the containers. Experiments showed that all larval stages (zoeae and megalopa) preferred complex substrata such as broken shell, cobble and gravel over sand which was rejected. The megalopa selects the substrate even during night period. Selection seems to be density-dependent since at the lowest density broken shell was the preferred substrate. Selection of complex substrata (i.e. mussel beds and/or shell fragments in nature) by all larval stages, even as early as the first zoea stage, provides a cryptic habitat which may reduce mortality by predation and/or cannibalism. Knowledge on habitat preference is useful for fishery management and also for assessing the different habitats in a potential stock enhancement program of southern king crab. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Host allometry influences the evolution of parasite host-generalism: Theory and meta-analysis
VL  - 372
IS  - 1719
AB  - Parasites vary widely in the diversity of hosts they infect: some parasite species are specialists-infecting just a single host species, while others are generalists, capable of infecting many. Understanding the factors that drive parasite host-generalism is of basic biological interest, but also directly relevant to predicting disease emergence in new host species, identifying parasites that are likely to have unidentified additional hosts, and assessing transmission risk. Here, we use mathematical models to investigate how variation in host body size and environmental temperature affect the evolution of parasite host-generalism. We predict that parasites are more likely to evolve a generalist strategy when hosts are large-bodied, when variation in host body size is large, and in cooler environments. We then explore these predictions using a newly updated database of over 20 000 fish-macroparasite associations. Within the database we see some evidence supporting these predictions, but also highlight mismatches between theory and data. By combining these two approaches, we establish a theoretical basis for interpreting empirical data on parasites' host specificity and identify key areas for future work that will help untangle the drivers of parasite host-generalism. This article is part of the themed issue 'Opening the black box: re-examining the ecology and evolution of parasite transmission'.

AB  - Young leaves of Kabuli chickpea as well as soybean Xiangdou No.3, which are the current plants that studied in our laboratory were selected as materials. Effects on protoplasts yield and survival rate of different enzyme combination, concentration of D-Mannitol in enzyme combinations, pH of enzyme combinations and enzymolysis time are detected. The results showed that, the best condition for Xiangdou No.3 leaf protoplasts isolation is to rotate the cut materials for 6 hours in enyzme solution under temperature of 27℃ and rotate speed of 45 r/min for 6 h. Onozuka R-10 (0.5%), Hemicellulase (0.8%), Macerozyme R-10 (0.8%) in combination with Pectolyase Y-23 (0.4%) dissolving in CPW solution with MES (0.1%) and Mannitol (10%), pH 6.0 was found best for protoplasts isolation of Xiangdou No.3 leaves.The best condition for protoplasts isolation of Kabuli chickpea is to put the cut materials into enzymatic hydrolysate enzymolyse for 7 to 8 hours under temperature of 27℃ and rotate speed of 45 r/min on water bath shaker, the optimum combination of enzyme consists of Onozuka R-10 (0.5%), Hemicellulase (0.8%), Macerozyme R-10 (0.8%), MES (0.1%) and Mannitol (10%) dissolved in CPW solution with pH 4.8. The protoplasts prepared with the methods above are used in subcellular location and the effects show well. © 2017, Science Press. All right reserved.

VL  - 13

SP  - 249-256
AB  - Antarctic biota evolved under the influence of a suite of geological and climatic factors, including geographic isolation of the landmass and continental shelves, extremely low temperatures and seasonality. Current warming trends in the continent and surrounding oceans may trigger substantial shifts in community composition and biodiversity, impacting the dominance of cold-adapted over more generalist species. Until recently, the diversity of microorganisms in cold environments was investigated only in terms of distribution, with little attention to their functional roles in important environmental processes. The 'omic' methodologies now offer effective tools to investigate the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and to understand the evolutionary principles of adaptation and tolerance/resistance to extreme conditions. In this review we summarise how cold temperatures affect the physiology of microorganisms and focus on the molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation revealed by recent biochemical and genetic studies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is a cosmopolitan, marine filter feeder, introduced as a laboratory research organism in the 1950s. Currently, it is widely used in many laboratories to investigate a variety of biological questions. Recently, it has become a species of concern, as it is an invasive species in many coastal environments. Here, we review studies on the geographical distribution of the species, sexual and asexual reproduction in the field, tolerance to temperature, salinity and anthropogenic activity, polychromatism, enzymatic polymorphism, and the genetic basis of pigmentation. Studying the relationship between genetic polymorphism and the adaptation of B. schlosseri to environmental stress is a challenge of future research and will improve our understanding of its evolutionary success and invasive potential.

TI  - Microhabitat and body size effects on heat tolerance: Implications for responses to climate change (army ants: Formicidae, Ecitoninae)
VL  - 84
IS  - 5
SP  - 1322-1330
AB  - Models that predict organismal and population responses to climate change may be improved by considering ecological factors that affect species thermal tolerance. Species differences in microhabitat use can expose animals to diverse thermal selective environments at a given site and may cause sympatric species to evolve different thermal tolerances. We tested the hypothesis that species differences in body size and microhabitat use (above- vs. below-ground activity) would correspond to differences in thermal tolerance (maximum critical temperatures: CTmax). Thermal buffering effects of soil can reduce exposure to extreme high temperatures for below-ground active species. We predicted larger-bodied individuals and species would have higher CTmax and that species mean CTmax would covary positively with degree of above-ground activity. We used Neotropical army ants (Formicidae: Ecitoninae) as models. Army ants vary in microhabitat use from largely subterranean to largely above-ground active species and are highly size polymorphic. We collected data on above- and below-ground temperatures in habitats used by army ants to test for microhabitat temperature differences, and we conducted CTmax assays for army ant species with varying degrees of surface activity and with different body sizes within and between species. We then tested whether microhabitat use was associated with species differences in CTmax and whether microhabitat was a better predictor of CTmax than body size for species that overlapped in size. Microhabitat use was a highly significant predictor of species' upper thermal tolerance limits, both for raw data and after accounting for the effects of phylogeny. Below-ground species were more thermally sensitive, with lower maximum critical temperatures (CTmax). The smallest workers within each species were the least heat tolerant, but the magnitude of CTmax change with body size was greater in below-ground species. Species-typical microhabitat was a stronger predictor of CTmax than body size for species that overlapped in size. Compared to the soil surface, 10-cm subsoil was a significantly moderated thermal environment for below-ground army ants, while maximum surface raid temperatures sometimes exceeded CTmax for the most thermally sensitive army ant castes. We conclude sympatric species differences in thermal physiology correspond to microhabitat use. These patterns should be accounted for in models of species and community responses to thermal variation and climate change. © 2015 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Adaptive abilities of the Mediterranean red coral Corallium rubrum in a heterogeneous and changing environment: From population to functional genetics
VL  - 449
SP  - 349-357
AB  - Mediterranean benthic ecosystems have been deeply impacted by thermal anomalies during the last decades. Adaptive capacities for marine species facing climate change can include individual acclimatization (during the individual life-span) and genetic selection (considered at the population level). The Mediterranean red coral, Corallium rubrum, is well suited to study adaptive evolution in heterogeneous environment. This is a sessile species, which inhabits contrasted environments with a strong genetic structure, and differential responses to thermal stress between populations. This study proposes an integrative study of the adaptive response of C. rubrum to thermal stress. To understand the underlying mechanisms of thermal adaptation in this species, we studied three populations of C rubrum from different depths (5 m, 20 m and 40 m depths) and therefore different thermal regimes in the same area. We first surveyed in situ the thermal environment and the corresponding stress levels at the different depths studied here. Then we submitted red coral colonies to different heat shocks in aquaria that mimicked in situ stresses (common garden conditions). We measured the expression levels of several candidate genes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) showed significant differences of expression depending on the depth of origin of the individuals and of their thermal history. Based on a complementary analysis of genetic structure, our study shows the evolution of a differential response at a local scale which might be explained by local adaptation or acclimatization. Our results also underline the trade-off between fitness and potential deleterious consequences linked to heat stress response. It also strongly emphasizes the conservation value of populations living at the edge of the species' range, as they represent an irreplaceable genetic pool for evolutionary rescue.

AB  - The ability of cold-adapted microorganisms (generally referred to as psychrophiles) to survive is the result of molecular evolution and adaptations which, together, counteract the potentially deleterious effects of low kinetic energy environments and the freezing of water. These physiological adaptations are seen at many levels. Against a background of detailed comparative protein structural analyses, the recent surge of psychrophile proteome, genome, metagenome and transcriptome sequence data has triggered a series of sophisticated analyses of changes in global protein composition. These studies have revealed consistent and statistically robust changes in amino acid composition, interpreted as evolutionary mechanisms designed to destabilise protein structures, as well as identifying the presence of novel genes involved in cold adaptation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Epiphyte response to drought and experimental warming in an Andean cloud forest
VL  - 3
AB  - The high diversity and abundance of vascular epiphytes in tropical montane cloud forest is associated with frequent cloud immersion, which is thought to protect plants from drought stress. Increasing temperature and rising cloud bases associated with climate change may increase epiphyte drought stress, leading to species and biomass loss. We tested the hypothesis that warmer and drier conditions associated with a lifting cloud base will lead to increased mortality and/or decreased recruitment of epiphyte ramets, altering species composition in epiphyte mats. By using a reciprocal transplant design, where epiphyte mats were transplanted across an altitudinal gradient of increasing cloud immersion, we differentiated between the effects of warmer and drier conditions from the more general prediction of niche theory that transplanting epiphytes in any direction away from their home elevation should result in reduced performance. Effects differed among species, but effects were generally stronger and more negative for epiphytes in mats transplanted down slope from the highest elevation, into warmer and drier conditions, than for epiphyte mats transplanted from other elevations. In contrast, epiphytes from lower elevations showed greater resistance to drought in all treatments. Epiphyte community composition changed with elevation, but over the timescale of the experiment there were no consistent changes in species composition. Our results suggest some epiphytes may show resistance to climate change depending on the environmental and evolutionary context. In particular, sites where high rainfall makes cloud immersion less important for epiphyte water-balance, or where occasional drought has previously selected for drought-resistant taxa, may be less adversely affected by predicted climate changes. © 2014 Rapp JM and Silman MR.

TI  - A model simulation of the adaptive evolution through mutation of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi based on a published laboratory study
VL  - 3
AB  - We expect the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems to change over this century in response to changes in key ocean variables associated with a changing climate. Organisms with generation times from years to decades have the capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions over a few generations by selecting from existing genotypes/phenotypes, but it is unlikely that evolution through mutation will be a major factor for organisms with generation times of years to decades. However, phytoplankton and other microbes, with generation times of days or less, experience hundreds of generations each year, allowing the possibility for favorable mutations (i.e., those that produce organisms with fitness maxima nearer to the environmental conditions at that time) to dominate existing genotypes and survive in a changing climate. Several laboratories have grown phytoplankton cultures for hundreds to thousands of generations and demonstrated that they have changed genetic makeup. In particular Schluter et al. (2014) grew replicates derived from a single cell of Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophorid with broad geographical and thermal range, for 3 years (similar to 1250 generations) at 15 degrees C, and then for a year at 26.3 degrees C, near their upper thermal limit. During the last year the intrinsic growth rate increased more or less linearly, which the authors attribute to genetic mutation. Here we simulate genetic mutation of a single trait (intrinsic growth rate), both for the control phase and the warm phase of their study. We consider sensitivities to frequency of mutation, changes with temperature in intrinsic growth rate, and use the experimental setup and results to place constraints on the way mutations occur. In particular, all numerical experiments with mutation result in a lag time similar to 30-140 generations before a significant increase in realized growth rate occurs. This lag after a favorable mutation results from the number of generations required for a single favorable mutant cell to reach a significant fraction of the similar to 10(5 )cells in the culture. A numerical experiment that includes a simple plastic response formulation shows that plasticity could remove this lag and yield results more in agreement with those observed in the laboratory study.

AB  - The transition in anthropological and biomedical research methods over the past 50 years, from anthropometric and craniometric measurements to large-scale microarray genetic studies has resulted in continued revision of opinions and ideas relating to the factors and forces that drive human variation. Human Variation: From the Laboratory to the Field brings together the contributions of 22 scientists working in four continents to identify and address challenges imposed by variability. It reviews the way we examine and analyze human variation, paying specific attention to genetics, growth and development, and physiology. In presenting new evidence and findings, it also discusses current developments in methodology and analytical techniques, detailing both field and laboratory approaches, and looking at how the two perspectives complement each other. In bridging that gap between laboratory trials and studies of the human in context, this book covers a number of interesting research areas including - Human adaptation to natural and artificial light, including variations in circadian photosensitivity and effects of light on GI activity Cold tolerance and lifestyle in modern society Genetics of body weight and obesity Human adaptability to emotional and intellectual mental stresses Geography, migration, climate, and environmental plasticity as contributors to human variation Impact of natural environmental stressors including pollution on physiological and morphological processes This book is the latest volume in a series of works from the Society for the Study of Human Biology (SSHB), which for half a century has advanced and promoted research in the biology of human populations in all of its branches including human viability, genetics, human adaptability, and ecology, and evolution. It holds two scientific meetings a year. This volume represents work presented during its most recent gathering. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Global climate change poses a serious threat to the future health of coral reef ecosystems. This calls for management strategies that are focused on maximizing the evolutionary potential of coral reefs. Fundamental to this is an accurate understanding of the spatial genetic structure in dominant reef-building coral species. In this study, we apply a genotyping-by-sequencing approach to investigate genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in a reef-building coral, Pocillopora damicornis, across 10 degrees of latitude and a transition from temperate to tropical waters. We identified strong patterns of differentiation and reduced genetic diversity in high-latitude populations. In addition, genome-wide scans for selection identified a number of outlier loci putatively under directional selection with homology to proteins previously known to be involved in heat tolerance in corals and associated with processes such as photoprotection, protein degradation, and immunity. This study provides genomic evidence for both restricted gene flow and local adaptation in a widely distributed coral species, and highlights the potential vulnerability of leading-edge populations to rapid environmental change as they are locally adapted, reproductively isolated, and have reduced levels of genetic diversity. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - No costs on freeze tolerance in genetically copper adapted earthworm populations (Dendrobaena octaedra)
VL  - 154
IS  - 3
SP  - 204-207
AB  - For nearly three centuries the area around Gusum, in south-east Sweden, has been highly polluted with copper. An earlier study in this area showed that populations of the freeze-tolerant earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra were genetically adapted to copper. Apparently, no life-history costs to reproduction or growth were imposed by this adaptation. In the present paper we therefore investigated how laboratory raised F1-generations of these populations coped when exposed to increased copper concentrations in the soil and to sub-zero temperatures. We found that D. octaedra from polluted sites accumulated the same amount of copper as reference worms. Furthermore, earthworms from polluted sites survived equally to reference worms when exposed to freezing temperatures (-8 or - 12 degrees C). However, when simultaneously exposed to the lowest temperature and copper, the worms from polluted sites survived significantly better than reference worms. The overall conclusion of this study is that worms from polluted sites seem to be better at handling copper and accrue no costs in terms of reduced cold tolerance in connection to genetic adaptation in these populations.

TI  - Vanishing chromosomal inversion clines in drosophila subobscura from Chile: Is behavioral thermoregulation to blame?
VL  - 182
IS  - 2
SP  - 249-259
AB  - Chromosomal inversion clines paralleling the longstanding ones in native Palearctic populations of Drosophila subobscura evolved swiftly after this species invaded the Americas in the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, the new clines did not consistently continue to converge on the Old World baseline. Our recent survey of Chilean populations of D. subobscura shows that inversion clines have faded or even changed sign with latitude. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that this fading of inversion clines might be due to the Bogert effect, namely, that flies' thermoregulatory behavior has eventually compensated for environmental variation in temperature, thus buffering selection on thermal-related traits. We show that latitudinal divergence in thermal preference (Tp) has evolved in Chile for females, with higher-latitude flies having a lower mean Tp. Plastic responses in Tp also lessen latitudinal thermal variation because flies developed at colder temperatures prefer warmer microclimates. Our results are consistent with the idea that active behavioral thermoregulation might buffer environmental variation and reduce the potential effect of thermal selection on other traits as chromosomal arrangements. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - How ants drop out: Ant abundance on tropical mountains
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
AB  - In tropical wet forests, ants are a large proportion of the animal biomass, but the factors determining abundance are not well understood. We characterized ant abundance in the litter layer of 41 mature wet forest sites spread throughout Central America (Chiapas, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) and examined the impact of elevation (as a proxy for temperature) and community species richness. Sites were intentionally chosen to minimize variation in precipitation and seasonality. From sea level to 1500 m ant abundance very gradually declined, community richness declined more rapidly than abundance, and the local frequency of the locally most common species increased. These results suggest that within this elevational zone, density compensation is acting, maintaining high ant abundance as richness declines. In contrast, in sites above 1500 m, ant abundance dropped abruptly to much lower levels. Among these high montane sites, community richness explained much more of the variation in abundance than elevation, and there was no evidence of density compensation. The relative stability of abundance below 1500 m may be caused by opposing effects of temperature on productivity and metabolism. Lower temperatures may decrease productivity and thus the amount of food available for consumers, but slower metabolisms of consumers may allow maintenance of higher biomass at lower resource supply rates. Ant communities at these lower elevations may be highly interactive, the result of continuous habitat presence over geological time. High montane sites may be ephemeral in geological time, resulting in non-interactive communities dominated by historical and stochastic processes. Abundance in these sites may be determined by the number of species that manage to colonize and/or avoid extinction on mountaintops. © 2014 Longino et al.

TI  - A new empirical model incorporating spatial interpolation of meteorological data for the prediction of overheating risks in UK dwellings
VL  - 3
SP  - 3786-3793
AB  - Heat-related morbidity and mortality is anticipated to increase as climatic change induced overheating become increasingly common. The development of building-specific predictive models has the potential to alert occupants and emergency services to the severity of impending risks. This research aims to evaluate the implementation of a newly developed time series model for overheating prediction. Since risk forecasting is contingent upon the accuracy of the model at different future time steps, the sensitivity of model outputs to the uncertainty in the data inputs needs to be understood. Internal and external climatic variables were monitored in an unoccupied domestic dwelling in order to evaluate the empirical model's predictive accuracy. The uncertainty related to the proximity of external weather stations was evaluated using data taken from four nearby weather stations and further bespoke data sets derived by interpolation. The results confirmed the overall accuracy of the newly developed time series predictive model, whilst highlighting the benefits of climatic data interpolation in reducing predictive uncertainties. The empirically derived modelling approach showed a low variance to the actual temperature evolution over a seven-day predictive period, pointing to its validity as a robust model for the prediction of future overheating risks. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.

TI  - Enhancing selective breeding for growth, slaughter traits and overall survival in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
VL  - 372
SP  - 89-96
AB  - Enhancing selection using two-stage selection is normally implemented by pre-selection for tagging weight (BWT) and by final selection for ungutted harvest weight (BWH) and thermal growth coefficient from tagging to harvest (TGC(TH)). However, selection on harvest traits, i.e., gutted weight (GBWH), visceral percentage (VISW%), condition factor (CFH), and overall survival (SURV), can be enhanced by exploiting correlated traits. It can be hypothesized that the efficiency of two-stage selection on genetic response in BWH and TGC(TH) is dependent on their genetic (r(g)) and phenotypic (r(p)) correlations with BWT and therefore dependent on the time point of pre-selection. The aims of this study were, first, to estimate genetic parameters (heritability: h(2), r(p), and r(g)) for BWT (7 months), BWS (weight at sorting, 9 months), BWH (14 months), TGC(TH), GBWH, VISW%, CFH, and SURV. Second, these genetic parameters were used in two deterministic simulation studies; i) one-and two-stage selections to compare genetic responses in BWH and TGC(TH), and ii) alternative selection indices using correlated traits to compare corresponding accuracy of selection (r(IH)) for slaughter traits, CFH, and SURV. Genetic parameters were estimated using an animal mixed model in ASReml on 2,041 fish records. The main results showed that, first, r(g) of BWT was 0.35 with BWH but -0.25 with TGC(TH), whereas the r(g) of BWS was 0.72 with BWH but 0.39 with TGC(TH). Pre-selection for BWS led to genetic response of 54.15 g in BWH which was higher than the genetic response from pre-selection for BWT (51.90 g). Similarly, pre-selection on BWS enhanced correlated genetic response in TGC(TH) to 0.30 g((1/3))/degrees C*day. In contrast, pre-selection for BWT resulted in lower correlated genetic response in TGC(TH) of 0.20 g(1/3)/degrees C*day. It can be concluded that genetic improvement of BWH and TGC(TH) can be enhanced by postponing pre-selection to a later age. However, an optimal time point for tagging and pre-selection should be found to minimize common environmental effects and rearing costs during communal rearing of full-sibs. Second, including GBWH in a selection index can reduce unfavourable selection responses in VISW%. The GBWH is highly genetically correlated with BWH and can be easily indirectly selected. TGC(TH) is a good predictor for selection for lower VISW%, and higher SURV, but not for higher CFH. To control genetic changes in the condition factor, it should be included to the selection index.

AB  - Bacterial protein synthesis is an essential, conserved, and environmentally responsive process. Yet, many of its components and dependencies remain unidentified. To address this gap, we used quantitative synthetic genetic arrays to map functional relationships among >48,000 gene pairs in Escherichia coli under four culture conditions differing in temperature and nutrient availability. The resulting data provide global functional insights into the roles and associations of genes, pathways, and processes important for efficient translation, growth, and environmental adaptation. We predict and independently verify the requirement of unannotated genes for normal translation, including a previously unappreciated role of YhbY in 30S biogenesis. Dynamic changes in the patterns of genetic dependencies across the four growth conditions and data projections onto other species reveal overarching functional and evolutionary pressures impacting the translation system and bacterial fitness, underscoring the utility of systematic screens for investigating protein synthesis, adaptation, and evolution. © 2016 The Author(s)

TI  - The other 96%: Can neglected sources of fitness variation offer new insights into adaptation to global change?
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 267-275
AB  - Mounting research considers whether populations may adapt to global change based on additive genetic variance in fitness. Yet selection acts on phenotypes, not additive genetic variance alone, meaning that persistence and evolutionary potential in the near term, at least, may be influenced by other sources of fitness variation, including nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects. The fitness consequences of these effects, and their environmental sensitivity, are largely unknown. Here, applying a quantitative genetic breeding design to an ecologically important marine tubeworm, we examined nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects on fitness (larval survival) across three thermal environments. We found that these effects are nontrivial and environment dependent, explaining at least 44% of all parentally derived effects on survival at any temperature and 96% of parental effects at the most stressful temperature. Unlike maternal environmental effects, which manifested at the latter temperature only, nonadditive genetic effects were consistently significant and covaried positively across temperatures (i.e., parental combinations that enhanced survival at one temperature also enhanced survival at elevated temperatures). Thus, while nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects have long been neglected because their evolutionary consequences are complex, unpredictable, or seen as transient, we argue that they warrant further attention in a rapidly warming world. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Evolving ecological networks and the emergence of biodiversity patterns across temperature gradients
VL  - 279
IS  - 1731
SP  - 1051-1060
AB  - In ectothermic organisms, it is hypothesized that metabolic rates mediate influences of temperature on the ecological and evolutionary processes governing biodiversity. However, it is unclear how and to what extent the influence of temperature on metabolism scales up to shape large-scale diversity patterns. In order to clarify the roles of temperature and metabolism, new theory is needed. Here, we establish such theory and model eco-evolutionary dynamics of trophic networks along a broad temperature gradient. In the model temperature can influence, via metabolism, resource supply, consumers' vital rates and mutation rate. Mutation causes heritable variation in consumer body size, which diversifies and governs consumer function in the ecological network. The model predicts diversity to increase with temperature if resource supply is temperature-dependent, whereas temperature-dependent consumer vital rates cause diversity to decrease with increasing temperature. When combining both thermal dependencies, a unimodal temperature-diversity pattern evolves, which is reinforced by temperature-dependent mutation rate. Studying coexistence criteria for two consumers showed that these outcomes are owing to temperature effects on mutual invasibility and facilitation. Our theory shows how and why metabolism can influence diversity, generates predictions useful for understanding biodiversity gradients and represents an extendable framework that could include factors such as colonization history and niche conservatism. © 2011 The Royal Society.

TI  - Vitamin E protection in the biochemical adaptation of marine organisms to cold-water environments
VL  - 157
IS  - 2
SP  - 145-158
AB  - Vitamin E is one of the most important lipid-soluble antioxidants to occur in plants and animals for cellular protection against lipid peroxidation. An essential adaptation to low temperature is the elaboration of high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the composition of cellular membranes, which is necessary to maintain functional membrane fluidity. Increasing the content of lipid unsaturation, however, occurs at the expense of enhancing the vulnerability of cellular membranes to oxidative damage. First isolated from salmon eggs, cold-water marine organisms were found to produce, or acquire, a specific vitamin E homologue, named "marine-derived tocopherol" (MDT), having an unusual methylene unsaturation at its isoprenoid-chain terminus. In this overview we compare the antioxidant composition of tropical, temperate and polar fishes, present provisional evidence that MDT is produced at the primary food chain, and provide empirical confirmation that the enhanced reactivity of MDT at low temperature is attributed to its greater rate of diffusion in viscous lipids at low temperatures. This claim of biochemical adaptation is supported by a unique model of diffusion-limited reactivity that mimics changes in the ratio of the MDT/α-tocopherol rate constants at diminishing levels of radical flux in viscous media at low temperature. We offer in conclusion future outlooks to research on antioxidant protection in cold-water ectotherms. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Limited individual phenotypic plasticity in the timing of and investment into egg laying in southern rockhopper penguins under climate change
VL  - 524
SP  - 269-281
AB  - Global climate change requires species to adapt to increasing environmental variability, rising air and ocean temperatures and many other effects, including temperatureassociated phenological shifts. Species may adapt to such rapid changes by microevolutionary processes and/or phenotypic plasticity. The speed of microevolutionary adaptation may critically be enhanced by between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity. However, such betweenindividual differences have rarely been shown, especially for long-lived and migratory species that appear particularly vulnerable to phenological shifts. Southern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome chrysocome are migratory, long-lived seabirds with a 'vulnerable' conservation status. We studied clutch initiation date (CID) and investment into egg mass in individually marked females in response to broad-scale and local climate variables across 7 yr. We thereby distinguished within-individual and between-individual variation and tested the existence of between-individual differences in the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Because of both within-individual and between-individual variation, CID was significantly advanced under high Southern Annular Mode (SAM), reflecting colder environmental conditions and higher food availability. Total clutch mass increased under low local sea surface temperatures (significant withinindividual effect) but was mostly accounted for by female identity. Intra-clutch egg-mass dimorphism was not affected by environmental variables at all. We found no indication of be tween-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity and overall, the expression of phenotypic plasticity appeared to be limited. This raises the question whether between-individual differences in phenotypic plasticity exist in other long-lived species and whether rockhopper penguins show sufficient phenotypic plasticity to adapt to predicted climate changes. © Inter-Research 2015, www.int-res.com.

TI  - Seasonal patterns of body temperature and microhabitat selection in a lacertid lizard
VL  - 77
SP  - 201-206
AB  - In temperate areas, seasonal changes entail a source of environmental variation potentially important for organisms. Temperate ectotherms may be adapted to the seasonal fluctuations in environmental traits. For lizards, behavioural adaptations regarding microhabitat selection could arise to improve thermoregulation during the different seasons. However, little is still known about which traits influence microhabitat selection of lizards and their adaptation to seasonality. Here we used Podarcis guadarramae to study the role of potential intrinsic (body size, sex, age) and environmental traits (air and substrate temperatures, wind speed, and sunlight) in the seasonal changes of body temperatures and microhabitat selection of lizards. We measured body temperatures of lizards in the same habitat during the four seasons and compared the climatic variables of the microhabitats selected by lizards with the mean climatic conditions available in their habitat. Body temperatures were similar for adult males, adult females, and juveniles within each season, being significantly higher in summer than in the other seasons, and in spring than in winter. The same pattern was found regarding substrate and air temperatures of the selected microhabitats. Wind speed and air temperature did not affect body temperatures, while body length was marginally significant and substrate temperatures and season did affect the body temperatures of lizards. Our results during the whole year support the idea that the seasonality could be the most important factor affecting body temperatures of these temperate species. Regarding micro habitat selection, environmental constraints, as environmental temperatures and wind speed, affected the seasonal changes on behavioural thermoregulation of lizards. This effect was similar between sexes and age classes, and was independent of body size. In addition, importance of sunlight exposure of the selected microhabitats (full sun, filtered sun, or shade) also changed between seasons. Hence, environmental constraints were the main forces driving seasonal changes in microhabitat selection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - No effect of environmental heterogeneity on the maintenance of genetic variation in wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 64
IS  - 12
SP  - 3398-3408
AB  - Theory suggests that heterogeneous environments should maintain more genetic variation within populations than homogeneous environments, yet experimental evidence for this effect in quantitative traits has been inconsistent. To examine the effect of heterogeneity on quantitative genetic variation, we maintained replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster under treatments with constant temperatures, temporally variable temperature, or spatially variable temperature with either panmictic or limited migration. Despite observing differences in fitness and divergence in several wing traits between the environments, we did not find any differences in the additive genetic variance for any wing traits among any of the treatments. Although we found an effect of gene flow constraining adaptive divergence between cages in the limited migration treatment, it did not tend to increase within-population genetic variance relative to any of the other treatments. The lack of any clear and repeatable patterns of response to heterogeneous versus homogeneous environments across several empirical studies suggests that a single general mechanism for the maintenance of standing genetic variation is unlikely; rather, the relative importance of putative mechanisms likely varies considerably from one trait and ecological context to another. © 2010 The Author(s).

TI  - Evolution determines how global warming and pesticide exposure will shape predator–prey interactions with vector mosquitoes
VL  - 9
IS  - 6
SP  - 818-830
AB  - How evolution may mitigate the effects of global warming and pesticide exposure on predator–prey interactions is directly relevant for vector control. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we addressed how 4°C warming and exposure to the pesticide endosulfan shape the predation on Culex pipiens mosquitoes by damselfly predators from replicated low- and high-latitude populations. Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - The distribution of intra-genomically variable dinoflagellate symbionts at Lord Howe Island, Australia
VL  - 35
IS  - 2
SP  - 565-576
AB  - The symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals and other marine invertebrates (Symbiodinium) are essential to the development of shallow-water coral reefs. This genus contains considerable genetic diversity and a corresponding range of physiological and ecological traits. Most genetic variation arises through the accumulation of somatic mutations that arise during asexual reproduction. Yet growing evidence suggests that occasional sexual reproductive events also occur within, and perhaps between, Symbiodinium lineages, further contributing to the pool of genetic variation available for evolutionary adaptation. Intra-genomic variation can therefore arise from both sexual and asexual reproductive processes, making it difficult to discern its underlying causes and consequences. We used quantitative PCR targeting the ITS2 locus to estimate proportions of genetically homogeneous symbionts and intra-genomically variable Symbiodinium (IGV Symbiodinium) in the reef-building coral Pocillopora damicornis at Lord Howe Island, Australia. We then sampled colonies through time and at a variety of spatial scales to find out whether the distribution of these symbionts followed patterns consistent with niche partitioning. Estimated ratios of homogeneous to IGV Symbiodinium varied between colonies within sites (metres to tens of metres) and between sites separated by hundreds to thousands of metres, but remained stable within colonies through time. Symbiont ratios followed a temperature gradient, with the local thermal maximum emerging as a negative predictor for the estimated proportional abundance of IGV Symbiodinium. While this pattern may result from fine-scale spatial population structure, it is consistent with an increased susceptibility to thermal stress, suggesting that the evolutionary processes that generate IGV (such as inter-lineage recombination and the accumulation of somatic mutations at the ITS2 locus) may have important implications for the fitness of the symbiont and that of the coral host. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Nrf2 and regulation of the antioxidant system in the Antarctic silverfish, Pleuragramma antarctica: Adaptation to environmental changes of pro-oxidant pressure
VL  - 129
SP  - 1-13
AB  - Despite the key importance of Nrf2-Keap1 in regulating antioxidant system in vertebrates, this system is still poorly investigated in marine species. The present study focused on the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarctica which, during the final phases of embryo development in platelet ice, is challenged by a sudden enhancement of environmental oxidative conditions associated to ice melting. Partial coding sequences were identified for Nrf2, its repressor Keap1 and for typical Nrf2-target antioxidant genes, like catalase, glutathione peroxidase isoform 1 and Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase. Compared to temperate homologues, the protein sequences showed an elevated conservation of amino acids essential for catalytic functions, while a few specific substitutions in non-essential regions may represent a molecular adaptation to improve flexibility and accessibility to active site at cold temperatures. The role of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in modulating the activation of antioxidant defences was demonstrated at both transcriptional and functional levels with a clear temporal increase of antioxidant protection in embryos before the hatching. Such findings confirm the importance of Nrf2 and highlight regulation of antioxidants as an adaptive strategy in P. antarctica to protect the early life stages toward the environmental changes of pro-oxidant pressure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Ras Labs-CASIS-ISS NL experiment for synthetic muscle returned to Earth: Resistance to ionizing radiation
VL  - 10163
AB  - In anticipation of deep space travel, new materials are being explored to assist and relieve humans in dangerous environments, such as high radiation, extreme temperature, and extreme pressure. Ras Labs Synthetic Muscle™-electroactive polymers (EAPs) that contract and expand at low voltages-which mimic the unique gentle-yet-strong nature of human tissue, is a potential asset to manned space travel through protective gear and human assist robotics and for unmanned space exploration through deep space. Gen 3 Synthetic Muscle™ was proven to be resistant to extreme temperatures, and there were indications that these materials would also be radiation resistant. The purpose of the Ras Labs-CASIS-ISS Experiment was to test the radiation resistivity of the third and fourth generation of these EAPs, as well as to make them even more radiation resistant. On Earth, exposure of the Generation 3 and Generation 4 EAPs to a Cs-137 radiation source for 47.8 hours with a total dose of 305.931 kRad of gamma radiation was performed at the US Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) at Princeton University, followed by pH, peroxide, Shore Hardness durometer, and electroactivity testing to determine the inherent radiation resistivity of these contractile EAPs, and to determine whether the EAPs could be made even more radiation resistant through the application of appropriate additives and coatings. The on Earth preliminary tests determined that selected Ras Labs EAPs were not only inherently radiation resistant, but with the appropriate coatings and additives, could be made even more radiation resistant. G-force testing to over 10 G's was performed at US Army's ARDEC Labs, with excellent results, in preparation for space flight to the International Space Station National Laboratory (ISS-NL). Selected samples of Generation 3 and Generation 4 Synthetic Muscle™, with various additives and coatings, were launched to the ISS-NL on April 14, 2015 on the SpaceX CRS-6 payload, and after 1+ year space exposure, returned to Earth on May 11, 2016 on SpaceX CRS-8. The results were very good, with the survival of all flown samples, which compared very well with the ground control samples. The most significant change observed was color change (yellowing) in some of the flown EAP samples, which in polymers can be indicative of accelerated aging. While the Synthetic Muscle Experiment was in orbit on the ISS-NL, photo events occur every 4 to 6 weeks to observe any changes, such as color, in the samples. Both the 32 flown EAP samples and 32 ground control samples were tested for pH, material integrity, durometer, and electroactivity, with very good results. The samples were also analyzed using stereo microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Smart electroactive polymer based materials and actuators promise to transform prostheses and robots, allowing for the treatment, reduction, and prevention of debilitating injury and fatalities, and to further our exploration by land, sea, air, and space. © 2017 SPIE.

TI  - Plasticity results in delayed breeding in a long-distant migrant seabird
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
SP  - 3100-3109
AB  - A major question for conservationists and evolutionary biologists is whether natural populations can adapt to rapid environmental change through micro-evolution or phenotypic plasticity. Making use of 17 years of data from a colony of a long-distant migratory seabird, the common tern (Sterna hirundo), we examined phenotypic plasticity and the evolutionary potential of breeding phenology, a key reproductive trait. We found that laying date was strongly heritable (0.27 ± 0.09) and under significant fecundity selection for earlier laying. Paradoxically, and in contrast to patterns observed in most songbird populations, laying date became delayed over the study period, by about 5 days. The discrepancy between the observed changes and those predicted from selection on laying date was explained by substantial phenotypic plasticity. The plastic response in laying date did not vary significantly among individuals. Exploration of climatic factors showed individual responses to the mean sea surface temperature in Senegal in December prior to breeding: Common terns laid later following warmer winters in Senegal. For each 1°C of warming of the sea surface in Senegal, common terns delayed their laying date in northern Germany by 6.7 days. This suggests that warmer waters provide poorer wintering resources. We therefore found that substantial plastic response to wintering conditions can oppose natural selection, perhaps constraining adaptation. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Determining the migration duration of rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée)) moths using a trajectory analytical approach
VL  - 7
AB  - Many moths finish their long distance migration after consecutive nights, but little is known about migration duration and distance. This information is key to predicting migration pathways and understanding their evolution. Tethered flight experiments have shown that ovarian development of rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis [Guenée]) moths was accelerated and synchronized by flight in the first three nights, whereby most females were then matured for mating and reproduction. Thus, it was supposed that this moth might fly three nights to complete its migration. To test this hypothesis, 9 year's field data for C. medinalis was collected from Nanning, Guangxi Autonomous Region in China. Forward trajectories indicated that most moths arrived at suitable breeding areas after three nights' flight. Thus, for C. medinalis this migration duration and distance was a reasonable adaptation to the geographic distribution of suitable habitat. The development of female moth ovaries after three consecutive night flights appears to be a well-balanced survival strategy for this species to strike between migration and reproduction benefits. Hence, an optimum solution of migration-reproduction trade-offs in energy allocation evolved in response to the natural selection on migration route and physiological traits. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Salinity affects behavioral thermoregulation in a marine decapod crustacean
VL  - 128
SP  - 76-83
AB  - Thermoregulation in aquatic ectotherms is a complex behavioral pattern that is affected by various biotic and abiotic factors with one being salinity. Especially in coastal and estuarine habitats, altering levels of salinity involve osmoregulatory adjustments that affect total energy budgets and may influence behavioral responses towards temperature. To examine the effect of salinity on behavioral thermoregulation in a marine evertebrate ectotherm, we acclimated juvenile and sub-adult common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) to salinities of 10, 20 and 30 PSU and investigated their thermal preference in an annular chamber system using the gravitational method for temperature preference determination. Thermal preference of individual brown shrimp was considerably variable and brown shrimp selected a wide range of temperatures in each level of salinity as well as within individual experimental trials. However, salinity significantly affected thermal preference with the shrimp selecting higher temperatures at 10 and 20 PSU when compared to 30 PSU of salinity. Body size had no effect on thermal selection and did not interact with salinity. Temperature preference differed by sex and male shrimp selected significantly higher temperatures at 10 PSU when compared to females. The results show that salinity strongly affects thermal selection in brown shrimp and confirms the strong interrelation of temperature and salinity on seasonal migratory movements that has been previously derived from observations in the field. In the field, however, it remains unclear whether salinity drives thermal selection or whether changes in temperature modify salinity preference. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 54
SP  - 30-36
AB  - Many soil invertebrates have physiological characteristics in common with freshwater animals and represent an evolutionary transition from aquatic to terrestrial life forms. Their high cuticular permeability and ability to tolerate large modifications of internal osmolality are of particular importance for their cold tolerance. A number of cold region species that spend some or most of their life-time in soil are in more or less intimate contact with soil ice during overwintering. Unless such species have effective barriers against cuticular water-transport, they have only two options for survival: tolerate internal freezing or dehydrate. The risk of internal ice formation may be substantial due to inoculative freezing and many species rely on freeze-tolerance for overwintering. If freezing does not occur, the desiccating power of external ice will cause the animal to dehydrate until vapor pressure equilibrium between body fluids and external ice has been reached. This cold tolerance mechanism is termed cryoprotective dehydration (CPD) and requires that the animal must be able to tolerate substantial dehydration. Even though CPD is essentially a freeze-avoidance strategy the associated physiological traits are more or less the same as those found in freeze tolerant species. The most well-known are accumulation of compatible osmolytes and molecular chaperones reducing or protecting against the stress caused by cellular dehydration. Environmental moisture levels of the habitat are important for which type of cold tolerance is employed, not only in an evolutionary context, but also within a single population. Some species use CPD under relatively dry conditions, but freeze tolerance when soil moisture is high. © 2015.

TI  - Applying the Triangle Method for the parameterization of irrigated areas as input for spatially distributed hydrological modeling - Assessing future drought risk in the Gaza Strip (Palestine)
VL  - 543
SP  - 877-888
AB  - In the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Gaza strip, an increased risk of drought is among the major concerns related to climate change. The impacts of climate change on water availability, drought risk and food security can be assessed by means of hydro-climatological modeling. However, the region is prone to severe observation data scarcity, which limits the potential for robust model parameterization, calibration and validation. In this study, the physically based, spatially distributed hydrological model WaSiM is parameterized and evaluated using satellite imagery to assess hydrological quantities. The Triangle Method estimates actual evapotranspiration (ETR) through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) provided by Landsat TM imagery. So-derived spatially distributed evapotranspiration is then used in two ways: first a subset of the imagery is used to parameterize the irrigation module of WaSiM and second, withheld scenes are applied to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model in the data scarce study area. The results show acceptable overall correlation with the validation scenes (r = 0.53) and an improvement over the usual irrigation parameterization scheme using land use information exclusively. This model setup is then applied for future drought risk assessment in the Gaza Strip using a small ensemble of four regional climate projections for the period 2041-2070. Hydrological modeling reveals an increased risk of drought, assessed with an evapotranspiration index, compared to the reference period 1971-2000. Current irrigation procedures cannot maintain the agricultural productivity under future conditions without adaptation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, we propose a technique for improving clutch durability and the efficiency of the power train system based on our analysis of the torque change occurring at the instant engagement of a wet dual-clutch transmission (DCT) clutch. Experimental conditions studied include the flow-rate volume of the DCT fluid (DCTF) inside the clutch pack, oil temperature, and engagement revolutions per minute (RPM). We compare the optimal oil-flow rate and oil temperature conditions by comparatively analyzing the steady change of torque after delay and the torque-transfer engagement time at high and low speeds. We confirm the varied consequences with respect to the engagement RPM, DCTF flow rate, and temperature. © 2016, FISITA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Egg viability, mating frequency and male mating ability evolve in populations of drosophila melanogaster selected for resistance to cold shock
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
AB  - Background Ability to resist temperature shock is an important component of fitness of insects and other ectotherms. Increased resistance to temperature shock is known to affect life-history traits. Temperature shock is also known to affect reproductive traits such as mating ability and viability of gametes. Therefore selection for increased temperature shock resistance can affect the evolution of reproductive traits. Methods We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. We then investigated the evolution of reproductive behavior along with other components of fitness- larval survivorship, adult mortality, fecundity, egg viability in these populations. Results We found that larval survivorship, adult mortality and fecundity post cold shock were not significantly different between selected and control populations. However, compared to the control populations, the selected populations laid significantly higher percentage of fertile eggs (egg viability) 24 hours post cold shock. The selected populations had higher mating frequency both with and without cold shock. After being subjected to cold shock, males from the selected populations successfully mated with significantly more non-virgin females and sired significantly more progeny compared to control males. Conclusions A number of studies have reported the evolution of survivorship in response to selection for temperature shock resistance. Our results clearly indicate that adaptation to cold shock can involve changes in components of reproductive fitness. Our results haveimportant implications for our understanding of how reproductive behavior can evolve in response to thermal stress. © 2015 Singh et al.

VL  - 5
IS  - 6
SP  - 1-10
AB  - Background: Previously, we have shown there is clinal variation for egg-to-adult developmental time along geographic gradients in Drosophila melanogaster. Further, we also have identified mutations in genes involved in metabolic and neurogenic pathways that affect development time (heterochronic genes). However, we do not know whether these loci affect variation in developmental time in natural populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we constructed second chromosome substitution lines from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from an altitudinal cline, and measured egg-adult development time for each line. We found not only a large amount of genetic variation for developmental time, but also positive associations of the development time with thermal amplitude and altitude. We performed genetic complementation tests using substitution lines with the longest and shortest developmental times and heterochronic mutations. We identified segregating variation for neurogenic and metabolic genes that largely affected the duration of the larval stages but had no impact on the timing of metamorphosis. Conclusions/Significance: Altitudinal clinal variation in developmental time for natural chromosome substitution lines provides a unique opportunity to dissect the response of heterochronic genes to environmental gradients. Ontogenetic stage-specific variation in invected, mastermind, cricklet and CG14591 may affect natural variation in development time and thermal evolution. © 2010 Mensch et al.

VL  - 30

SP  - 1384-1396
AB  - A functional understanding of processes involved in adaptive divergence is one of the awaiting opportunities afforded by high-throughput transcriptomic technologies. Functional analysis of coexpressed genes has succeeded in the biomedical field in identifying key drivers of disease pathways. However, in ecology and evolutionary biology, functional interpretation of transcriptomic data is still limited. Here, we used Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of coexpressed genes in muscle and brain tissue of a lake whitefish backcross progeny. Modules were connected to gradients of known adaptive traits involved in the ecological speciation process between benthic and limnetic ecotypes. Key drivers, that is, hub genes of functional modules related to reproduction, growth, and behavior were identified, and module preservation was assessed in natural populations. Using this approach, we identified modules of coexpressed genes involved in phenotypic divergence and their key drivers, and further identified a module part specifically rewired in the backcross progeny. Functional analysis of transcriptomic data can significantly contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation. Our findings point to bone morphogenetic protein and calcium signaling as common pathways involved in coordinated evolution of trophic behavior, trophic morphology (gill rakers), and reproduction. Results also point to pathways implicating hemoglobins and constitutive stress response (HSP70) governing growth in lake whitefish. © The Author 2013.

TI  - InSTREAM-Gen: Modelling eco-evolutionary dynamics of trout populations under anthropogenic environmental change
VL  - 326
SP  - 36-53
AB  - Current rates of environmental change are exceeding the capacity of many populations to adapt to new conditions and thus avoid demographic collapse and ultimate extinction. In particular, cold-water freshwater fish species are predicted to experience strong selective pressure from climate change and a wide range of interacting anthropogenic stressors in the near future. To implement effective management and conservation measures, it is crucial to quantify the maximum rate of change that cold-water freshwater fish populations can withstand. Here, we present a spatially explicit eco-genetic individual-based model, inSTREAM-Gen, to predict the eco-evolutionary dynamics of stream-dwelling trout under anthropogenic environmental change. The model builds on a well-tested demographic model, which includes submodels of river dynamics, bioenergetics, and adaptive habitat selection, with a new genetic module that allows exploration of genetic and life-history adaptations to new environments. The genetic module models the transmission of two key traits, size at emergence and maturity size threshold. We parameterized the model for a brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) population at the warmest edge of its range to validate it and analyze its sensitivity to parameters under contrasting thermal profiles. To illustrate potential applications of the model, we analyzed the population's demographic and evolutionary dynamics under scenarios of (1) climate change-induced warming, and (2) warming plus flow reduction resulting from climate and land use change, compared to (3) a baseline of no environmental change. The model predicted severe declines in density and biomass under climate warming. These declines were lower than expected at range margins because of evolution towards smaller size at both emergence and maturation compared to the natural evolution under the baseline conditions. Despite stronger evolutionary responses, declining rates were substantially larger under the combined warming and flow reduction scenario, leading to a high probability of population extinction over contemporary time frames. Therefore, adaptive responses could not prevent extinction under high rates of environmental change. Our model demonstrates critical elements of next generation ecological modelling aiming at predictions in a changing world as it accounts for spatial and temporal resource heterogeneity, while merging individual behaviour and bioenergetics with microevolutionary adaptations.

TI  - A temperature sensor clustering method for thermal error modeling of heavy milling machine tools
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - A clustering method is an effective way to select the proper temperature sensor location for thermal error modeling of machine tools. In this paper, a new temperature sensor clustering method is proposed. By analyzing the characteristics of the temperature of the sensors in a heavy floor-type milling machine tool, an indicator involving both the Euclidean distance and the correlation coefficient was proposed to reflect the differences between temperature sensors, and the indicator was expressed by a distance matrix to be used for hierarchical clustering. Then, the weight coefficient in the distance matrix and the number of the clusters (groups) were optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA), and the fitness function of the GA was also rebuilt by establishing the thermal error model at one rotation speed, then deriving its accuracy at two different rotation speeds with a temperature disturbance. Thus, the parameters for clustering, as well as the final selection of the temperature sensors, were derived. Finally, the method proposed in this paper was verified on a machine tool. According to the selected temperature sensors, a thermal error model of the machine tool was established and used to predict the thermal error. The results indicate that the selected temperature sensors can accurately predict thermal error at different rotation speeds, and the proposed temperature sensor clustering method for sensor selection is expected to be used for the thermal error modeling for other machine tools. © 2016 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of Ocean Acidification on Juvenile Red King Crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) and Tanner Crab (Chionoecetes bairdi) Growth, Condition, Calcification, and Survival
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Ocean acidification, a decrease in the pH in marine waters associated with rising atmospheric CO2 levels, is a serious threat to marine ecosystems. In this paper, we determine the effects of long-term exposure to near-future levels of ocean acidification on the growth, condition, calcification, and survival of juvenile red king crabs, Paralithodes camtschaticus, and Tanner crabs, Chionoecetes bairdi. Juveniles were reared in individual containers for nearly 200 days in flowing control (pH 8.0), pH 7.8, and pH 7.5 seawater at ambient temperatures (range 4.4-11.9 degrees C). In both species, survival decreased with pH, with 100% mortality of red king crabs occurring after 95 days in pH 7.5 water. Though the morphology of neither species was affected by acidification, both species grew slower in acidified water. At the end of the experiment, calcium concentration was measured in each crab and the dry mass and condition index of each crab were determined. Ocean acidification did not affect the calcium content of red king crab but did decrease the condition index, while it had the opposite effect on Tanner crabs, decreasing calcium content but leaving the condition index unchanged. This suggests that red king crab may be able to maintain calcification rates, but at a high energetic cost. The decrease in survival and growth of each species is likely to have a serious negative effect on their populations in the absence of evolutionary adaptation or acclimatization over the coming decades.

TI  - Loss of cAMP/CRP regulation confers extreme high hydrostatic pressure resistance in Escherichia coli O157: H7
VL  - 166
IS  - 1
SP  - 65-71
AB  - Application of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) constitutes a valuable non-thermal pasteurization process in modern food conservation. Triggered by our interest in the rapid adaptive evolution towards HHP resistance in the food-borne pathogen E. coli O157:H7 (strain ATCC 43888) that was demonstrated earlier, we used genetic screening to identify specific loci in which a loss-of-function mutation would be sufficient to markedly increase HHP survival. As such, individual loss of RssB (anti RpoS-factor), CRP (catabolite response protein) and CyaA (adenylate cyclase) were each found to confer significant HHP resistance in the 300 MPa range (i.e. > 1,000-fold), and this phenotype invariably coincided with increased resistance against heat as well. In contrast to loss of RssB, however, loss of CRP or CyaA also conferred significantly increased resistance to 600 MPa (i.e. > 10,000-fold), suggesting cAMP/CRP homeostasis to affect extreme HHP resistance independently of increased RpoS activity. Surprisingly, none of the rapidly emerging HHP-resistant mutants of ATCC 43888 that were isolated previously did incur any mutations in rssB, crp or cyaA, indicating that a number of other loci can guide the rapid emergence of HHP resistance in E. coli O157:H7 as well. The inability of spontaneous rssB, crp or cyaA mutants to emerge during selective enrichment under HHP selection likely stems from their decreased competitive fitness during growth. Overall, this study is the first to shed light on the possible genetic strategies supporting the acquisition of HHP resistance in E. coli O157:H7. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Small changes in gene expression of targeted osmoregulatory genes when exposing marine and freshwater threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) to abrupt salinity transfers
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
AB  - Salinity is one of the key factors that affects metabolism, survival and distribution of fish species, as all fish osmoregulate and euryhaline fish maintain osmotic differences between their extracellular fluid and either freshwater or seawater. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a euryhaline species with populations in both marine and freshwater environments, where the physiological and genomic basis for salinity tolerance adaptation is not fully understood. Therefore, our main objective in this study was to investigate gene expression of three targeted osmoregulatory genes (Na+/K+-ATPase (ATPA13), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) and a voltage gated potassium channel gene (KCNH4) and one stress related heat shock protein gene (HSP70)) in gill tissue from marine and freshwater populations when exposed to non-native salinity for periods ranging from five minutes to three weeks. Overall, the targeted genes showed highly plastic expression profiles, in addition the expression of ATP1A3 was slightly higher in saltwater adapted fish and KCNH4 and HSP70 had slightly higher expression in freshwater. As no pronounced changes were observed in the expression profiles of the targeted genes, this indicates that the osmoregulatory apparatuses of both the marine and landlocked freshwater stickleback population have not been environmentally canalized, but are able to respond plastically to abrupt salinity challenges. © 2014 Taugbøl et al.

TI  - The stress of protein misfolding: From single cells to multicellular organisms
VL  - 3
IS  - 6
SP  - 1-18
AB  - Organisms survive changes in the environment by altering their rates of metabolism growth and reproduction. At the same time the system must ensure the stability and functionality of its macromolecules. Fluctuations in the environment are sensed by highly conserved stress responses and homeostatic mechanisms and of these the heat shock response (HSR) represents an essential response to acute and chronic proteotoxic damage. However unlike the strategies employed to maintain the integrity of the genome protection of the proteome must be tailored to accommodate the normal flux of nonnative proteins and the differences in protein composition between cells and among individuals. Moreover adult cells are likely to have significant differences in the rates of synthesis and clearance that are influenced by intrinsic errors in protein expression genetic polymorphisms and fluctuations in physiological and environmental conditions. Here we will address how protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is achieved at the level of the cell and organism and how the threshold of the stress response is set to detect and combat protein misfolding. For metazoans the requirement for coordinated function and growth imposes additional constraints on the detection signaling and response to misfolding and requires that the HSR is integrated into various aspects of organismal physiology such as lifespan. This is achieved by hierarchical regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) by the metabolic state of the cell and centralized neuronal control that could allow optimal resource allocation between cells and tissues. We will examine how protein folding quality control mechanisms in individual cells may be integrated into a multicellular level of control and further even custom-designed to support individual variability and impose additional constraints on evolutionary adaptation. © 2011 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - Surviving chytridiomycosis: Differential anti-Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis activity in bacterial isolates from three lowland species of Atelopus
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
AB  - In the Neotropics, almost every species of the stream-dwelling harlequin toads (genus Atelopus) have experienced catastrophic declines. The persistence of lowland species of Atelopus could be explained by the lower growth rate of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) at temperatures above 25°C. We tested the complementary hypothesis that the toads' skin bacterial microbiota acts as a protective barrier against the pathogen, perhaps delaying or impeding the symptomatic phase of chytridiomycosis. We isolated 148 cultivable bacterial strains from three lowland Atelopus species and quantified the anti-Bd activity through antagonism assays. Twenty-six percent (38 strains representing 12 species) of the bacteria inhibited Bd growth and just two of them were shared among the toad species sampled in different localities. Interestingly, the strongest anti-Bd activity was measured in bacteria isolated from A. elegans, the only species that tested positive for the pathogen. The cutaneous bacterial microbiota is thus likely a fitness-enhancing trait that may (adaptation) or not (exaptation) have appeared because of natural selection mediated by chytridiomycosis. Our findings reveal bacterial strains for development of local probiotic treatments against chytridiomycosis and also shed light on the mechanisms behind the frog-bacteria-pathogen interaction.

VL  - 130

SP  - 559-571
AB  - The southern part of northeast China has experienced a marked warming and drying climate. We provide dendrochronological evidence for atmospheric CO2 fertilization and the impacts of warming on Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) growth. The results of this study show that increased temperature has a negative effect on pine growth during a major part of the growing season and a weakly positive effects on growth during the remaining portion of the year. The monthly temperatures explain ca. 20 % of the total variance in the annual radial growth of Chinese pine from 1901 to 2009. An increase of approximately 3–5 °C is the maximum that Chinese pine can tolerate in this region with an annual rainfall of 500–700 mm. Our results suggest a that there is a proportional response to warming only up to a maximum of 1 °C warming, and indicate the complexitiesof succession in forest ecosystems in terms of adaptation and evolution in local pine populations under a rapid warming condition. In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations have a positive effect on tree growth. This effect can be detected with conventional dendrochronological methods. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Local adaptation of a Drosophila parasitoid: Habitat-specific differences in thermal reaction norms
VL  - 26
IS  - 5
SP  - 1108-1116
AB  - Local climate is an important source of selection on thermal reaction norms that has been well investigated in cline studies, where populations sampled along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients are compared. Several biotic factors vary with climate, but are rarely integrated as alternative agents of selection to climatic factors. We tested the hypothesis that habitat may select for thermal reaction norms and magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in a drosophila parasitoid, independently of the climate of origin. We sampled populations of Leptopilina boulardi, a Drosophila parasitoid in two different habitats, orchards and forests. Orchards offer laying opportunities over small distances for parasitoids, with a low variability in the number of hosts per patch, while forests offer more dispersed and more variable patches. The sampling was realized in a temperate and a Mediterranean climate. We measured egg load, volume of eggs, longevity and lipid content for parasitoids reared at two temperatures. Reaction norms were opposite for populations from forests and orchards for investment in reproduction, independently of the climate of origin. The maximal investment of resources in reproduction occurred at the lower temperature in orchards and the higher temperature in forests. Host distribution differences between habitats may explain these opposite reaction norms. We also observed a flatter reaction norm for egg load in forests than in orchards. This relative canalization may have been selected in response to the higher variability in laying opportunities observed in forests. Our results demonstrate the potential role of resource distribution in evolution of thermal plasticity. © 2013 The Authors. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 23

SP  - 307-317
AB  - Predicting the impacts of climate change requires knowledge of the potential to adapt to rising temperatures, which is unknown for most species. Adaptive potential may be especially important in tropical species that have narrow thermal ranges and live close to their thermal optimum. We used the animal model to estimate heritability, genotype by environment interactions and nongenetic maternal components of phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits in the coral reef damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus. Offspring of wild-caught breeding pairs were reared for two generations at current-day and two elevated temperature treatments (+1.5 and +3.0 °C) consistent with climate change projections. Length, weight, body condition and metabolic traits (resting and maximum metabolic rate and net aerobic scope) were measured at four stages of juvenile development. Additive genetic variation was low for length and weight at 0 and 15 days posthatching (dph), but increased significantly at 30 dph. By contrast, nongenetic maternal effects on length, weight and body condition were high at 0 and 15 dph and became weaker at 30 dph. Metabolic traits, including net aerobic scope, exhibited high heritability at 90 dph. Furthermore, significant genotype x environment interactions indicated potential for adaptation of maximum metabolic rate and net aerobic scope at higher temperatures. Net aerobic scope was negatively correlated with weight, indicating that any adaptation of metabolic traits at higher temperatures could be accompanied by a reduction in body size. Finally, estimated breeding values for metabolic traits in F2 offspring were significantly affected by the parental rearing environment. Breeding values at higher temperatures were highest for transgenerationally acclimated fish, suggesting a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in adaptive responses of metabolic traits. These results indicate a high potential for adaptation of aerobic scope to higher temperatures, which could enable reef fish populations to maintain their performance as ocean temperatures rise. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Reptiles with small body size and high surface-to-volume ratios face challenges in thermoregulation and water balance because they rapidly exchange heat and lose moisture via evaporation to the environment. The purpose of this study is to determine the thermoregulatory mode of the skink Scincella lateralis in the field, as well as how temperature and season influence metabolism and water balance in this species. I measured field body temperatures (Tbf) and environmental temperatures during May to December 2012. I measured selected substrate temperatures in laboratory thermal gradients. For both summer and winter acclimatized skinks, I measured oxygen consumption at 24, 28, 32 and 36 °C. In the laboratory, I measured rates of heating and cooling in dry or humid air to determine the influence of evaporative cooling on heat exchange. I measured evaporative water loss at 28, 32 and 36 °C. In the field, skinks thermoregulated more effectively during autumn/winter (de - db = 9.0) than spring/summer (de - db =2.1), yet maintained similar average body temperatures between seasons (Tb autumn/winter: 28.0 °C vs. Tb spring/summer: 29.2 °C). Metabolic rates of summer and winter acclimatized skinks measured in the laboratory were temperature insensitive between 28–33 °C (Q10 ≈ 1), corresponding to the skink’s preferred temperature range. Metabolic rates were approximately twice as high during summer than winter indicating no seasonal acclimatory increase in metabolic rate. Heating and cooling rates in dry versus humid air indicated that skinks heated more slowly than they cooled in dry air, whereas heating and cooling rates were similar in humid air. Results of the study suggests that distribution and activity of skinks may depend on availability of microenvironments with suitable temperature and moisture conditions, which permit skinks to maintain body temperature and water balance within preferred ranges. © 2014.

AB  - To understand why organisms function the way that they do, we must understand how evolution shapes physiology. This requires knowledge of how selection acts on physiological traits in nature. Selection studies in the wild allow us to determine how variation in physiology causes variation in fitness, revealing how evolution molds physiology over evolutionary time. Manipulating phenotypes experimentally in a selection study shifts the distribution of trait variation in a population to better explore potential constraints and the adaptive value of physiological traits. There is a large database of selection studies in the wild on a variety of traits, but very few of those are physiological traits. Nevertheless, data available so far suggest that physiological traits, including metabolic rate, thermal physiology, whole-organism performance, and hormone levels, are commonly subjected to directional selection in nature, with stabilizing and disruptive selection less common than predicted if physiological traits are optimized to an environment. Selection studies on manipulated phenotypes, including circulating testosterone and glucocorticoid levels, reinforce this notion, but reveal that trade-offs between survival and reproduction or correlational selection can constrain the evolution of physiology. More studies of selection on physiological traits in nature that quantify multiple traits are necessary to better determine the manner in which physiological traits evolve and whether different types of traits (dynamic performance vs. regulatory) evolve differently.

TI  - Selection experiments to alter the sex ratio in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by means of temperature treatment
VL  - 306
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-67
AB  - A selection experiment in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was initiated to verify if the proportion of females after temperature treatment could be significantly altered by selection. Rainbow trout spawners out of six populations were used to produce a diallel cross in which all populations were used as male as well as female parents. The 95 families of this breeding base were tested for their temperature sensitivity as follows. After an incubation period of 42 days, alevins of each family were subdivided into a treatment group and a full sib control group (12 degrees C), each consisting of 300 fish. Temperature treatments were carried out with 18 degrees C for 30 days. Each treatment and corresponding control group was raised separately until an age of 9 months post fertilization. Then a random sample of 10 fingerlings out of each control group was kept for later selection decisions. All other fish from the treatment and control groups were sexed by microscopic inspection of gonad squashes. The families were ranked according to the percentage of females, and families with the highest (n = 6) and lowest percentage of females (n = 6) in their sex ratios after temperature treatment were selected to produce two divergent lines (high and low line). After one generation of selection the temperature-treated groups in the high line showed a female percentage of 58%. whereas the low line had an average female proportion of 44%. The realized heritability was 0.63 in the high and 0.71 in the low line. This study provides the first evidence that the sex ratios in temperature-treated groups of rainbow trout can be selected as a quantitative trait. Additionally, in the meiotic gynogenetic offspring derived from a female spawner, which showed low percentages of females after temperature treatment in previous matings, 16% males were observed in the temperature-treated group. Thus, there seem to be two possible consumer- and environment-friendly ways to increase significantly the proportion of females in rainbow trout: directly via selection of families which show a high percentage of females in their sex ratios after temperature treatment to build up a corresponding temperature sensitive line or indirectly via neo-males derived from temperature treatments of gynogenetic offspring.

AB  - The life history traits of blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius, 1775) was studied under semi-controlled laboratory conditions at 29.14°C temperature, 72.53% relative humidity, and 12-h photoperiod. The raw data were analyzed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table, considering the development rates among individuals of both sexes. Cochliomyia macellaria survival rate was 0.43 (♂) and 0.40 (♀), while life expectancy was 17.9 (♂) and 20.9 (♀) days, for adult males and females, respectively. The total fecundity was 681.15 eggs/female, with an average of 3.65 batches/female and 199 eggs/batch. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.327 days−1, the finite rate of population increase (λ) was 3.35 days−1, the mean generation time (T) was 17.15 days, and the net reproduction rate (R0) was 272.46 offspring/individual. The population parameters found here corroborates that C. macellaria population act as a r selected species under laboratory conditions. Additionally, development data and accumulated degree days (ADD) for each stage of C. macellaria are provided and its implications for the forensic use are discussed. © 2017, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

TI  - Ecological novelty by hybridization: Experimental evidence for increased thermal tolerance by transgressive segregation in tigriopus californicus
VL  - 68
IS  - 1
SP  - 204-215
AB  - Early generations of hybrids can express both genetic incompatibilities and phenotypic novelty. Insights into whether these conflicting interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic selection persist after a few generations of recombination require experimental studies. To address this question, we use interpopulation crosses and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the copepod Tigriopus californicus, and focus on two traits that are relevant for the diversification of this species: survivorship during development and tolerance to thermal stress. Experimental crosses between two population pairs show that most RILs between two heat-tolerant populations show enhanced tolerance to temperatures that are lethal to the respective parentals, whereas RILs between a heat-tolerant and a heat-sensitive population are intermediate. Although interpopulation crosses are affected by intrinsic selection at early generational hybrids, most of the sampled F9 RILs have recovered fitness to the level of their parentals. Together, these results suggest that a few generations of recombination allows for an independent segregation of the genes underlying thermal tolerance and cytonuclear incompatibilities, permitting certain recombinant lineages to survive in niches previously unused by parental taxa (i.e., warmer thermal environments) without incurring intrinsic selection. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - The Western honeybees Apis mellifera carnica and A. m. ligustica are closely related subspecies living in neighbouring regions. Metabolism and the upper lethal thermal limits are crucial physiological traits, adapted in the evolutionary process to environment and climate conditions. We investigated whether samples from these two ecotypes differ in these traits. The standard metabolic rate was higher in the A. m. ligustica population only at a high temperature (T (a) similar to 40 A degrees C; dVCO(2) = 12 nl s(-1); P < 0.05), probably due to a higher body temperature (dT(thorax) = 1.5 A degrees C; P < 0.01). The critical thermal maximum of activity and respiration was similar (difference activity CTmax = 0.8 A degrees C, respiratory CTmax = 1.1 A degrees C). The lethal temperature (LT50, 8h) revealed higher tolerance and survival rates of the Ligustica bees (Carnica 50.3 A degrees C; Ligustica 51.7 A degrees C; P < 0.02). Results reveal the adaptation of the two subspecies to their historic climate conditions, possibly favouring Ligustica in a warming environment.

TI  - Temperature effect on microalgae: A crucial factor for outdoor production
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SP  - 153-164
AB  - High rate outdoor production units of microalgae can undergo temperature fluctuations. Seasonal temperature variations as well as more rapid daily fluctuations are liable to modify the growth conditions of microalgae and hence affect production efficiency. The effect of elevated temperatures, above optimal growth temperatures, on growth is seldom reported in literature, but often described as more deleterious than low temperatures. Depending on the species, different strategies are deployed to counteract the effect of above optimal temperatures such as energy re-balancing and cell shrinking. Moreover, long term adaptation of certain species over generation cycles has also been proven efficient to increase optimal temperatures. Physical models coupled to biological kinetics are able to predict the evolution of temperature in the growth media and its effect on the growth rate, highlighting the downstream drastic economic and environmental impacts. Regarding the relative elasticity of microalgae towards temperature issues, cell mortality can depend on species or adapted species and in certain cases can be attenuated. These elements can complement existing models and help visualize the effective impacts of temperature on outdoor cultures. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Plastic Responses to Temperature Versus Local Adaptation at the Cold Extreme of the Climate Gradient
VL  - 42
IS  - 4
SP  - 473-482
AB  - Climate is a strong selection agent at high elevations, but experimental examinations of how animals exclusive of highlands cope with its variation are scarce. We analysed temperature-induced variation of early ontogenetic traits in the alpine grasshopper Chorthippus cazurroi, and compared populations from the elevational extremes of the species distribution under laboratory conditions spanning natural temperature ranges. Neither elevation of origin, nor different growing temperatures, had a direct effect on nymph body size, but both factors contributed to size at hatching indirectly, via their effect on the duration of embryo development. Large emerging nymphs had a consistently greater survival, although small and fast-developing nymphs from highlands also performed well at low temperatures. Viability selection favoured fast-developing phenotypes in conditions in which plasticity delayed development, in a typical countergradient pattern. Growth in the successive stage did not compensate for slow development at hatching, thus responses at this early stage have potential long-lasting consequences. Although phenotypic selection during early development certifies the strength of selection imposed by cold temperatures in the laboratory, elevation clines of body size did not emerge in either nymphs or the wild parental generation. Differentiation in the wild may be levelled out by fecundity selection for large sizes, drift and gene flow resulting from the fragmentation and proximity of populations, or by micro-climatic differences that reduce the likelihood of directional selection. There is therefore potential for local adaptation to temperature, but a series of conditions typical of alpine environments and ectotherms may impair, confound or constrain full differentiation along the gradient. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Complex patterns of local adaptation in heat tolerance in Drosophila simulans from eastern Australia
VL  - 25
IS  - 9
SP  - 1765-1778
AB  - Latitudinal clines are considered a powerful means of investigating evolutionary responses to climatic selection in nature. However, most clinal studies of climatic adaptation in Drosophila have involved species that contain cosmopolitan inversion polymorphisms that show clinal patterns themselves, making it difficult to determine whether the traits or inversions are under selection. Further, although climatic selection is unlikely to act on only one life stage in metamorphic organisms, a few studies have examined clinal patterns across life stages. Finally, clinal patterns of heat tolerance may also depend on the assay used. To unravel these potentially confounding effects on clinal patterns of thermal tolerance, we examined adult and larval heat tolerance traits in populations of Drosophila simulans from eastern Australia using static and dynamic (ramping 0.06 °C min-1) assays. We also used microsatellites markers to clarify whether demographic factors or selection are responsible for population differentiation along clines. Significant cubic clinal patterns were observed for adult static basal, hardened and dynamic heat knockdown time and static basal heat survival in larvae. In contrast, static, hardened larval heat survival increased linearly with latitude whereas no clinal association was found for larval ramping survival. Significant associations between adult and larval traits and climatic variables, and low population differentiation at microsatellite loci, suggest a role for climatic selection, rather than demographic processes, in generating these clinal patterns. Our results suggest that adaptation to thermal stress may be species and life-stage specific, complicating our efforts to understand the evolutionary responses to selection for increasing thermotolerance.

AB  - 4-Hydroxyderricin is a heat labile bioactive chalcone isolated from the plant Angelica keiskei. It received attention due to its antibiotic potency against several strains of bacteria including pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus. Despite these promising pharmacological properties, the exact mode of action or the biological targets are still unknown. Here we report the synthesis and the application of a 4-hydroxyderricin probe for activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) in S. aureus. Due to the heat sensitivity of the natural product we utilize a chemical tool for the mild and selective enrichment of labile probe-protein conjugates and report seryl-tRNA synthetase (STS) to be covalently modified by our probe. This modification results in inhibition of the amino acylation of tRNAs catalyzed by S. aureus STS which is an essential enzymatic pathway for bacterial viability. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Assessment of heat shock and laboratory virus challenges to selectively breed for ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) resistance in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 469
SP  - 50-58
AB  - Mass mortalities of juvenile Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in aquaculture operations have been linked to the ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1) or its variants. This oyster has heritable resilience to the virus which can provide a basis for selective breeding for higher OsHV-1 resistance, however, controlled challenge methods for improving selection response towards increased OsHV-1 resistance are required. The objective of this studywas to compare the survival of sibling juvenile oysters exposed to either a laboratory virus challenge or a heat shock challenge (as proxy for the virus challenge) and the survival of the same families on two oyster farms where they were exposed to natural field conditions including the presence of OsHV-1. A strong correlation between the family rankings was observed for the two farm sites. Estimated narrow sense heritabilities (h(2)) on the underlying liability scale were 0.38 (on-farm survival), 0.45 (laboratory virus challenge survival) and 0.15 (heat shock challenge survival). Only on-farm survival and laboratory virus challenge had a high genetic correlation. The method for measuring heat shock resistance in juvenile oysters produced high variability in survival among families but low estimates of heritability. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the laboratory virus challenge is a simple and relatively effective tool for selective breeding specifically towards OsHV-1 resistance or as part of a controlled multi-trait program. Statement of relevance: The OsHV-1 virus is a serious problem for commercial aquaculture of Pacific oysters in numerous countries. This paper tests two ways of evaluating oysters for resistance to OsHV-1 that can be incorporated into selective breeding programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Coping with temperature at the warm edge - patterns of thermal adaptation in the microbial eukaryote paramecium caudatum
VL  - 7
IS  - 3
AB  - Background: Ectothermic organisms are thought to be severely affected by global warming since their physiological performance is directly dependent on temperature. Latitudinal and temporal variations in mean temperatures force ectotherms to adapt to these complex environmental conditions. Studies investigating current patterns of thermal adaptation among populations of different latitudes allow a prediction of the potential impact of prospective increases in environmental temperatures on their fitness. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, temperature reaction norms were ascertained among 18 genetically defined, natural clones of the microbial eukaryote Paramecium caudatum. These different clones have been isolated from 12 freshwater habitats along a latitudinal transect in Europe and from 3 tropical habitats (Indonesia). The sensitivity to increasing temperatures was estimated through the analysis of clone specific thermal tolerances and by relating those to current and predicted temperature data of their natural habitats. All investigated European clones seem to be thermal generalists with a broad thermal tolerance and similar optimum temperatures. The weak or missing co-variation of thermal tolerance with latitude does not imply local adaptation to thermal gradients; it rather suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity among the whole European subpopulation. The tested Indonesian clones appear to be locally adapted to the less variable, tropical temperature regime and show higher tolerance limits, but lower tolerance breadths. Conclusions/Significance: Due to the lack of local temperature adaptation within the European subpopulation, P. caudatum genotypes at the most southern edge of their geographic range seem to suffer from the predicted increase in magnitude and frequency of summer heat waves caused by climate change. © 2012 Krenek et al.

TI  - Patterns of tree species diversity in relation to climatic factors on the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
AB  - Biological diversity can be defined as variability among living organisms from all sources, including terrestrial organisms, marine and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes which they are part of. This includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. Numerous diversity indices combine richness and evenness in a single expression, and several climate-based explanations have been proposed to explain broad-scale diversity patterns. However, climate-based water-energy dynamics appears to be an essential factor that determines patterns of diversity. The Mexican Sierra Madre Occidental occupies an area of about 29 million hectares and is located between the Neotropical and Holarctic ecozones. It shelters a high diversity of flora, including 24 different species of Pinus (ca. 22% on the whole), 54 species of Quercus (ca. 9-14%), 7 species of Arbutus (ca. 50%) and many other trees species. The objectives of this study were to model how tree species diversity is related to climatic and geographic factors and stand density and to test the Metabolic Theory, Productivity-Diversity Hypothesis, Physiological Tolerance Hypothesis, Mid-Domain Effect, and the Water-Energy Dynamic Theory on the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango. The results supported the Productivity-Diversity Hypothesis, Physiological Tolerance Hypothesis and Water-Energy Dynamic Theory, but not the Mid-Domain Effect or Metabolic Theory. The annual aridity index was the variable most closely related to the diversity indices analyzed. Contemporary climate was found to have moderate to strong effects on the minimum, median and maximum tree species diversity. Because water-energy dynamics provided a satisfactory explanation for the patterns of minimum, median and maximum diversity, an understanding of this factor is critical to future biodiversity research. Quantile regression of the data showed that the three diversity parameters of tree species are generally higher in cold, humid temperate climates than in dry, hot climates. © 2014 Silva-Flores et al.

TI  - Trade-Offs between Predation Risk and Growth Benefits in the Copepod Eurytemora affinis with Contrasting Pigmentation
VL  - 8
IS  - 8
AB  - Intraspecific variation in body pigmentation is an ecologically and evolutionary important trait; however, the pigmentation related trade-offs in marine zooplankton are poorly understood. We tested the effects of intrapopulation phenotypic variation in the pigmentation of the copepod Eurytemora affinis on predation risk, foraging, growth, metabolic activity and antioxidant capacity. Using pigmented and unpigmented specimens, we compared (1) predation and selectivity by the invertebrate predator Cercopagis pengoi, (2) feeding activity of the copepods measured as grazing rate in experiments and gut fluorescence in situ, (3) metabolic activity assayed as RNA:DNA ratio in both experimental and field-collected copepods, (4) reproductive output estimated as egg ratio in the population, and (5) total antioxidant capacity. Moreover, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) COI gene variation was analysed. The pigmented individuals were at higher predation risk as evidenced by significantly higher predation rate by C. pengoi on pigmented individuals and positive selection by the predator fed pigmented and unpigmented copepods in a mixture. However, the antioxidant capacity, RNA:DNA and egg ratio values were significantly higher in the pigmented copepods, whereas neither feeding rate nor gut fluorescence differed between the pigmented and unpigmented copepods. The phenotypic variation in pigmentation was not associated with any specific mtDNA genotype. Together, these results support the metabolic stimulation hypothesis to explain variation in E. affinis pigmentation, which translates into beneficial increase in growth via enhanced metabolism and antioxidant protective capacity, together with disadvantageous increase in predation risk. We also suggest an alternative mechanism for the metabolic stimulation via elevated antioxidant levels as a primary means of increasing metabolism without the increase in heat absorbance. The observed trade-offs are relevant to evolutionary mechanisms underlying plasticity and adaptation and have the capacity to modify strength of complex trophic interactions. © 2013 Gorokhova et al.

TI  - A systems biology approach to the characterization of stress response in Dermacentor reticulatus tick unfed larvae
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
AB  - Background: Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius, 1794) is distributed in Europe and Asia where it infests and transmits disease-causing pathogens to humans, pets and other domestic and wild animals. However, despite its role as a vector of emerging or re-emerging diseases, very little information is available on the genome, transcriptome and proteome of D. reticulatus. Tick larvae are the first developmental stage to infest hosts, acquire infection and transmit pathogens that are transovarially transmitted and are exposed to extremely stressing conditions. In this study, we used a systems biology approach to get an insight into the mechanisms active in D. reticulatus unfed larvae, with special emphasis on stress response. Principal Findings: The results support the use of paired end RNA sequencing and proteomics informed by transcriptomics (PIT) for the analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data, particularly for organisms such as D. reticulatus with little sequence information available. The results showed that metabolic and cellular processes involved in protein synthesis were the most active in D. reticulatus unfed larvae, suggesting that ticks are very active during this life stage. The stress response was activated in D. reticulatus unfed larvae and a Rickettsia sp. similar to R. raoultii was identified in these ticks. Significance: The activation of stress responses in D. reticulatus unfed larvae likely counteracts the negative effect of temperature and other stress conditions such as Rickettsia infection and favors tick adaptation to environmental conditions to increase tick survival. These results show mechanisms that have evolved in D. reticulatus ticks to survive under stress conditions and suggest that these mechanisms are conserved across hard tick species. Targeting some of these proteins by vaccination may increase tick susceptibility to natural stress conditions, which in turn reduce tick survival and reproduction, thus reducing tick populations and vector capacity for tick-borne pathogens. © 2014 Villar et al.

TI  - Phenology and temperature-dependent development of Ceutorhynchus assimilis, a potential biological control agent for Lepidium draba
VL  - 141
IS  - 3
SP  - 219-230
AB  - Lepidium draba (Brassicaceae) is a major concern for agriculture and biodiversity in the western United States. As current control methods do not provide long-term, sustainable solutions, research has been conducted to find biological control agents. Ceutorhynchus assimilis is one of the currently investigated candidates. Known as oligophagous in the literature, a specialist clade of this root-galling weevil exists in southern Europe. This raised the question of its ability to survive in colder climates in the target range. We investigated the phenology of C. assimilis in the field in southern France (specialist clade) and Romania (generalist clade) and measured various temperature-dependent parameters in the laboratory. In both ranges, weevils were univoltine. Oviposition in autumn started later in France compared to Romania, while mature larvae exited galls (to pupate in the soil) earlier the following year. On average, 25% and 32% of galls from France and Romania were completely below the soil surface, respectively, and this appeared to depend on soil substrate. Weevils transported from France to Romania were able to develop, but at a much lower rate than Romanian weevils. Mortality of overwintering larvae of both clades increased with decreasing temperature and exposure time. At −5°C, lethal times Lt50 and Lt95 were 15 and 42 days for the specialist clade and 26 and 72 days for the generalist clade. A higher proportion of third instar larvae compared to first and second instar larvae survived. Pupation time at different temperatures did not differ between weevils from France or Romania. A climate match model (comparing winter temperatures) indicated that the specialist clade of C. assimilis from France has the potential to establish in some parts of the target range (e.g. Washington, Oregon, California). However, temperature extremes and winters without snow cover will likely limit its establishment unless rapid adaptive evolution takes place. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Thermal performance curves (TPCs) provide a powerful framework for studying the evolution of continuous reaction norms and for testing hypotheses of thermal adaptation. Although featured heavily in comparative studies, the framework has been comparatively underutilized for quantitative genetic tests of thermal adaptation. We assayed the distribution of genetic (co)variance for TPC (locomotor activity) within and among three natural populations of Drosophila serrata and performed replicated tests of two hypotheses of thermal adaptation - that 'hotter is better' and that a generalist-specialist trade-off underpins the evolution of thermal sensitivity. We detected significant genetic variance within, and divergence among, populations. The 'hotter is better' hypothesis was not supported as the genetic correlations between optimal temperature (Topt) and maximum performance (zmax) were consistently negative. A pattern of variation consistent with a generalist-specialist trade-off was detected within populations and divergence among populations indicated that performance curves were narrower and had higher optimal temperatures in the warmer, but less variable tropical population. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Mobile ectothermic animals can control their body temperatures by selecting specific thermal conditions in the environment, but embryos - trapped within an immobile egg and lacking locomotor structures - have been assumed to lack that ability. Falsifying that assumption, our experimental studies show that even early stage turtle embryos move within the egg to exploit small-scale spatial thermal heterogeneity. Behavioral thermoregulation is not restricted to posthatching life and instead may be an important tactic in every life-history stage.

TI  - Fluctuating selection and immigration as determinants of the phenotypic composition of a population
VL  - 173
IS  - 1
SP  - 305-317
AB  - It is important to identify the factors that affect the evolutionary potential of populations to respond to environmental changes. Such processes are for example the ones affecting the amount of heritable phenotypic variation in a population. We examined factors explaining the wide phenotypic variation in the genetically determined black-brown dorsal colouration of male pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during a period of >50 years in a northern European breeding population. We demonstrate that the temperature-dependent relative breeding success of brown males predicts the inter-annual change in the proportion of the brown male phenotype. The proportion of brown males also appears to reflect immigration from Central Europe, where the brown type prevails due to local selection pressure. Warm springs in northern Central Europe had a positive effect on the proportion of the brown phenotype in the north in the early part of the study period, which suggests prolonged migration in favourable conditions. However, the association between warm springs and a high proportion of brown males has weakened from the 1950s to the present, which may explain why the proportion of the brown males in our study area decreased by a third during the period 1954 to 2008. This is likely a result of decreasing population size in Central Europe. These results demonstrate that temporal variation in environmental conditions is maintaining variation in the pied flycatcher male phenotype. They also indicate that climate warming has the potential to change the population composition both through temperature-dependent selection and environmental factors affecting long-distance immigration. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity for wing morph differentiation in insects
VL  - 35
IS  - 12
SP  - 3988-3999
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is a phenomenon in which the same genotype produces entirely different phenotypes in response to changes in the environment, and grants an organism the ability to adapt to environmental variations. Wing polymorphism is commonly observed in insects, including Homoptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Isoptera, Psocoptera, and Dermaptera, as a strategy to tolerate trade-offs between flight capability and fecundity. As a result, it may confer an important adaptive value to the evolution of populations because these winged individuals can migrate long distances and find suitable habitats for development and reproduction of their offspring more easily. At the present time, there is limited knowledge of the mechanisms of wing polymorphism in varying populations. Both genes and the environment are usually considered to affect the developmental outcomes of insect wing morphs. It is easy to understand the contributions of genes to morphology as a consequence of the research of evolution and developmental biology. However, very little is known about the influential mechanism of environmental factors on the development of phenotypes. In fact, it is not yet clear that how the evolutionary shifts of character variation is realized between environmental and genetic control. So far, studies on wing polymorphism are mostly reported on phytophagous insects, very few are known in parasitoids, natural enemies of insect pests. Here we summarized the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity for wing morph differentiation in insects. Both genetic and environmental factors can act on the wing development of insects. The genotypes have significant effects on the determination of insect wing morphs. External environmental conditions such as temperature, photoperiod, food quality, population density, exogenous hormones, etc., also play important roles in regulating the insect wing development, which produce wing polyphenism. In addition, the parasitism or predation of natural enemies may induce alternative variations across transgenerational wing morphs in some insects. The ecological significance of insect wing polymorphism and its functions during their evolutionary process are discussed. Polyphenism is one of the main reasons why insects have become so successful on the earth, and grants them the capability to effectively utilize the same genome in order to best adapt to predictable changes in the environment, such as degradation of survival conditions after overcrowding, by developing into different phenotypes. Wing polyphenism in insects is a clear example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity, which provides a very good model to study alternative phenotypes from both genetic and environmental perspectives. This may also be advantageous to evaluate how environmental and genetic factors jointly control the same developmental events. Further study recommendations were also discussed in this review, as well as the potential utilization of wing morph differentiation mechanisms of parasitic wasps in biological control, e.g., through artificially culturing the winged individuals of parasitoids for field release to improve the dispersal ability of natural enemies. Some critical aspects still need to be investigated further on the mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity for wing morph differentiation in insects. Further development in functional genomics and epigenetics may provide novel opportunities and technological support for revealing the mechanisms of polyphenism in insects completely. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - A total evidence approach to understanding phylogenetic relationships and ecological diversity in Selaginella subg. Tetragonostachys
VL  - 100
IS  - 8
SP  - 1672-1682
AB  - • Premise of the Study: Several members of Selaginella are renowned for their ability to survive extreme drought and "resurrect" when conditions improve. Many of these belong to subgenus Tetragonostachys, a group of ~45 species primarily found in North and Central America, with substantial diversity in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. We evaluated the monophyly and the age of subgenus Tetragonostachys and assess how drought tolerance contributed to the evolution of this clade. • Methods: Our study included most Tetragonostachys species, using plastid and nuclear sequences, fossil and herbarium records, and climate variables to describe the species diversity, phylogenetic relationships, divergence times, and climatic niche evolution in the subgenus. • Key Results: We found that subgenus Tetragonostachys forms a monophyletic group sister to Selaginella lepidophylla and may have diverged from other Selaginella because of a Gondwanan-Laurasian vicariance event ca. 240 mya. The North American radiation of Tetragonostachys appears to be much more recent and to have occurred during the Early Cretaceous-late Paleocene interval. We identifi ed two signifi cant and nested ecological niche shifts during the evolution of Tetragonostachys associated with extreme drought tolerance and a more recent shift to cold climates. Our analyses suggest that drought tolerance evolved in the warm deserts of southwest North America and may have been advantageous for colonization of cold and dry boreal climates. • Conclusions: Our investigation provides a foundation for future research addressing the genomics of ecological niche evolution and the potential role of reticulate evolution in Selaginella subgenus Tetragonostachys.

VL  - 87

AB  - The life and survival of the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi during its adaptation in natural aquatic systems is highly influenced by the availability of nutrients and temperature. To learn about adaptation strategies evolved by this bacterium to cope with drastic temperature downshifts and nutrients depletion, we have studied the phenotypical and gene expression changes occurring in V. harveyi during its adaptation to cold seawater. We found that incubation in cold seawater up to 12 h did not cause any significant morphological changes in V. harveyi and had no effect on the number of viable and culturable cells. Microarray analysis revealed that the V. harveyi response to cold seawater leads to up- and downregulation of numerous genes controlling the central carbon metabolism, nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis as well as DNA repair. In addition, expression of some genes controlling biosynthesis of lipids, molecular transport, and energy production was altered to likely affect the composition and properties of the V. harveyi cell envelope, thus implying the putative role of this compartment in adaptation to stress. Here, we discuss these results with regard to the putative adaptive responses likely triggered by V. harveyi to cope with environmental challenges in natural aquatic systems. © 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

VL  - 26
IS  - 11
SP  - 1238-1246
AB  - Aim: The evolution of key innovations promotes adaptive radiations by opening access to new ecological opportunity. The acquisition of viviparity (live-bearing reproduction) has emerged as one such innovation explaining reptile proliferations into extreme climates. By evolving viviparity, females provide embryos with internally stable environments to complete development. The classical hypothesis suggests that natural selection for viviparity arises from low temperatures in cold climates, which promote prolonged egg retention in the mother's body. An alternative hypothesis proposes that declines in atmospheric oxygen at high elevations create natural selection for embryo retention to provide them with optimal oxygen levels during development. However, although experimental studies support the negative effects of low oxygen on egg development, this ‘hypoxia’ hypothesis has never been tested quantitatively. Here, we compete the hypoxia hypothesis against the ‘cold-climate’ hypothesis, using a highly diverse lizard genus. Location: South America. Major taxa: Liolaemus lizards. Methods: We use a multivariate dataset covering 121 species varying extensively in geographical and climatic distribution (including extreme thermal and oxygen gradients) and parity mode. Based on a new molecular phylogeny for the genus, we use phylogenetic logistic regressions to generate a range of models ranking environmental factors as a function of their effects on parity mode transitions. Results: Elevation and oxygen declines were almost perfectly correlated, and both were identified as the dominant predictors of oviparity-to-viviparity transitions, whereas the role for temperature (dominated by the coldest winter temperatures and daily fluctuations) was significant but secondary. Overall, we showed that oxygen deprivation and low temperatures both play a role in the evolution of viviparity. Main conclusions: Our findings support the role for selection from declines in oxygen concentrations as the primary driver behind viviparity. However, selection arising from cold temperatures and from reduced fluctuations in daily temperatures contributes to the evolution of these transitions by creating multivariate selection on parity mode. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 29

SP  - 1033-1041
AB  - How insects evolve resistance or counter-resistance against antagonists is a basic issue in the study of host-parasitoid coevolution. One of the factors that affect their coevolution is fitness costs of resistance and counter-resistance. Here, we assess fitness costs of resistance against the parasitoid Leptopilina victoriae in Drosophila bipectinata on the basis of selection experiments. We made a base population by mixing three geographic fly populations that differed in resistance. The established base population was divided into four populations, two for selection of resistance against a L. victoriae population and two for control. Resistance increased rapidly in response to selection and reached a very high level within four generations in the selected populations, while resistance of the control populations remained low during 20 generations. High resistance of the selected populations was maintained at least for 10 generations after selection was stopped. Both selected populations had lower female longevity than the control populations, and at least one of the selected populations had shorter thorax length, lower female desiccation tolerance and adult heat tolerance than both or either of the control populations. On the other hand, the selected populations had higher male starvation tolerance and longevity than the control populations. There were no significant differences in resistance against another population of L. victoriae and two other parasitoid species between the selected and control populations. These results suggest that the resistance against the L. victoriae population in D. bipectinata may incur some but not so high costs and act parasitoid-species- and/or parasitoid-population-specifically. © 2014, The Ecological Society of Japan.

SP  - 652-655
AB  - Objective: To study the biological characteristics of cypermethrin-resistance strain and -susceptible strain of Aedes albopictus under different controlled temperatures in the laboratory. Methods: The two strains were raised at three different temperatures, 20, 25°C and 28°C respectively, and the biological characteristics of the two mosquito strains, such as reproduction, development and life expectancy, were observed and recorded in the laboratory. Results: The life expectancy of both strains became shorter as the temperature raised, and the resistant strain (69.37%±0.01%, 77.04%±0.07%) lived shorter than the susceptible strain (85.24%±0.03%, 88.23%±0.05%)in average. Under 25°C, the hatching rate of resistant strain decreased by 25.88%, and the pupation rate decreased by 11.18%. In the three temperatures, all the life expectancy expanded as the temperature went up, the periods for the susceptible strain were 19.75±0.10, 23.65±0.07 d and 25.08±0.08 d under 28, 25°C and 20°C. While life expectancy for the resistant strain decreased to 17.21±0.09, 20.95±0.09, 22.58±0.10 d. Under the same temperature, the development timing of the resistance strain was longer than that of the susceptible strain, and the period was the longest under 28°C(156.2 h, 137.1 h). In the three temperatures, all the development periods expanded as the temperature went up, the susceptible and resistant larvae developed 137.1 d and 163.3 d, 247.7 d and 156.2 d, 182.3 d and 263.2 d under 28, 25°C and 20°C. The differences show statistic significance (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The resistance of A. albopictus to cypermethrin results in the decrease of adaptability to the environment change and the disadvantage of reproduction at different temperatures. © 2014, Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Schistosomiasis Control.

TI  - Microgeographic differentiation in thermal performance curves between rural and urban populations of an aquatic insect
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
SP  - 1067-1075
AB  - The rapidly increasing rate of urbanization has a major impact on the ecology and evolution of species. While increased temperatures are a key aspect of urbanization (“urban heat islands”), we have very limited knowledge whether this generates differentiation in thermal responses between rural and urban populations. In a common garden experiment, we compared the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rate and mortality in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella from three urban and three rural populations. TPCs for growth rate shifted vertically, consistent with the faster–slower theoretical model whereby the cold-adapted rural larvae grew faster than the warm-adapted urban larvae across temperatures. In line with costs of rapid growth, rural larvae showed lower survival than urban larvae across temperatures. The relatively lower temperatures hence expected shorter growing seasons in rural populations compared to the populations in the urban heat islands likely impose stronger time constraints to reach a certain developmental stage before winter, thereby selecting for faster growth rates. In addition, higher predation rates at higher temperature may have contributed to the growth rate differences between urban and rural ponds. A faster–slower differentiation in TPCs may be a widespread pattern along the urbanization gradient. The observed microgeographic differentiation in TPCs supports the view that urbanization may drive life-history evolution. Moreover, because of the urban heat island effect, urban environments have the potential to aid in developing predictions on the impact of climate change on rural populations. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Constant, cycling, hot and cold thermal environments: Strong effects on mean viability but not on genetic estimates
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1209-1215
AB  - It has frequently been suggested that trait heritabilities are environmentally sensitive, and there are genetic trade-offs between tolerating different environments such as hot and cold or constant and fluctuating temperatures. Future climate predictions suggest an increase in both temperatures and their fluctuations. How species will respond to these changes is uncertain, particularly as there is a lack of studies which compare genetic performances in constant vs. fluctuating environments. In this study, we used a nested full-sib/half-sib breeding design to examine how the genetic variances and heritabilities of egg-to-adult viability differ at high and low temperatures with and without daily fluctuations in temperatures using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. Although egg-to-adult viability was clearly sensitive to developmental temperatures, heritabilities were not particularly sensitive to developmental temperatures. Moreover, we found that egg-to-adult viabilities at different developmental temperatures were positively correlated, suggesting a common genetic background for egg-to-adult viability at different temperatures. Finding both a uniform genetic background coupled with rather low heritabilities insensitive to temperatures, our results suggest evolutionary responses are unlikely to be limited by temperature effects on genetic parameters or negative genetic correlations, but by the direct effects of stressful temperatures on egg-to-adult viability accompanied with low heritabilities. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Distribution of CpG motifs in upstream gene domains in a reef coral and sea anemone: Implications for epigenetics in cnidarians
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
AB  - Coral reefs are under aault from streors including global warming, ocean acidification, and urbanization. Knowing how these factors impact the future fate of reefs requires delineating stre responses acro ecological, organismal and cellular scales. Recent advances in coral reef biology have integrated molecular procees with ecological fitne and have identified putative suites of temperature acclimation genes in a Scleractinian coral Acropora hyacinthus.We wondered what unique characteristics of these genes determined their coordinate expreion in response to temperature acclimation, and whether or not other corals and cnidarians would likewise poe these features. Here, we focus on cytosine methylation as an epigenetic DNA modification that is responsive to environmental streors. We identify common conserved patterns of cytosine-guanosine dinucleotide (CpG) motif frequencies in upstream promoter domains of different functional gene groups in two cnidarian genomes: A coral (Acropora digitifera) and an anemone (Nematostella vectensis). Our analyses show that CpG motif frequencies are prominent in the promoter domains of functional genes aociated with environmental adaptation, particularly those identified in A. hyacinthus. Densities of CpG sites in upstream promoter domains near the transcriptional start site (T) are 1.38x higher than genomic background levels upstream of -2000 bp from the T. The increase in CpG usage suggests selection to allow for DNA methylation events to occur more frequently within 1 kb of the T. In addition, observed shifts in CpG densities among functional groups of genes suggests a potential role for epigenetic DNA methylation within promoter domains to impact functional gene expreion responses in A. digitifera and N. vectensis. Identifying promoter epigenetic sequence motifs among genes within specific functional groups establishes an approach to describe integrated cellular responses to environmental stre in reef corals and potential roles of epigenetics on survival and fitne in the face of global climate change. © 2016 Marshet al.

TI  - Role of the Phop-PhoQ gene regulatory system in adaptation of yersinia pestis to environmental stress in the flea digestive tract
VL  - 161

SP  - 1198-1210
AB  - The Yersinia pestis PhoPQ gene regulatory system is induced during infection of the flea digestive tract and is required to produce adherent biofilm in the foregut, which greatly enhances bacterial transmission during a flea bite. To understand the in vivo context of PhoPQ induction and to determine PhoP-regulated targets in the flea, we undertook whole-genome comparative transcriptional profiling of Y. pestis WT and DphoP strains isolated from infected fleas and from temperature-matched in vitro planktonic and flow-cell biofilm cultures. In the absence of PhoP regulation, the gene expression program indicated that the bacteria experienced diverse physiological stresses and were in a metabolically less active state. Multiple stress response genes, including several toxin-antitoxin loci and YhcN family genes responsible for increased acid tolerance, were upregulated in the phoP mutant during flea infection. The data implied that PhoPQ was induced by low pH in the flea gut, and that PhoP modulated physiological adaptation to acid and other stresses encountered during infection of the flea. This adaptive response, together with PhoP-dependent modification of the bacterial outer surface that includes repression of pH 6 antigen fimbriae, supports stable biofilm development in the flea foregut. © 2015.

VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - The Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi, is a tropical species but has increasingly been collected from the subtropics in recent years, making it sympatric to the Formosan subterranean termite, C. formosanus in at least three areas, Taiwan, Hawaii, and Florida. Simultaneous flights by these two species were observed since 2013 in South Florida, during which interspecies tandems were observed. Laboratory mating of C. formosanus and C. gestroi alates produced hybrid incipient colonies of larger population size. Studies are underway to examine the presence in the field of hybrid colonies in sympatric areas of Taiwan and Florida. Other biological characteristics of C. formosanus × C. gestroi hybrids being studied include temperature tolerance and preference, colony growth rate, wood-consumption rate, and reproductive fertility. This current research aims to determine the potential establishment of a hybrid termite population in south Florida and Taiwan. It investigates the risk of introgressive hybridization in field populations, with an emphasis on its potential ecological, evolutionary, and economic consequences. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Depth as an organizing force in Pocillopora damicornis: Intra-reef genetic architecture
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - Relative to terrestrial plants, and despite similarities in life history characteristics, the potential for corals to exhibit intra-reef local adaptation in the form of genetic differentiation along an environmental gradient has received little attention. The potential for natural selection to act on such small scales is likely increased by the ability of coral larval dispersal and settlement to be influenced by environmental cues. Here, we combine genetic, spatial, and environmental data for a single patch reef in K ne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i, USA in a landscape genetics framework to uncover environmental drivers of intra-reef genetic structuring. The genetic dataset consists of near-exhaustive sampling (n = 2352) of the coral, Pocillopora damicornis at our study site and six microsatellite genotypes. In addition, three environmental parameters - depth and two depth-independent temperature indices - were collected on a 4 m grid across 85 locations throughout the reef. We use ordinary kriging to spatially interpolate our environmental data and estimate the three environmental parameters for each colony. Partial Mantel tests indicate a significant correlation between genetic relatedness and depth while controlling for space. These results are also supported by multi-model inference. Furthermore, spatial Principle Component Analysis indicates a statistically significant genetic cline along a depth gradient. Binning the genetic dataset based on size-class revealed that the correlation between genetic relatedness and depth was significant for new recruits and increased for larger size classes, suggesting a possible role of larval habitat selection as well as selective mortality in structuring intra-reef genetic diversity. That both pre-and post-recruitment processes may be involved points to the adaptive role of larval habitat selection in increasing adult survival. The conservation importance of uncovering intra-reef patterns of genetic diversity is discussed. © 2015 Gorospe, Karl.

AB  - The quality of parts produced using powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes viz. electron beam melting mainly depends on the energy source, raster scan pattern, and stress evolution due to concentrated heat addition. In the present work, effort has been made to analyze the relationship between various process parameters such as input power, penetration depth, raster scan hatch spacing, powder porosity and their effects on the temperature profile, stress evolution and re-melt volume, using a three-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the EBAM process on AISI 316L stainless steel, implemented using the COMSOL (R) multiphysics modelling platform. The volume fraction of re-melt material shows a non-linear and non-monotonic dependence on the electron beam size. The results of this study pave way for robust design of the EBAM process from simulation point of view. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Rapid genetic divergence in response to 15 years of simulated climate change
VL  - 21
IS  - 11
SP  - 4165-4176
AB  - Genetic diversity may play an important role in allowing individual species to resist climate change, by permitting evolutionary responses. Our understanding of the potential for such responses to climate change remains limited, and very few experimental tests have been carried out within intact ecosystems. Here, we use amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data to assess genetic divergence and test for signatures of evolutionary change driven by long-term simulated climate change applied to natural grassland at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL). Experimental climate treatments were applied to grassland plots for 15 years using a replicated and spatially blocked design and included warming, drought and precipitation treatments. We detected significant genetic differentiation between climate change treatments and control plots in two coexisting perennial plant study species (Festuca ovina and Plantago lanceolata). Outlier analyses revealed a consistent signature of selection associated with experimental climate treatments at individual AFLP loci in P. lanceolata, but not in F. ovina. Average background differentiation at putatively neutral AFLP loci was close to zero, and genomewide genetic structure was associated neither with species abundance changes (demography) nor with plant community-level responses to long-term climate treatments. Our results demonstrate genetic divergence in response to a suite of climatic environments in reproductively mature populations of two perennial plant species and are consistent with an evolutionary response to climatic selection in P. lanceolata. These genetic changes have occurred in parallel with impacts on plant community structure and may have contributed to the persistence of individual species through 15 years of simulated climate change at BCCIL. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Genomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal adaptation mechanisms of an Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans strain YL15 to alpine acid mine drainage
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans is an acidophile that often occurs in low temperature acid mine drainage, e.g., that located at high altitude. Being able to inhabit the extreme environment, the bacterium must possess strategies to copy with the survival stress. Nonetheless, information on the strategies is in demand. Here, genomic and transcriptomic assays were performed to illuminate the adaptation mechanisms of an A. ferrivorans strain YL15, to the alpine acid mine drainage environment in Yulong copper mine in southwest China. Genomic analysis revealed that strain has a gene repertoire for metal-resistance, e.g., genes coding for the mer operon and a variety of transporters/efflux proteins, and for low pH adaptation, such as genes for hopanoid-synthesis and the sodium:proton antiporter. Genes for various DNA repair enzymes and synthesis of UV-absorbing mycosporine-like amino acids precursor indicated hypothetical UV radiation - resistance mechanisms in strain YL15. In addition, it has two types of the acquired immune system-type III-B and type I-F CRISPR/Cas modules against invasion of foreign genetic elements. RNA-seq based analysis uncovered that strain YL15 uses a set of mechanisms to adapt to low temperature. Genes involved in protein synthesis, transmembrane transport, energy metabolism and chemotaxis showed increased levels of RNA transcripts. Furthermore, a bacterioferritin Dps gene had higher RNA transcript counts at 6°C, possibly implicated in protecting DNA against oxidative stress at low temperature. The study represents the first to comprehensively unveil the adaptation mechanisms of an acidophilic bacterium to the acid mine drainage in alpine regions. © 2017 Peng et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

TI  - Hyperosmotic response of streptococcus mutans: From microscopic physiology to transcriptomic profile
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Abstract. Background: Oral streptococci metabolize carbohydrate to produce organic acids, which not only decrease the environmental pH, but also increase osmolality of dental plaque fluid due to tooth demineralization and consequent calcium and phosphate accumulation. Despite these unfavorable environmental changes, the bacteria continue to thrive. The aim of this study was to obtain a global view on strategies taken by Streptococcus mutans to deal with physiologically relevant elevated osmolality, and perseveres within a cariogenic dental plaque. Results: We investigated phenotypic change of S. mutans biofilm upon hyperosmotic challenge. We found that the hyperosmotic condition was able to initiate S. mutans biofilm dispersal by reducing both microbial content and extracellular polysaccharides matrix. We then used whole-genome microarray with quantitative RT-PCR validation to systemically investigate the underlying molecular machineries of this bacterium in response to the hyperosmotic stimuli. Among those identified 40 deferentially regulated genes, down-regulation of gtfB and comC were believed to be responsible for the observed biofilm dispersal. Further analysis of microarray data showed significant up-regulation of genes and pathways involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Specific genes involved in heat shock response and acid tolerance were also upregulated, indicating potential cross-talk between hyperosmotic and other environmental stress. Conclusions: Hyperosmotic condition induces significant stress response on S. mutans at both phenotypic and transcriptomic levels. In the meantime, it may take full advantage of these environmental stimuli to better fit the fluctuating environments within oral cavity, and thus emerges as numeric-predominant bacterium under cariogenic conditions. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Sequence Polymorphism and Expression Variability of Crassostrea gigas Immune Related Genes Discriminate Two Oyster Lines Contrasted in Term of Resistance to Summer Mortalities
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - Summer mortalities of Crassostrea gigas are a major concern in oyster aquaculture. They are the result of a complex interaction between the host, pathogens and environmental factors. Oyster genetics have been identified as an essential determinant of oyster susceptibility to summer mortalities. As the capability of oysters to circumvent diseases depends in part on their immune defenses, we aimed to analyze the gene expression and sequence polymorphism of 42 immune related genes in two oyster lines selected for their "High" (H) and "Low" (L) survival to summer mortalities. Results showed that the variability of gene expression and the sequence polymorphism acting on particular genes could enable the discrimination between H and L oyster lines. Besides, a higher sequence polymorphism was observed on the L line affecting 11 of the 42 analyzed genes. By analyzing gene expression, sequence polymorphism and gene copy number of two antimicrobial peptide families (Cg-Defs and Cg-Prp), and an antimicrobial protein (Cg-BPI) on individual oysters, we showed that gene expression and/or sequence polymorphism could also discriminate H and L oyster lines. Finally, we observed a positive correlation between the gene expression and the gene copy number of antimicrobials and that sequence polymorphism could be encoded in the genome. Overall, this study gives new insights in the relationship between oyster immunity and divergent phenotypes, and discusses the potential implication of antimicrobial diversity in oyster survival to summer mortalities. © 2013 Schmitt et al.

TI  - Strong gene flow and lack of stable population structure in the face of rapid adaptation to local temperature in a spring-spawning salmonid, the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus)
VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 460-471
AB  - Gene flow has the potential to both constrain and facilitate adaptation to local environmental conditions. The early stages of population divergence can be unstable because of fluctuating levels of gene flow. Investigating temporal variation in gene flow during the initial stages of population divergence can therefore provide insights to the role of gene flow in adaptive evolution. Since the recent colonization of Lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Norway by European grayling (Thymallus thymallus), local populations have been established in over 20 tributaries. Multiple founder events appear to have resulted in reduced neutral variation. Nevertheless, there is evidence for local adaptation in early life-history traits to different temperature regimes. In this study, microsatellite data from almost a decade of sampling were assessed to infer population structuring and its temporal stability. Several alternative analyses indicated that spatial variation explained 2-3 times more of the divergence in the system than temporal variation. Over all samples and years, there was a significant correlation between genetic and geographic distance. However, decomposed pairwise regression analysis revealed differing patterns of genetic structure among local populations and indicated that migration outweighs genetic drift in the majority of populations. In addition, isolation by distance was observable in only three of the six years, and signals of population bottlenecks were observed in the majority of samples. Combined, the results suggest that habitat-specific adaptation in this system has preceded the development of consistent population substructuring in the face of high levels of gene flow from divergent environments.

SP  - 49-89
AB  - This chapter assesses temporal and geographic variation in body size and body shape in Europe from the Early Upper Paleolithic to recent times. It reviews some more general principles underlying variation in body form, as well as providing a brief summary of the population history of Late Pleistocene/Holocene Europe. Genetic variation may also have been introduced by partial population replacement across the Last Glacial Maximum (the LGM), as well as across the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. Body size very clearly declined and body shape changed across the LGM. At the global level, geographic variation in body size, and especially in body shape, is in part due to genetic differences acquired via long-term natural selection to produce adaptation to different thermal environments. However, genetic adaptations must also have played some role, as indicated for example by the fact that North/Central Europeans of all time periods tend to have relatively shorter tibias than Mediterranean Europeans. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Using a well-adapted Drosophila subobscura population (Avala, Serbia), a drastic experiment of inbreeding was carried out to assess whether the expected level of homozygosity could be reached or if other evolutionary forces affected the process. In general, no significant changes of inversion (or arrangement) frequencies were detected after 12 brother-sister mating generations. Furthermore, no significant differences were obtained between observed and expected (under the inbreeding model) karyotypic frequencies. Thus, these results seemed to indicate that the main evolutionary factor in the experiment was inbreeding. However, in the G(12) generation, complete chromosomal fixation was reached only in two out of the eight final inbred lines. In these lines, the chromosomal compositions were difficult to interpret, but they could be likely a consequence of adaptation to particular laboratory conditions (constant 18 degrees C, food, light period, etc.). Finally, in a second experiment, the inbred lines presented higher fertility at 18 degrees C than at 13 degrees C. Also, there was a significant line effect on fertility: inbred line number 6 (A(1), J(1), U(1) under bar+(2) under bar; U(1) under bar+(2) under bar+(6) under bar, E-8, and O (3) under bar (+(4) under bar+(7) under bar)) presented the highest values, which maybe the result of an adaptation to laboratory conditions. Thus, the results obtained in our experiments reflect the adaptive potential of D. subobscura inversions.

TI  - A stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in flour beetles
VL  - 52
SP  - 108-116
AB  - Whole-organism performance depends on body temperature and ectotherms have variable body temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that thermal reaction norms have coevolved with thermal preference such that organisms attain optimal performance under a narrow range of body temperatures commonly experienced in the wild. Since thermal reaction norms are often similar, researchers interested in the effects of temperature on fitness often use one easily measured thermal reaction norm, such as locomotor performance, and assume it is a good proxy for fitness when testing the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. The extent to which this assumption holds, however, is often untested. In this study, we provide a stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in red and in confused flour beetles by comparing the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output to the preferred body temperature range. We also test the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output, a more ultimate index of fitness. In both species, we measured the number of eggs laid, righting time, and sprint speed at eight temperatures, as well as the thermal preference in a thermal gradient. The number of eggs laid increased with female sprint speed and with male righting time, and all three performances had similar thermal reaction norms, with 80% of the maximum achieved between 23 and 37 degrees C. Red flour beetles had preferred body temperatures that matched the optimal temperature for performance; confused flour beetles had lower preferred body temperature than the optimal temperature for performance. We found support for the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for reproductive output in flour beetles, but we only found evidence for thermal coadaptation in one of the two species.

TI  - Potential for thermal tolerance to mediate climate change effects on three members of a cool temperate lizard genus, Niveoscincus
VL  - 52
SP  - 14-23
AB  - Climatic changes are predicted to be greater in higher latitude and mountainous regions but species specific impacts are difficult to predict. This is partly due to inter-specific variance in the physiological traits which mediate environmental temperature effects at the organismal level. We examined variation in the critical thermal minimum (CTmin), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and evaporative water loss rates (EWL) of a widespread lowland (Niveoscincus ocellatus) and two range restricted highland (N. microlepidotus andN. greeni) members of a cool temperate Tasmanian lizard genus. The widespread lowland species had significantly higher CTmin and CTmax and significantly lower EWL than both highland species. Implications of inter-specific variation in thermal tolerance for activity were examined under contemporary and future climate change scenarios. Instances of air temperatures below CTmin were predicted to decline in frequency for the widespread lowland and both highland species. Air temperatures of high altitude sites were not predicted to exceed the CTmax of either highland species throughout the 21st century. In contrast, the widespread lowland species is predicted to experience air temperatures in excess of CTmax on 1 or 2 days by three of six global circulation models from 2068-2096. To estimate climate change effects on activity we reran the thermal tolerance models using minimum and maximum temperatures selected for activity. A net gain in available activity time was predicted under climate change for all three species; while air temperatures were predicted to exceed maximum temperatures selected for activity with increasing frequency, the change was not as great as the predicted decline in air temperatures below minimum temperatures selected for activity. We hypothesise that the major effect of rising air temperatures under climate change is an increase in available activity period for both the widespread lowland and highland species. The consequences of a greater available activity period will depend on the extent to which changes in climate alters other related factors, such as the nature and level of competition between the respective species. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Several highly effective fire-adaptive traits first evolved among modern plants during the mid-Cretaceous, in response to the widespread wildfires promoted by anomalously high atmospheric oxygen (O2) and extreme temperatures. Serotiny, or long-term canopy seed storage, is a fire-adaptive strategy common among plants living in fire-prone areas today, but evidence of this strategy has been lacking from the fossil record. Deposits of abundant fossil charcoal from sedimentary successions of the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, record wildfires in the south polar regions (75°-80°S) during the mid-Cretaceous (ca. 99-90 Ma). Newly discovered fossil conifer reproductive structures were consistently associated with these charcoal-rich deposits. The morphology and internal anatomy as revealed by neutron tomography exhibit a range of serotiny-associated characters. Numerous related fossils from similar, contemporaneous deposits of the Northern Hemisphere suggest that serotiny was a key adaptive strategy during the high-fire world of the Cretaceous. © 2017 Geological Society of America.

TI  - The role of stress and stress adaptations in determining the fate of the bacterial pathogen listeria monocytogenes in the food chain
VL  - 7
AB  - The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is a highly adaptable organism that can persist in a wide range of environmental and food-related niches. The consumption of contaminated ready-to-eat foods can cause infections, termed listeriosis, in vulnerable humans, particularly those with weakened immune systems. Although these infections are comparatively rare they are associated with high mortality rates and therefore this pathogen has a significant impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt to and survive a wide range of stress conditions including low pH, low water activity, and low temperature, which makes it problematic for food producers who rely on these stresses for preservation. Stress tolerance in L. monocytogenes can be explained partially by the presence of the general stress response (GSR), a transcriptional response under the control of the alternative sigma factor sigma B (σB) that reconfigures gene transcription to provide homeostatic and protective functions to cope with the stress. Within the host σB also plays a key role in surviving the harsh conditions found in the gastrointestinal tract. As the infection progresses beyond the GI tract L. monocytogenes uses an intracellular infectious cycle to propagate, spread and remain protected from the host's humoral immunity. Many of the virulence genes that facilitate this infectious cycle are under the control of a master transcriptional regulator called PrfA. In this review we consider the environmental reservoirs that enable L. monocytogenes to gain access to the food chain and discuss the stresses that the pathogen must overcome to survive and grow in these environments. The overlap that exists between stress tolerance and virulence is described. We review the principal measures that are used to control the pathogen and point to exciting new approaches that might provide improved means of control in the future. © 2016 NicAogáin and O'Byrne.

TI  - Genome-wide detection of natural selection in African Americans pre- and post-admixture
VL  - 22

SP  - 519-527
AB  - It is particularly meaningful to investigate natural selection in African Americans (AfA) due to the high mortality their African ancestry has experienced in history. In this study, we examined 491,526 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 5210 individuals and conducted a genome-wide search for selection signals in 1890 AfA. Several genomic regions showing an excess of African or European ancestry, which were considered the footprints of selection since population admixture, were detected based on a commonly used approach. However, we also developed a new strategy to detect natural selection both pre- and post-admixture by reconstructing an ancestral African population (AAF) from inferred African components of ancestry in AfA and comparing it with indigenous African populations (IAF). Interestingly, many selection-candidate genes identified by the new approach were associated with AfA-specific high-risk diseases such as prostate cancer and hypertension, suggesting an important role these disease-related genes might have played in adapting to a new environment. CD36 and HBB, whose mutations confer a degree of protection against malaria, were also located in the highly differentiated regions between AAF and IAF. Further analysis showed that the frequencies of alleles protecting against malaria in AAF were lower than those in IAF, which is consistent with the relaxed selection pressure of malaria in the New World. There is no overlap between the top candidate genes detected by the two approaches, indicating the different environmental pressures AfA experienced pre- and post-population admixture. We suggest that the new approach is reasonably powerful and can also be applied to other admixed populations such as Latinos and Uyghurs. © 2012 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - Seasonal changes in the body size of two rotifer species living in activated sludge follow the Temperature-Size Rule
VL  - 4
IS  - 24
SP  - 4678-4689
AB  - Temperature-Size Rule (TSR) is a phenotypic body size response of ectotherms to changing temperature. It is known from the laboratory studies, but seasonal patterns in the field were not studied so far. We examined the body size changes in time of rotifers inhabiting activated sludge. We hypothesize that temperature is the most influencing parameter in sludge environment, leading sludge rotifers to seasonally change their body size according to TSR, and that oxygen content also induces the size response. The presence of TSR in Lecane inermis rotifer was tested in a laboratory study with two temperature and two food-type treatments. The effect of interaction between temperature and food was significant; L. inermis followed TSR in one food type only. The seasonal variability in the body sizes of the rotifers L. inermis and Cephalodella gracilis was estimated by monthly sampling and analyzed by multiple regression, in relation to the sludge parameters selected as the most influential by multivariate analysis, and predicted to alter rotifer body size (temperature and oxygen). L. inermis varied significantly in size throughout the year, and this variability is explained by temperature as predicted by the TSR, but not by oxygen availability. C. gracilis also varied in size, though this variability was explained by both temperature and oxygen. We suggest that sludge age acts as a mortality factor in activated sludge. It may have a seasonal effect on the body size of L. inermis and modify a possible effect of oxygen. Activated sludge habitat is driven by both biological processes and human regulation, yet its resident organisms follow general evolutionary rule as they do in other biological systems. The interspecific response patterns differ, revealing the importance of taking species-specific properties into account. Our findings are applicable to sludge properties enhancement through optimizing the conditions for its biological component. We found that temperature and oxygen are among parameters most affecting the activated sludge properties. Both parameters drive size variability in rotifers in activated sludge, but the response is species-related and disturbed by sludge age. We showed that sludge organisms follow a common evolutionary rule, the Temperature-Size Rule. © 2014 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Landscape-scale clines in environmental parameters can lead to life-history gradients. Study of interspecific life-history differences can provide evidence of evolutionary adaptations in response to environmental cues, whereas examination of intraspecific life-history variation can identify the ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution. We examined egg size and fecundity variation in three species of closely related freshwater fish (Galaxiidae) which occur across a habitat gradient in South Island, New Zealand. Inter-population trait variation was assessed in the species with the widest distribution to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving egg size evolution. Substantial interspecific egg size and fecundity differences were observed. Galaxias paucispondylus, which generally occurs in high altitude headwater streams, showed an average egg size an order of magnitude larger, and fecundity an order of magnitude lower than G. brevipinnis, a species which rears in pelagic environments. Galaxias vulgaris, which rears fluvial environments but is generally distributed in lower catchment reaches than G. paucispondylus, showed intermediate fecundity and egg size traits. This interspecific trait variation is likely to be driven by differences in the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in cold high altitude locations requires large well-developed larvae (and therefore large eggs) but these come at the cost of maternal fecundity, whereas in rearing in warmer lower catchment watercourses, and pelagic habitats, does not require such large well-developed larvae. Hence, fitness is maximised by progressively increasing fecundity by reducing egg size across this habitat cline. Life history-habitat trends were repeated when intraspecific patterns in the widely distributed G. vulgaris were assessed, with population egg size increasing, and fecundity decreasing, in relation to a suite of interrelated environmental variables up an approximate altitudinal cline. The results highlight how inter- and intraspecific variation in egg size–fecundity trade-offs in closely related species can interact to drive the evolution of landscape-scale life-history gradients. Egg size differences are likely to be driven by differences in the quality of the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in a challenging habitat requires a larger egg whereas in relatively benign larval rearing habitat, fecundity can be maximised by reducing egg size. The interspecific variation observed provides evidence of trait adaptation in response to an environmental cue, while the intraspecific inter-population differences indicate the potential ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - The GR3D model, a tool to explore the Global Repositioning Dynamics of Diadromous fish Distribution
VL  - 283
SP  - 31-44
AB  - Within the context of ongoing environmental changes, the life history of diadromous fish represents a real potential for exploring and colonizing new environments due to high potential dispersal abilities. The use of dynamic approaches to assess how these species will respond to climate change is a challenging issue and mechanistic models able to incorporate biological and evolutionary processes are a promising tool. To this end we developed an individual-based model, called GR3D (Global Repositioning Dynamics for Diadromous fish Distribution), combining climatic requirements and population dynamics with an explicit dispersal process to evaluate potential evolution of their distribution area in the context of climatic change. This paper describes thoroughly the model structure and presents an exploratory test case where the repositioning of a virtual allis shad (Alosa alosa L.) population between two river catchments under a scenario of temperature increase was assessed. The global sensitivity analysis showed that landscape structure and parameters related to sea lifespan and to survival at sea were crucial to determine the success of colonization. These results were consistent with the ecology of this species. The integration of climatic factors directly into the processes and the explicit dispersal process make GR3D an original and relevant tool to assess the repositioning dynamics and persistence of diadromous fish facing climate change.

VL  - 51
IS  - 4
SP  - 919-928
AB  - Summary: Freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate change and pollution. One key challenge for aquatic toxicology is to determine and manage the combined effects of temperature increase and contaminants across species' ranges. We tested how thermal adaptation and life-history evolution along a natural temperature gradient influence the vulnerability of an aquatic insect to a pesticide under global warming. We applied a space-for-time substitution approach to study the effect of warming on the vulnerability of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae to the pesticide chlorpyrifos in a common garden warming experiment (20 and 24 °C) with replicated populations from three latitudes spanning >1500 km in Europe. Chlorpyrifos was more toxic to damselfly larvae at the higher temperature: mortality only occurred at 24 °C and the reductions in growth rate were stronger at 24 °C. This could partly be explained by parallel reductions in food intake but not by the activities of two widespread enzymatic biomarkers, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). There was some evidence that the increased toxicity of the high chlorpyrifos concentration at 24 °C was stronger in terms of growth reduction in the faster-growing larvae from the low-latitude populations. This is consistent with energy allocation trade-offs between growth rate and pesticide tolerance, but suggests that local thermal adaptation does not play a role in coping with pesticide stress. Synthesis and applications. Damselfly larvae from populations in lower latitudes were more vulnerable to a common pesticide at higher temperatures and pesticide concentrations, whereas evidence for the influence of local thermal adaptation on the vulnerability of larvae was weak. These results emphasize the need for spatially explicit bioassessment and conservation tools. Management practices aimed at mitigating pesticide run-off into aquatic ecosystems are particularly important in agricultural areas at low latitudes. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Behavioral thermoregulation of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) throughout the seasonal cycle
VL  - 478
SP  - 1-9
AB  - Ectothermic organisms rely on behavioral thermoregulation to modulate their body temperature and the final thermal preferendum (FTP) paradigm (FTPP) postulates that a given species holds a species-specific FTP. The FTPP, however, has been challenged by a considerable amount of recent findings on vertebrate ectotherms, indicating that the FTP is not as static as originally postulated but can be modulated by various factors. In contrast to vertebrates, evidence from invertebrate ectotherms is far more limited. To test for the validity of the FTPP and to study whether behavioral thermoregulation in a marine invertebrate varies seasonally, thermal preferenda of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) were determined through a 14 month period. Thermal preferenda of males and females of different size groups were measured in an annular chamber system (4-25 degrees C) using the gravitational method for thermal preference testing. The results revealed that brown shrimp behaviorally selected a wide range of temperatures and did not show a single or constant thermal preferendum. Thermal preference was modulated following a seasonal pattern suggesting the existence of distinct seasonal preference zones rather than a species-specific preference temperature. Brown shrimp selected low temperatures during winter, however, a difference of 5 degrees C in preferred temperature was observed between a cold and a relatively mild one. Highest thermal preferenda did not coincide with field water temperatures but were observed after field water temperatures exceeded the annual temperature peak. Besides season, body size of brown shrimp significantly affected thermal selection and small individuals selected higher temperatures compared to large ones. A significant interaction of body size and water temperature at which the shrimp were caught was detected. The study further provides evidence that cohort identity as well as female reproductive state may affect thermal preference as well. The results of the study reveal that thermal selection in brown shrimp is complex, not static and that preference temperature can be modulated by various factors, representing the first evidence for a marine invertebrate ectotherm.

TI  - Thermal regimes during incubation do not affect mean selected temperatures of hatchling lizards (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae)
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-51
AB  - Incubation temperatures profoundly affect many phenotypic traits of squamate reptiles, and mean selected body temperatures of such animals also are plastic in response to environmental factors. Plausibly, then, incubation temperatures might affect hatchling thermoregulation, either via adaptation (i.e., populations that historically experience different nest conditions, also will diverge in hatchling thermoregulatory behaviour) or phenotypic plasticity (incubation temperatures directly modify hatchling behaviours). We tested this hypothesis with a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), using thermal-imaging methods to quantify temperatures (of both head and body) selected by hatchling lizards. The Young lizards kept their heads cooler than their bodies, but mean selected temperatures did not differ among hatchlings from three populations with differing thermal regimes in natural nests, nor were they affected by thermal conditions during incubation. The conservatism of mean selected temperatures stands in strong contrast to the lability of many other phenotypic traits in response to incubation temperatures in this species.

TI  - High-latitude settings promote extreme longevity in fossil marine bivalves
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 365-382
AB  - One of the longest-lived, noncolonial animals on the planet today is a bivalve that attains life spans in excess of 500 years and lives in a cold, seasonally food-limited setting. Separating the influence of temperature and food availability on life span in modern settings is difficult, as these two conditions covary. The life spans of fossil animals can provide insights into the role of environment in the evolution of extreme longevity that are not available from studies of modern taxa. We examine bivalves from the unique, nonanalogue, warm and high-latitude setting of Seymour Island, Antarctica, during the greenhouse intervals of the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. Despite significant sampling limitations, we find that all 11 species examined are both slow growing and long-lived, especially when compared with modern bivalves living in similar temperature settings. While cool temperatures have long been thought to be a key factor in promoting longevity, our findings suggest an important role for caloric restriction brought about by the low and seasonal light regime of the high latitudes. Our life-history data, spanning three different families, emphasize that longevity is in part governed by environmental rather than solely phylogenetic or ecologic factors. Such findings have implications for both modern and ancient latitudinal diversity gradients, as a common correlate of slow growth and long life is delayed reproduction, which limits the potential for evolutionary change. While life spans of modern bivalves are well studied, data on life spans of fossil bivalves are sparse and largely anecdotal. Life histories of organisms from deep time can not only elucidate the controls on life span but also add a new dimension to our understanding of macroevolutionary patterns.

TI  - Can environmental change affect host/parasite-mediated speciation?
VL  - 119
IS  - 4
SP  - 384-394
AB  - Parasitism can be a driver of species divergence and thereby significantly alter species formation processes. While we still need to better understand how parasite-mediated speciation functions, it is even less clear how this process is affected by environmental change. Both rapid and gradual changes of the environment can modify host immune responses, parasite virulence and the specificity of their interactions. They will thereby change host-parasite evolutionary trajectories and the potential for speciation in both hosts and parasites. Here, we summarise mechanisms of host-parasite interactions affecting speciation and subsequently consider their susceptibility to environmental changes. We mainly focus on the effects of temperature change and nutrient input to ecosystems as they are major environmental stressors. There is evidence for both disruptive and accelerating effects of those pressures on speciation that seem to be context-dependent. A prerequisite for parasite-driven host speciation is that parasites significantly alter the host's Darwinian fitness. This can rapidly lead to divergent selection and genetic adaptation; however, it is likely preceded by more short-term plastic and transgenerational effects. Here, we also consider how these first responses and their susceptibility to environmental changes could lead to alterations of the species formation process and may provide alternative pathways to speciation.

TI  - Genomic basis of ecological niche divergence among cryptic sister species of non-biting midges
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: There is a lack of understanding the evolutionary forces driving niche segregation of closely related organisms. In addition, pinpointing the genes driving ecological divergence is a key goal in molecular ecology. Here, larval transcriptome sequences obtained by next-generation-sequencing are used to address these issues in a morphologically cryptic sister species pair of non-biting midges (Chironomus riparius and C. piger).Results: More than eight thousand orthologous open reading frames were screened for interspecific divergence and intraspecific polymorphisms. Despite a small mean sequence divergence of 1.53% between the sister species, 25.1% of 18,115 observed amino acid substitutions were inferred by α statistics to be driven by positive selection. Applying McDonald-Kreitman tests to 715 alignments of gene orthologues identified eleven (1.5%) genes driven by positive selection.Conclusions: Three candidate genes were identified as potentially responsible for the observed niche segregation concerning nitrite concentration, habitat temperature and water conductivity. Additionally, signs of positive selection in the hydrogen sulfide detoxification pathway were detected, providing a new plausible hypothesis for the species' ecological differentiation. Finally, a divergently selected, nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein may contribute to reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear coevolution. © 2013 Schmidt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Minor actinide incineration and Th-U breeding in a small FLiNaK Molten Salt Fast Reactor
VL  - 99
SP  - 335-344
AB  - Minor actinide (MA) accumulated in spent fuel is the primary contributor to the long-term radiological hazards of high-level nuclear waste. Due to its outstanding features such as fast neutron spectrum, no fuel assembly fabrication, on-line refueling and reprocessing, Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is regarded as one of the candidate reactors for MA incineration. In the present work, we evaluate the MA incineration capability for a 500 MWth FLiNaK MSFR by considering on-line MA feeding into the fuel salt and/or U-233 extraction from the fertile salt, where the initial FLiNaK fuel salt is composed of 70 mol% (LiF4, NaF and KF) and 30 mol% (ThF4, (UF4)-U-233 and MAF(3)). The simulated results show that, during a 50-year operation, the MA incineration efficiency with on-line MA feeding and U-233 extraction scenario is significantly higher compared with the case without either MA feeding or U-233 extraction. Based on the scenario of online MA feeding and U-233 extraction, the initial MA loading is further adjusted to keep a small excess reactivity during the whole operation. And the MA incineration amount, the depletion ratio between MA and total heavy nuclides and the MA incineration efficiency at 50-year operating time are 7301 kg, 77.4% and 33.3 kg/TWh, respectively, with a doubling time of 39-year for U-233 breeding. We also analyze and discuss the evolutions of the fuel temperature feedback coefficient, the effective delayed neutron fraction and the intensity of spontaneous fission neutron during the whole operating time.

VL  - 171
IS  - 2
SP  - 1-14
AB  - In this paper, we show how the results of phase equilibria calculations in different mantle compositions can be reconciled with the evidence from natural mantle samples. We present data on the response of bulk rock density to pressure (P), temperature (T) and compositional changes in the lithospheric mantle and obtain constraints on the P–T evolution recorded by mantle xenoliths. To do this, we examine the mantle xenolith suite from the Quaternary alkali basalts of Pali-Aike, Patagonia, using phase equilibria calculation in six representative compositions. The calculations were done subsolidus and in volatile-free conditions. Our results show that the density change related to the spinel peridotite to garnet peridotite transition is not sharp and strongly depends on the bulk composition. In a depleted mantle composition, this transition is not reflected in the density profile, while in a fertile mantle it leads to a relative increase in density with respect to more depleted compositions. In mantle sections characterized by hot geothermal gradients (~70 mW/m2), the spinel–garnet transition may overlap with the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary. Phase equilibria calculations in peridotitic compositions representative of the Pali-Aike mantle were also used to constrain the origin and evolution of the mantle xenoliths. Our results indicate that the mineral modes and compositions, and the mineral zonation reported for the low-temperature peridotites (spinel and spinel + garnet harzburgites and lherzolites), are linked to a cooling event in the mantle which occurred long before the eruption of the host basalts. In addition, our phase equilibria calculations show that kelyphitic rims around garnets, as those observed in the high-temperature garnet peridotites from Pali-Aike, can be explained simply by decompression and do not require additional metasomatic fluid or melt. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - Does genetic variation maintained by environmental heterogeneity facilitate adaptation to novel selection?
VL  - 188
IS  - 1
SP  - 27-37
AB  - Environmental heterogeneity helps maintain genetic variation in fitness. Therefore, one might predict that populations living in heterogeneous environments have higher adaptive potential than populations living in homogeneous environments. Such a prediction could be useful in guiding conservation priorities without requiring detailed genetic studies. However, this prediction will be true only if the additional genetic variation maintained by environmental heterogeneity can be used to respond to novel selection. Here we examine the effect of environmental heterogeneity on future adaptability using replicated experimental Drosophila melanogaster populations that had previously evolved for ∼100 generations under one of four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched larvae medium, constant cadmium-enriched larvae medium, and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally or spatially between the two media. Replicates of these experimental populations were subjected to a novel heat stress while being maintained in their original larval diet selection regimes. Adaptation to increased temperature was measured with respect to female productivity and male siring success after ∼20 generations. For female productivity, there was evidence of adaptation overall and heterogeneous populations had a larger adaptive response than homogeneous populations. There was less evidence of adaptation overall for male siring success and no support for faster adaptation in heterogeneous populations. © 2016 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

VL  - 202
IS  - 2
SP  - 675-687
AB  - Genetic variation is prevalent among individuals of the same species and yet the potential effects of genetic variation on developmental outcomes are frequently suppressed. Understanding the mechanisms that are responsible for this suppression is an important goal. Previously, we found that the microRNA miR-9a mitigates the impact of natural genetic variants that promote the development of scutellar bristles in adult Drosophila. Here we find that miR-9a does not affect the impact of genetic variants that inhibit the development of scutellar bristles. We show this using both directional and stabilizing selection in the laboratory. This specificity of action suggests that miR-9a does not interact with all functional classes of developmental genetic variants affecting sensory organ development. We also investigate the impact of miR-9a on a fitness trait, which is adult viability. At elevated physiological temperatures, miR-9a contributes to viability through masking genetic variants that hinder adult viability. We conclude that miR-9a activity in different developmental networks contributes to suppression of natural variants from perturbing development. © 2016 by the Genetics Society of America.

TI  - Sensitivity of typical Mediterranean crops to past and future evolution of seasonal temperature and precipitation in Apulia
VL  - 14
IS  - 5
SP  - 2025-2038
AB  - The region of Apulia, which is located in the south-east tip of the Italian Peninsula, has a typical Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot-dry summers. Agriculture, an important sector of its economy, is potentially threatened by future climate change. This study describes the evolution of seasonal temperature and precipitation from the recent past to the next decades and estimates future potential impacts of climate change on three main agricultural products: wine, wheat and olives. Analysis is based on instrumental data, on an ensemble of climate projections and on a linear regression model linking these three agricultural products to seasonal values of temperature and precipitation. In Apulia, precipitation and temperature time series show trends toward warmer and marginally drier conditions during the whole analyzed (1951–2005) period: 0.18 °C/decade in mean annual minimum temperature and −14.9 mm/decade in the annual total precipitation. Temperature trends have been progressively increasing and rates of change have become noticeably more intense during the last 25 years of the twentieth century. Model simulations are consistent with observed trends for the period 1951–2000 and show a large acceleration of the warming rate in the period 2001–2050 with respect to the period 1951–2000. Further, in the period 2001–2050, simulations show a decrease in precipitation, which was not present in the previous 50 years. Wine production, wheat and olive harvest records show large inter-annual variability with statistically significant links to seasonal temperature and precipitation, whose strength, however, strongly depends on the considered variables. Linear regression analysis shows that seasonal temperature and precipitation variability explains a small, but not negligible, fraction of the inter-annual variability of these crops (40, 18, 9 % for wine, olives and wheat, respectively). Results (which consider no adaptation of crops and no fertilization effect of CO2) suggest that evolution of these seasonal climate variables in the first half of the twenty-first century could decrease all considered variables. The most affected is wine production (−20 ÷ −26 %). The effect is relevant also on harvested olives (−8 ÷ −19 %) and negligible on harvested wheat (−4 ÷ −1 %). © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Differential expression of survival proteins during decreased intracellular oxygen tension in brain endothelial cells of grey mullets
VL  - 115

SP  - 421-428
AB  - The brain requires constant oxygen supply to perform its biological functions essential for survival. Because of low oxygen capacity and poor oxygen diffusibility of water, many fish species have evolved various adaptive mechanisms to cope with depleted oxygen. Endothelial cells (EC) are the primary components responsible for controlled environment of brain. Brain homeostasis largely depends on integrity of the EC. To elucidate their adaptive strategy, EC were isolated from the fish brain of Kovalam-control site and Ennore estuary-test/field hypoxic site and were subjected to low oxygen tension in laboratory. Cell viability, 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed to ascertain stress. Hypoxic insult, cytoprotective role of HSPs and apoptotic effect were analyzed by assessing hypoxia-inducible-factor-alpha (HIF1 alpha), heat-shock-protein-70 (HSP70), heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK1). This study evidenced that HSP70 and HO-1 are the key stress proteins, confer high tolerance to decreased oxygen tension mediated stress. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comparison of PCB bioaccumulation factors between an arctic and a temperate marine food web
VL  - 408
IS  - 13
SP  - 2753-2760
AB  - To test how environmental conditions in the Arctic and the resulting ecological adaptations affect accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the marine food web, bioaccumulation of four polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in an arctic (Barents Sea 77°N-82°N) and a temperate marine (Baltic Sea 54°N-62°N) food web were compared. Three different trophic levels were studied (zooplankton, fish, and seal), representing the span from first-level consumer to top predator. Previously published high-quality data on PCB water concentrations in the two areas were used for calculation of bioaccumulation factors (BAF). BAF was calculated as the ratio of the PCB concentration in the organism ([PCB]org; pg/kg lipid) to the dissolved water concentration (Cw; pg/L). The BAFArctic:BAFTemperate ratios were above 1 for all four PCB congeners in zooplankton (6.4-13.8) and planktivorous fish (2.9-5.0)), whereas the ratios were below 1 in seal. The mean ratio between arctic and temperate BAFs for all trophic levels and congeners (BAFArcti:BAFTemperate) was 4.8. When the data were corrected for the seawater temperature difference between the two ecosystems, the ratio was 2.0. We conclude that bioaccumulation differences caused by ecological or physiological adaptations of organisms between the two ecosystems were well within a water concentration variability of 50%. Further, our data support the hypothesis that lower seawater temperature lead to a thermodynamically favoured passive partitioning to organic matrices and thus elevated ambient BAFs in the Arctic compared to the Baltic Sea. This would imply that bioaccumulation in the Arctic may be described in the same way as bioaccumulation in temperate regions, e.g. by the use of mechanistic models parameterised for the Arctic. © 2010.

TI  - Water-rich planets: How habitable is a water layer deeper than on Earth?
VL  - 277
SP  - 215-236
AB  - Water is necessary for the origin and survival of life as we know it. In the search for life-friendly worlds, water-rich planets therefore are obvious candidates and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The surface H2O layer on such planets (containing a liquid water ocean and possibly high-pressure ice below a specific depth) could potentially be hundreds of kilometres deep depending on the water content and the evolution of the proto-atmosphere. We study possible constraints for the habitability of deep water layers and introduce a new habitability classification relevant for water-rich planets (from Mars-size to super-Earth-size planets). A new ocean model has been developed that is coupled to a thermal evolution model of the mantle and core. Our interior structure model takes into account depth-dependent thermodynamic properties and the possible formation of high-pressure ice. We find that heat flowing out of the silicate mantle can melt an ice layer from below (in some cases episodically), depending mainly on the thickness of the ocean-ice shell, the mass of the planet, the surface temperature and the interior parameters (e.g. radioactive mantle heat sources). The high pressure at the bottom of deep water-ice layers could also impede volcanism at the water-mantle boundary for both stagnant lid and plate tectonics silicate shells. We conclude that water-rich planets with a deep ocean, a large planet mass, a high average density or a low surface temperature are likely less habitable than planets with an Earth-like ocean.

TI  - Fiber Bragg grating sensors as a tool to evaluate the influence of filler on shrinkage of geopolymer matrices
VL  - 9506
AB  - Geopolymer matrices represent one of the main sustainable alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and other clinker-based blended cements. Real scale applications are limited and a relevant amount of data is still needed to assess the early age and long-term behavior of these systems. Particularly, the early-age monitoring of geopolymers represent a key parameter for mix design optimization. Most of the available methods for the measurement of temperature evolution due to polycondensation kinetics and early age deformations are related to laboratory activities. The upscaling to in situ techniques represents a crucial step toward technological assessment. To this aim, authors propose to use Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) embedded in the geopolymer matrices. Starting from a case study by authors related to the design of externally bonded fiber reinforced geopolymers for strengthening of existing structures, the matrix was optimized in terms of quartz filler content. The measurements carried out by means of FBG sensors allowed to reduce filler content respect to the abovementioned work. Particularly, quartz content can be reduced by 50%. The temperature associated to polycondensation was slightly below 65°C for the three studied systems, limiting the use of designed metakaolin geopolymer to non-massive structures, since thermal cracking could occur, unless further research will be able to assess the viability of retardants. The experimental results confirm that FBG represent an accurate method for simultaneous shrinkage and temperature measurements for geopolymers and the application in real scale structures for remote sensing could help to create database on inner temperatures and early age deformations. © 2015 SPIE.

TI  - Status of the Norwegian thorium Light Water Reactor (LWR) fuel development and irradiation test program
VL  - 1
SP  - 798-804
AB  - This paper presents the status of a thorium mixed oxide fuel (Th-MOX) development and irradiation campaign, which is being conducted by Thor Energy, a Norwegian cooperation supported by a consortium of industrial and R&D institutions. The objective of the campaign is to support claims that thorium (Th) provides a comparative advantage if used as the major fertile component in nuclear fuel for conventional light water reactors. The scope of the project is focused around PuO2-ThO2 and UO2-ThO2 ceramics to address fuel manufacturing, fuel cycle neutronics and economics, and in-pile thermal and mechanical behavior. Thorium, as the basis fertile component for a mixed oxide fuel, is advantageous for many reasons. The combination of plutonium and thorium to form a Th-MOX fuel is an attractive way to incinerate reactor or weapons grade plutonium. The irradiation of Th-MOX results in a spent reactor fuel with lower radiotoxicity and plutonium levels. Furthermore, thorium oxide is highly inert and cannot be oxidized beyond its +4 oxidation state (unlike UO2 which easily oxidizes to U308). ThO2 is also much less soluble in aqueous media. As a result of the aforementioned, ThO2 provides safety benefits in abnormal reactor operation and added safety margins in waste management and spent fuel storage. ThO2 has a higher thermal conductivity and releases less fission gas due to a higher degree of oxide stability than UO2. The higher absorption cross-section and the reduced fast fission factor of Th coupled with the flatter spectrum dependent neutron yield of uranium-233 allows more plutonium to be loaded into the fuel pins while still maintaining adequate safety margins and negative reactivity coefficients. Lastly, the net plutonium destruction for thorium-based fuels is roughly 50 - 70 percent, vastly exceeding that of uranium based fuels. The Norwegian Th-MOX program began by detailing manufacturing blueprints for these fuel ceramics. Care was taken to insure that sufficient uniformity and high theoretical density were achieved in a simple process compatible with current commercial LWR fuel manufacturing. The irradiation test is being conducted at the Halden reactor operated by the Norwegian Institute of Energy Technology (IFE). A highly instrumented test rig has been configured to take on-line measurements of fission gas release, fuel stack elongation, cladding elongation, fuel pellet swelling, pellet cladding mechanical interaction, neutron flux environment, fuel temperature profile, coolant flow and coolant temperatures. Following the irradiation the fuel will be subjected to post irradiation analysis to examine fission gas composition, fuel microstructure evolution, thermal conductivity evolution and other fuel matrix properties. The data collected from the campaign is aimed to demonstrate not only the advantages, but also the safe and long-term reliable performance of Th-MOX. This data will directly support the planning and approval of a commercial irradiation of such fuel.

TI  - A non-cold-inducible cold shock protein homolog mainly contributes to translational control under optimal growth conditions
VL  - 279
IS  - 6
SP  - 1014-1029
AB  - Cold shock proteins (Csps) include both cold-induced and non-cold-induced proteins, contrary to their name. Cold-induced Csps are well studied; they function in cold acclimation by controlling transcription and translation. Some Csps have been reported to contribute to other cellular processes. However, the functions of non-cold-induced Csps under optimal growth conditions remain unknown. To elucidate these functions, we used transcriptome and proteome analyses as comprehensive approaches and have compared the outputs of wild-type and non-cold-induced Csp-deletion mutant cells. As a model organism, we selected Thermus thermophilus HB8 because it has only two csp genes (ttcsp1 and ttcsp2); ttCsp1 is the only non-cold-induced Csp. Surprisingly, the amount of transcripts and proteins upon deletion of the ttcsp1 gene was quite different. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the deletion of ttcsp1 did not affect the amount of transcripts, although the ttcsp1 gene was constantly expressed in the wild-type cell. Nonetheless, proteomic analysis revealed that the expression levels of many proteins were significantly altered when ttcsp1 was deleted. These results suggest that ttCsp1 functions in translation independent of transcription. Furthermore, ttCsp1 is involved in both the stimulation and inhibition of translation of specific proteins. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of ttCsp1 at 1.65 Å. This is the first report to present the structure of a non-cold-inducible cold shock protein. We also report the nucleotide binding affinity of ttCsp1. Finally, we discuss the functions of non-cold-induced Csps and propose how they modulate the levels of specific proteins to suit the prevailing environmental conditions. © 2012 FEBS.

TI  - Host and Phenology Shifts in the Evolution of the Social Moth Genus Thaumetopoea
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - The genus Thaumetopoea contains the processionary moths, a group of lepidopteran associated with forest trees, well known for the social behaviour of the larvae and for carrying urticating setae. The taxonomy of the genus is partly unresolved and a phylogenetic approach is lacking. The goal of this work is to produce a phylogeny for Thaumetopoea and to identify the main traits driving the evolution of this group. Eighteen mitochondrial and three nuclear genes were fully/partly sequenced. Markers were aligned and analysed singularly or in various combinations. Phylogenetic analyses were performed according to maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Trees obtained from largest data sets provided identical topologies that received strong statistical support. Three main clades were identified within Thaumetopoea and were further supported by several signatures located in the mitochondrial tRNAs and intergenic spacers. The reference topology was used to investigate the evolution of life history traits related to biogeography, host plant, ecology, and morphology. A multigenic approach allowed to produce a robust phylogenetic analysis of the genus Thaumetopoea, with the identification of three major clades linked to different ecological and life history traits. The first clade is associated with Angiosperm host plants and has a fast spring development of larvae on young foliage. The other clades have originated by one event of host plant shift to Gymnosperm Pinaceae, which implied a longer larval developmental time due to the lower nutritional quality of leaves. These clades showed different adaptations to such a constraint, the first with a switch of larval feeding to cold season (winter pine processionary moths), and the second with a retraction to high altitude and latitude and a development cycle extended over two years (summer pine processionary moths). Recent global warming is affecting all species and seems able to further shape the evolution of the group. © 2013 Simonato et al.

VL  - 76

SP  - 662-664
AB  - Life history in reproductive pattern in hares are affected by ambient temperature. We hypothesized that European hares dwelling in areas of higher energy demands would have larger body sizes, larger fat depots and a delayed first reproduction. To test this assumption we compared yearly reproductive output as well as age, body size, body weight and body condition of female European hares from Belgium (temperate oceanic climate) and Lower Austria (temperate continental climate). Our results reveal that there was no effect of study site on annual reproductive output in female European hares. However, adult female hares from Belgium were significantly smaller and had significantly lower body condition in late autumn compared to the Lower Austrian sample, although Belgian individuals were actually older than Lower Austrians. These findings suggest that females in Belgium are more under an r-selection regime whereas Lower Austrian females might be more under K-selection within the r-K-continuum.

SP  - 915-933
AB  - Zircons from 14 compositionally variable granitic rocks were examined in detail using CL image-guided micro-analysis to unravel the complex magmatic history above the southward retreating Hellenic subduction zone system in the Aegean Sea. Previously published U-Pb ages document an episodic crystallisation history from 17 to 11 Ma, with peraluminous (S-type) granitic rocks systematically older than closely associated metaluminous (I-type) granitic rocks. Zircon O- and Hf isotopic data, combined with trace element compositions, are highly variable within and between individual samples, indicative of open-system behaviour involving mantle-derived melts and evolved supracrustal sources. Pronounced compositional and thermal fluctuations highlight the role of magma mixing and mingling, in accord with field observations, and incremental emplacement of distinct melt batches coupled with variable degrees of crustal assimilation. In the course of partial fusion, more fertile supracrustal sources dominated in the earlier stages of Aegean Miocene magmatism, consistent with systematically older crystallisation ages of peraluminous granitic rocks. Differences between zircon saturation and crystallisation temperatures (deduced from zircon Ti concentrations), along with multimodal crystallisation age spectra for individual plutons, highlight the complex and highly variable physico-compositional and thermal evolution of silicic magma systems. The transfer of heat and juvenile melts from the mantle varied probably in response to episodic rollback of the subducting lithospheric slab, as suggested by punctuated crystallisation age spectra within and among individual granitic plutons. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics in urbanized landscapes: Evolution, species sorting and the change in zooplankton body size along urbanization gradients
VL  - 372
IS  - 1712
AB  - Urbanization causes both changes in community composition and evolutionary responses, but most studies focus on these responses in isolation. We performed an integrated analysis assessing the relative contribution of intraand interspecific trait turnover to the observed change in zooplankton community body size in 83 cladoceran communities along urbanization gradients quantified at seven spatial scales (50–3200 m radii). We also performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 12 Daphnia magna populations along the same urbanization gradient. Body size in zooplankton communitiesgenerally declined with increasing urbanization, but the opposite was observed for communities dominated by large species. The contribution of intraspecific trait variation to community body size turnover with urbanization strongly varied with the spatial scale considered, and was highest for communities dominated by large cladoceran species and at intermediate spatial scales. Genotypic size at maturity was smaller for urban than for rural D. magna populations and for animals cultured at 248C compared with 208C. While local genetic adaptation likely contributed to the persistenceof D. magna in the urban heat islands, buffering for the phenotypic shift to larger body sizes with increasing urbanization, community body size turnover was mainly driven by non-genetic intraspecific trait change.

VL  - 170

SP  - 47-55
AB  - The ability to modify phenotypes in response to heterogeneity of the thermal environment represents an important component of an ectotherm's non-genetic adaptive capacity. Despite considerable attention being dedicated to the study of thermally-induced developmental plasticity, whether or not interspecific interactions shape the plastic response in both a predator and its prey remains unknown. We tested several predictions about the joint influence of predator/prey scents and thermal conditions on the plasticity of preferred body temperatures (T (p)) in both actors of this interaction, using a dragonfly nymphs-newt larvae system. Dragonfly nymphs (Aeshna cyanea) and newt eggs (Ichthyosaura alpestris) were subjected to fluctuating cold and warm thermal regimes (7-12 and 12-22A degrees C, respectively) and the presence/absence of a predator or prey chemical cues. Preferred body temperatures were measured in an aquatic thermal gradient (5-33A degrees C) over a 24-h period. Newt T (p) increased with developmental temperature irrespective of the presence/absence of predator cues. In dragonflies, thermal reaction norms for T (p) were affected by the interaction between temperature and prey cues. Specifically, the presence of newt scents in cold regime lowered dragonfly T (p). We concluded that predator-prey interactions influenced thermally-induced plasticity of T (p) but not in a reciprocal fashion. The occurrence of frequency-dependent thermal plasticity may have broad implications for predator-prey population dynamics, the evolution of thermal biology traits, and the consequences of sustaining climate change within ecological communities.

TI  - Nitric Oxide Acts as a Positive Regulator to Induce Metamorphosis of the Ascidian Herdmania momus
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - Marine invertebrates commonly have a biphasic life cycle in which the metamorphic transition from a pelagic larva to a benthic post-larva is mediated by the nitric oxide signalling pathway. Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesised by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is a client protein of the molecular chaperon heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). It is notable, then, that both NO and HSP90 have been implicated in regulating metamorphosis in marine invertebrates as diverse as urochordates, echinoderms, molluscs, annelids, and crustaceans. Specifically, the suppression of NOS activity by the application of either NOS- or HSP90-inhibiting pharmacological agents has been shown consistently to induce the initiation of metamorphosis, leading to the hypothesis that a negative regulatory role of NO is widely conserved in biphasic life cycles. Further, the induction of metamorphosis by heat-shock has been demonstrated for multiple species. Here, we investigate the regulatory role of NO in induction of metamorphosis of the solitary tropical ascidian, Herdmania momus. By coupling pharmacological treatments with analysis of HmNOS and HmHSP90 gene expression, we present compelling evidence of a positive regulatory role for NO in metamorphosis of this species, in contrast to all existing ascidian data that supports the hypothesis of NO as a conserved negative regulator of metamorphosis. The exposure of competent H. momus larvae to a NOS inhibitor or an NO donor results in an up-regulation of NOS and HSP90 genes. Heat shock of competent larvae induces metamorphosis in a temperature dependent manner, up to a thermal tolerance that approaches 35°C. Both larval/post-larval survival and the appearance of abnormal morphologies in H. momus post-larvae reflect the magnitude of up-regulation of the HSP90 gene in response to heat-shock. The demonstrated role of NO as a positive metamorphic regulator in H. momus suggests the existence of inter-specific adaptations of NO regulation in ascidian metamorphosis. © 2013 Ueda, Degnan.

TI  - The structural and preservation conditions for shale gas enrichment and high productivity in the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation, Southeastern Sichuan Basin
VL  - 33
IS  - 3
SP  - 259-276
AB  - We have analysed the Wufeng-Longmaxi shale gas field (gas pool) in the Southeastern Sichuan Basin in the light of previous studies on the main constraints of shale gas field enrichment in North America. We have demonstrated that, unlike the relatively simple tectonic evolutionary history of its North American counterparts, South China, represented by the Sichuan Basin and its peripheral areas, has undergone multiple uplifting events and intense folding and thrusting processes. After the distribution of high-quality shale formations has been identified, the structural and preservation conditions are important determinants of the level of shale gas enrichment and productivity. For a complex structural area that has experienced high thermal evolution to become enriched in shale gas and highly productive, the following prerequisites are indispensable: (1) normal structures, i.e. uplifts and anticlines, the latter being the most favourable structural type for shale gas enrichment; (2) hyperpressure, which is not only an important identifier of the presence of a regionally closed environment, but also, an important signature of natural gas pool enrichment; (3) late regional strike-slipping processes and good roof and floor conditions-the existence of structural conditions for forming and maintaining a compressional-shearing environment and a roof and floor that provide good closure are critical indicators of shale gas enrichment in complex structural areas; (4) distance to any regional aqueous layers and avoidance of faults channelling these aqueous layers.

VL  - 116

SP  - 114-123
AB  - Physiological changes associated with evolutionary and ecological processes such as diversification, range expansion or speciation are still incompletely understood, especially for non-model species. Here we study differences in protein expression in response to temperature in a western Mediterranean diving beetle species complex, using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis with one Moroccan and one Iberian population each of Agabus ramblae and Agabus brunneus. We identified proteins with significant expression differences after thermal treatments comparing them with a reference EST library generated from one of the species of the complex (A. ramblae). The colonisation during the Middle Pleistocene of the Iberian peninsula by A. ramblae, where maximum temperatures and seasonality are lower than in the ancestral north African range, was associated with changes in the response to 27 °C in proteins related to energy metabolism. The subsequent speciation of A. brunneus from within populations of Iberian A. ramblae was associated with changes in the expression of several stress-related proteins (mostly chaperons) when exposed to 4 °C. These changes are in agreement with the known tolerance to lower temperatures of A. brunneus, which occupies a larger geographical area with a wider range of climatic conditions. In both cases, protein expression changes paralleled the evolution of thermal tolerance and the climatic conditions experienced by the species. However, although the colonisation of the Iberian peninsula did not result in morphological change, the speciation process of A. brunneus within Iberia involved genetic isolation and substantial differences in male genitalia and body size and shape. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Experimental evolution of adenylate kinase reveals contrasting strategies toward protein thermostability
VL  - 99
IS  - 3
SP  - 887-896
AB  - Success in evolution depends critically upon the ability of organisms to adapt, a property that is also true for the proteins that contribute to the fitness of an organism. Successful protein evolution is enhanced by mutational pathways that generate a wide range of physicochemical mechanisms to adaptation. In an earlier study, we used a weak-link method to favor changes to an essential but maladapted protein, adenylate kinase (AK), within a microbial population. Six AK mutants (a single mutant followed by five double mutants) had success within the population, revealing a diverse range of adaptive strategies that included changes in nonpolar packing, protein folding dynamics, and formation of new hydrogen bonds and electrostatic networks. The first mutation, AKBSUB Q199R, was essential in defining the structural context that facilitated subsequent mutations as revealed by a considerable mutational epistasis and, in one case, a very strong dependence upon the order of mutations. Namely, whereas the single mutation AKBSUB G213E decreases protein stability by &gt;25°C, the same mutation in the background of AKBSUB Q199R increases stability by 3.4°C, demonstrating that the order of mutations can play a critical role in favoring particular molecular pathways to adaptation. In turn, protein folding kinetics shows that four of the five AKBSUB double mutants utilize a strategy in which an increase in the folding rate accompanied by a decrease in the unfolding rate results in additional stability. However, one mutant exhibited a dramatic increase in the folding relative to a modest increase in the unfolding rate, suggesting a different adaptive strategy for thermostability. In all cases, an increase in the folding rates for the double mutants appears to be the preferred mechanism in conferring additional stability and may be an important aspect of protein evolution. The range of overlapping as well as contrasting strategies for success illustrates both the power and subtlety of adaptation at even the smallest unit of change, a single amino acid. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of the Brucella suis proteome reveals metabolic adaptation to long-term nutrient starvation
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: During the infection process, bacteria are confronted with various stress factors including nutrient starvation. In an in vitro model, adaptation strategies of nutrient-starved brucellae, which are facultative intracellular pathogens capable of long-term persistence, were determined. Results: Long-term nutrient starvation in a medium devoid of carbon and nitrogen sources resulted in a rapid decline in viability of Brucella suis during the first three weeks, followed by stabilization of the number of viable bacteria for a period of at least three weeks thereafter. A 2D-Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE) approach allowed the characterization of the bacterial proteome under these conditions. A total of 30 proteins showing altered concentrations in comparison with bacteria grown to early stationary phase in rich medium were identified. More than half of the 27 significantly regulated proteins were involved in bacterial metabolism with a marked reduction of the concentrations of enzymes participating in amino acid and nucleic acid biosynthesis. A total of 70% of the significantly regulated proteins showed an increased expression, including proteins involved in the adaptation to harsh conditions, in regulation, and in transport. Conclusions: The adaptive response of Brucella suis most likely contributes to the long-term survival of the pathogen under starvation conditions, and may play a key role in persistence. © 2013Al Dahouk et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Does forest continuity enhance the resilience of trees to environmental change?
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
AB  - There is ample evidence that continuously existing forests and afforestations on previously agricultural land differ with regard to ecosystem functions and services such as carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling and biodiversity. However, no studies have so far been conducted on possible long-term (.100 years) impacts on tree growth caused by differences in the ecological continuity of forest stands. In the present study we analysed the variation in tree-ring width of sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) trees (mean age 115-136 years) due to different land-use histories (continuously existing forests, afforestations both on arable land and on heathland). We also analysed the relation of growth patterns to soil nutrient stores and to climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation). Tree rings formed between 1896 and 2005 were widest in trees afforested on arable land. This can be attributed to higher nitrogen and phosphorous availability and indicates that former fertilisation may continue to affect the nutritional status of forest soils for more than one century after those activities have ceased. Moreover, these trees responded more strongly to environmental changes - as shown by a higher mean sensitivity of the tree-ring widths - than trees of continuously existing forests. However, the impact of climatic parameters on the variability in tree-ring width was generally small, but trees on former arable land showed the highest susceptibility to annually changing climatic conditions. We assume that incompletely developed humus horizons as well as differences in the edaphon are responsible for the more sensitive response of oak trees of recent forests (former arable land and former heathland) to variation in environmental conditions. We conclude that forests characterised by a long ecological continuity may be better adapted to global change than recent forest ecosystems. © 2014 von Oheimb et al.

AB  - Ectotherms in water experience rates of heat transfer at least two orders of magnitude greater than in air, seriously constraining their thermoregulatory capabilities. Yet, even in water, individuals may exert control over body temperature (T-b) via behaviors such as selecting thermally favorable microhabitats. The interactions among body size, physiology, and behavior on the thermal biology of large, entirely aquatic, ectotherms is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that alligator snapping turtles (Macroclemmys temminckii) selected microhabitats based on temperature by comparing temperatures at sites used by turtles to temperatures at randomly selected sites. These large turtles selected a narrow range of microhabitats that were significantly warmer and less variable in temperature than random sites. Cooling trials in the laboratory indicated larger turtles equilibrated more slowly to ambient temperature (T-a) than smaller turtles. We recorded T-a and body temperature (T-b) of turtles in the field continuously throughout the year. The T-b generally conformed to T-a but there were periods when T-b - T-a differences were great. These results suggest that while physiology and size of aquatic turtles can affect T-b transiently, microhabitat selection may be the only meaningful mechanism for large, entirely aquatic, turtles to control T-b.

TI  - Direct fitness correlates and thermal consequences of facultative aggregation in a Desert Lizard
VL  - 7
IS  - 7
AB  - Social aggregation is a common behavioral phenomenon thought to evolve through adaptive benefits to group living. Comparing fitness differences between aggregated and solitary individuals in nature - necessary to infer an evolutionary benefit to living in groups - has proven difficult because communally-living species tend to be obligately social and behaviorally complex. However, these differences and the mechanisms driving them are critical to understanding how solitary individuals transition to group living, as well as how and why nascent social systems change over time. Here we demonstrate that facultative aggregation in a reptile (the Desert Night Lizard, Xantusia vigilis) confers direct reproductive success and survival advantages and that thermal benefits of winter huddling disproportionately benefit small juveniles, which can favor delayed dispersal of offspring and the formation of kin groups. Using climate projection models, however, we estimate that future aggregation in night lizards could decline more than 50% due to warmer temperatures. Our results support the theory that transitions to group living arise from direct benefits to social individuals and offer a clear mechanism for the origin of kin groups through juvenile philopatry. The temperature dependence of aggregation in this and other taxa suggests that environmental variation may be a powerful but underappreciated force in the rapid transition between social and solitary behavior. © 2012 Rabosky et al.

TI  - Increasing in cysteine proteinase B expression and enzymatic activity during in vitro differentiation of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis: First evidence of modulation during morphological transition
VL  - 133
SP  - 28-36
AB  - Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis presents adaptive protease-dependent mechanisms, as cysteine proteinases B (CPB). This study investigates the expression of three cpb gene isoforms and CPB enzymatic activity during the parasite differentiation. Relative expression levels of LbrM.08.0810 gene were assessed, exhibiting a higher quantity of transcripts in the logarithmic promastigotes phase than in the stationary promastigotes phase (&gt;1.5 times). The cbp gene tends to decrease during acid pH shock and increases when the temperature rises (&gt;1.3 times). LbrM.08.0820 and LbrM.08.0830 genes exhibited similar expression profiles to LbrM.08.0810 gene, with lower levels being observed overall. The proteolytic activity exhibits a gradual increase during the parasite's differentiation with low levels in samples of logarithmic promastigotes phase (3.2 ± 0.08 mmol min−1 mg protein−1) to a peak of activity after 72 h of incubation at 32 °C (4.2 ± 0.026 mmol min−1 mg protein−1) followed by a subsequent decrease of 68 % of peak activity levels after 96 h of incubation at 32 °C (2.8 ± 0.37 mmol min−1 mg protein−1). These activities were also measured in the presence of selective inhibitors for cysteine proteinases, such as Z-Phe-Phe-fluoromethyl ketone and trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane, demonstrating their source as cathepsin-like proteinases. To the best of our knowledge, this report presents the first description of a modulation of cathepsin L-like expression during the L. (V.) braziliensis in vitro differentiation induced by acid pH and high temperature. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM)

VL  - 3
SP  - 1688-1694
AB  - Temperature is a critical factor that influences the distribution and abundance of animals such as fish. Temperature has these effects at the population and community level because of its effects on processes at the chemical and biochemical levels of organization. Temperature influences the rates at which chemical and biochemical reactions proceed. Temperature also affects the formation and stabilization of weak bonds, which affect the structure and function of DNA, RNA, proteins, and membranes. Together, these physico-chemical effects at the molecular level alter the function of processes at higher levels of biological organization and influence whole-organism performance and fitness. Fishes use a variety of strategies to avoid or mitigate these effects of temperature both on short timescales (behavioral avoidance, biochemical and physiological acclimation) and on long (evolutionary) timescales through the evolution of differing thermal strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Environmental control of asexual reproduction and somatic growth of Aurelia spp. (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa) polyps from the Adriatic Sea
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Polyps of two moon jellyfish species, Aurelia coerulea and A. relicta, from two Adriatic Sea coastal habitats were incubated under multiple combinations of temperature (14, 21°C), salinity (24, 37 ppt) and food regime (9.3, 18.6, 27.9 μg C ind−1 week−1) to comparatively assess how these factors may influence major asexual reproduction processes in the two species. Both species exhibited a shared pattern of budding mode (Directly Budded Polyps: DBP; Stolonal Budded Polyps: SBP), with DBP favoured under low food supply (9.3 μg C ind −1 week−1) and low temperature (14°C), and SBP dominant under high temperature (21°C). However, A. coerulea showed an overall higher productivity than A. relicta, in terms of budding and podocyst production rates. Further, A. coerulea exhibited a wide physiological plasticity across different temperatures and salinities as typical adaptation to ecological features of transitional coastal habitats. This may support the hypothesis that the invasion of A. coerulea across coastal habitats worldwide has been driven by shellfish aquaculture, with scyphistoma polyps and resting stages commonly found on bivalve shells. On the contrary, A. relicta appears to be strongly stenovalent, with cold, marine environmental optimal preferences (salinity 37 ppt, T ranging 14–19°C), corroborating the hypothesis of endemicity within the highly peculiar habitat of the Mljet lake. By exposing A. relicta polyps to slightly higher temperature (21°C), a previously unknown developmental mode was observed, by the sessile polyp regressing into a dispersive, temporarily unattached and tentacle-less, non-feeding stage. This may allow A. relicta polyps to escape climatic anomalies associated to warming of surface layers and deepening of isotherms, by moving into deeper, colder layers. Overall, investigations on species-specific eco-physiological and ontogenetic potentials of polyp stages may contribute to clarify the biogeographic distribution of jellyfish and the phylogenetic relationships among evolutionary related sister clades. © 2017 Hubot et al.

TI  - Size and genotype affect resistance to mortality caused by OsHV-1 in Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 416
SP  - 129-134
AB  - As with summer mortalities reported in France between 2001 and 2006, mortality caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in Crassostrea gigas affects mostly juveniles, although adults can also be impacted to a small extent. This could suggest that both mortalities have similar causes and that establishment of resistance, in particular to the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1), depends on either the size or the age of oysters. The present study reports an investigation of both size and age using three cohorts produced during winter and three produced during summer. Each cohort contained oysters genetically selected to be resistant or susceptible to the summer mortality phenomenon, as well as unselected control oysters. Any abnormal mortality was recorded between production and placement in the field. Transfer to field conditions was then made over thirty deployments between July 2009 and September 2011. All mortalities occurred when seawater temperature was above 16 degrees C, which was termed the 'risk' period. For all deployments made during the risk period, mortality was observed within two weeks post-deployment and most episodes lasted over a week. For deployments made outside of the risk period, mortality occurred as soon as the next risk period began. The absence of detection of OsHV-1 at deployment, the presence of a high viral load of OsHV-1 (>10(+6) DNA copies per mg of fresh tissue) on moribund oysters sampled during peak mortality, and the mortality kinetic all suggest that the mortalities can be attributed to this pathogen alone. The major finding of this study was that the resistance to mortality caused by OsHV-1 increased with both age and size, suggesting a maturation of the immune system against the virus. In field conditions, the relationship between mortality and size was stronger than the relationship between mortality and age. Regression equations of oyster size or age at the onset of the mortality event were derived to estimate the mortality due to OsHV-1. Although larger animals always tended to be more resistant to OsHV-1 than smaller ones, mortality in unselected oysters remained high (>70%) for the size range 0-10 g. Selective breeding to improve resistance to OsHV-1 remains the best way to significantly reduce mortality; however, prudent management strategies for oyster growers could also potentially offer viable solutions. For example, deploying juveniles at a site favouring the growth of oysters after the threat of exposure to OsHV-1 has passed (i.e. at the end of the risk period), and by using cultural practices favouring high growth and/or a site for which the risk period is short due to the seawater temperature. Use of triploid oysters or lines selected for higher growth is also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Environmental factors affecting survival of immature ixodes scapularis and implications for geographical distribution of lyme disease: The climate/behavior hypothesis
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Recent reports suggest that host-seeking nymphs in southern populations of Ixodes scapularis remain below the leaf litter surface, while northern nymphs seek hosts on leaves and twigs above the litter surface. This behavioral difference potentially results in decreased tick contact with humans in the south, and fewer cases of Lyme disease. We studied whether north-south differences in tick survival patterns might contribute to this phenomenon. Four month old larvae resulting from a cross between Wisconsin males and South Carolina females died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the lab, as has previously been reported for ticks from both northern and southern populations. However, newlyemerged larvae from Rhode Island parents did not differ consistently in mortality under northern and southern conditions, possibly because of their younger age. Survival is lower, and so the north-south survival difference might be greater in older ticks. Larval survival was positively related to larval size (as measured by scutal area), while survival was positively related to larval fat content in some, but not all, trials. The difference in larval survival under northern vs. southern conditions might simply result from faster metabolism under warmer southern conditions leading to shorter life spans. However, ticks consistently died faster under southern than under northern conditions in the laboratory when relative humidity was low (75%), but not under moderate (85%) or high (95%) RH. Therefore, mortality due to desiccation stress is greater under southern than under northern conditions. We hypothesize that mortality resulting from the greater desiccation stress under southern conditions acts as a selective pressure resulting in the evolution of host-seeking behavior in which immatures remain below the leaf litter surface in southern I. scapularis populations, so as to avoid the desiccating conditions at the surface. If this hypothesis is correct, it has implications for the effect of climate change on the future distribution of Lyme disease..

TI  - The kinetic and thermodynamic aftermath of horizontal gene transfer governs evolutionary recovery
VL  - 32
IS  - 10
SP  - 2571-2584
AB  - Shared host cells can serve as melting pots for viral genomes, giving many phylogenies a web-like appearance due to horizontal gene transfer. However, not all virus families exhibit web-like phylogenies. Microviruses form three distinct clades, represented by φX174, G4, and α3. Here, we investigate protein-based barriers to horizontal gene transfer between clades. We transferred gene G, which encodes a structural protein, between φX174 and G4, and monitored the evolutionary recovery of the resulting chimeras. In both cases, particle assembly was the major barrier after gene transfer. The G4φXG chimera displayed a temperature-sensitive assembly defect that could easily be corrected through single mutations that promote productive assembly. Gene transfer in the other direction was more problematic. The initial φXG4G chimera required an exogenous supply of both the φX174 major spike G and DNA pilot H proteins. Elevated DNA pilot protein levels may be required to compensate for off-pathway reactions that may have become thermodynamically and/or kinetically favored when the foreign spike protein was present. After three targeted genetic selections, the foreign spike protein was productively integrated into the φX174 background. The first adaption involved a global decrease in gene expression. This was followed by modifications affecting key protein-protein interactions that govern assembly. Finally, gene expression was re-elevated. Although the first selection suppresses nonproductive reactions, subsequent selections promote productive assembly and ultimately viability. However, viable chimeric strains exhibited reduced fitness compared with wild-type. This chimera's path to recovery may partially explain how unusual recombinant viruses could persist long enough to naturally emerge. © The Author 2015.

TI  - Fitness consequences of altered feeding behavior in immune-challenged mosquitoes
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Malaria-infected mosquitoes have been reported to be more likely to take a blood meal when parasites are infectious than when non-infectious. This change in feeding behavior increases the likelihood of malaria transmission, and has been considered an example of parasite manipulation of host behavior. However, immune challenge with heat-killed Escherichia coli induces the same behavior, suggesting that altered feeding behavior may be driven by adaptive responses of hosts to cope with an immune response, rather than by parasite-specific factors. Here we tested the alternative hypothesis that down-regulated feeding behavior prior to infectiousness is a mosquito adaptation that increases fitness during infection. Methods: We measured the impact of immune challenge and blood feeding on the fitness of individual mosquitoes. After an initial blood meal, Anopheles stephensi Liston mosquitoes were experimentally challenged with heat-killed E. coli at a dose known to mimic the same temporal changes in mosquito feeding behavior as active malaria infection. We then tracked daily egg production and survivorship of females maintained on blood-feeding regimes that either mimicked down-regulated feeding behaviors observed during early malaria infection, or were fed on a four-day feeding cycle typically associated with uninfected mosquitoes. Results: Restricting access to blood meals enhanced mosquito survival but lowered lifetime reproduction. Immune-challenge did not impact either fitness component. Combining fecundity and survival to estimate the population-scale intrinsic rate of increase (r), we found that, contrary to the mosquito adaptation hypothesis, mosquito fitness decreased if blood feeding was delayed following an immune challenge. Conclusions: Our data provide no support for the idea that malaria-induced suppression of blood feeding is an adaptation by mosquitoes to reduce the impact of immune challenge. Alternatively, the behavioral alterations may be neither host nor parasite adaptations, but rather a consequence of constraints imposed on feeding by activation of the mosquito immune response, i.e. non-adaptive illness-induced anorexia. Future work incorporating field conditions and different immune challenges could further clarify the effect of altered feeding on mosquito and parasite fitness. © 2016 Ohm et al.

TI  - Sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) phenology in a warming world
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Present-day climate change has altered the phenology (the timing of periodic life cycle events) of many plant and animal populations worldwide. Some of these changes have been adaptive, leading to an increase in population fitness, whereas others have been associated with fitness decline. Representing short-term responses to an altered weather regime, hitherto observed changes are largely explained by phenotypic plasticity. However, to track climatically induced shifts in optimal phenotype as climate change proceeds, evolutionary capacity in key limiting climate-and fitness-related traits is likely to be crucial. In order to produce realistic predictions about the effects of climate change on species and populations, a main target for conservation biologists is thus to assess the potential of natural populations to respond by these two mechanisms. In this study we use a large 15-year dataset on an ectotherm model, the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), to investigate how higher spring temperature is likely to affect oviposition timing in a high latitude population, a trait strongly linked to offspring fitness and survival. Results: With an interest in both the short-and potential long-term effect of rising temperatures, we applied a random regression model, which yields estimates of population-level plasticity and among-individual variation in the average, as well as the plastic, response to temperature. Population plasticity represents capacity for short-term adjustments whereas variation among individuals in a fitness-related trait indicates an opportunity for natural selection and hence for evolutionary adaptation. The analysis revealed both population-level plasticity and individual-level variation in average laying date. In contrast, we found no evidence for variation among females in their plastic responses to spring temperature, which could demonstrate a similarity in responses amongst females, but may also be due to a lack of statistical power to detect such an effect. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that climate warming may have positive fitness effects in this lizard population through an advancement of oviposition date. This prediction is consistent over shorter and potentially also longer time scales as the analysis revealed both population-level plasticity and individual-level variation in average laying date. However, the genetic basis for this variation would have to be examined in order to predict an evolutionary response. © 2015 Ljungström et al.

VL  - 88
IS  - 6
SP  - 2111-2129
AB  - In this study, animal-borne telemetry with temperature sensors was coupled with extensive habitat temperature monitoring in a dimictic reservoir, to test the following hypotheses: behavioural thermoregulation occurs throughout the year and temperature selection varies on a diel and seasonal basis, in a winter-specialist diel-migrating fish. Burbot Lota lota demonstrated nightly behavioural thermoregulation throughout the year, with a large seasonal shift between selection for very cold temperatures (<2 degrees C) optimal for reproduction during the spawning period and selection for warmer temperatures (12-14 degrees C) optimal for hunting and feeding during non-reproductive periods. During daylight hours, while L. lota avoided habitats warmer than optimal for reproduction and feeding during the spawning and non-reproductive periods, respectively, active selection was limited to selection for 4-6 degrees C habitat during the prespawning period. Although behavioural thermoregulation explained the night-time migration, behavioural thermoregulation only partially explained daytime behaviour, indicating that diel migration is best explained by a combination of factors. Thus, thermal-habitat selection was a good predictor of night-time habitat occupancy in a diel-migrating species. Together, these results show that thermal-habitat selection by fishes may be important throughout the year and a more seasonally plastic behaviour than previously recognized.

VL  - 29
IS  - 11
SP  - 2129-2142
AB  - The integration of genetic information with ecological and phenotypic data constitutes an effective approach to gain insight into the mechanisms determining interpopulation variability and the evolutionary processes underlying local adaptation and incipient speciation. Here, we use the Pyrenean Morales grasshopper (Chorthippus saulcyi moralesi) as study system to (i) analyse the relative role of genetic drift and selection in range-wide patterns of phenotypic differentiation and (ii) identify the potential selective agents (environment, elevation) responsible for variation. We also test the hypothesis that (iii) the development of dispersal-related traits is associated with different parameters related to population persistence/turnover, including habitat suitability stability over the last 120 000 years, distance to the species distribution core and population genetic variability. Our results indicate that selection shaped phenotypic differentiation across all the studied morphological traits (body size, forewing length and shape). Subsequent analyses revealed that among-population differentiation in forewing length was significantly explained by a temperature gradient, suggesting an adaptive response to thermoregulation or flight performance under contrasting temperature regimes. We found support for our hypothesis predicting a positive association between the distance to the species distribution core and the development of dispersal-related morphology, which suggests an increased dispersal capability in populations located at range edges that, in turn, exhibit lower levels of genetic variability. Overall, our results indicate that range-wide patterns of phenotypic variation are partially explained by adaptation in response to local environmental conditions and differences in habitat persistence between core and peripheral populations. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Payoffs, Not Tradeoffs, in the Adaptation of a Virus to Ostensibly Conflicting Selective Pressures
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - The genetic architecture of many phenotypic traits is such that genes often contribute to multiple traits, and mutations in these genes can therefore affect multiple phenotypes. These pleiotropic interactions often manifest as tradeoffs between traits where improvement in one property entails a cost in another. The life cycles of many pathogens include periods of growth within a host punctuated with transmission events, such as passage through a digestive tract or a passive stage of exposure in the environment. Populations exposed to such fluctuating selective pressures are expected to acquire mutations showing tradeoffs between reproduction within and survival outside of a host. We selected for individual mutations under fluctuating selective pressures for a ssDNA microvirid bacteriophage by alternating selection for increased growth rate with selection on biophysical properties of the phage capsid in high-temperature or low-pH conditions. Surprisingly, none of the seven unique mutations identified showed a pleiotropic cost; they all improved both growth rate and pH or temperature stability, suggesting that single mutations even in a simple genetic system can simultaneously improve two distinct traits. Selection on growth rate alone revealed tradeoffs, but some mutations still benefited both traits. Tradeoffs were therefore prevalent when selection acted on a single trait, but payoffs resulted when multiple traits were selected for simultaneously. We employed a molecular-dynamics simulation method to determine the mechanisms underlying beneficial effects for three heat-shock mutations. All three mutations significantly enhanced the affinities of protein-protein interfacial bindings, thereby improving capsid stability. The ancestral residues at the mutation sites did not contribute to protein-protein interfacial binding, indicating that these sites acquired a new function. Computational models, such as those used here, may be used in future work not only as predictive tools for mutational effects on protein stability but, ultimately, for evolution. © 2014 McGee et al.

SP  - 291-299
AB  - A new correlation for solution gas–oil ratio (Rs) for gas condensate reservoir was developed in this paper by using genetic programming algorithm of a commercial software (Discipulus) program. Matching PVT experimental data with an equation of state model, a commercial simulator (Eclipse simulator) was used to calculate the solution gas–oil ratio (Rs) values used in this study. More than 1,800 solution gas–oil ratio (Rs) values obtained from the analysis of eight gas condensate fluid PVT laboratory reports, selected under a wide range of reservoir temperature and pressure, composition and condensate yield, were used. Comparisons of the results showed that currently published correlations of gas–oil ratio (Rs) for gas condensate gave poor estimates of its value (the average absolute error for Standing correlation was 63.48 with a standard deviation (SD) equal to 0.724, the average absolute error for Glaso correlation was 61.19 % with a SD equal to 0.688, the average absolute error for Vasques and Beggs correlation was 52.22 % with a SD equal to 0.512, the average absolute error for Marhoun correlation was 56.34 % with a SD equal to 0.519 and the average absolute error for Fattah et al. correlation was 18.6 % with a SD equal to 0.049). The proposed new correlation improved extensively the average absolute error for gas condensate fluids. The average absolute error for the new correlation was 10.54 % with a SD equal to 0.035. Also, the hit-rate (R2) of the new correlation was 0.9799 and the fitness variance was 0.012. The importance of the new correlation comes from depending only on readily available production data in the field and can have wide applications when representative PVT lab reports are not available. © 2014, The Author(s).

VL  - 160

SP  - 2237-2248
AB  - A mortality rate higher than 90 % was observed in a larva-rearing facility for Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus, in China. Larvae showing clinical signs of infection were collected. Initial suspicion of nervous necrosis virus (NNV) infection was confirmed by sequencing, absolute quantification real-time PCR (A-qPCR), and electron microscopy. The nucleotide sequence of RNA2 was 1,375 bases long (GenBank no. KM576685), coding for a single ORF corresponding to the capsid protein from residues 21 to 1034. Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein sequence showed that PCNNV belongs to the barfin flounder NNV (BFNVV) genotype. An amino acid sequence alignment revealed 39 differences between the cold- and warm-resistant viral groups, suggesting that PCNNV evolved under temperature selection. The 3-D structure of the predicted capsid protein was modeled to identify potential epitopes, and the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, yielding a protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa. During PCNNV outbreaks, the viral copy number was found to reach 107 per ng of total RNA, which could be considered the lethal copy number of NNV in cod. The gonads, eggs, fertilized eggs and asymptomatic cod fry were all positive for PCNNV, indicating viral vertical transmission as the main source of the viral load. The amount of virus in the apparent healthy fry or survivors seemed to decrease gradually with development. These results might lead to efficient diagnostic methods to help farmers select NNV-free broodfish for cod breeding. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

TI  - Metabolic power budgeting and adaptive strategies in zoology: Examples from scallops and fish
VL  - 88
IS  - 8
SP  - 753-763
AB  - Evolutionary explanations of the adaptive value of animal characteristics are often expressed in energetic terms, but unless they are accompanied by demonstrations of limited energy availability, they remain speculative. In this review, we argue that metabolic power budgeting provides easily testable mechanisms through which energetically efficient attributes could become adaptive. Given each organism's maximal aerobic (and metabolic) capacity, available metabolic power (energy use per unit time) is limited and must be partitioned between different processes. This leads to compromises among the major fitness functions of growth, locomotor activity, and reproductive investment. As examples of such conflicts, we examine the compromise among growth, reproduction, and predator avoidance in scallops, as well as the means whereby thermal limitations on oxygen uptake reflect the geographical distribution limits and associated energetic trade-offs of temperate zone and polar fishes. These examples show several means whereby the budgeting of aerobic power is implicated in the major fitness trade-offs faced by animals.

TI  - A novel mercuric reductase from the unique deep brine environment of atlantis II in the red sea
VL  - 289
IS  - 3
SP  - 1675-1687
AB  - Aunique combination of physicochemical conditions prevails in the lower convective layer (LCL) of the brine pool at Atlantis II (ATII) Deep in the Red Sea. With a maximum depth of over 2000 m, the pool is characterized by acidic pH (5.3), high temperature (68 °C), salinity (26%), low light levels, anoxia, and high concentrations of heavy metals. We have established a metagenomic dataset derived from the microbial community in the LCL, and here we describe a gene for a novel mercuric reductase, a key component of the bacterial detoxification system for mercuric and organomercurial species. The metagenome-derived gene and an ortholog from an uncultured soil bacterium were synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The properties of their products show that, in contrast to the soil enzyme, the ATII-LCL mercuric reductase is functional in high salt, stable at high temperatures, resistant to high concentrations of Hg2+, and efficiently detoxifies Hg2+ in vivo. Interestingly, despite the marked functional differences between the orthologs, their amino acid sequences differ by less than 10%. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes, in conjunction with three-dimensional modeling, have identified distinct structural features that contribute to extreme halophilicity, thermostability, and high detoxification capacity, suggesting that these were acquired independently during the evolution of this enzyme. Thus, our work provides fundamental structural insights into a novel protein that has undergone multiple biochemical and biophysical adaptations to promote the survival of microorganisms that reside in the extremely demanding environment of the ATII-LCL. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - The abrogation of the germ cells in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) by either genetic means or cell ablation results in about 60% increase of longevity. Upon the inhibition of germline stem cell proliferation, certain signaling molecules inhibit the target of rapamycin (TOR), activate the transcription factors including DAF-16, DAF-12, and PHA-4, leading to altered fatty acid lipolysis, autophagy, stress resistance, and the extended lifespan. But the exact cascades and interactions of those signaling pathways are still obscure. To understand how the reproductive system affects aging at the protein level, we determined the protein expression profile of the long-lived temperature-sensitive mutant glp-1(e2141) and wild-type N2 using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology. Our results showed that the abundance of proteins relevant to transcription, RNA processing, translation, protein folding, and proteolytic process were decreased, while collagen proteins and proteins involved in detoxification and innate immune responses were increased in C. elegans glp-1 mutant, these alterations of protein abundance might attenuate protein metabolism and enhance immune response and stress resistance, and finally contribute to germline-mediated longevity. Biological significance This study provides an overview of the altered protein expression upon germline ablation. Germ-cell loss results in decreased abundance of proteins involved in protein synthesis and breakdown, and increased abundance of proteins involved in detoxification and immune response, suggesting that protein synthesis and metabolism might be attenuated, while detoxification and immune responses might be increased. The altered protein abundance might result in physiological adaptations that contribute to extended longevity in germline-deficient C. elegans. This study brings new light on the role of reproductive control of lifespan. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 42

AB  - The black siliceous mudstones of the Upper Permian Dalong Formation in Sichuan basin are important target zones for shale gas exploration. To facilitate the unconventional hydrocarbon resources exploration in this area, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elemental geochemistry were used to investigate organic matter types, distribution characteristics and enrichment factors in Dalong Formation. According to SEM pictures, organic matter in the Dalong Formation can be divided into morphological organic matter, amorphous organic matter and bitumen. Morphological organic matter is the result of selected preservation, discretely distributed in all lithology samples; disperse organic matter, which can be seen in siliceous mudstones but rarely in siliceous limestone samples, is the principle part of TOC (total organic carbon) of the Dalong Formation, reflecting the adsorption of clay minerals; bitumen formed from dissolved organic matter migration and subsequent high thermal evolution, is distributed in siliceous limestone and limestone samples, rarely in siliceous mudstone samples. Geochemical data indicate that anoxic environment is beneficial to the preservation of organic matter, but the productivity is the main factor to control the change of content of total organic carbon (TOC). Comprehensive correlation research shows that the sea-level rise of the Late Permian led to the increased productivity and anoxic water column in the adjacent oceanic basin. The high content of TOC in organic-matter-rich black siliceous mudstone is the result of sedimentary environment and mineral absorption, and also reflects preservation state of primary organic matter. Migration bitumen should be excluded for hydrocarbon source rock evaluation. © 2017, Editorial Department of Earth Science. All right reserved.

VL  - 24

SP  - 490-500
AB  - Because magmatism conveys radioactive isotopes plus latent heat rapidly upwards while advecting heat, this process, not convection, links and controls Earth's thermal and chemical evolution. On this basis, we present an alternative view of Earth's internal workings. Earth's beginning involved cooling via explosive outgassing of substantial ice (mainly CO) buried with dust during accretion. High carbon content is expected from Solar abundances and ice in comets. Reaction of CO with metal provided a carbide-rich core while converting MgSiO3 to olivine via oxidizing reactions. Because thermodynamic law indicates that primordial heat from gravitational segregation is neither large, nor carried downwards, whereas differentiation forced radioactive elements upwards, formation of the core and lower mantle greatly cooled the Earth. Reference conductive geotherms, calculated by using accurate thermal diffusivity data, require that heat-producing elements are sequestered above 670 km which limits convection to the upper mantle. These irreversible beginnings limit secular cooling to radioactive wind-down, permitting deduction of Earth's inventory of heat-producing elements from today's heat flux. Coupling this estimate with meteoritic data indicates that Earth's oxide content has been underestimated. Density sorting segregated a Si-rich, peridotitic upper mantle from a refractory lower mantle with high Ca, Al and Ti contents, consistent with diamond inclusion mineralogy. Early and rapid differentiation means that internal temperatures have long been buffered by freezing of the inner core, allowing survival of crust as old as similar to 4 Ga. Magmatism remains important. Melt escaping through stress-induced fractures in the rigid lithosphere imparts a lateral component and preferred direction to upper mantle circulation. Mid-ocean magma production over 4.5 Ga has deposited a slab volume at 670 km that is equivalent to the transition zone, thereby continuing differentiation by creating a late-stage chemical discontinuity near 400 km.

TI  - Inheritance of diapause in crosses between the northernmost and the southernmost strains of the asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - The northernmost Harbin strain (N strain) of the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis enters facultative diapause as fully grown larvae in response to short daylengths; whereas the southernmost Ledong strain (S strain) exhibits almost no diapause under the same light conditions. In the present study, we examined the inheritance of diapause induction and termination by crossing the two strains under a range of environmental conditions. The N strain showed a typical long-day response with a critical daylength of approximately 15.88 h at 22°C, 15.72 h at 25°C and 15.14 h at 28°C, whereas the S strain showed a weak photoperiodic response at 22°C. The F1 progeny also showed a long-day response at 22, 25 and 28°C. However, the critical daylengths in S ♀ x N ♂ crosses were significantly longer than those in N ♀ x S ♂ crosses, indicating a sex linkage in the inheritance of diapause induction, with the male parent having more influence on the following F1 progeny. The incidence of diapause in S ♀ x N ♂ crosses was the same as in the N strain under short daylengths of 11-13 h, indicating that diapause trait is completely dominant over the non-diapause trait. The critical daylength in backcross to N was significantly longer than it was in backcross to S, showing a grandfather gene effect. Whether the inheritance of diapause fits an additive hypothesis or not was dependent on the rearing photoperiod, and the capacity for diapause was transmitted genetically in the manner of incomplete dominance. The duration of diapause for the reciprocal crosses under different diapause-terminating conditions showed different patterns of inheritance. The results in this study reveal that genetic and genetic-environmental interactions are involved in diapause induction and termination in O. furnacalis. © 2015 Fu et al.

TI  - Facing the heat: Thermoregulation and behaviour of lowland species of a cold-dwelling butterfly genus, Erebia
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
AB  - Understanding the potential of animals to immediately respond to changing temperatures is imperative for predicting the effects of climate change on biodiversity. Ectothermic animals, such as insects, use behavioural thermoregulation to keep their body temperature within suitable limits. It may be particularly important at warm margins of species occurrence, where populations are sensitive to increasing air temperatures. In the field, we studied thermal requirements and behavioural thermoregulation in low-altitude populations of the Satyrinae butterflies Erebia aethiops, E. euryale and E. medusa. We compared the relationship of individual body temperature with air and microhabitat temperatures for the low-altitude Erebia species to our data on seven mountain species, including a high-altitude population of E. euryale, studied in the Alps. We found that the grassland butterfly E. medusa was well adapted to the warm lowland climate and it was active under the highest air temperatures and kept the highest body temperature of all species. Contrarily, the woodland species, E. aethiops and a low-altitude population of E. euryale, kept lower body temperatures and did not search for warm microclimates as much as other species. Furthermore, temperaturedependence of daily activities also differed between the three low-altitude and the mountain species. Lastly, the different responses to ambient temperature between the low- and highaltitude populations of E. euryale suggest possible local adaptations to different climates. We highlight the importance of habitat heterogeneity for long-term species survival, because it is expected to buffer climate change consequences by providing a variety of microclimates, which can be actively explored by adults. Alpine species can take advantage of warm microclimates, while low-altitude grassland species may retreat to colder microhabitats to escape heat, if needed. However, we conclude that lowland populations of woodland species may be more severely threatened by climate warming because of the unavailability of relatively colder microclimates. © 2016 Kleckova, Klecka.

TI  - Thermal reaction norms between populations with climatic differences of the invader silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) MEAM 1 clade in Colombia
VL  - 35

SP  - 54-61
AB  - Insect species can respond adaptively to stress temperature conditions including both thermal limits and reaction norms. In this study, we considered two populations of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), in which adaptive differentiation was detected for tolerance to upper thermal limits. These two populations are found in two regions of Colombia with climatic differences: the Caribbean region with high environmental temperatures and the Southwest region with lower temperature regimens. We assessed the thermal responses to a range of 1 h heat shocks (37, 39, 41, 43 and 44 °C) performed below the thermal limits for this species. Thermal responses were measured using three life-history traits involved in fitness: survival, fecundity and viability of the offspring after heat shocks. Survival or fecundity as a response to heat shocks did not differ among populations; however, there were significantly different responses for viability between populations. The Southwestern population showed higher viability responses to low heat shocks than the Caribbean population. This relationship suggests a potential trade-off, which appears to be associated with climatic regions. In addition, these results suggest that adaptation under thermal limits does not necessarily involve similar responses throughout the reaction norm. A potential ongoing evolutionary response is taking place through the thermal reaction norms for viability after the invasion by this pest in Colombia. Copyright © ICIPE 2015.

VL  - 31

AB  - The paradigm for the latitudinal gradient in species richness is that it is unimodal with a tropical peak. For 27 published studies, and global datasets of 65 000 recent and 50 000 fossil marine species, we found that almost all datasets were significantly bimodal with a dip in species richness near the equator. The locations of mid-latitude peaks varied between taxa and were higher in the northern hemisphere where the continental shelf is greatest. Our findings support hypotheses of tropical species evolving in response to temperature variation near the edges of the tropics and available high-productivity habitat. They suggest that the equator may already be too hot for some species and that the modes may move further apart due to climate warming. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Stress response regulators identified through genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the (p)ppGpp-dependent response in Rhizobium etli
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - Background: The alarmone (p)ppGpp mediates a global reprogramming of gene expression upon nutrient limitation and other stresses to cope with these unfavorable conditions. Synthesis of (p)ppGpp is, in most bacteria, controlled by RelA/SpoT (Rsh) proteins. The role of (p)ppGpp has been characterized primarily in Escherichia coli and several Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report the first in-depth analysis of the (p)ppGpp-regulon in an α-proteobacterium using a high-resolution tiling array to better understand the pleiotropic stress phenotype of a relA/rsh mutant.Results: We compared gene expression of the Rhizobium etli wild type and rsh (previously rel) mutant during exponential and stationary phase, identifying numerous (p)ppGpp targets, including small non-coding RNAs. The majority of the 834 (p)ppGpp-dependent genes were detected during stationary phase. Unexpectedly, 223 genes were expressed (p)ppGpp-dependently during early exponential phase, indicating the hitherto unrecognized importance of (p)ppGpp during active growth. Furthermore, we identified two (p)ppGpp-dependent key regulators for survival during heat and oxidative stress and one regulator putatively involved in metabolic adaptation, namely extracytoplasmic function sigma factor EcfG2/PF00052, transcription factor CH00371, and serine protein kinase PrkA.Conclusions: The regulatory role of (p)ppGpp in R. etli stress adaptation is far-reaching in redirecting gene expression during all growth phases. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of a strain deficient in a global regulator, and exhibiting a pleiotropic phenotype, enables the identification of more specific regulators that control genes associated with a subset of stress phenotypes. This work is an important step toward a full understanding of the regulatory network underlying stress responses in α-proteobacteria. © 2011 Vercruysse et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Fuzzy optimization control in multi-operative statuses for natural gas reheating furnace of titanium
VL  - 62

SP  - 2140-2145
AB  - A fuzzy optimization control strategy based on the property of distributed parameters is presented. Both the error of furnace temperature and its changing rates at different segments of the reheating furnace are used as the input of fuzzy logic, so that a group of 2-dimension fuzzy controller is designed with respect to every furnace temperature adjustment point. According to the features of two operative statuses, which are rising temperature segment and maintaining temperature segment, the fuzzy control rules are designed respectively. Based on the variable universe theory, an adaptive mutation differential evolution algorithm, in which the dynamic fitness function is constructed and the mutation probability is adaptively regulated according to the evolved generations, is applied to optimize the fuzzy controllers. The running results show that, the method proposed in this paper is good at controlling the temperature of titanium slab furnace. © All Rights Reserved.

TI  - A test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis with ultimate measures of fitness in flour beetles
VL  - 69
SP  - 206-212
AB  - Whole-organism performance of ectotherms depends on body temperature, which is tightly linked to environmental temperatures. Individuals attempting to optimize fitness must thus select appropriate temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that To for traits closely linked to fitness should match temperatures selected by a species (Tset) and should coevolve with Tset. To may mismatch Tset if the thermal reaction norm for fitness is asymmetric. In this study, we examined six traits related to fitness in red and in confused flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum, respectively), including longevity, lifetime reproductive success, reproductive rate, and development time at four temperatures between 23 and 32 °C. For reproductive traits, To matched Tset whereas for longevity To was lower than Tset. Tribolium species have a strongly r-selected life history strategy, therefore reproductive traits are likely more tightly linked to fitness than longevity due to high predation rates at early life stages. We therefore provide support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis for reproductive traits that are tightly linked to fitness. Our results highlight the importance of knowing the relationships of traits to fitness when studying thermal physiology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Emperor penguins breeding on iceshelves
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - We describe a new breeding behaviour discovered in emperor penguins; utilizing satellite and aerial-survey observations four emperor penguin breeding colonies have been recorded as existing on ice-shelves. Emperors have previously been considered as a sea-ice obligate species, with 44 of the 46 colonies located on sea-ice (the other two small colonies are on land). Of the colonies found on ice-shelves, two are newly discovered, and these have been recorded on shelves every season that they have been observed, the other two have been recorded both on ice-shelves and sea-ice in different breeding seasons. We conduct two analyses; the first using synthetic aperture radar data to assess why the largest of the four colonies, for which we have most data, locates sometimes on the shelf and sometimes on the sea-ice, and find that in years where the sea-ice forms late, the colony relocates onto the ice-shelf. The second analysis uses a number of environmental variables to test the habitat marginality of all emperor penguin breeding sites. We find that three of the four colonies reported in this study are in the most northerly, warmest conditions where sea-ice is often sub-optimal. The emperor penguin's reliance on sea-ice as a breeding platform coupled with recent concerns over changed sea-ice patterns consequent on regional warming, has led to their designation as "near threatened" in the IUCN red list. Current climate models predict that future loss of sea-ice around the Antarctic coastline will negatively impact emperor numbers; recent estimates suggest a halving of the population by 2052. The discovery of this new breeding behaviour at marginal sites could mitigate some of the consequences of sea-ice loss; potential benefits and whether these are permanent or temporary need to be considered and understood before further attempts are made to predict the population trajectory of this iconic species. © 2014 Fretwell et al.

TI  - Genetic adaptation to climate inwhite spruce involves small to moderate allele frequency shifts in functionally diverse genes
VL  - 7
IS  - 12
SP  - 3269-3285
AB  - Understanding thegeneticbasis of adaptation toclimate isofparamount importance for preservingandmanaginggenetic diversity in plants in a context of climate change. Yet, this objective has been addressed mainly in short-lived model species. Thus, expanding knowledge to nonmodel species with contrasting life histories, such as forest trees, appears necessary. To uncover the genetic basis of adaptation to climate in the widely distributed boreal conifer white spruce (Picea glauca), an environmental association study was conducted using 11,085 single nucleotide polymorphisms representing 7,819 genes, that is, approximately a quarter of the transcriptome. Linear and quadratic regressions controlling for isolation-by-distance, and the Random Forest algorithm, identified several dozen genes putatively under selection, amongwhich 43 showed strongest signals along temperature and precipitation gradients.Most of them were related to temperature. Small to moderate shifts in allele frequencieswere observed.Genes involved encompassed a wide variety of functions and processes, some of them being likely important for plant survival under biotic and abiotic environmental stresses according to expression data. Literature mining and sequence comparison also highlighted conserved sequences and functions with angiosperm homologs. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions that local adaptation involves genes with small frequency shifts when selection is recent and gene flow among populations is high. Accordingly, genetic adaptation to climate in P. glauca appears to be complex, involving many independent and interacting gene functions, biochemical pathways, and processes. From an applied perspective, these results shall lead to specific functional/association studies in conifers and to the development ofmarkers useful for the conservation of genetic resources. © The Author(s) 2015.

TI  - Thermal adaptation and phosphorus shape thermal performance in an assemblage of rainforest ants
VL  - 97
IS  - 4
SP  - 1038-1047
AB  - We studied the Thermal Performance Curves (TPCs) of 87 species of rainforest ants and found support for both the Thermal Adaptation and Phosphorus-Tolerance hypotheses. TPCs relate a fitness proxy (here, worker speed) to environmental temperature. Thermal Adaptation posits that thermal generalists (ants with flatter, broader TPCs) are favored in the hotter, more variable tropical canopy compared to the cooler, less variable litter below. As predicted, species nesting in the forest canopy 1) had running speeds less sensitive to temperature; 2) ran over a greater range of temperatures; and 3) ran at lower maximum speeds. Tradeoffs between tolerance and maximum performance are often invoked for constraining the evolution of thermal generalists. There was no evidence that ant species traded off thermal tolerance for maximum speed, however. Phosphorus-Tolerance is a second mechanism for generating ectotherms able to tolerate thermal extremes. It posits that ants active at high temperatures invest in P-rich machinery to buffer their metabolism against thermal extremes. Phosphorus content in ant tissue varied three-fold, and as predicted, temperature sensitivity was lower and thermal range was higher in P-rich species. Combined, we show how the vertical distribution of hot and variable vs. cooler and stable microclimates in a single forest contribute to a diversity of TPCs and suggest that a widely varying P stoichiometry among these ants may drive some of these differences. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Evolutionary determinants of population differences in population growth rate × habitat temperature interactions in Chironomus riparius
VL  - 172
IS  - 2
SP  - 585-594
AB  - Little is known about intraspecific variation in fitness performance in response to thermal stress among natural populations and how this relates to evolutionary aspects of species ecology. In this study, population growth rate (PGR; a composite fitness measure) varied among five natural Chironomus riparius populations sampled across a climatic gradient when subjected to three temperature treatments reflecting the typical range of summer habitat temperatures (20, 24 and 28 °C). The variation could be explained by a complex model including effects of genetic drift, genetic diversity and adaptation to average temperature during the warmest month, in addition to experimental temperature. All populations suffered a decrease in PGR from 20 to 28 °C and ΔPGR was significantly correlated with the respective average habitat temperature in the warmest month-populations from warmer areas showing lower ΔPGR. This implies that long-term exposure to higher temperatures in the warmest month (the key reproductive period for C. riparius) is likely to be a key selective force influencing fitness at higher temperatures. A comparison of phenotypic divergence and neutral genetic differentiation revealed that one phenotypic trait-the number of fertile egg masses per female-appeared to be under positive selection in some populations. Our findings support a role for response to temperature selection along a climatic gradient and suggest population history is a key determinant of intraspecific fitness variation. We stress the importance of integrating different types of data (climatic, experimental, genetic) in order to understand the effects of global climate change on biodiversity. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 23

SP  - 1278-1285
AB  - Separating genetic and environmental causes of the latitudinal differences among populations is crucial when evaluating the potential for microevolutionary responses to the changing environment. We studied among-population and environmental components of variation in several life-history traits of a lichen-feeding moth Eilema depressum when offspring of replicate Swiss and Finnish females were reared in a common-garden factorial experiment. A partial second generation was produced only among Swiss larvae, more likely so at higher temperature regime and higher host quality, and more frequently among the offspring of particular females. Growth rates of larvae that chose the diapause development were higher in northern individuals. Our results thus reveal adaptive differences between latitudinal populations in studied life-history traits, allowing to expect rapid adaptation of the species to further environmental changes. In contrast, invariable responses of the growth rates of the larvae to temperature and host quality support the idea that some basic parameters of insect growth show a high degree of evolutionary conservatism. © 2010 The Authors.

TI  - Maternal effects influence phenotypes and survival during early life stages in an aquatic turtle
VL  - 29
IS  - 2
SP  - 268-276
AB  - Offspring phenotypic variation can be substantially influenced by non-genetic factors such as maternal effects, which ultimately can influence organismal fitness. For oviparous organisms that lack parental care, oviposition-site choice and egg size are maternal effects that can greatly affect offspring traits. Yet, few studies examine the consequences of these traits in the wild. We manipulated the contents of natural painted turtle nests such that offspring spent two life stages (incubation and hibernation) in either maternally selected nest sites or randomly selected nest sites and quantified treatment differences in environmental parameters and offspring phenotypes. Additionally, we tracked the fates of individual eggs and hatchlings, which allowed us to quantify the strength and form of selection acting on egg size during incubation and, for the first time, body size during hibernation. Maternally selected nest sites were warmer and produced offspring that were longer and hatched earlier than their siblings emerging from cooler, randomly selected nests. Treatments did not affect any measured traits during hibernation. We detected no selection on egg size during the incubation stage, but significant linear selection favouring larger hatchlings during hibernation. Our results suggest that nest-site choice allows mothers to partially control the environment of their incubating eggs, but is less effective at controlling hatchling environments during hibernation. Additionally, we provide novel support for the 'bigger-is-better' hypothesis in turtles by showing a positive relationship between size and survival during the hibernation stage. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

VL  - 19

SP  - 2303-2338
AB  - We review the evidence of how organisms and populations are currently responding to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, genotypic evolution, changes in distribution and, in some cases, local extinction. Organisms alter their gene expression and metabolism to increase the concentrations of several antistress compounds and to change their physiology, phenology, growth and reproduction in response to climate change. Rapid adaptation and microevolution occur at the population level. Together with these phenotypic and genotypic adaptations, the movement of organisms and the turnover of populations can lead to migration toward habitats with better conditions unless hindered by barriers. Both migration and local extinction of populations have occurred. However, many unknowns for all these processes remain. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic evolution and their possible trade-offs and links with population structure warrant further research. The application of omic techniques to ecological studies will greatly favor this research. It remains poorly understood how climate change will result in asymmetrical responses of species and how it will interact with other increasing global impacts, such as N eutrophication, changes in environmental N : P ratios and species invasion, among many others. The biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks on climate of all these changes in vegetation are also poorly understood. We here review the evidence of responses to climate change and discuss the perspectives for increasing our knowledge of the interactions between climate change and life. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Adaptive regulatory substitutions affect multiple stages in the life cycle of the bacteriophage phi X174
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Previously, we showed that adaptive substitutions in one of the three promoters of the bacteriophage φX174 improved fitness at high-temperature by decreasing transcript levels three- to four-fold. To understand how such an extreme change in gene expression might lead to an almost two-fold increase in fitness at the adaptive temperature, we focused on stages in the life cycle of the phage that occur before and after the initiation of transcription. For both the ancestral strain and two single-substitution strains with down-regulated transcription, we measured seven phenotypic components of fitness (attachment, ejection, eclipse, virion assembly, latent period, lysis rate and burst size) during a single cycle of infection at each of two temperatures. The lower temperature, 37°C, is the optimal temperature at which phages are cultivated in the lab; the higher temperature, 42°C, exerts strong selection and is the condition under which these substitutions arose in evolution experiments. We augmented this study by developing an individual-based stochastic model of this same life cycle to explore potential explanations for our empirical results. Results: Of the seven fitness parameters, three showed significant differences between strains that carried an adaptive substitution and the ancestor, indicating the presence of pleiotropy in regulatory evolution. 1) Eclipse was longer in the adaptive strains at both the optimal and high-temperature environments. 2) Lysis rate was greater in the adaptive strains at the high temperature. 3) Burst size for the mutants was double that of the ancestor at the high temperature, but half that at the lower temperature. Simulation results suggest that eclipse length and latent period variance can explain differences in burst sizes and fitness between the mutant and ancestral strains. Conclusions: Down-regulating transcription affects several steps in the phage life cycle, and all of these occur after the initiation of transcription. We attribute the apparent tradeoff between delayed progeny production and faster progeny release to improved host resource utilization at high temperature. © 2013 Brown et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 120

SP  - 700-704
AB  - Polistes paper wasps have striking and variable colour patterns. Although these colour patterns are known to function in communication, little is known about how they affect fitness in relation to the abiotic environment. In the present study, we used dried-preserved museum specimens, comprising male and female Polistes from all over the world, aiming to test for a correlation between the body luminance (assessed by digital photography) and environmental temperature (assessed by the available online environmental databases). We found that the female thorax and abdomen are darker (low luminance) in colder compared to warmer environments. In males, however, body luminance is not associated with environmental temperature. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that darker insects have an advantage in colder environments because they can heat faster than lighter ones (thermal melanism hypothesis). By showing that melanic Polistes inhabit cooler areas more than the brighter species, we presume that selection for effective heating may provide an adaptive explanation for the evolution of Polistes colour diversity.

AB  - A 3D finite element analysis has been carried out of the whole manufacturing process of a shackle involving the steps of closed-die forging and de-flashing of the extremity jaws, the open-die forging of the central body, and the ram bending of the crown. Thermal effects related to the transportation from the gas furnace to the mechanical press and from convective/radiative cooling were also taken into consideration. An elastic-plastic law with viscous effects was used to describe the thermo-mechanical behavior of the 34CrNiMo6 low alloy steel used for the shackle. Based on a fully coupled thermo-mechanical approach, the evolution of thermal and mechanical parameters was studied in details and compared with experimental measurements. A good agreement between the predicted and the experimental data for the die load, process energy, and the dimensions of the flash and the shackle was obtained. This study showed that design, optimization, and analysis of parameters for the manufacturing of shackles can be done efficiently with the use of the numerical simulation; such a numerical design could enhance the productivity. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.

TI  - Chemical looping of metal nitride catalysts: Low-pressure ammonia synthesis for energy storage
VL  - 6
IS  - 7
SP  - 3965-3974
AB  - The activity of many heterogeneous catalysts is limited by strong correlations between activation energies and adsorption energies of reaction intermediates. Although the reaction is thermodynamically favourable at ambient temperature and pressure, the catalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3), a fertilizer and chemical fuel, from N2 and H2 requires some of the most extreme conditions of the chemical industry. We demonstrate how ammonia can be produced at ambient pressure from air, water, and concentrated sunlight as renewable source of process heat via nitrogen reduction with a looped metal nitride, followed by separate hydrogenation of the lattice nitrogen into ammonia. Separating ammonia synthesis into two reaction steps introduces an additional degree of freedom when designing catalysts with desirable activation and adsorption energies. We discuss the hydrogenation of alkali and alkaline earth metal nitrides and the reduction of transition metal nitrides to outline a promoting role of lattice hydrogen in ammonia evolution. This is rationalized via electronic structure calculations with the activity of nitrogen vacancies controlling the redox-intercalation of hydrogen and the formation and hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrogen species. The predicted trends are confirmed experimentally with evolution of 56.3, 80.7, and 128 μmol NH3 per mol metal per min at 1 bar and above 550 °C via reduction of Mn6N2.58 to Mn4N and hydrogenation of Ca3N2 and Sr2N to Ca2NH and SrH2, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2015.

TI  - Ecological fitness and virulence features of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in estuarine environments
VL  - 101
IS  - 5
SP  - 1781-1794
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a commonly encountered and highly successful organism in marine ecosystems. It is a fast-growing, extremely versatile copiotroph that is active over a very broad range of conditions. It frequently occurs suspended in the water column (often attached to particles or zooplankton), and is a proficient colonist of submerged surfaces. This organism is an important pathogen of animals ranging from microcrustaceans to humans and is a causative agent of seafood-associated food poisoning. This review examines specific ecological adaptations of V. parahaemolyticus, including its broad tolerances to temperature and salinity, its utilization of a wide variety of organic carbon and energy sources, and its pervasive colonization of suspended and stationary materials that contribute to its success and ubiquity in temperate and tropical estuarine ecosystems. Several virulence-related features are examined, in particular the thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH), the TDH-related hemolysin (TRH), and the type 3 secretion system, and the possible importance of these features in V. parahaemolyticus pathogenicity is explored. The impact of new and much more effective PCR primers on V. parahaemolyticus detection and our views of virulent strain abundance are also described. It is clear that strains carrying the canonical virulence genes are far more common than previously thought, which opens questions regarding the role of these genes in pathogenesis. It is also clear that virulence is an evolving feature of V. parahaemolyticus and that novel combinations of virulence factors can lead to emergent virulence in which a strain that is markedly more pathogenic evolves and propagates to produce an outbreak. The effects of global climate change on the frequency of epidemic disease, the geographic distribution of outbreaks, and the human impacts of V. parahaemolyticus are increasing and this review provides information on why this ubiquitous human pathogen has increased its footprint and its significance so dramatically. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Dimethoxymethane or DMM is a versatile chemical with applications in many industries such as paints, perfume, pharmacy, and fuel additives. DMM can be produced through the reaction of methanol and formaldehyde in the presence of acid catalysts or, directly, through the selective oxidation of methanol over catalysts with redox and acid functionalities. In terms of sustainability, the so-called bio-methanol derived from syngas obtained via biomass gasification can be used in DMM synthesis. In this review article, we have condensed and classified the research outputs published over the past decade aimed at producing DMM from methanol over different types of catalysts. The majority of studies described the reaction of methanol to DMM in a promising way using heterogeneous catalysts in the gas phase for the ease of product and catalyst recovery as well as suitability for continuous processing. Likewise, the influence of parameters including catalyst component, feed composition, and temperature on the performance of catalysts utilised in DMM production is analysed and discussed. Further, some perspectives concerning the evolution of potential DMM market with respect to the characteristics of the best catalyst materials for high DMM productivity are expressed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

TI  - Adaptive genetic diversity of trees for forest conservation in a future climate: A case study on Norway spruce in Austria
VL  - 22
IS  - 5
SP  - 1151-1166
AB  - Genetic resources of forest trees are considered as a key factor for the persistence of forest ecosystems because the ability of tree species to survive under changing climate depends strongly on their intraspecific variation in climate response. Therefore, utilizing available genetic variation in climate response and planting alternative provenances suitable for future climatic conditions is considered as an important adaptation measure for forestry. On the other hand, the distribution of adaptive genetic diversity of many tree species is still unknown and the predicted shift of ecological zones and species' distribution may threaten forest genetic resources that are important for adaptation. Here, we use Norway spruce in Austria as a case study to demonstrate the genetic variation in climate response and to analyse the existing network of genetic conservation units for its effectiveness to safeguard the hotspots of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity of this species. An analysis of the climate response of 480 provenances, clustered into 9 groups of climatically similar provenances, revealed high variation among provenance groups. The most productive and promising provenance clusters for future climates originate from three regions that today depict the warmest and driest areas of the natural spruce distribution in Austria. Gap analysis of the Austrian genetic conservation units in the EUFGIS Portal suggests adequate coverage of the genetic hotspots in southern parts of Austria, but not in eastern and northern Austria. Therefore conservation measures and sustainable utilization of the valuable genetic resources in these regions need to be expanded to cover their high adaptive genetic variation and local adaptation to a warmer climate. The study shows that current conservation efforts need to be evaluated for their effectiveness to protect genetic resources that are important for the survival of trees in a future climate. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 13

AB  - For the smelting ferrotungsten of raw materials (mineral) took us to calculate the charge for each experiment. To optimize the process of obtaining ferrotungsten of wolframite carried out the following activities: to reduce speed and combustion temperature. A change batch positive impact on the development of the combustion process. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the introduction of aluminium additives in excess of stoichiometry because the explosive burning regime turned into stationary. In this work the charge calculated on 300 g volframite concentrate so that as a result of the aluminotermic reaction in the alloy contained 70% of tungsten. Calculations of charge showed that in the case of the smelting of ferro-alloys and master alloys used in this work and have a high melting point (ferrotungsten, ferromolybdenum, etc.) - temperature process of melting alloy is indispensable for the success of melting. To reduce the speed of combustion and the temperature were conducted experiments on selection of ballast additives which allows you to bring the process to a smooth flow of the reaction. As ballast additives used aluminium oxide. It was found that an increase of more than 20 additives reducing the release of the alloy and metal extraction. Also included experiments on selection of warm additives. Use as a warm additive of ammonium nitrate is not desirable because of the rapid reaction and loss of metal slag. The output and the extraction of metal in the application of potassium and sodium nitrate are the same but in the case of kalievoj nitrate slag can be used as a prolonged potash fertilizer. From the x-ray spectrometer alloys were analyzed. © 2011 al-Farabi Kazakh National University.

TI  - Trade-offs between growth and maturation: the cost of reproduction for surviving environmental extremes
VL  - 178
IS  - 3
SP  - 723-732
AB  - Life-history trade-offs and the costs of reproduction are central concepts in evolution and ecology. Episodic climatic events such as drought and extreme temperatures provide strong selective pressures that can change the balance of these costs and trade-offs. We used size-structured matrix models parameterized from field and laboratory studies to examine the effect of periodic drought on two species of aquatic salamanders (greater siren, Siren lacertina; lesser siren, Siren intermedia) that differ in size at reproduction and maximum body size. Post-drought body size distributions of the larger species (S. lacertina) are consistent with size-dependent mortality. Smaller individuals were extirpated from the population during each drought while large animals persisted, a pattern that contrasted with that seen in several ectotherms. This appears to be largely explained by estivation proficiency and a positive relationship between body size and estivation potential. Increased body size, however, may come at the cost of fecundity and maturation rate compared to a closely related congener. The cost of somatic allocation in this case may manifest itself via reduced per-capita competitive ability, which (at least in simulation studies) allows the smaller, fast-maturing species to outcompete the larger, slow-maturing species when drought is minimal or nonexistent. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Protein/glycerol blends and injection-molded bioplastic matrices: Soybean versus egg albumen
VL  - 133
IS  - 6
AB  - Two well-known proteins have been selected in order to produce bioplastics through injection molding: a soy protein isolate (SPI) and an egg white albumen concentrate (EW). Each of them has been thoroughly mixed with glycerol (40 wt %) and the blend then obtained have been characterized by means of rheological and thermomechanical techniques, which allowed the optimization of the processing moulding conditions (cylinder temperature, 60 degrees C-65 degrees C; mould temperature, 120 degrees C; post-injection pressure, 500-600 bars). Once bioplastics were obtained, their thermomechanical and tensile properties, as well as their water uptake capacity and transparency were evaluated. Bioplastics containing EW showed higher values in the elastic and loss moduli, E and E, from -30 degrees C to 130 degrees C, than the corresponding SPI bioplastic. However, they both showed qualitatively the same evolution with temperature, where E and E decreased up to a plateau at high temperatures. When examining their tensile and water uptake properties is found that SPI bioplastics are more ductile and present enhanced water uptake behavior over EW bioplastics, which on the other hand possess higher Young's modulus. SPI seems to provide tougher bioplastics, being an excellent option for potential superabsorbent applications, whereas EW would suit for those applications requiring higher mechanical properties.

AB  - An in vitro evolution is a simplified Darwinian evolution in well-controlled surroundings. This evolution process can be modeled as a hill-climbing or adaptive walk on a fitness landscape in sequence space. The evolving molecular system gains at least two kinds of information originating from the converged sequences and the fitness increment of the evolving biopolymer as the adaptive walker. These two represent two aspects of the biomolecular information, its extent and its content, respectively. Here, we review studies related to formulation of the "content" and "extent" of biomolecular information. The two aspects are interconnected through physicochemical properties of the biopolymer, contrary to the case of conventional information, which seems to be independent of matter. The interconnection was analyzed based on the analogy between the evolution process and thermodynamics. The linear combination of the two by a temperature-like fluctuation factor resulted in a free-energy-like monotonically increasing function during the evolution process. © 2009 International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer.

TI  - Contemporary temperature-driven divergence in a Nordic freshwater fish under conditions commonly thought to hinder adaptation
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Evaluating the limits of adaptation to temperature is important given the IPCC-predicted rise in global temperatures. The rate and scope of evolutionary adaptation can be limited by low genetic diversity, gene flow, and costs associated with adaptive change. Freshwater organisms are physically confined to lakes and rivers, and must therefore deal directly with climate variation and change. In this study, we take advantage of a system characterised by low genetic variation, small population size, gene flow and between-trait trade-offs to study how such conditions affect the ability of a freshwater fish to adapt to climate change. We test for genetically-based differences in developmental traits indicating local adaptation, by conducting a common-garden experiment using embryos and larvae from replicate pairs of sympatric grayling demes that spawn and develop in natural cold and warm water, respectively. These demes have common ancestors from a colonization event 22 generations ago. Consequently, we explore if diversification may occur under severely constraining conditions. Results. We found evidence for divergence in ontogenetic rates. The divergence pattern followed adaptation predictions as cold-deme individuals displayed higher growth rates and yolk conversion efficiency than warm-deme individuals at the same temperature. The cold-deme embryos had a higher rate of muscle mass development. Most of the growth-and development differences occurred prior to hatch. The divergence was probably not caused by genetic drift as there was a strong degree of parallelism in the divergence pattern and because phenotypic differentiation (QST) was larger than estimated genetic drift levels (microsatellite FST) between demes from different temperature groups. We also document that these particular grayling populations cannot develop successfully at temperatures above 12°C, whereas other European populations can, and that increasing the muscle mass development rate comes at the cost of some skeletal trait development rates. Conclusions. This study shows that genetically based phenotypic divergence can prevail even under conditions of low genetic variation and ongoing gene flow. Furthermore, population-specific maximum development temperatures along with musculoskeletal developmental trade-offs may constrain adaptation. © 2010 Kavanagh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The analysis of this study focused on the tea growing areas of Northeast India to provide predictions for future climate scenarios and its impact on tea production by 2050. The applied methodology involves a combination of current climate data with future climate change predictions from different models for 2050 as derived by WorldClim and IPCC4 (CIAT recommended). The results showed the possibility of an increase in average temperature by 2W C in 2050, while not much variation is observed in the rainfall pattern. A change in tea production period is also expected by 2050 making tea planters look for alternative crops as an adaptive measure to keep the industry on its feet. With such expected impacts on tea production, the planters would need to make changes in their management practices to adapt to the evolving conditions and environment. In this study, the climate data were used as input to DIVA GIS Model. Monthly climate data were fed into Cranfield University Plantation Productivity Analysis for Tea Model (CUPPA Tea Model) to simulate observed and predicted yields. The study further shows that the overall climate will become less seasonal in terms of variation through the years followed by expected variations in monthly precipitation during the peak production months. © IWA Publishing 2014.

AB  - Reproduction in salmonids is characterized by intense sexual selection, where intrasexual competition is fierce, leading to a high variance in reproductive success. Females are known to build a redd, a form of parental care, whereas males apparently do not provide paternal care. In brown trout (Salmo trutta), one of the most semelparous salmonids, the intrasexual competition is direct for males, and body size generally predicts the outcome, whereas it is mostly indirect for females. While the relationship between mating success and phenotype, such as body size or color patterns has been investigated, there are far less data available on intersexual preference in salmonids. It is generally supposed to be aimed at indirect benefits, such as good genes or compatible genes. But the brown trout presents an intriguing case, where selective pressures on freshly laid eggs can be strong and are directly correlated to intrasexual competition. Indeed, dramatic cannibalism events can be observed before the female can cover the redd with gravels, especially when operational sex ratio is high (number of males on number of females). As a countermeasure, some males exhibit post-fertilization aggressive behaviour that reduce the opportunity for cannibalism. This opens an interesting perspective in salmonids: female preference for males could be directed at both indirect and direct benefits (here egg protection). Because the selective pressure controlling for egg survival is driven by environment (density and phenotypes of males for instance), the potential for evolution is also therefore dependent on environmental change: habitat modification, connectivity, temperature and water discharge dynamics. These parameters affect the population density, the distribution of phenotypes and the fitness of eggs depending on redd location. In this chapter, we describe recently acquired knowledge on the evolution of the brown trout reproductive system with emphasis on the interaction between sexual and natural selection. We then propose possible paths in order to make decisive advances in this area, and explain how environmental change may shape the stage for the outcome of mating system evolution in brown trout. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - In the world agriculture, the potatoes acreage tends to decrease, and production increases to 280 million t, i.e. in some countries, the average yield is 30-40 t/ha, which became possible due to the technological progress in agriculture and related industries. However, the potential of biological and economic productivity of the potato remains far unused. In many states, the yield of potatoes remains low, particularly in Russia. Considering potato yield in the Russian Federation, we can state that in the southern areas, due to the climatic conditions, this indicator leaves much to be desired. Due to the hot summer and the high infectious background of viral disease carriers, the seed qualities of prime reproductions degenerate rapidly. All this obliges searching for the best variants of cleaning seed tubers from viral, viroid and mycoplasmal diseases. The lack of high quality planting material, untimely varietal updating, introduction of non-adaptive varieties result in a decreased productivity of the crop and obtaining low yields of tubers with fragile immune system. In this regard, creating potato varieties that are resistant to biotic and abiotic factors of the environment adapted to the conditions of cultivation and ecologically plastic remains an importanttaskof all breeding programs. According to the results of scientific research work (SRW), samples of potatoes that were adaptive to the conditions of the mountains and foothills have been annually taken as donors for future hybridization and creating new immune varieties, based on studying their varietal peculiarities in a collection nursery, and identifying their dominant characteristics. Sources of the main signs that correlate with productivity and resistance to diseases have been detected, which correspond to the created models of varieties for various environmental conditions of mountains and foothills of the North Caucasus region. The maximum attention has been paid to table varieties, and to their resistance to late blight, heat and drought. Individual elements of innovative technologies ofcultivating seed and food potatoes of the most promising varieties and hybrids of Russian and foreign selection have been proposed. Source material has been created, which has been gathered by the complex of valuable economic and biologic features. Parameters of growing sprouts have been justified for various planting schemes, and temperature regimes in the conditions of artificial lighting. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

VL  - 5
AB  - Extremely cold environments are a challenge for all organisms. They are mostly inhabited by psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria, which employ various strategies to cope with the cold. Such harsh environments are often highly vulnerable to the influence of external factors and may undergo frequent dynamic changes. The rapid adjustment of bacteria to changing environmental conditions is crucial for their survival. Such "short-term" evolution is often enabled by plasmids-extrachromosomal replicons that represent major players in horizontal gene transfer. The genomic sequences of thousands of microorganisms, including those of many cold-active bacteria have been obtained over the last decade, but the collected data have yet to be thoroughly analyzed. This report describes the results of a meta-analysis of the NCBI sequence databases to identify and characterize plasmids of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria. We have performed in-depth analyses of 66 plasmids, almost half of which are cryptic replicons not exceeding 10 kb in size. Our analyses of the larger plasmids revealed the presence of numerous genes, which may increase the phenotypic flexibility of their host strains. These genes encode enzymes possibly involved in (i) protection against cold and ultraviolet radiation, (ii) scavenging of reactive oxygen species, (iii) metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides and lipids, (iv) energy production and conversion, (v) utilization of toxic organic compounds (e.g., naphthalene), and (vi) resistance to heavy metals, metalloids and antibiotics. Some of the plasmids also contain type II restriction-modification systems, which are involved in both plasmid stabilization and protection against foreign DNA. Moreover, approx. 50% of the analyzed plasmids carry genetic modules responsible for conjugal transfer or mobilization for transfer, which may facilitate the spread of these replicons among various bacteria, including across species boundaries. © 2014 Dziewit and Bartosik.

TI  - Living on the edge: Conservation Genetics of Seven Thermophilous Plant Species in a High Arctic Archipelago
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Small, isolated and/or peripheral populations are expected to harbour low levels of genetic variation and may therefore have reduced adaptability to environmental change, including climate warming. In the Arctic, global warming has already caused vegetation change across the region and is acting as a significant stressor on Arctic biodiversity. Many of the rare plants in the Arctic are relicts from early Holocene warm periods, but their ability to benefit from the current warming is dependent on the viability of their populations. We therefore examined Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data from regional red listed vascular plant species in the High Arctic archipelago of Svalbard and reference populations from the main distribution area of: (1) Botrychium lunaria, (2) Carex capillaris ssp. fuscidula, (3) Comastoma tenellum, (4) Kobresia simpliciuscula ssp. subholarctica, (5) Ranunculus wilanderi, (6) Sibbaldia procumbens and (7) Tofieldia pusilla. In addition, we gathered population size data in Svalbard. The Svalbard populations had low genetic diversity and distinctiveness and few or no private markers compared to populations outside the archipelago. This is similar to observations in other rare species in Svalbard and the genetic depletion may be due to an initial founder effect and/or a genetic bottleneck caused by late Holocene cooling. There seems to be limited gene flow from other areas and the Svalbard populations should therefore be considered as demographically independent management units. Overall, these management units have small and/or few populations and are therefore prone to stochastic events which may further increase vulnerability to inbreeding depression, loss of genetic variation, and reduced evolutionary potential. Our results support theory predicting lower levels of genetic diversity in small, isolated and/or peripheral populations and may be of importance for management of other rare plant species in the Arctic. © The Authors 2017.

VL  - 24

SP  - 3628-3638
AB  - Understanding landscape processes driving patterns of population genetic differentiation and diversity has been a long-standing focus of ecology and evolutionary biology. Gene flow may be reduced by historical, ecological or geographic factors, resulting in patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) or isolation by environment (IBE). Although IBE has been found in many natural systems, most studies investigating patterns of IBD and IBE in nature have used anonymous neutral genetic markers, precluding inference of selection mechanisms or identification of genes potentially under selection. Using landscape genomics, the simultaneous study of genomic and ecological landscapes, we investigated the processes driving population genetic patterns of White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) in sky islands (montane forest habitat islands) of the Madrean Archipelago. Using more than 4000 single nucleotide polymorphisms and multiple tests to investigate the relationship between genetic differentiation and geographic or ecological distance, we identified IBE, and a lack of IBD, among sky island populations of S. carolinensis. Using three tests to identify selection, we found 79 loci putatively under selection; of these, seven matched CDS regions in the Zebra Finch. The loci under selection were highly associated with climate extremes (maximum temperature of warmest month and minimum precipitation of driest month). These results provide evidence for IBE - disentangled from IBD - in sky island vertebrates and identify potential adaptive genetic variation. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of lead (Pb) on regulatory proteins linked to mechanisms of animal adaptation to polluted environments (using in vivo and in vitro tests) and to validate the in vitro assay as a tool for environmental assessment. Specimens of the bivalve Corbicula fluminea were exposed to nominal concentrations of Pb 5 mg l -1 for 96 h. Isolated gill cells were exposed to three concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM) for 5 h. Metal toxicity was evaluated by cell viability (trypan blue exclusion). We also analyzed Na +/K + adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and carbonic anhydrase activity. Additionally, the multixenobiotic-resistance (MXR) phenotype was evaluated by the accumulation of rhodamine B (RB). Immunolabeling was used to quantify the expression of P-glycoproteins (C219) and proteins involved in ion transport, water movement, and cellular repair using antibodies against Na +/K + ATPase, aquaporin 1, and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Pb was shown to be toxic in both in vivo and in vitro tests, in which cellular viability significantly decreased by approximately 25%. Cellular viability in the in vivo assays was determined by gill cell isolation after the entire animal was exposed to Pb. We observed that Na +/K + ATPase activity was inhibited by 70%. Also, the expression of the MXR phenotype significantly increased in our in vivo tests. A statistically significant difference was observed in the expression of all proteins in the in vitro assays, whereas only Hsp70 increased in vivo. Employing these analyses, we could validate the sensitivity of the in vitro tests and can propose our in vitro model as a possible tool for environmental assessment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

VL  - 7

AB  - High-throughput genomic methods are increasingly used to investigate invertebrate thermal responses with greater dimensionality and resolution than previously achieved. However, corresponding methods for characterizing invertebrate phenotypes are still lacking. To scale up the characterization of invertebrate thermal responses, we propose a novel use of thermocyclers as temperature-controlled incubators. Here, we tested the performance of thermocyclers as incubators and demonstrated the application of this method to efficiently characterize the thermal responses of model and non-model invertebrates. We found the thermocyclers performed with high precision, accuracy and resolution under various and fluctuating ambient conditions. We were able to successfully characterize the temperature-dependent development of grasshopper eggs (Warramaba virgo), as well as the effects of fluctuating temperature cycles on the survival of mosquito eggs (Aedes aegypti) and developmental success of Drosophila simulans larvae, all with similar survival rates to conventional methods. Thermocyclers are a general and transferrable means to scale up current methods of incubating small invertebrates. They permit rapid characterization of high-dimensional physiological responses to natural thermal regimes. When combined with existing approaches in thermal and evolutionary biology, these methods will advance our understanding of, and ability to predict, biological adaptations and responses to environmental changes. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - The use of artificial spawning substrates in order to understand the factors influencing the spawning site selection, depth of egg strands deposition and hatching time of perch (Perca fluviatilis L.)
VL  - 71

SP  - 170-179
AB  - The distribution of egg strands of perch Perca fluviatilis and factors affecting this distribution, in terms of spawning sites and spawning depths used, was studied in spring 2010 in Chabařovice Lake, Czech Republic, using areas with an artificial spawning substrate (A.S.S.) and control areas outside the A.S.S. Perch significantly preferred a calm shore instead of a windward shore for spawning. The depths at which perch egg strands were found increased significantly during the spawning period in both A.S.S. areas and in areas outside the A.S.S. (on average from 4.9 m at the beginning to 12.3 m at the end of the spawning period). With increasing depth of deposition the size of the egg strands decreased significantly. The mean depth of egg strands on individual dates corresponded to the position of 10-12°C water layers. From the third week onward, however, egg strands were deposited in much deeper and colder water. A strong relationship was found between the depth at which egg strands were deposited and the duration of the daylight period, indicating that, at the end of the spawning season, perch do not react to the actual temperature of the water column but that they follow their inner clock, assuming that "normally" the shallower depth layers are too warm for successful embryo development. Factors influencing the depth distribution of egg strands were identified as waves, temperature and duration of the daylight period. Factors influencing the selection of spawning sites were identified as wind inducing current, internal seiches and temperature instability of the water column. The first perch larvae were present in the open water of Chabařovice Lake before mid-May, and the latest larvae not earlier than the beginning of July, since warming of the water in deeper layers was very slow. It appears that with prolonged spawning and hatching periods and with spawning occurring at various depths and temperatures, perch have evolved a powerful mechanism to protect their population against the vagaries of the weather and temporary bad biological conditions in the lake.

VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-48
AB  - Tracks produced by swift heavy ions in ceramics are of interest for fundamental science as well as for applications covering different fields such as nanotechnology or fission-track dating of minerals. In the case of pyrochlores with general formula A(2)B(2)O(7), the track structure and radiation sensitivity show a clear dependence on the composition. Ion irradiated Gd2Zr2O7, e.g., retains its crystallinity while amorphous tracks are produced in Gd2Ti2O7. Tracks in Ti-containing compositions have a complex morphology consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a shell of a disordered, defect-fluorite phase. The size of the amorphous core decreases with decreasing energy loss and with increasing Zr content, while the shell thickness seems to be similar over a wide range of energy loss values. The large data set and the complex track structure has made pyrochlore an interesting model system for a general theoretical description of track formation including thermal spike calculations (providing the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature around the ion trajectory) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (describing the response of the atomic system). Recent MD advances consider the sudden temperature increase by inserting data from the thermal spike. The combination allows the reproduction of the core-shell track characteristic and sheds light on the early stages of track formation including recrystallization of the molten material produced by the thermal spike.

AB  - Species-rich adaptive radiations typically diversify along several distinct ecological axes, each characterized by morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. We test here whether different types of adaptive traits share similar patterns of evolution within a radiation by investigating patterns of evolution of morphological traits associated with microhabitat specialization and of physiological traits associated with thermal biology in Anolis lizards. Previous studies of anoles suggest that close relatives share the same "structural niche" (i.e., use the same types of perches) and are similar in body size and shape, but live in different "climatic niches" (i.e., use habitats with different insolation and temperature profiles). Because morphology is closely tied to structural niche and field active body temperatures are tied to climatic niches in Anolis, we expected phylogenetic analyses to show that morphology is more evolutionarily conservative than thermal physiology. In support of this hypothesis, we find (1) that thermal biology exhibits more divergence among recently diverged Anolis taxa than does morphology; and (2) diversification of thermal biology among all species often follows diversification in morphology. These conclusions are remarkably consistent with predictions made by anole biologists in the 1960s and 1970s. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Evidence needed to manage freshwater ecosystems in a changing climate: Turning adaptation principles into practice
VL  - 408
IS  - 19
SP  - 4150-4164
AB  - It is widely accepted that climate change poses severe threats to freshwater ecosystems. Here we examine the scientific basis for adaptively managing vulnerable habitats and species. Our views are shaped by a literature survey of adaptation in practice, and by expert opinion. We assert that adaptation planning is constrained by uncertainty about evolving climatic and non-climatic pressures, by difficulties in predicting species- and ecosystem-level responses to these forces, and by the plasticity of management goals. This implies that adaptation measures will have greatest acceptance when they deliver multiple benefits, including, but not limited to, the amelioration of climate impacts. We suggest that many principles for biodiversity management under climate change are intuitively correct but hard to apply in practice. This view is tested using two commonly assumed doctrines: "increase shading of vulnerable reaches through tree planting" (to reduce water temperatures); and "set hands off flows" (to halt potentially harmful abstractions during low flow episodes). We show that the value of riparian trees for shading, water cooling and other functions is partially understood, but extension of this knowledge to water temperature management is so far lacking. Likewise, there is a long history of environmental flow assessment for allocating water to competing uses, but more research is needed into the effectiveness of ecological objectives based on target flows. We therefore advocate more multi-disciplinary field and model experimentation to test the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of adaptation measures applied at different scales. In particular, there is a need for a major collaborative programme to: examine natural adaptation to climatic variation in freshwater species; identify where existing environmental practice may be insufficient; review the fitness of monitoring networks to detect change; translate existing knowledge into guidance; and implement best practice within existing regulatory frameworks. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The contributions of evolutionary divergence and phenotypic plasticity to geographic variation in the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis
VL  - 99
IS  - 1
SP  - 84-98
AB  - Local genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two mechanisms that can have marked effects on the morphology, performance, and behaviour of animals, producing geographic variation among populations. However, few studies have examined how these mechanisms interact during ontogeny to shape organismal phenotypes. We incubated eggs of the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, from four populations (representing two latitudes and altitudes) in either a warm or cool environment in the laboratory. We then raised the hatchlings under common laboratory conditions, measured morphological and performance traits until 5 weeks of age, and compared juvenile morphology with that of field-caught adults from each population. The results obtained indicate that some phenotypic traits that contribute to performance (body size, hindlimb length, head shape) were relatively canalized in juveniles and differed among populations in a way that was consistent with adults from their population of origin. However, other traits (forelimb length, inter-limb length, mass, tail length), showed significant effects of incubation temperature, and this environmentally induced variation persisted throughout the experiment. Although selection pressure may be stronger for traits that are integral to survival, developmental effects might still have a lasting impact on traits less important to organismal fitness. We discuss the results obtained in the present study the context of the life history of these animals.

AB  - The effects of alizarin complexone (ALC) on otolith marking, growth and survival of Tanichthys albonubes were studied, aiming to improve the applicability of this marking technique in tracing T. albonubes for a better understanding of its movement and migration pattern. Larvae, juveniles with the body length of 5.8-10.5 mm (J5s), juveniles with the body length of 10.8-13.2 mm (J10s), and adults of T. albonubes were selected in the experiment, the water temperature was 28-30 ℃, and immerse time was 24 h. Larvae and J5s of T. albonubes exposed to 50 mg·L-1 and 80 mg·L-1 of ALC had a 100% survival rate, but those exposed to 100 mg·L-1 had a mortality rate of 80%. Under the condition of 80 mg·L-1 ALC, growth rings in otoliths detected by fluorescence microscope (GRFM) were found in all the larvae and J5s. Under 80 mg·L-1 and 100 mg·L-1 of ALC, all J10s survived, but the mortality rate of J10s exposed to 150 mg·L-1 of ALC was 44%. GRFM was found in all J10s under 100 mg·L-1 of ALC. Under 100 mg·L-1 and 150 mg·L-1 of ALC, all adult fish survived with GRFM, but under 200 mg·L-1 of ALC all adult fish died. Cultured for 90 days after exposure to ALC, J5s had the similar body weight, SGR, DWG, and 100% survival rate as compared to the controls (P&gt;0.05). It was suggested that the suitable concentrations of ALC treating larvae, J5s, J10s, and adults of T. albonubes for GRFM were 80 mg·L-1, 100 mg·L-1 and 150 mg·L-1, respectively. © 2015, editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

TI  - The costs of phenotypic adaptation to repeatedly fluctuating temperatures in a soil arthropod
VL  - 36
IS  - 8
SP  - 515-520
AB  - Costs of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments have often been studied in morphological structures. Such structures typically are irreversible for at least some stage in the organism's life. In this study we investigated whether recurrent and reversible adaptation to changes in the thermal environment incurs a cost in terms of some key life-history traits in the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We exposed juvenile O. cincta to two treatments differing in the frequency of temperature fluctuation but with equal total temperature sums. In the high frequency treatment temperature fluctuated daily between 10 and 20 degrees C, while in the low frequency treatment temperature fluctuated on a weekly schedule. During the treatments we measured juvenile growth rate and juvenile mortality, and after six weeks the animals were transferred to constant 15 degrees C and adult starvation resistance was assessed. We found no significant differences between the treatments in juvenile growth rate or juvenile survival. Also, adults that had grown up under high frequency temperature fluctuations did not suffer from reduced starvation resistance compared to animals growing under low frequency temperature fluctuations. This finding supports the hypothesis that selection minimizes the production costs of inducible phenotypes and suggests that the development of optimal phenotypes and evolution of temperature reaction norms are not constrained by such costs.

AB  - The lifecycle of most microbial pathogens can be divided into two states: existence outside and inside their hosts. The sudden temperature upshift experienced upon entry from environmental or vector reservoirs into a warm-blooded host is one of the most crucial signals informing the pathogens to adjust virulence gene expression and their host-stress survival program. This article reviews the plethora of sophisticated strategies that bacteria have evolved to sense temperature, and outlines the molecular signal transduction mechanisms used to modulate synthesis of crucial virulence determinants. The molecular details of thermal control through conformational changes of DNA, RNA and proteins are summarized, complex and diverse thermosensing principles are introduced and their potential as drug targets or synthetic tools are discussed. © 2013 Future Medicine Ltd.

VL  - 278
IS  - 1719
SP  - 2745-2752
AB  - Because key nutritional processes differ in their thermal optima, ectotherms may use temperature selection to optimize performance in changing nutritional environments. Such behaviour would be especially advantageous to small terrestrial animals, which have low thermal inertia and often have access to a wide range of environmental temperatures over small distances. Using the locust, Locusta migratoria, we have demonstrated a direct link between nutritional state and thermoregulatory behaviour. When faced with chronic restrictions to the supply of nutrients, locusts selected increasingly lower temperatures within a gradient, thereby maximizing nutrient use efficiency at the cost of slower growth. Over the shorter term, when locusts were unable to find a meal in the normal course of ad libitum feeding, they immediately adjusted their thermoregulatory behaviour, selecting a lower temperature at which assimilation efficiency was maximal. Thus, locusts use fine scale patterns of movement and temperature selection to adjust for reduced nutrient supply and thereby ameliorate associated life-history consequences. © 2011 The Royal Society.

VL  - 8

AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with an Urban Canopy Model (UCM) was used for studying urban environmental issues. Because land use data employed in the WRF model do not agree with the current situation around Guangzhou, China, the performance of WRF/UCM with new land-use data extracted from Remote Sensing (RS) data was evaluated in early August 2012. Results from simulations reveal that experiments with the extracted data are capable of reasonable reproductions of the majority of the observed temporal characteristics of the 2-m temperature, and can capture the characteristics of Urban Heat Island (UHI). The "UCM_12" simulation, which employed the extracted land-use data with the WRF/UCM model, provided the best reproduction of the 2-m temperature data evolution and the smallest minimum absolute average error when compared with the other two experiments without coupled UCM. The contributions of various factors to the UHI effect were analyzed by comparing the energy equilibrium processes of "UCM_12" in urban and suburban areas. Analysis revealed that energy equilibrium processes with new land use data can explain the diurnal character of the UHI intensity variation. Furthermore, land use data extracted from RS can be used to simulate the UHI. © 2016 by the authors.

VL  - 19
IS  - 19
SP  - 4217-4227
AB  - The evolutionary potential of plant species that reproduce via predominantly clonal means and the conditions under which clonality is favoured are not well known. Long-term clonal reproduction is expected to result in a number of readily detectable genetic signals not present in populations that reproduce by sexual means. We use a hierarchical sampling strategy to assess genotype probabilities and confirm that two rare sister taxa of Banksia ionthocarpa have contrasting modes of reproduction. Banksia ionthocarpa subsp. chrysophoenix reproduces clonally. Populations had low levels of genotypic diversity and were comprised of large clonal patches consisting of many ramets that covered hundreds of square metres and showed little intermixing. The taxon was genetically depauperate (mean Na = 1.97, mean P = 0.66, mean He = 0.282), had high levels of genetic differentiation between populations ( = 0.481), and populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci, suggesting historically high levels of clonality. In contrast, the sister taxon B. ionthocarpa subsp. ionthocarpa, which occurs in an area with more than twice the annual rainfall and less extreme minimum and maximum temperatures, showed no evidence of clonality, high levels of genotypic diversity, greater genetic diversity (mean Na = 3.31, mean P = 0.81, mean He = 0.405), lower levels of genetic differentiation between populations ( = 0.253) and no evidence of excess heterozygosity or LD among loci. We suggest that the development of clonality in subsp. chrysophoenix is associated with its more marginal environment and enhanced by response to recurrent fires. © 2010 This work is the property of the Government of Western Australia.

SP  - 174-177
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the possibility of valorization of the carbonatation lime from the sugarbeet industry by production of compost using in the same time the excess of bagasse from the cane sugar industry together with household waste (organic materials). Three experiments were conducted: in the first experiment the carbonatation lime (dry substance content 83.7%) at a content of 32% was composted with bagasse (DS 89.3%) and household waste (DS 13.4%), while in the second experiment the compost did not contain the carbonatation lime (only bagasse and household waste in the same proportions). In the third experiment the concentration of carbonatation lime in the mixture (carbonatation lime - bagasse - household waste) was increased to 50%. After 75 days of composting with natural aeration, a good evolution of the temperature for all the composts was observed. In the final step of composting, all composts have pH values of 8.0-8.5 and the ratio of carbon/nitrogen was reduced to the recommended value. The compost with carbonatation lime could be used as fertilizer for the Moroccan soils.

VL  - 88

AB  - Because fitness of ectotherms, including reptiles, is highly dependent on temperature and water availability, the study of ecophysiological traits, such as preferred temperature (Tp) and water loss rates (WLRs), may provide mechanistic evidence on the restricting factors to the species ranges. TheMoorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, is a species complex with a circum- Mediterranean distribution. In the Iberian Peninsula, two sister parapatric forms of the complex, known as the Iberian and the European clades, are found. Ecological models previously performed using presence records and bioclimatic variables suggest niche divergence between both lineages correlated with precipitation rather than with temperature. In this study, we test this correlative hypothesis using ecophysiological evidence. In the laboratory, we analyzed the Tp and WLRs for 84 adult males from seven distinct populations ascribed to one of the two lineages present in Iberia. Specifically, we evaluated the existence of trait conservatism versus adaptation among populations, lineages, or both. In addition, we tested for a trade-off between water and thermal traits and assessed whether climate regime of sampling localities had any influence on the ecophysiological patterns found. We found that Tp is quite conserved at both the population and lineage levels and independent from body size. In contrast, water loss experiments revealed some variation among populations, but the regression analysis failed to detect correlation between Tp andWLR at any level. Overall, the European lineage displayed a trend for higher water loss and was more diverse among populations when compared with the Iberian lineage. The lack of correspondence between ecophysiological traits and local climatic conditions favors phylogenetic signal versus adaptation. This suggests divergent evolutionary responses to the environment, mainly acting on water ecology, in both lineages, which may account for the differences in their range expansion. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Characterizing socially avoidant and affiliative responses to social exclusion
AB  - Humans have a fundamental need for social relationships. From an evolutionary standpoint, the drive to form social connections may have evolved as an adaptive mechanism to promote survival, as group membership afforded the benefits of shared resources and security. Thus, rejection from social groups is especially detrimental, rendering the ability to detect threats to social relationships and respond in adaptive ways critical. Previous research indicates that social exclusion alters cognition and behavior in specific ways that may initially appear contradictory. That is, although some studies have found that exclusionary social threats lead to withdrawal from the surrounding social world, other studies indicate that social exclusion motivates affiliative social behavior. Here, we review the existing evidence supporting accounts of avoidant and affiliative responses, and highlight the conditions under which both categories of responses may be simultaneously employed. Then, we review the neuroimaging research implicating specific brain regions underlying the ability to detect and adaptively respond to threats of social exclusion. Collectively, these findings are suggestive of neural system highly attuned to social context and capable of motivating flexible behavioral responses. © 2012 Powers and Heatherton.

VL  - 19

AB  - The life history of polysphinctine parasitoids is poorly understood. As a result, their effect on their host has not been evaluated. Here, we present the phenology of Zatypota percontatoria, an ectoparasitoid wasp of theridiid spiders, using rich field, semi-field and laboratory investigations of selected life-history parameters. The wasps overwintered as larva attached to the spider abdomen and the imagos of the first generation emerged at the beginning of May. The sex ratio (F/M) of overwintered wasp larvae was 1.4. The wasp spent an average of 6.4days in the egg stage, 27.67days in the larval stage and 9.6days in the pupal stage. Adult longevity was on average 14.34days. Oviposition occurred on average 8.44days following maturity. The wasp laid on average 0.35eggs/day. The total fecundity was on average 7.4 eggs per wasp and decreased with age (data from unmated females). The developmental rate increased with experimental temperature up to 28°C. The lower developmental threshold for pupae was estimated at 6.6°C. The sum of effective temperatures for pupae was estimated at 157.8degree days. Using daily temperature records from the Czech Republic over the last 41years, we estimated an average of 3.5 generations of Z.percontatoria per year. Mortality was 48% in semi-field conditions and 23% in the laboratory. The incidence of mortality was highest during egg and larval stages caused by the detachment of eggs or larvae during spider molting, the mortality of the spider-host and egg deposition on the spider prosoma. © 2016 The Entomological Society of Japan.

VL  - 22

SP  - 763-776
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 levels could have drastic effects on the performance of invasive weeds and their insect herbivores. Despite the importance of biological control as an effective management tool for environmental weeds, there have been few studies on the potential impact of climate change on the future efficacy of biological control. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of elevated CO2 on the performance of tropical soda apple Solanum viarum (Solanaceae) and its biological control agent Gratiana boliviana (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We established three levels of CO2 in environmental growth chambers: ambient (400 ppm), medium (580 ppm) and high (780 ppm). Plants growing at the high level had greater biomass compared to those growing at the ambient and medium levels of CO2. Leaf water content and the amount of leaf nitrogen were reduced at high compared to ambient or medium CO2 levels. G. boliviana immature survival and developmental time were negatively affected at high CO2 but not at medium or ambient levels. Adults were lighter and smaller when reared at the high CO2 level compared to ambient and medium treatments, while adult fecundity was higher at the medium CO2 level. Leaf area consumed by fifth instars was lower when feeding on plants grown at the high CO2 level either inside a Petri dish or on potted plants. These results suggest that beetle performance may be diminished under future climate. However, further studies should incorporate other factors such as temperature and precipitation as well as the evolutionary potential of herbivores and plants to adapt to a changing climate. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Adaptations of enchytraeids to single and combined effects of physical and chemical stressors
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Climate changes are expected to be greatest in the polar and temperate areas, where predictions point to an increase in freeze-thaw events and changes in precipitation, evaporation, and salinity patterns. These events will therefore affect biological activity of the soil compartment that may result in large impacts in ecosystem functioning and dynamics therein. This concern becomes even more important when considering the presence of contaminants due to intense anthropogenic activity, which may lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects and increase or decrease the impact on natural ecosystems. This paper reviews the effect of physical and chemical stressors on enchytraeids, with special emphasis on Enchytraeus albidus because most relevant studies have involved this species. E. albidus is a freeze-tolerant and euryhaline organism and several studies suggest that the absence of salinity may have important (negative) consequences not only for their freeze tolerance ability but also for their reproduction and capacity to deal with the presence of contaminants, such as metals and fungicides. Single and joint effects of constant freezing or freeze-thaw cycles and surfactants, such as 4-nonylphenol, affected negatively E. albidus freeze tolerance by decreasing the levels of cryoprotectants, membrane fluidity and interfering with cellular energy allocation. Because enchytraeids are of ecological significance in many important habitats along the Artic and cold-temperate environments, a reduction in abundance may result in disturbances of the decomposition processes in soils. The knowledge of the biological, physiological, and biochemical limits of enchytraeids to combined effect of physical and chemical stressors are crucial to provide a scientific basis for improving the setting of safety factors when extrapolating from controlled (and optimal) laboratory conditions to natural soil ecosystems. Therefore, there is a need to expand and evolve experiments that more realistically mimic the situation in the field, where interactions between factors are highly relevant. The synergistic or antagonistic interactions identified in the present review may also represent a stepping stone in the evaluation and possible inclusion of natural factors, like cold and salinity, in standardized enchytraeid test guidelines and consequently in risk assessment of chemicals. © 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Robust biological systems are expected to accumulate cryptic genetic variation that does not affect the system output in standard conditions yet may play an evolutionary role once phenotypically expressed under a strong perturbation. Genetic variation that is cryptic relative to a robust trait may accumulate neutrally as it does not change the phenotype, yet it could also evolve under selection if it affects traits related to fitness in addition to its cryptic effect. Cryptic variation affecting the vulval intercellular signaling network was previously uncovered among wild isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a quantitative genetic approach, we identify a non-synonymous polymorphism of the previously uncharacterized nath-10 gene that affects the vulval phenotype when the system is sensitized with different mutations, but not in wild-type strains. nath-10 is an essential protein acetyltransferase gene and the homolog of human NAT10. The nath-10 polymorphism also presents non-cryptic effects on life history traits. The nath-10 allele carried by the N2 reference strain leads to a subtle increase in the egg laying rate and in the total number of sperm, a trait affecting the trade-off between fertility and minimal generation time in hermaphrodite individuals. We show that this allele appeared during early laboratory culture of N2, which allowed us to test whether it may have evolved under selection in this novel environment. The derived allele indeed strongly outcompetes the ancestral allele in laboratory conditions. In conclusion, we identified the molecular nature of a cryptic genetic variation and characterized its evolutionary history. These results show that cryptic genetic variation does not necessarily accumulate neutrally at the whole-organism level, but may evolve through selection for pleiotropic effects that alter fitness. In addition, cultivation in the laboratory has led to adaptive evolution of the reference strain N2 to the laboratory environment, which may modify other phenotypes of interest. © 2012 Duveau, Felix.

TI  - Miocene to Pliocene development of surface and subsurface temperatures in the Benguela Current system
VL  - 26
IS  - 3
AB  - The initiation of the Benguela upwelling has been dated to the late Miocene, but estimates of its sea surface temperature evolution are not available. This study presents data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1085 recovered from the southern Cape Basin. Samples of the middle Miocene to Pliocene were analyzed for alkenone-based (U37K, SST UK) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) based (TEX 86, TempTEX) water temperature proxies. In concordance with global cooling during the Miocene, SSTUK and TempTEX exhibit a decline of about 8C and 16C, respectively. The temperature trends suggest an inflow of cold Antarctic waters triggered by Antarctic ice sheet expansion and intensification of Southern Hemisphere southeasterly winds. A temperature offset between both proxies developed with the onset of upwelling, which can be explained by differences in habitat: alkenone-producing phytoplankton live in the euphotic zone and record sea surface temperatures, while GDGT-producing Thaumarchaeota are displaced to colder subsurface waters in upwelling-influenced areas and record subsurface water temperatures. We suggest that variations in subsurface water temperatures were driven by advection of cold Antarctic waters and thermocline adjustments that were due to changes in North Atlantic deep water formation. A decline in surface temperatures, an increased offset between temperature proxies, and an increase in primary productivity suggest the establishment of the Benguela upwelling at 10 Ma. During the Messinian Salinity Crisis, between 7 and 5 Ma, surface and subsurface temperature estimates became similar, likely because of a strong reduction in Atlantic overturning circulation, while high total organic carbon contents suggest a "biogenic bloom." In the Pliocene the offset between the temperature estimates and the cooling trend was reestablished. Copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Geochemical Characteristics of the Paleogene and Neogene Saline Lacustrine Source Rocks in the Western Qaidam Basin, Northwestern China
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
SP  - 4537-4549
AB  - On the basis of salinity and organic geochemical analyses of mudstones, this paper analyzed the relationship between salinity and sedimentary facies of different strata; studied influences of salinity on organic matter richness, types, and thermal maturities of source rocks; and built the organic enrichment accumulation model for the Paleogene and Neogene saline lakes of the western Qaidam Basin. In the western Qaidam Basin, saline lake depocenters and high salinity areas migrated eastward, and chloride ion (Cl-) concentration of source rocks showed an increasing trend from the Paleocene to Pliocene. The relationship between organic matter content and salinity of the Paleocene and Pliocene source rocks shows a three-interval model: both TOC (total organic carbon) content and chloroform bitumen content have low values at the low salinity stage, first increase to the peak and then decrease to the lowest values at the medium salinity stage, and sustain the lowest values at the super saline stage because of the interaction between organic productivity and reduction-oxidation in the saline lake of the western Qaidam Basin. The relationship between organic matter type and salinity of these source rocks suggests that the kerogen increasingly corresponds to a sapropelic and planktonic origin with increasing salinity. The organic matter enrichment model of the Paleogene and Neogene saline lakes of the western Qaidam Basin showed that saline lakes had high productivity and reducing conditions favorable for organic matter accumulation and preservation at their middle evolution stage. Through improving their apparent activation energy, salinity slowed down thermal evolution of source rocks, making the Paleogene and Neogene source rocks at low maturity to the immature stage in the western Qaidam Basin. © 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - The principles of buoyancy in Marine Fish Eggs and their vertical distributions across the World Oceans
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - Buoyancy acting on plankton, i.e.The difference in specific gravity between plankton and the ambient water, is a function of salinity and temperature. From specific gravity measurements of marine fish eggs salinity appears to be the only determinant of the buoyancy indicating that the thermal expansions of the fish egg and the ambient seawater are equal.We analyze the mechanisms behind thermal expansion in fish eggs in order to determine to what extent it can be justified to neglect the effects of temperature on buoyancy. Our results confirm the earlier assumptions that salinity is the basic determinant on buoyancy in marine fish eggs that, in turn, influence the vertical distributions and, consequently, the dispersal of fish eggs from the spawning areas. Fish populations have adapted accordingly by producing egg specific gravities that tune the egg buoyancy to create specific vertical distributions for each local population. A wide variety of buoyancy adaptations are found among fish populations. The ambient physical conditions at the spawning sites form a basic constraint for adaptation. In coastal regions where salinity increases with depth, and where the major fraction of the fish stocks spawns, pelagic and mesopelagic egg distributions dominate. However, in the larger part of worlds' oceans salinity decreases with depth resulting in different egg distributions. Here, the principles of vertical distributions of fish eggs in the world oceans are presented in an overarching framework presenting the basic differences between regions, mainly coastal, where salinity increases with depth and the major part of the world oceans where salinity decreases with depth. We show that under these latter conditions, steady-state vertical distribution of mesopelagic fish eggs cannot exist as it does in most coastal regions. In fact, a critical spawning depth must exist where spawning below this depth threshold results in eggs sinking out of the water column and become lost for recruitment to the population. An example of adaptation to such conditions is Cape hake spawning above the critical layer in the Northern Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The eggs rise slowly in the onshore subsurface current below the Ekman layer, hence being advected inshore where the hatched larvae concentrate with optimal feeding conditions.

VL  - 44

SP  - 433-445
AB  - Aim: Genetic and phenotypic data may show convergent or contrasting spatial patterns. Discrepancies between markers may develop in response to different evolutionary forces. In this study we analyse inter- and intraspecific differentiation of closely related taxa in the marbled white butterfly species group. Based on genetic and phenotypic characters we test for potential evolutionary drivers and propose a taxonomic revision. Location: Western Palaearctic (including north-western Africa). Methods: We compared distributions of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences, of several allozyme loci, and of the shape of wings and genitalia obtained by applying landmark-based techniques for the three butterfly species Melanargia galathea (central and eastern Europe), M. lachesis (Iberia) and M. lucasi (North Africa). Results: All studied markers showed a strong spatial structure, although discordance among their patterns was detected. COI sequences, wing shape and genitalia indicated a main split between M. galathea and M. lucasi. A lower differentiation between M. galathea and M. lachesis was found in wing shape and reflected in two mutations of the COI gene, while allozymes indicated a strong divergence. Within M. galathea, allozyme data and COI, but not morphology, revealed the existence of a slightly differentiated lineage in the Italian Peninsula, France and Switzerland. Based on COI, Melanargia lucasi was split into two subgroups, a western and an eastern Maghreb lineage. Main conclusions: Long-term isolation of Melanargia populations between North Africa and Europe led to divergence between M. galathea and M. lucasi. This was followed by a recent differentiation among populations isolated during the cold periods of the Pleistocene, such as M. lachesis in Iberia. These lineages are characterized by a tendency not to overlap in secondary sympatry. The different patterns of the four markers may arise from divergent evolutionary processes and pressures: wings may be mainly affected by natural selection, genital structures by sexual selection, whereas long-term isolation and drift may have driven divergence of mitochondrial DNA and allozymes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Two concentrations were selected for sub lethal exposure i.e., 1/10th (3.15 ppm) and 1/5th (6.3 ppm) of LC50 for a period of 28 days. Food consumption rate, ammonia-N excretion rate, Oxygen: Nitrogen ratio was studied which showed significant changes throughout the exposure period. Food consumption rate was declined and lower value (0.0068 g feed/g body weight) was noticed on 28th day whereas, ammonia-N excretion rate increased and the highest value (0.00096mg/ l/g/h) was recorded on the 7th day and Oxygen: Nitrogen ratio was declined and the lowest value (4.32) was found in 1/5th concentration of LC50 (6.3 ppm).

TI  - Drilling optimization: Utilizing lifetime prediction to improve drilling performance and reduce downtime
SP  - 140-153
AB  - The capability to optimize drilling performance by predicting the life of drilling components is integral to preventing costly downhole tool failures and ensuring success of any drilling operation. Drilling tools are subject to various parameters such as vibration, temperature, revolutions per minute (RPM) and torque. These parameters can greatly fatigue even the most robust tool depending on the where and how the tool is operated. As a result, there is a need to predict time to failure of components operating in a downhole drilling environment. Analyzing operational data, inclusive of the parameters above, prior to or during maintenance actions and before starting drilling jobs, provides unique insight into how to improve the drilling performance of tools and to reduce downtime. Life prediction provides a cutting-edge way to identify precursors to costly failures in the field and enables proactive guidance during maintenance periods for parts which may otherwise have been disregarded strictly on maintenance procedures. Statistical models that relate operating environment to the component life and are derived from failure data of fielded components, introduce a new way to optimize the efficiency of drilling tools. Utilizing lifetime prediction to optimize drilling performance is a groundbreaking methodology developed to determine life of components operating in benign and harsh drilling environments by incorporating statistical aspects such as those caused because of variation in operating stress and maintenance upgrades. Since the algorithm utilizes field data, the need for costly laboratory experiments are also eliminated. Each model developed is unique to the specified part and can be calibrated for the best fit. In this methodology, a Bayesian-based model selection technique is developed that incorporates operating environment variables after each successful drilling run to dynamically select a model that gives the best survival probability for that component. Dynamic model selection ensures maximum utilization of a component, while avoiding failure to improve the overall reliability of the tool while in the field. The paper describes the methodology used to estimate the life of components in drilling systems by employing operational data, drilling dynamics and historical information. © Copyright 2014, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - The Temperature-Size Rule in Lecane inermis (Rotifera) is adaptive and driven by nuclei size adjustment to temperature and oxygen combinations
VL  - 54
SP  - 78-85
AB  - The evolutionary implications of the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR) in ectotherms is debatable; it is uncertain whether size decrease with temperature increase is an adaptation or a non-adaptive by-product of some temperature-dependent processes. We tested whether (i) the size of the rotifer Lecane inermis affects fecundity in a way that depends on the combination of low or high temperature and oxygen content and (ii) the proximate mechanism underlying TSR in this species is associated with nuclei size adjustment (a proxy of cell size). Small-type and large-type rotifers were obtained by culturing at different temperatures prior to the experiment and then exposed to combinations of two temperature and two oxygen conditions. Fecundity was estimated and used as a measure of fitness. Nuclei and body sizes were measured to examine the response to both environmental factors tested. The results show the following for L. inermis. (i) Body size affects fecundity in response to both temperature and oxygen, supporting a hypothesis regarding the contribution of oxygen in TSR. (ii) Large individuals are generally more fecund than small ones; however, under a combination of high temperature and poor oxygen conditions, small individuals are more fecund than large ones, in accordance with a hypothesis of the adaptive significance of TSR. (iii) The body size response to temperature is realised by nuclei size adjustment. (iv) Nuclei size changes in response to temperature and oxygen conditions, in agreement with hypotheses on the cellular mechanism underlying TSR and on a contribution of oxygen availability in TSR. These results serve as empirical evidence for the adaptive significance of TSR and validation of the cellular mechanism for the observed response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating mechanistic organism-environment interactions into the basic theory of community and evolutionary ecology
VL  - 215
IS  - 6
SP  - 948-961
AB  - This paper presents an overview of how mechanistic knowledge of organism-environment interactions, including biomechanical interactions of heat, mass and momentum transfer, can be integrated into basic theoretical population biology through mechanistic functional responses that quantitatively describe how organisms respond to their physical environment. Integrating such functional responses into simple community and microevolutionary models allows scaling up of the organism-level understanding from biomechanics both ecologically and temporally. For community models, Holling-type functional responses for predator-prey interactions provide a classic example of the functional response affecting qualitative model dynamics, and recent efforts are expanding analogous models to incorporate environmental influences such as temperature. For evolutionary models, mechanistic functional responses dependent on the environment can serve as fitness functions in both quantitative genetic and game theoretic frameworks, especially those concerning function-valued traits. I present a novel comparison of a mechanistic fitness function based on thermal performance curves to a commonly used generic fitness function, which quantitatively differ in their predictions for response to environmental change. A variety of examples illustrate how mechanistic functional responses enhance model connections to biologically relevant traits and processes as well as environmental conditions and therefore have the potential to link theoretical and empirical studies. Sensitivity analysis of such models can provide biologically relevant insight into which parameters and processes are important to community and evolutionary responses to environmental change such as climate change, which can inform conservation management aimed at protecting response capacity. Overall, the distillation of detailed knowledge or organism-environment interactions into mechanistic functional responses in simple population biology models provides a framework for integrating biomechanics and ecology that allows both tractability and generality. © 2012.

VL  - 306
IS  - 6
SP  - 443-451
AB  - Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaireś disease, is naturally found in aquatic habitats. The intracellular life cycle within protozoa pre-adapted the “accidental” human pathogen to also infect human professional phagocytes like alveolar macrophages. Previous studies employing the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that also nematodes might serve as a natural host for L. pneumophila. Here, we report for the first time from a natural co-habitation of L. pneumophila and environmental nematode species within biofilms of a warm water spring. In addition, we identified the protozoan species Oxytricha bifaria, Stylonychia mytilus, Ciliophrya sp. which have never been described as potential interaction partners of L. pneumophila before. Modeling and dissection of the Legionella-protozoa-nematode interaction revealed that C. elegans ruptures Legionella-infected amoebal cells and by this means incorporate the pathogen. Further infection studies revealed that the macrophage infectivity potentiator (Mip) protein of L. pneumophila, which is known to bind collagen IV during human lung infection, promotes the colonization of the intestinal tract of L4 larvae of C. elegans and negatively influences the life span of the worms. The Mip-negative L. pneumophila mutant exhibited a 32-fold reduced colonization rate of the nematodes after 48 h when compared to the wild-type strain. Taken together, these studies suggest that nematodes may serve as natural hosts for L. pneumophila, promote their persistence and dissemination in the environment, and co-evolutionarily pre-adapt the pathogen for interactions with extracellular constituents of human lung tissue. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Silencing of Transposable Elements by piRNAs in Drosophila: An Evolutionary Perspective
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
SP  - 164-176
AB  - Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that can move within the genome. TEs have greatly shaped the genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of the host organisms through a variety of mechanisms. However, TEs generally disrupt genes and destabilize the host genomes, which substantially reduce fitness of the host organisms. Understanding the genomic distribution and evolutionary dynamics of TEs will greatly deepen our understanding of the TE-mediated biological processes. Most TE insertions are highly polymorphic in Drosophila melanogaster, providing us a good system to investigate the evolution of TEs at the population level. Decades of theoretical and experimental studies have well established “transposition-selection” population genetics model, which assumes that the equilibrium between TE replication and purifying selection determines the copy number of TEs in the genome. In the last decade, P-element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were demonstrated to be master repressors of TE activities in Drosophila. The discovery of piRNAs revolutionized our understanding of TE repression, because it reveals that the host organisms have evolved an adaptive mechanism to defend against TE invasion. Tremendous progress has been made to understand the molecular mechanisms by which piRNAs repress active TEs, although many details in this process remain to be further explored. The interaction between piRNAs and TEs well explains the molecular mechanisms underlying hybrid dysgenesis for the I-R and P-M systems in Drosophila, which have puzzled evolutionary biologists for decades. The piRNA repression pathway provides us an unparalleled system to study the co-evolutionary process between parasites and host organisms. © 2017 Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Genetics Society of China

AB  - Thermoregulation is the temperature control in a physical any system. Social insect species have evolved to regulate the temperature inside the nest through a number of mechanisms that can be primary or secondary. The primary mechanisms of regulation, includes such mechanisms as nest site selection to optimize internal nest temperature, or simple behavior such as brood translocation to regions within a nest where temperatures are most favorable. As for the secondary mechanisms include physiological and / or behavioral, as the behavior of heating or cooling the nests, for example, by clustering and generation of metabolic heat if the intention is to keep the colony warm, shake or wings if the intention is to lead the hot air out of the colony. If the temperature of the nest are not maintained within the specified limits of the species, there are often unintended consequences that may affect physiological factors of individuals and thus generate consequences later in their adult life. © 2014, Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-arido.

TI  - Main controlling factors of tight sand gas accumulation of Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation in Yingshan structure, Central Sichuan, China
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 18-26
AB  - The previous researches on Member 2 of Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation (T3x2) in the Yingshan structure of Sichuan Basin differ in some extent from the practical exploration results, because the exploration success rate is only 32%. This study tries to solve the key scientific issues on the geological understanding in order to improve the effectiveness of natural gas exploration. The paper analyzes the source rocks, reservoir rocks, preservation and trap conditions of the gas pool of Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation, and concludes that the accumulation condition is superior. The apatite fission track and the Easy R0 chemical kinetics simulation are used to reconstruct the thermalevolved history of hydrocarbon source rocks. Combined with the homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusions and ESR dating, the hydrocarbon-accumulation process is reconstructed. This indicates that the natural gas of Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation has experienced 3 stages of accumulation, that is, the early injection of hydrocarbon fluid in Late Jurassic, the dominant injection period of hydrocarbon period in Middle-Late Cretaceous, and the adjustment and transformation of gas pools brought about by the tectonic uplift since Late Cretaceous. The main controlling factors of hydrocarbon-accumulation of the gas pools in Member 2 of Xujiahe Formation of the Yingshan structure pointed out in this paper are as follows. The enrichment of natural gas is controlled by the physical properties of the reservoir, the gas and water distribution in the gas reservoir is controlled by the structure amplitude, the seepage mechanism and the productivity of the reservoir are controlled by the development of the fractures, and the difference in natural gas accumulation from south to north is controlled by fault sealing.

VL  - 10
IS  - 11
AB  - Introduction: Recurrent cholera outbreaks have been reported in Cameroon since 1971. However, case fatality ratios remain high, and we do not have an optimal understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, due in part to the diversity of Cameroon’s climate subzones and a lack of comprehensive data at the health district level. Methods/Findings: A unique health district level dataset of reported cholera case numbers and related deaths from 2000–2012, obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of Cameroon and World Health Organization (WHO) country office, served as the basis for the analysis. During this time period, 43,474 cholera cases were reported: 1748 were fatal (mean annual case fatality ratio of 7.9%), with an attack rate of 17.9 reported cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. Outbreaks occurred in three waves during the 13-year time period, with the highest case fatality ratios at the beginning of each wave. Seasonal patterns of illness differed strikingly between climate subzones (Sudano-Sahelian, Tropical Humid, Guinea Equatorial, and Equatorial Monsoon). In the northern Sudano-Sahelian subzone, highest number of cases tended to occur during the rainy season (July-September). The southern Equatorial Monsoon subzone reported cases year-round, with the lowest numbers during peak rainfall (July-September). A spatial clustering analysis identified multiple clusters of high incidence health districts during 2010 and 2011, which were the 2 years with the highest annual attack rates. A spatiotemporal autoregressive Poisson regression model fit to the 2010–2011 data identified significant associations between the risk of transmission and several factors, including the presence of major waterbody or highway, as well as the average daily maximum temperature and the precipitation levels over the preceding two weeks. The direction and/or magnitude of these associations differed between climate subzones, which, in turn, differed from national estimates that ignored subzones differences in climate variables. Conclusions/Significance: The epidemiology of cholera in Cameroon differs substantially between climate subzones. Development of an optimal comprehensive country-wide control strategy for cholera requires an understanding of the impact of the natural and built environment on transmission patterns at the local level, particularly in the setting of ongoing climate change. © 2016 Ngwa et al.

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 119-134
AB  - Climate adaptation is surprisingly rarely reported as a cause for the build-up of reproductive isolation between diverging populations. In this review, we summarize evidence for effects of climate adaptation on pre- and postzygotic isolation between emerging species with a particular focus on pied (Ficedula hypoleuca) and collared (Ficedula albicollis) flycatchers as a model for research on speciation. Effects of climate adaptation on prezygotic isolation or extrinsic selection against hybrids have been documented in several taxa, but the combined action of climate adaptation and sexual selection is particularly well explored in Ficedula flycatchers. There is a general lack of evidence for divergent climate adaptation causing intrinsic postzygotic isolation. However, we argue that the profound effects of divergence in climate adaptation on the whole biochemical machinery of organisms and hence many underlying genes should increase the likelihood of genetic incompatibilities arising as side effects. Fast temperature-dependent co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes may be particularly likely to lead to hybrid sterility. Thus, how climate adaptation relates to reproductive isolation is best explored in relation to fast-evolving barriers to gene flow, while more research on later stages of divergence is needed to achieve a complete understanding of climate-driven speciation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Theoretical and experimental studies of flux enhancement with roughened surface in direct contact membrane distillation desalination
VL  - 433
SP  - 160-166
AB  - A new design of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) using roughened-surface flow channel for enhancement of heat transfer was proposed for increasing the pure water productivity in saline water desalination. The roughened surface was fabricated using siphonic-blasting with aluminum oxide (Al2O3) sand grains and arc spraying for Ni film coating. Experimental study has demonstrated its feasibility and up to 37% of performance enhancement was obtained for the experimental system. A mathematical model considering heat and mass transfer mechanisms has been developed and incorporated with experimental data for evolving a correlation for a heat transfer coefficient correction factor. The correlation is expressed as relative roughness and can be used for predicting the heat transfer coefficient for roughened-surface channels. Considering the tradeoff between the flux enhancements at the expense of energy consumption, an optimized level of roughness can be determined. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of a genotype to develop intodifferent phenotypes in response to environmental cues. In many instances, thisability is an evolved adaptation to enable organisms to adapt to predictable butvariable environments in time or space (West-Eberhard MJ, Developmental plasticityand evolution. Oxford Unversity Press, New York, p 794, 2003; Stearns SC,BioScience 39(7):436-445, 1989; Bradshaw AD, Evolutionary significance ofphenotypic plasticity in plants. In: Caspari EW (ed) Adv Genet 13. Academic,New York, pp 115-155, 1956; de Jong G, New Phytol 166(1):101-117, 2005;Moran NA, Am Nat 139(5):971-989, 1992). While much research has focused onthe ecological and adaptive significance of the alternative phenotypes producedunder different environments, relatively little is still known about the proximatephysiological and molecular mechanism translating environmental variation tophenotypic variation and how these mechanisms may have evolved (Beldade P,Mateus ARA, Keller RA, Mol Ecol 20(7):1347-1363, 2011). Here I provide a review of the literature that has explored how environmentalvariation, in particular seasonal variation, impacts eyespot size in African satyridbutterflies of the genus Bicyclus. Plasticity in eyespot size is undeniably the mostconspicuous effect of seasonal variation on the appearance of Bicyclus species, andperhaps because of this, its ecological and physiological bases have been underinvestigation since 1984 (Brakefield PM, Reitsma N, Ecol Entomol 16:291-303,1991; Brakefield PM, Larsen TB, Biol J Linn Soc 22:1-12, 1984). Much subsequentresearch on members of this genus, and in particular on the model species Bicyclusanynana, uncovered, however, many other morphological, behavioral, physiological,and life history traits that are equally impacted by seasons and, in particular, byrearing temperature (Bear A, Monteiro A, Plos One 8(5), 2013; Dion E,Monteiro A, Yew JY, Scientific Reports 6:39002, 2016; Fischer K, BrakefieldPM, Zwaan BJ, Ecology 84(12):3138-3147, 2003a; de Jong MA, Kesbeke F, Brakefield PM, Zwaan BJ, Climate Res 43(1-2):91-102, 2010; Mateus ARA,Marques-Pita M, Oostra V, Lafuente E, Brakefield PM, Zwaan BJ, et al.

TI  - Viability selection on body size in a non-marine ostracod
VL  - 671
IS  - 1
SP  - 193-203
AB  - One of the most important research topics in evolutionary ecology is body size evolution. Actually, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the many observed patterns-also known as "rules"-of body size variation in across latitude, temperature, and time. The temperature-size rule (TSR), describes an inverse relationship between body size and temperature. We took advantage of the "natural laboratory" that the crustacean populations at the Chilean altiplano offers, to study the TSR in ostracods. We studied three populations of Limnocythere atacamae that are physically separated by several kilometers, and differ mainly by their permanent thermal regime. We found larger individuals in the hotspring compared to the cold ponds. Also, in the hotspring we found a significant quadratic selection coefficient, suggesting stabilizing selection in this population. The fitness profiles showed stabilizing selection in the hotspring, and positive directional selection in the ponds. Our results suggest the existence of an optimal body size above the population means. This optimal size is apparently attained in the hotspring population. Then, natural selection appears to be promoting a shift in the mean phenotype that, for some reason, is not attained in the cold environments. Genetic slippage and population bottleneck would explain this absence of response to selection. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 46

SP  - 393-397
AB  - It is not known how selection affects mutations in the multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome. We transferred cytoplasm between D. melanogaster embryos carrying mitochondrial mutations to create heteroplasmic lines transmitting two mitochondrial genotypes. Increased temperature imposed selection against a temperature-sensitive mutation affecting cytochrome oxidase, driving decreases in the abundance of the mutant genome over successive generations. Selection did not influence the health or fertility of the flies but acted during midoogenesis to influence competition between the genomes. Mitochondria might incur an advantage through selective localization, survival or proliferation, yet timing and insensitivity to park mutation suggest that preferential proliferation underlies selection. Selection drove complete replacement of the temperature-sensitive mitochondrial genome by a wild-type genome but also stabilized the multigenerational transmission of two genomes carrying complementing detrimental mutations. While they are so balanced, these stably transmitted mutations have no detrimental phenotype, but their segregation could contribute to disease phenotypes and somatic aging. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.

VL  - 209

SP  - 1230-1239
AB  - Given the dual role of many plant traits to tolerate both herbivore attack and abiotic stress, the climatic niche of a species should be integrated into the study of plant defense strategies. Here we investigate the impact of plant reproductive strategy and components of species' climatic niche on the rate of chemical defense evolution in the milkweeds using a common garden experiment of 49 species. We found that across Asclepias species, clonal reproduction repeatedly evolved in lower temperature conditions, in species generally producing low concentrations of a toxic defense (cardenolides). Additionally, we found that rates of cardenolide evolution were lower for clonal than for nonclonal species. We thus conclude that because the clonal strategy is based on survival, long generation times, and is associated with tolerance of herbivory, it may be an alternative to toxicity in colder ecosystems. Taken together, these results indicate that the rate of chemical defense evolution is influenced by the intersection of life-history strategy and climatic niches into which plants radiate. © 2016 New Phytologist Trust.

TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of the leaf phenological cycle in an oak metapopulation along an elevation gradient
VL  - 30
IS  - 12
SP  - 2116-2131
AB  - It has been predicted that environmental changes will radically alter the selective pressures on phenological traits. Long-lived species, such as trees, will be particularly affected, as they may need to undergo major adaptive change over only one or a few generations. The traits describing the annual life cycle of trees are generally highly evolvable, but nothing is known about the strength of their genetic correlations. Tight correlations can impose strong evolutionary constraints, potentially hampering the adaptation of multivariate phenological phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary, genetic and environmental components of the timing of leaf unfolding and senescence within an oak metapopulation along an elevation gradient. Population divergence, estimated from in situ and common-garden data, was compared to expectations under neutral evolution, based on microsatellite markers. This approach made it possible (1) to evaluate the influence of genetic correlation on multivariate local adaptation to elevation and (2) to identify traits probably exposed to past selective pressures due to the colder climate at high elevation. The genetic correlation was positive but very weak, indicating that genetic constraints did not shape the local adaptation pattern for leaf phenology. Both spring and fall (leaf unfolding and senescence, respectively) phenology timings were involved in local adaptation, but leaf unfolding was probably the trait most exposed to climate change-induced selection. Our data indicated that genetic variation makes a much smaller contribution to adaptation than the considerable plastic variation displayed by a tree during its lifetime. The evolutionary potential of leaf phenology is, therefore, probably not the most critical aspect for short-term population survival in a changing climate. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Northern natterjack toads (Bufo calamita) select breeding habitats that promote rapid development
VL  - 149
IS  - 7
SP  - 737-754
AB  - It is generally believed that harsh climate inhibits growth and development of ectotherms at high latitudes. However, this environmental effect may be counterbalanced by countergradient genetic variation and habitat selection. While there is laboratory evidence for genetically based increases in growth and development rates in amphibians living at high latitudes, it remains unclear how environmental and genetic effects combine in the field to produce gradients of phenotypic variation. We performed a field study on the growth and development of tadpoles and habitat selection of breeding adults of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in Denmark and in Estonia where the average onset of breeding differs by 12 days. Although growth and development of Estonian tadpoles trailed Danish conspecifics during the first half of the larval period, Estonian tadpoles caught up in both body length and developmental stage to Danish tadpoles in the last third of the larval period. Breeding ponds in Denmark were significantly larger and deeper than in Estonia, however, the water temperatures in the ponds did not vary substantially between the countries. In Estonia the toads selected shallower breeding ponds with higher temperature and oxygen concentrations, suggesting, that at higher latitudes active selection of specific water bodies ensures faster growth and development of larvae. The results, together with previous laboratory evidence, indicate that amphibian distribution limits are shaped both by adaptive differences in developmental rates and behavioural plasticity. To cope with harsh climates, amphibians in the north apparently require shallow water bodies - a habitat particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic degradation. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - The developed controlled pulse keyholing plasma arc welding control system has been verified to stabilize the keyhole behaviour and improve the process stability, confirm the weld quality. However, the system is developed based on the indirect signals to reflect keyhole penetration state, the feedback signal cannot measure the weld pool thermal state. Previous observation studies to the PAW keyhole behaviour find that, keyhole exit positional parameter is better to predicate the weld pool thermal state evolution than the keyhole dimensional parameters, and the decreasing speed of the welding current in pulse waveform is reliable to adjust the keyhole exit deviation distance. In this paper, a novel controlled pulse keyholing PAW control system is designed by using the keyhole exit image as the feedback signal. In the new system, keyhole exit deviation distance as the controlled factor, falling degree in the welding current pulse as the controlling factor, predicative control algorithm is developed. Bead on welding is conducted on the 9.5 mm thick 304 stainless steel plate to test control system, keyhole process is controlled to open and close smoothly, sound quality weld is obtained. © 2017 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

VL  - 19
IS  - 7
SP  - 1985-2000
AB  - Findings on climate change influence on plant pathogens are often inconsistent and context dependent. Knowledge of pathogens affecting agricultural crops and natural plant communities remains fragmented along disciplinary lines. By broadening the perspective beyond agriculture, this review integrates cross-disciplinary knowledge to show that at scales relevant to climate change, accelerated evolution and changing geographic distribution will be the main implications for pathogens. New races may evolve rapidly under elevated temperature and CO2, as evolutionary forces act on massive pathogen populations boosted by a combination of increased fecundity and infection cycles under favourable microclimate within enlarged canopy. Changing geographic distribution will bring together diverse lineages/genotypes that do not share common ecological niche, potentially increasing pathogen diversity. However, the uncertainty of model predictions and a lack of synthesis of fragmented knowledge remain as major deficiencies in knowledge. The review contends that the failure to consider scale and human intervention through new technology are major sources of uncertainty. Recognizing that improved biophysical models alone will not reduce uncertainty, it proposes a generic framework to increase focus and outlines ways to integrate biophysical elements and technology change with human intervention scenarios to minimize uncertainty. To synthesize knowledge of pathogen biology and life history, the review borrows the concept of 'fitness' from population biology as a comprehensive measure of pathogen strengths and vulnerabilities, and explores the implications of pathogen mode of nutrition to fitness and its interactions with plants suffering chronic abiotic stress under climate change. Current and future disease management options can then be judged for their ability to impair pathogenic and saprophytic fitness. The review pinpoints improving confidence in model prediction by minimizing uncertainty, developing management strategies to reduce overall pathogen fitness, and finding new sources of data to trawl for climate signatures on pathogens as important challenges for future research. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A potential biosurfactant producing strain, marine Nocardiopsis B4 was isolated from the West coast of India. Culture conditions involving variations in carbon and nitrogen sources were examined at constant pH, temperature and revolutions per min (rpm), with the aim of increasing productivity in the process. The biosurfactant production was followed by measuring the surface tension, emulsification assay and emulsifying index E24. Enhanced biosurfactant production was carried out using olive oil as the carbon source and phenyl alanine as the nitrogen source. The maximum production of the biosurfactant by Nocardiopsis occurred at a C/N ratio of 2:1 and the optimized bioprocess condition was pH 7.0, temperature 30 degrees C and salt concentration 3%. The production of the biosurfactant was growth dependent. The surface tension was reduced up to 29 mN/m as well as the emulsification index E24 was 80% in 6 to 9 days. Properties of the biosurfactant that was separated by acid precipitation were investigated. The biosurfactant activity was stable at high temperature, a wide range of pH and salt concentrations thus, indicating its application in bioremediation, food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries.

AB  - A series of Escherichia coli strains with varied genomic sequences were subjected to high-density microarray analyses to elucidate the fitness-correlated transcriptomes. Fitness, which is commonly evaluated by the growth rate during the exponential phase, is not only determined by the genome but is also linked to growth conditions, e.g., temperature. We previously reported genetic and environmental contributions to E. coli transcriptomes and evolutionary transcriptome changes in thermal adaptation. Here, we describe experimental details on how to prepare microarray samples that truly represent the growth fitness of the E. coli cells. A step-by-step record of sample preparation procedures that correspond to growing cells and transcriptome data sets that are deposited at the GEO database (GSE33212, GSE52770, GSE61739) are also provided for reference.

TI  - Tick-pathogen Ensembles: Do molecular interactions lead ecological innovation?
VL  - 7
AB  - Ticks are arthropods distributed worldwide that constitute the most important vectors of diseases to animals, and second to mosquitoes regarding pathogens of public health importance. Ticks are remarkably plastic and can colonize diverse ecological niches of the planet, from tropics to polar areas (de la Fuente et al., 2008). In the last decade, the reports of tick-borne pathogens have increased sharply, motivating vigorous research programs that addressed major questions on the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases, vector-host-pathogen interactions, tick ecology, and tick genomics. Notably, the first tick genome was released this year (Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016), opening new possibilities to explore tick-host-pathogen interactions (de la Fuente et al., 2016a). In contrast, the evolutionary and ecological implications of tick-pathogen associations have received comparatively less attention. Herein, we hypothesized that tick-pathogen associations evolved to form “intimate epigenetic relationships” similar to those described for Theileria spp. and its vertebrate host (Cheeseman and Weitzman, 2015) in which the pathogen induces transcriptional reprogramming in infected ticks. This will ultimately favor pathogen propagation, but will also select for the most suitable ecological adaptations in the tick vector. These phenotypic and genetic changes may have the potential to be transmitted to the next generation of ticks. As a result, the ecological associations between tick, vertebrates, and pathogens would evolve to maximize pathogen circulation in these communities (Estrada-Peña et al., 2015, 2016). Our hypothesis was based on the following evidences: (i) tick-borne pathogens induce transcriptional reprogramming in infected tick (Ayllón et al., 2015; Villar et al., 2015; Weisheit et al., 2015) and vertebrate cells (Lee et al., 2008; Bouquet et al., 2016); (ii) tick-borne pathogens produce and secrete effector proteins, nucleomodulins, which constitute a family of proteins produced by bacterial pathogens to control host transcription and other nuclear processes (Bierne and Cossart, 2012), that interact with host epigenetic machinery and induce transcriptional reprogramming (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2009a,b; Rennoll-Bankert et al., 2015; Sinclair et al., 2015; Lina et al., 2016), and (iii) tick-pathogen interactions increase tick fitness (Neelakanta et al., 2010; Belova et al., 2012; Herrmann and Gern, 2015; de la Fuente et al., 2016b). © 2017 Cabezas-Cruz, Estrada-Peña, Rego and De la Fuente.

TI  - Candidate genes that have facilitated freshwater adaptation by palaemonid prawns in the genus Macrobrachium: Identification and expression validation in a model species (M. koombooloomba)
VL  - 2017
IS  - 2
AB  - Background. The endemic Australian freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium koom- booloomba, provides a model for exploring genes involved with freshwater adaptation because it is one of the relatively few Macrobrachium species that can complete its entire life cycle in freshwater. Methods. The present study was conducted to identify potential candidate genes that are likely to contribute to effective freshwater adaptation by M. koombooloomba using a transcriptomics approach. De novo assembly of 75 bp paired end 227,564,643 high quality Illumina raw reads from 6 different cDNA libraries revealed 125,917 contigs of variable lengths (200-18,050 bp) with an N50 value of 1597. Results. In total, 31,272 (24.83%) of the assembled contigs received significant blast hits, of which 27,686 and 22,560 contigs were mapped and functionally annotated, respectively. CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) based transcriptome quality assessment revealed 96.37% completeness. We identified 43 different potential genes that are likely to be involved with freshwater adaptation in M. koombooloomba. Identified candidate genes included: 25 genes for osmoregulation, five for cell volume regulation, seven for stress tolerance, three for body fluid (haemolymph) maintenance, eight for epithelial permeability and water channel regulation, nine for egg size control and three for larval development. RSEM (RNA-Seq Expectation Maximization) based abundance estimation revealed that 6,253, 5,753 and 3,795 transcripts were expressed (at TPM value ≥10) in post larvae, juveniles and adults, respectively. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis showed that 15 genes were expressed differentially in different individuals but these genes apparently were not involved with freshwater adaptation but rather were involved in growth, development and reproductive maturation. Discussion. The genomic resources developed here will be useful for better understanding the molecular basis of freshwater adaptation in Macrobrachium prawns and other crustaceans more broadly. © 2017 Rahi et al.

TI  - Beyond the antipredatory defence: Honey bee venom function as a component of social immunity
VL  - 58
IS  - 6
SP  - 550-557
AB  - The honey bee colonies, with the relevant number of immature brood and adults, and stable, high levels of humidity and temperatures of their nests, result in suitable environments for the development of microorganisms including pathogens. In response, honey bees evolved several adaptations to face the increased risks of epidemic diseases. As the antimicrobial venom peptides of Apis mellifera are present both on the cuticle of adult bees and on the nest wax it has been recently suggested that these substances act as a social antiseptic device. Since the use of venom by honey bees in the context of social immunity needs to be more deeply investigated, we extended the study of this potential role of the venom to different species of the genus Apis (A. mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Apis andreniformis) using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry techniques. In particular we investigated whether (similarly to A. mellifera) the venom is spread over the body cuticle and on the comb wax of these three Asian species. Our results confirm the idea that the venom functions are well beyond the classical stereotype of defence against predators, and suggest that the different nesting biology of these species may be related to the use of the venom in a social immunity context. The presence of antimicrobial peptides on the comb wax of the cavity-dwelling species and on the cuticle of workers of all the studied species represents a good example of "collective immunity" and a component of the "social immunity " respectively.

VL  - 20
IS  - 9
SP  - 1888-1904
AB  - Species with a wide geographical distribution are often composed of distinct subgroups which may be adapted to their local environment. European trout (Salmo trutta species complex) provide an example of such a complex consisting of several genetically and ecologically distinct forms. However, trout populations are strongly influenced by human activities, and it is unclear to what extent neutral and adaptive genetic differences have persisted. We sampled 30 Swiss trout populations from heterogeneous environments along replicated altitudinal gradients in three major European drainages. More than 850 individuals were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci which included loci diagnostic for evolutionary lineages and candidate markers associated with temperature tolerance, reproductive timing and immune defence. We find that the phylogeographic structure of Swiss trout populations has not been completely erased by stocking. Distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the different drainages could be identified, although nonindigenous alleles were clearly present, especially in the two Mediterranean drainages. We also still detected neutral genetic differentiation within rivers which was often associated with the geographical distance between populations. Five loci showed evidence of divergent selection between populations with several drainage-specific patterns. Lineage-diagnostic markers, a marker linked to a quantitative trait locus for upper temperature tolerance in other salmonids and a marker linked to the major histocompatibility class I gene were implicated in local adaptation and some patterns were associated with altitude. In contrast, tentative evidence suggests a signal of balancing selection at a second immune relevant gene (TAP2). Our results confirm the persistence of both neutral and potentially adaptive genetic differences between trout populations in the face of massive human-mediated dispersal. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The integration or coadaptation of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits is represented by whole-organism performance traits such as locomotion or bite force. Additionally, maximum sprint speed is a good indicator of whole-organism performance capacity as variation in sprinting ability can affect survival. We studied thermal biology, morphology, and locomotor performance in a clade of Liolaemus lizards that occurs in the Patagonian steppe and plateaus, a type of habitat characterized by its harsh cold climate. Liolaemus of the lineomaculatus section display a complex mixture of conservative and flexible traits. The phylogenetically informed analyses of these ten Liolaemus species show little coevolution of their thermal traits (only preferred and optimum temperatures were correlated). With regard to performance, maximum speed was positively correlated with optimum temperature. Body size and morphology influenced locomotor performance. Hindlimbs are key for maximal speed, but forelimb length was a better predictor for sustained speed (i.e. average speed over a total distance of 1.2m). Finally, sustained speed differed among species with different diets, with herbivores running on average faster over a long distance than omnivores. J. Exp.

TI  - Climate impacts on landlocked sea lamprey: Implications for host-parasite interactions and invasive species management
VL  - 5
IS  - 6
AB  - Altered thermal regimes under climate change may influence host-parasite interactions and invasive species, both potentially impacting valuable ecosystem services. There is considerable interest in how parasite life cycle rates, growth, and impacts on hosts will change under altered environmental temperatures. Likewise, transformed thermal regimes may reduce natural resistance and barriers preventing establishment of invasive species or alter the range and impacts of established exotic species. The Laurentian Great Lakes are some of the most invaded ecosystems and have been profoundly shaped by exotic species. Invasion by the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) contributed to major declines in many Great Lakes fish populations. In Lake Superior, substantial progress has been made towards controlling invasive sea lamprey and rehabilitating native fish populations. Surface water temperatures in Lake Superior have been increasing rapidly since 1980 presenting a new challenge for management. Here we test how thermal changes in Lake Superior have impacted the feeding and growth of the parasitic sea lamprey. Sea lamprey have increased in size corresponding with longer durations of thermal habitat (i.e., longer growing seasons) for their preferred hosts. To compare regional differences in sea lamprey feeding and growth rates, we used a bioenergetics model with temperature estimates from a lake-wide hydrodynamic model hindcast from 1979-2006. Spatial differences in patterns of warming across the lake result in regionally different predictions for increases in sea lamprey feeding rates and size. These predictions were matched by data from adult sea lamprey spawning in streams draining into these different thermal regions. Larger sea lampreys will be more fecund and have increased feeding rates, thus increasing mortality among host fishes. Resource management should consider these climate driven regional impacts when allocating resources to sea lamprey control efforts. Under new and evolving thermal regimes, successful management systems may need to be restructured for changing phenology, growth, and shifts in host-parasite systems towards greater impacts on host populations. © 2014 Cline et al.

AB  - Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were obtained as eggs from two North American sources, an eastern (Fraser River, Canada) and a western (Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA) stock. Fish were pit tagged (eastern X-±SE=247±13g , western X-±SE=220±4g) and stocked communally into three replicated 7-m3 tanks at a density of 7.6±1.2kg/m3. Each tank was supplied with 2 ppt salinity water from a recirculating biological filtration system. Fish were fed a commercial diet (48%P, 20%F) from automatic feeders. Fish were harvested approximately 24mo after hatching at a final tank density of 56.2±1.3kg/m3. Mean daily water temperature was 10.4 C with a range of 5.9-12.6 C and mean dissolved oxygen was 12.6mg/L with a range of 9.7 (91% of saturation) to 17.8mg/L (149% of saturation). Individual fish were evaluated for total, carcass, and fillet weight, sex, stage of sexual maturity, fillet fat, fillet color, and gonad weight. The western stock fish grew faster and were significantly larger (X-±SE=1.89±0.03kg) (P&lt;0.0001) than the eastern stock (X-±SE=1.19±0.04kg). Heritabilities were low for all traits and ranged from 0.08±0.06 to 0.28±0.09. Genetic correlations for body size traits were highly positive and significant (0.99-1.00). Genetic correlations of fillet color and body size traits were positive, but not significant. Genetic correlations of fillet fat with body size traits were negative, but not significant. Genetic correlation of fillet fat and fillet color was positive and significant (0.55±0.27). Random genetic variation was assessed from microsatellite variability on 30 fish from each stock (eastern and western) and 32 fish from a third commercial source of unknown origin for comparison. The amount of variation detected in the western stock was higher than the eastern and commercial stocks. The eastern stock was composed of an admixture of two sources, the commercial stock was composed by three different sources, and the western stock was composed by three to four source populations. Data will be used to calculate breeding values on a separate group of captive sibling adult broodfish and a line selected for carcass weight and maturity at 3yr will be developed. Published 2013.

AB  - A survey work on green house cultivation was carried out with a view to study the motivating factors and problems faced by grower in South Gujarat in the year 2007-08. Out of total 83 green houses in Gujarat, 20 respondents were selected randomly from South Gujarat for study. The results revealed that about one third (35%) of the respondents were motivated by progressive farmers followed by self efforts (30%) and one fourth by Agricultural fairs/tour. Among the different problems, all the growers (100%) faced the problems of high cost of fertilizers and high temperature in summer. About 90% of the respondents faced the problems of high cost of planting material, lack of leaf analysis technique, pest and disease and their control measures and fluctuations in market prices. The problems of non availability of skilled laborers, high genset cost and its high operating cost, non availability of timely transport and high freight charges were faced by 85% of the respondents. Non availability of power continuously and its high cost were also reported as severe problems by 75% respondents.

TI  - Genetic decoupling of thermal hardiness across metamorphosis in drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 57
IS  - 5
SP  - 999-1009
AB  - As organisms age the environment fluctuates, exerting differential selection across ontogeny. In particular, highly seasonal environments expose life stages to often drastically different thermal environments. This developmental variation is particularly striking in organisms with complex life cycles, wherein life history stages also exhibit distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors. Genes acting pleiotropically on thermal responses may produce genetic correlations across ontogeny, constraining the independent evolution of each life stage to their respective thermal environments. To investigate whether developmental genetic correlations constrain the evolution thermal hardiness of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, we applied quantitative genetic analyses to cold hardiness measured in both larvae and adults from isogenic lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), using survival at stressful low temperatures as the phenotypic metric. Using full genome resequencing data for the DGRP, we also implemented genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMMs) to estimate associations between naturally segregating variation and cold hardiness for both larvae and adults. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed no significant genetic correlation for cold hardiness between life stages, suggesting complete genetic decoupling of thermal hardiness across the metamorphic boundary. Both quantitative genetic and GWA analyses suggested that polygenic variation underlies cold hardiness in both stages, and that associated loci largely affected one stage or the other, but not both. However, reciprocal enrichment tests and correlations between BSLMM parameters for each life stage support some shared physiological mechanisms that may reflect common cellular thermal response pathways. Overall, these results suggest no developmental genetic constraints on cold hardiness across metamorphosis in D. melanogaster, an important consideration in evolutionary models of responses to changing climates. Genetic correlations for environmental sensitivity across ontogeny remains largely unexplored in other organisms, thus assessing the generality of genetic decoupling will require further quantitative or population genetic analysis in additional species. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Demography can favour female-advantageous alleles
VL  - 281
IS  - 1790
AB  - When female fecundity is relatively independent of male abundance, while male reproduction is proportional to female abundance, females have a larger effect on population dynamics than males (i.e. female demographic dominance). This population dynamic phenomenon might not appear to influence evolution, because male and female genomes still contribute equally much to the next generation. However, here we examine two evolutionary scenarios to provide a proof of principle that spatial structure can make female demographic dominance matter. Our two simulation models combine dispersal evolution with local adaptation subjected to intralocus sexual conflict and environmentally driven sex ratio biases, respectively. Both models have equilibria where one environment (without being intrinsically poorer) has so few reproductive females that trait evolution becomes disproportionately determined by those environments where females survive better (intralocus sexual conflict model), or where daughters are overproduced (environmental sex determination model). Surprisingly, however, the two facts that selection favours alleles that benefit females, and population growth is improved when female fitness is high, together do not imply that all measures of population performance are improved. The sex-specificity of the source-sink dynamics predicts that populations can evolve to fail to persist in habitats where alleles do poorly when expressed in females. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 5

SP  - 299-309
AB  - Dengue is currently regarded globally as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. A history of symptoms compatible with dengue can be traced back to the Chin Dynasty of 265-420 AD. The virus and its vectors have now become widely distributed throughout tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly over the last half-century. Significant geographic expansion has been coupled with rapid increases in incident cases, epidemics, and hyperendemicity, leading to the more severe forms of dengue. Transmission of dengue is now present in every World Health Organization (WHO) region of the world and more than 125 countries are known to be dengue endemic. The true impact of dengue globally is difficult to ascertain due to factors such as inadequate disease surveillance, misdiagnosis, and low levels of reporting. Currently available data likely grossly underestimates the social, economic, and disease burden. Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections per year have ranged between 50 million and 200 million; however, recent estimates using cartographic approaches suggest this number is closer to almost 400 million. The expansion of dengue is expected to increase due to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change, globalization, travel, trade, socioeconomics, settlement and also viral evolution. No vaccine or specific antiviral therapy currently exists to address the growing threat of dengue. Prompt case detection and appropriate clinical management can reduce the mortality from severe dengue. Effective vector control is the mainstay of dengue prevention and control. Surveillance and improved reporting of dengue cases is also essential to gauge the true global situation as indicated in the objectives of the WHO Global Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control, 2012-2020. More accurate data will inform the prioritization of research, health policy, and financial resources toward reducing this poorly controlled disease. The objective of this paper is to review historical and current epidemiology of dengue worldwide and, additionally, reflect on some potential reasons for expansion of dengue into the future. © 2013 Murray et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

AB  - Maria Virginia Parachu Marco, Carlos Ignacio Pina, Melina Simoncini, and Larriera Alejandro (2010) Effects of incubation and rearing temperatures on Caiman latirostris growth. Zoological Studies 49(3): 367-373. Different studies found that incubation temperature has an influence on the size of Caiman latirostris hatchlings and determines their gonadal sex. Experimental manipulations revealed that the effects of temperature on growth are independent of sex. Ambient temperature after hatching is also an influential factor: juvenile caiman had lower growth at a cool (29 degrees C) vs. a warm temperature (33 degrees C) independent of incubation temperatures. Two-month-old caiman were raised at 2 different temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) for 100 d. These animals were subjected to different incubation treatments: 29, 31 (females), 33 (males), and 33 degrees C with 17 beta-estradiol (females). No differences were found in growth based on incubation temperature or sex. Our data indicate that the evolutionary advantage of a temperature-dependent sex determination, if it exists, is not bound to differential growth between the sexes nor to incubation temperature, at least in the 1st stages of life before hatchlings reach their 1st winter. Temperatures during the development and grow-out phases have direct effects on the size of the broad-snouted caiman. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.3/367.pdf

TI  - A narrow quantitative trait locus in C. elegans coordinately affects longevity, thermotolerance, and resistance to paraquat
VL  - 2
AB  - By linkage mapping of quantitative trait loci, we previously identified at least 11 natural genetic variants that significantly modulate Caenorhabditis elegans life-span (LS), many of which would have eluded discovery by knock-down or mutation screens. A region on chromosome IV between markers stP13 and stP35 had striking effects on longevity in three inter-strain crosses (each P &lt; 10-9). In order to define the limits of that interval, we have now constructed two independent lines by marker-based selection during 20 backcross generations, isolating the stP13-stP35 interval from strain Bergerac-BO in a CL2a background. These congenic lines differed significantly from CL2a in LS, assayed in two environments (each P &lt; 0.001). We then screened for exchange of flanking markers to isolate recombinants that partition this region, because fine-mapping the boundaries for overlapping heteroallelic spans can greatly narrow the implicated interval. Recombinants carrying the CL2a allele at stP35 were consistently long-lived compared to those retaining the Bergerac-BO allele (P &lt; 0.001), and more resistant to temperature elevation and paraquat (each ~ 1.7-fold, P &lt; 0.0001), but gained little protection from ultraviolet or peroxide stresses. Two rounds of recombinant screening, followed by fine-mapping of break-points and survival testing, narrowed the interval to 0.18 Mb (13.35-13.53 Mb) containing 26 putative genes and six small-nuclear RNAs - a manageable number of targets for functional assessment. © 2011 Vertino, Ayyadevara, Thaden and Reis.

TI  - Reaching the limit: Constrained behavioural flexibility of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) at current coastal temperatures
VL  - 413
SP  - 192-197
AB  - The currently rising sea temperatures are expected to affect the structure of aquatic communities. Through increased metabolic rates, activity and feeding motivation, higher temperature can be expected to add to competition and predation risk for many small fish and juveniles. However, behavioural flexibility e.g. individual variation in the expression of behavioural traits may act to buffer the detrimental effects of increased temperature. In the present study we ask how juvenile Atlantic cod respond to food availability and predation risk at the limits of their current natural temperature at the Icelandic coast (3 degrees C-13 degrees C). At 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles responded less to risk, remaining active, dispersed and leaving shelter positions earlier. However, at the same time their feeding attempts reduce significantly and correspondingly to the lower temperature. Therefore, our results suggest that at 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles do not adjust their behaviour to manage the increased feeding motivation while under risk. However, we do find evidence for individual variation in how behaviour is expressed across treatments indicating natural variation that could respond to selection. In conclusion, our results suggest that increased sea temperature could have both immediate negative effects on survival and initiate a selective response in Atlantic cod populations.

AB  - The characteristics of oxygen/hydrogen productivity using 30-mol%-M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Mn)-doped CeO2-delta (30-mol%-M-CeO2-delta) were studied for the thermochemical two-step water splitting cycle comprising TR (thermal reduction) at 1500 degrees C and WD (water decomposition) at 1150 degrees C. The reproducibility of oxygen evolution was evaluated using 30-mol%-M-CeO2-delta and the effects of different M dopants were compared in the TR temperature range of 1200-1500 degrees C. Two solid phases detected in the 30-mol%-M- CeO2-delta powders were involved in the redox reaction of the thermochemical two-step water splitting cycle. Among the M-CeO2-delta samples evaluated, Mn-doped CeO2-delta provided the most stable and reproducible results and the highest reactivity for oxygen evolution at all temperatures employed for the TR step of the thermochemical two-step water-splitting cycle.

VL  - 28

AB  - Successful latitudinal expansions into temperate climates depend largely upon the evolution of novel adaptive traits or the presence of pre-adaptive or exapted mechanisms for survival in seasonal climates. Geographic comparisons of ancestral (pre-expansion) and derived (post-expansion) populations provide a useful framework for understanding the evolutionary conditions that facilitate geographic expansions. Using a common agricultural pest, the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as a model, we conducted a regional comparison of cold hardiness and overwintering success among ancestral (southern Mexico) and derived (Vermont and Kansas, USA) L. decemlineata populations. In order to determine if ancestral and derived beetle populations vary physiologically for cold hardiness, we compared supercooling points (SCPs) of three geographic populations of L. decemlineata. We also tested if ancestral and derived beetle populations differed in their overwintering behavior and success by performing an overwintering field experiment. Ancestral and derived populations did not express different physiological responses (i.e. SCPs) to freezing temperatures. However, ancestral and derived populations responded differently to the onset of winter conditions and displayed dissimilar overwintering behaviors. The majority of ancestral beetles failed to initiate diapause and dug upward within experimental mesocosms. Differences in overwintering behavior also resulted in significant variation in overwintering success as derived populations displayed higher overwintering survivorship when compared with ancestral populations. Given our results, it is evident that research exploring the interaction of the ecological factors and evolutionary processes is necessary to fully realize the dynamics of biological invasions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Maximum thermal tolerance trades off with chronic tolerance of high temperature in contrasting thermal populations of Radix balthica
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
SP  - 3149-3156
AB  - Thermal adaptation theory predicts that thermal specialists evolve in environments with low temporal and high spatial thermal variation, whereas thermal generalists are favored in environments with high temporal and low spatial variation. The thermal environment of many organisms is predicted to change with globally increasing temperatures and thermal specialists are presumably at higher risk than thermal generalists. Here we investigated critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and preferred temperature (Tp) in populations of the common pond snail (Radix balthica) originating from a small-scale system of geothermal springs in northern Iceland, where stable cold (ca. 7°C) and warm (ca. 23°C) habitats are connected with habitats following the seasonal thermal variation. Irrespective of thermal origin, we found a common Tp for all populations, corresponding to the common temperature optimum (Topt) for fitness-related traits in these populations. Warm-origin snails had lowest CTmax. As our previous studies have found higher chronic temperature tolerance in the warm populations, we suggest that there is a trade-off between high temperature tolerance and performance in other fitness components, including tolerance to chronic thermal stress. Tp and CTmax were positively correlated in warm-origin snails, suggesting a need to maintain a minimum “warming tolerance” (difference in CTmax and habitat temperature) in warm environments. Our results highlight the importance of high mean temperature in shaping thermal performance curves. © 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Radioresistance of Adenine to Cosmic Rays
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 298-308
AB  - The presence of nucleobases in carbonaceous meteorites on Earth is an indication of the existence of this class of molecules in outer space. However, space is permeated by ionizing radiation, which can have damaging effects on these molecules. Adenine is a purine nucleobase that amalgamates important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and ATP. Adenine has a unique importance in biochemistry and therefore life. The aim of this work was to study the effects of cosmic ray analogues on solid adenine and estimate its survival when exposed to corpuscular radiation. Adenine films were irradiated at GANIL (Caen, France) and GSI (Darmstadt, Germany) by 820 MeV Kr33+, 190 MeV Ca10+, 92 MeV Xe23+, and 12 MeV C4+ ion beams at low temperature. The evolution of adenine molecules under heavy ion irradiation was studied by IR absorption spectroscopy as a function of projectile fluence. It was found that the adenine destruction cross section (σd) follows an electronic stopping power (Se) power law under the form: CSen; C is a constant, and the exponential n is a dimensionless quantity. Using the equation above to fit our results, we determined σd = 4 × 10-17 Se1.17, with Se in kiloelectronvolts per micrometer (keV μm-1). New IR absorption bands arise under irradiation of adenine and can be attributed to HCN, CN-, C2H4N4, CH3CN, and (CH3)3CNC. These findings may help to understand the stability and chemistry related to complex organic molecules in space. The half-life of solid adenine exposed to the simulated interstellar medium cosmic ray flux was estimated as (10 ± 8) × 106 years.

TI  - Living in the soil matrix. Abiotic factors affecting root herbivores
VL  - 45
SP  - 1
AB  - Root herbivores live in the soil matrix where they are in constant physical contact with their environment and have become behaviourally and physiologically adapted to its abiotic properties. Soil moisture is amongst the most important factors influencing root herbivores, though this is tightly linked with soil temperature. Root herbivores have evolved behavioural (e.g. cell construction and burrowing) and physiological (e.g. cuticular pumps and spiracle valves) mechanisms to prevent desiccation and suffocation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is higher within the soil than in the air, and hence, root feeders are physiologically adapted to high concentrations. Indirectly, root herbivores can benefit from elevated atmospheric CO2 through stimulation of root growth, though studies are scarce. Similarly, in an agricultural context, fertilisation usually affects root herbivores positively through improved nutritional quality of host plants. Soil texture and structure is critical for root herbivore movement, and compacted soils cause significant mortality. As a consequence, many maternal insects specifically oviposit in soils amenable to offspring movement. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Shape evolution and thermal stability of lysozyme crystals: Effect of pH and temperature
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-99
AB  - The properties of crystalline protein materials are closely linked to crystal shape. However, the effective strategies for the shape control of protein crystals are lacking. The conventional sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed to investigate the influence of pH and temperature on the crystal nucleation behavior of hen egg white lysozyme. Moreover, the size distributions of protein crystals grown at different conditions were analyzed. Differential scanning calorimetry was employed to evaluate the thermal stability of lysozyme crystals. The results indicated that pH and temperature will affect the supersaturation and electrostatic interactions among protein molecules in the nucleation process. In particular, the crystals with different aspect ratios can be selectively nucleated, depending upon the choice of pH and temperature. Therefore, this study provided a simple method for obtaining shape-controlled lysozyme crystals and supplied some information on thermal behaviors of lysozyme crystals grown at different pH values. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 68
IS  - 2
SP  - 101-106
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using 16S rRNA and elongation factor (tuf) mRNA as targets for selective detection of viable beer-spoilage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). One-step real-time RT-PCR was applied to monitor the target transcripts in Lactobacillus brevis, L. lindneri, and Pediococcus damnosus. Three methods were compared for total RNA extraction. To study the correlation between viability and RNA detection, log-phase cultures were inactivated using brewery disinfectant or heating. RT-PCR, denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and cultivation were performed before and at various times after the inactivation treatments. A method combining bead-beating with traditional RNA purification provided good RNA yield from LAB. The 16S rRNA and tuf mRNA targets were detected in inactivated cells by RT-PCR throughout a 21-day storage period. Cultivable cells could not be recovered at any postinactivation time. The 16S rRNA degraded with time, and its degradation appeared to be initially faster after disinfection than after heating. The overall degradation patterns between the strains were similar. Our results indicate that tuf mRNA and 16S rRNA can be stable in LAB cells inactivated under conditions they may encounter during the brewing process. Hence, the RT-PCR analysis of these target transcripts may not be a reliable technique for selective detection of viable LAB in brewery samples. © 2010 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.

AB  - Populations should adapt to the climate at their respective localities. Here, we examined differences in thermal biology between two populations of Podarcis hispanica lizards from areas with different climates. Lizards from the cold, northern mountains attained lower field body temperatures than lizards form the warm, southern plains. However, the larger body size and darker coloration of northern lizards resulted in slower cooling rates, which may increase efficiency of thermoregulation. Northern populations selected higher temperatures in a thermal gradient, possibly as an adaptation to heat up before conditions changed, as their mountain environment is unpredictable. Finally, lizards from both populations had similar temperature-dependent locomotor performance curves, although southern lizards were relatively faster considering their smaller body size. We suggest that environmental differences may lead to differences in morphology and locally adapted thermal biology in lizards that might allow maximizing thermoregulation in each local climatic conditions. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2013.

VL  - 69

SP  - 2399-2413
AB  - Polyphenism, the expression of discrete alternative phenotypes, is often a consequence of a developmental switch. Physiological changes induced by a developmental switch potentially affect reaction norms, but the evolution and existence of alternative reaction norms remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that, in the butterfly Pieris napi (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), thermal reaction norms of several life history traits vary adaptively among switch-induced alternative developmental pathways of diapause and direct development. The switch was affected both by photoperiod and temperature, ambient temperature during late development having the potential to override earlier photoperiodic cues. Directly developing larvae had higher development and growth rates than diapausing ones across the studied thermal gradient. Reaction norm shapes also differed between the alternative developmental pathways, indicating pathway-specific selection on thermal sensitivity. Relative mass increments decreased linearly with increasing temperature and were higher under direct development than diapause. Contrary to predictions, population phenology did not explain trait variation or thermal sensitivity, but our experimental design probably lacks power for finding subtle phenology effects. We demonstrate adaptive differentiation in thermal reaction norms among alternative phenotypes, and suggest that the consequences of an environmentally dependent developmental switch primarily drive the evolution of alternative thermal reaction norms in P. napi. © 2015 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - The effect of temperature on development and behaviour of relict leopard frog tadpoles
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Relict leopard frog (Rana [Lithobates] onca) tadpoles were obtained shortly after hatching at Gosner stage 25 and raised in aquaria maintained at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C. Development was arrested in the 15 degrees C group, and survivorship declined to 64% after 191 days. However, 80% of the surviving larvae remained alive after the temperature was increased to 25 degrees C. Of these, 96% reached metamorphosis. Survivorship of the 20, 25 and 30 degrees C acclimation groups was 82, 94 and 66%, respectively, whereas none survived at 35 degrees C. Time to metamorphosis was significantly shorter for the 25 degrees C group (67 +/- 1 days), followed by the 30 degrees C (98 +/- 2 days) and 20 degrees C (264 +/- 7 days) groups. A linear 66 cm thermal gradient was used to identify temperature ranges selected by tadpoles in the different acclimation groups. Five 10 degrees C gradients (10-20, 15-25, 20-30, 25-35 and 30-40 degrees C) were used, and time spent in the cooler, middle and warmer thirds of the gradient was compared for 10 individuals from each acclimation group. In the coolest gradient, tadpoles from all acclimation groups selected the warmer third (> 17 degrees C) of the gradient. In the warmer gradients, tadpoles from the 20 and 25 degrees C acclimation groups selected temperatures <29 degrees C, while those from the 30 degrees C acclimation group selected temperatures <33 degrees C. Maximal burst speed for all groups was greater at experimental temperatures of 25 than 15 degrees C. Efforts to reintroduce this species to its historical range should select habitats where water temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees C are available during the post-hatching period.

TI  - Strong ion regulatory abilities enable the crab xenograpsus testudinatus to inhabit highly acidified marine vent systems
VL  - 7
AB  - Hydrothermal vent organisms have evolved physiological adaptations to cope with extreme abiotic conditions including temperature and pH. To date, acid-base regulatory abilities of vent organisms are poorly investigated, although this physiological feature is essential for survival in low pH environments. We report the acid-base regulatory mechanisms of a hydrothermal vent crab, Xenograpsus testudinatus, endemic to highly acidic shallow-water vent habitats with average environment pH-values ranging between 5.4 and 6.6. Within a few hours, X. testudinatus restores extracellular pH (pHe) in response to environmental acidification of pH 6.5 (1.78 kPa pCO2) accompanied by an increase in blood HCO3- levels from 8.8 ± 0.3 to 31 ± 6 mM. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase (VHA), the major ion pumps involved in branchial acid-base regulation, showed dynamic increases in response to acidified conditions on the mRNA, protein and activity level. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate the presence of NKA in basolateral membranes, whereas the VHA is predominantly localized in cytoplasmic vesicles of branchial epithelial- and pillar-cells. X. testudinatus is closely related to other strong osmo-regulating brachyurans, which is also reflected in the phylogeny of the NKA. Accordingly, our results suggest that the evolution of strong ion regulatory abilities in brachyuran crabs that allowed the occupation of ecological niches in euryhaline, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats are probably also linked to substantial acid-base regulatory abilities. This physiological trait allowed X. testudinatus to successfully inhabit one of the world's most acidic marine environments. © 2016 Hu, Guh, Shao, Kuan, Chen, Lee, Jeng and Tseng.

VL  - 223
IS  - 2
SP  - 236-244
AB  - Shell calcification in argonauts is unique. Only females of these cephalopods construct the paper nautilus shell, which is used as a brood chamber for developing embryos in the pelagic realm. As one of the thinnest (225 mu m) known adult mollusc shells, and lacking an outer protective periostracum-like cover, this shell may be susceptible to dissolution as the ocean warms and decreases in pH. Vulnerability of the A. nodosa shell was investigated through immersion of shell fragments in multifactorial experiments of control (19 degrees C/pH 8.1; pCO(2) 419; Omega(Ca) = 4.23) and near-future conditions (24 degrees C/pH 7.8-7.6; pCO(2) 932-1525; Omega(Ca) = 2.72-1.55) for 14 days. More extreme pH treatments (pH 7.4-7.2; pCO(2) 2454-3882; Omega(Ca) = 1.20-0.67) were used to assess tipping points in shell dissolution. X-ray diffractometry revealed no change in mineralogy between untreated and treated shells. Reduced shell weight due to dissolution was evident in shells incubated at pH 7.8 (projected for 2070) after 14 days at control temperature, with increased dissolution in warmer and lower pH treatments. The greatest dissolution was recorded at 24 degrees C (projected for local waters by 2100) compared to control temperature across all low-pH treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed dissolution and etching of shell mineral in experimental treatments. In the absence of compensatory mineralization, the uncovered female brood chamber will be susceptible to dissolution as ocean pH decreases. Since the shell was a crucial adaptation for the evolution of the argonauts' holopelagic existence, persistence of A. nodosa may be compromised by shell dissolution in an ocean-change world.

VL  - 62
SP  - 141-145
AB  - Vinegar is a precious food additive and complement as well as effective preservative against food spoilage. Recently traditional vinegar production has been improved using various natural substrates and fruits such as grape, palm, cherry, coconut, date, sugarcane, rice and balsam. These neoclassical fermentations resulted in several vinegar types with different tastes, fragrances and nutritional values because of applying various acetic acid bacteria as starters. Acetic acid bacteria include genera Acetobacter, Gluconacetobacter and Gluconobacter according to latest edition of Bergy's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology that classifies genera on the basis of their 16s RNA differences. Acetobacter spp as the main vinegar starters belong to family Acetobacteraceae that are gram negative obligate aerobes, chemoorganotrophic bacilli that are oxidase negative and oxidize ethanol to acetic acid. In this research we isolated and identified a native Acetobacter strain with high acetic acid productivity and tolerance against high ethanol concentrations from Iranian peach as a summer delicious fruit that is very susceptible to food spoilage and decay. We used selective and specific laboratorial culture media such as Standard GYC, Frateur and Carr medium. Also we used a new industrial culture medium and a miniature fermentor with a new aeration system innovated by Pars Yeema Biotechnologists Co., Isfahan Science and Technology Town (ISTT), Isfahan, Iran. The isolated strain was successfully cultivated in modified Carr media with 2.5% and 5% ethanol simultaneously in high temperatures, 34 - 40 o C after 96 hours of incubation period. We showed that the increase of ethanol concentration resulted in rising of strain sensitivity to high temperature. In conclusion we isolated and characterized a new Acetobacter strain from Iranian peach that could be considered as a potential strain for production of a new vinegar type, peach vinegar, with a delicious taste and advantageous nutritional value in food biotechnology and industrial microbiology.

TI  - Revealing martensitic transformation and α/β interface evolution in electron beam melting three-dimensional-printed Ti-6Al-4V
VL  - 6
AB  - As an important metal three-dimensional printing technology, electron beam melting (EBM) is gaining increasing attention due to its huge potential applications in aerospace and biomedical fields. EBM processing of Ti-6Al-4V as well as its microstructure and mechanical properties were extensively investigated. However, it is still lack of quantitative studies regarding its microstructural evolution, indicative of EBM thermal process. Here, we report α′ martensitic transformation and α/β interface evolution in varied printing thicknesses of EBM-printed Ti-6Al-4V block samples by means of atom probe tomography. Quantitative chemical composition analysis suggests a general phase transformation sequence. By increasing in-fill hatched thickness, elemental partitioning ratios arise and β volume fraction is increased. Furthermore, we observe kinetic vanadium segregation and aluminum depletion at interface front and the resultant α/β interface widening phenomenon. It may give rise to an increased α/β lattice mismatch and weakened α/β interfaces, which could account for the degraded strength as printing thickness increases.

VL  - 47

SP  - 2227-2242
AB  - As a major part of fish larval diet in nature, copepods constitute an appropriate live prey for aquaculture purposes. Considering the difficulty of mastering copepod mass production, studies on their growth performance at different environmental conditions are needed to improve their productivity. In this study a new selective approach based on temperature control is proposed to improve the physiological (body size, fecundity and lipid storage) performance of copepods. The estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis known to have a high genetic variance in temperature tolerance was used as a biological model. First two different copepod lines were obtained after long-term culture at constant cold (7 degrees C) and warm (20 degrees C) temperatures. Then both populations were transferred to a higher temperature of 24 degrees C appropriate for aquaculture use and followed during five generations. During the first two generations (F1-F2) of a cold-acclimated population, female body size and fecundity decreased significantly whereas the survival rate remained high. The high lipid content of this population was used by females to compensate the heat shock of more than 10 degrees C. However, the survival rate decreased dramatically in F3 but allowed the selection of robust individuals which progressively improved their fitness during the following generations. So, compared to the warm acclimated population, the cold acclimated one showed larger body size, higher fecundity and better lipid storage. After only five generations at 24 degrees C the cold-acclimated population showed a significant genetic gain in prosome length compared to the warm acclimated one.

TI  - Unmasking host and microbial strategies in the agrobacterium-plant defense tango
VL  - 6
SP  - 1-17
AB  - Coevolutionary forces drive adaptation of both plant-associated microbes and their hosts. Eloquently captured in the Red Queen Hypothesis, the complexity of each plant-pathogen relationship reflects escalating adversarial strategies, but also external biotic and abiotic pressures on both partners. Innate immune responses are triggered by highly conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs, that are harbingers of microbial presence. Upon cell surface receptor-mediated recognition of these pathogen-derived molecules, host plants mount a variety of physiological responses to limit pathogen survival and/or invasion. Successful pathogens often rely on secretion systems to translocate host-modulating effectors that subvert plant defenses, thereby increasing virulence. Host plants, in turn, have evolved to recognize these effectors, activating what has typically been characterized as a pathogen-specific form of immunity. Recent data support the notion that PAMP-triggered and effector-triggered defenses are complementary facets of a convergent, albeit differentially regulated, set of immune responses. This review highlights the key players in the plant’s recognition and signal transduction pathways, with a focus on the aspects that may limit Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection and the ways it might overcome those defenses. Recent advances in the field include a growing appreciation for the contributions of cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking to the regulation of these exquisitely tuned defenses. Pathogen counter-defenses frequently manipulate the interwoven hormonal pathways that mediate host responses. Emerging systems-level analyses include host physiological factors such as circadian cycling. The existing literature indicates that varying or even conflicting results from different labs may well be attributable to environmental factors including time of day of infection, temperature, and/or developmental stage of the host plant. © 2015 Hwang, Wang, Bravo and Banta.

AB  - The fire-damaged pressure vessel reactor, evaluated in this study, was a cylindrical vessel with design conditions of 460 psig (3.17 MPa) at 413 °C. The fitness for service (FFS) of the fire-damaged pressure vessel was assessed according to API 579-1/ASME FFS-1. First, the maximum temperature during the fire accident was determined based on deterioration of outer protective layer. Then, the possible damage was examined by hardness test, in-situ field metallography and metallographic replicas. Grain growth and spheroidized pearlite were observed in the base metal at the inner surface of the vessel. Outer surface of the vessel showed ferritic microstructure with smaller grain size as compared to the inner surface. Decarburizing and carbide formation were also visible at the outer surface. The lower hardness of the base metal at both sides of the vessel was compared to the standard value and related to the microstructure evolution during high temperature/fire exposure condition. The results of the FFS evaluation indicated that the vessel is not suitable for the current design conditions, and therefore a new maximum allowable working pressure was determined. © 2017

TI  - Short-term predicted extinction of Andean populations of the lizard Stenocercus guentheri (Iguanidae: Tropidurinae)
VL  - 62
SP  - 30-36
AB  - We studied the thermal physiology of the Andean lizard Stenocercus guentheri in order to evaluate the possible effects of global warming on this species. We determined the preferred body temperature (Tpref), critical thermals (CTmin, CTmax), and hours of restriction and activity. Tpref was 32.14±1.83 °C; CTmin was 8.31 °C in adults and 9.14 °C in juveniles, whereas CTmax was 43.28 °C in adults and 41.68 °C in juveniles. To assess extinction risk, we used the model created by Sinervo et al. (2010) and predicted that 16.7% of populations will have a high risk of extinction by 2020, with an increase to 26.7% by 2050. These results suggest that this species, despite being able to maintain its Tpref through behavioral thermoregulation and habitat selection, could be physiologically sensitive to climate warming; thus, the potential for local adaptation may be limited under a warmer climate. Further studies focusing on the ability of S. guentheri to evolve higher Tpref and thermal tolerances are needed to understand the ability of this species to respond to climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Microarray-based identification of gonad transcripts differentially expressed between lines of pacific oyster selected to be resistant or susceptible to summer mortality
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SP  - 326-339
AB  - Summer mortality of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the result of a complex interaction between oysters, their environment, and pathogens. Heredity appears to be a major factor determining the sensitivity of oysters to summer mortality, allowing resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines to be produced. We conducted genome-wide expression profiling of R and S gonads during the 3-month period preceding a summer mortality event, using a cDNA microarray that we designed. ANOVA analysis revealed that 34 genes were differentially expressed between R and S lines on four dates preceding the mortality event. Annotation of some of these genes highlights reproduction and its allocation and antioxidant defenses as the main pathways that operate differentially between R and S lines. This transcriptional analysis provides new indications to define markers for quantitative trait loci searches and functional studies and evaluate the potential role of each gene in the resistance to summer mortality. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

VL  - 160

SP  - 101-108
AB  - Due to the ephemeral nature of carcasses they grow on, necrophagous blowfly larvae should minimize the time spent on the cadaver. This could be achieved by moving to high-temperature areas. On that basis, we theorized that larvae placed in a heterogeneous thermal environment would move to the higher temperature that speed up their development. This study was designed to (1) test the ability of necrophagous larvae to orientate in a heterogeneous thermal environment, and (2) compare the temperatures selected by the larvae of three common blowfly species: Lucilia sericata (Meigen), Calliphora vomitoria (L.) and Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy). For this purpose, we designed a setup we named Thermograde. It consists of a food-supplied linear thermal gradient that allows larvae to move, feed, and grow in close-to-real conditions, and to choose to stay at a given temperature. For each species and replication, 80 young third instars were placed on the thermal gradient. The location of larvae was observed after 19 h, with fifteen replications per species. The larvae of each species formed aggregations that were always located at the same temperatures, which were highly species-specific: 33.3 ± 1.52 °C for L. sericata, 29.6 ± 1.63 °C for C. vomitoria, and 22.4 ± 1.55 °C for C. vicina. According to the literature, these value allows a fast development of the larvae, but not to reach the maximum development rate. As control experiments clearly demonstrate that larval distribution was not due to differences in food quality, we hypothesized that the local temperature selection by larvae may result from a trade-off between development quality and duration. Indeed, temperature controls not only the development rate of the larvae, but also the quality of their growth and survival rate. Finally, results raise questions regarding the way larvae moved on the gradient and located their preferential temperature. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

TI  - Reliable refuge: Two sky island scorpion species select larger, thermally stable retreat sites
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
AB  - Sky island scorpions shelter under rocks and other surface debris, but, as with other scorpions, it is unclear whether these species select retreat sites randomly. Furthermore, little is known about the thermal preferences of scorpions, and no research has been done to identify whether reproductive condition might influence retreat site selection. The objectives were to (1) identify physical or thermal characteristics for retreat sites occupied by two sky island scorpions (Vaejovis cashi Graham 2007 and V. electrum Hughes 2011) and those not occupied; (2) determine whether retreat site selection differs between the two study species; and (3) identify whether thermal selection differs between species and between gravid and non-gravid females of the same species. Within each scorpion's habitat, maximum dimensions of rocks along a transect line were measured and compared to occupied rocks to determine whether retreat site selection occurred randomly. Temperature loggers were placed under a subset of occupied and unoccupied rocks for 48 hours to compare the thermal characteristics of these rocks. Thermal gradient trials were conducted before parturition and after dispersal of young in order to identify whether gravidity influences thermal preference. Vaejovis cashi and V. electrum both selected larger retreat sites that had more stable thermal profiles. Neither species appeared to have thermal preferences influenced by reproductive condition. However, while thermal selection did not differ among non-gravid individuals, gravid V. electrum selected warmer temperatures than its gravid congener. Sky island scorpions appear to select large retreat sites to maintain thermal stability, although biotic factors (e.g., competition) could also be involved in this choice. Future studies should focus on identifying the various biotic or abiotic factors that could influence retreat site selection in scorpions, as well as determining whether reproductive condition affects thermal selection in other arachnids. © 2016 Becker, Brown.

AB  - Thermal reaction norms of ectotherms exhibit a distinctive latitudinal pattern: the temperature at which performance is maximized coincides with the mean habitat temperature in tropical ectotherms but exceeds the mean temperature in temperate ectotherms. We hypothesize, on the basis of Jensen’s inequality, that this pattern is driven by latitudinal variation in seasonal temperature fluctuations. We test this hypothesis with an eco-evolutionary model that integrates the quantitative genetics of reaction norm evolution with stage-structured population dynamics, which we parameterize with data from insects. We find that thermal optima of temperate and Mediterranean species evolve to exceed the mean habitat temperature if seasonal fluctuations are strong, while the thermal optimum of tropical species evolves to coincide with the mean habitat temperature if fluctuations are weak. Importantly, ecological dynamics can impose a constraint on reaction norm evolution. Tropical species cannot tolerate an increase in seasonal fluctuations at the high mean habitat temperature it experiences, while the temperate species cannot tolerate a reduction in seasonal fluctuations if the mean temperature is higher. In both cases, stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances precludes adaptation to a novel thermal environment. Our findings suggest a potential directionality in colonization success. Tropical ectotherms, because of their high thermal optima, can successfully colonize temperate habitats, while temperate ectotherms, because of their low optima, are less successful in colonizing tropical habitats. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Stress tolerance in a novel system: Genetic and environmental sources of (co)variation for cold tolerance in the butterfly Eurema smilax
VL  - 41
IS  - 5
SP  - 529-537
AB  - The physiological ability to survive climatic extremes, such as low temperature, is a major determinant of species distribution. Research suggests that tropically restricted insect populations may possess low to zero variation in stress tolerance, thereby limiting any potential to adapt to colder climates. This paradigm derives largely from contrasts among Drosophila populations and species along the tropical–temperate cline of eastern Australia. Butterfly groups, such as the variously distributed representatives of the genus Eurema, offer opportunities to test the taxonomic breadth of this paradigm. We contribute here by investigating plasticity, repeatability and heritability (h2) for cold tolerance in Eurema smilax. This continentally widespread species (extending from the Torres Strait to the south coast of Victoria) offers an important comparative basis for evaluating stress tolerance in geographically restricted congenerics. We reared two generations of E. smilax under laboratory conditions and measured recovery from a chill-coma assay, which is one of the commonly used methods for characterizing adult cold stress tolerance. Trials on F2s conducted over three consecutive days revealed individual repeatability (r = 0.405). However, recovery time decreased systematically across trials, which is characteristic of a phenotypically plastic ‘hardening’ response to prior cold exposure. Generalized linear modelling, wherein genetic variance was estimated via an ‘animal model’ approach, indicated no difference between sexes and no effect of body size, but a significant additive genetic term, corresponding to a heritability estimate of h2 = 0.414 ± 0.100. These data suggest significant adaptive potential for cold tolerance in E. smilax but show that individuals may also respond directly to extremes of cold via phenotypic plasticity. This indicates the potential to adapt to varied thermal extremes, which would be expected for a broadly distributed species that is resilient to climate change. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia

AB  - The detection of environmental temperature is critical for the survival of the most diverse organisms. Thermosensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channels have evolved as a class of ion channels activated by a wide range of temperatures. These molecular thermal sensors are spread through the different TRP channel subfamilies. Among the Melastatin subfamily of TRP channels, the eighth member, TRPM8, is a calcium-permeable cationic ion channel activated by cold, by substances that evoke cold sensation such as menthol, and by voltage. This channel is considered the main molecular entity responsible for the sensitivity to cold of primary sensory neurons of the somatosensory system. Here we present to the readers a summary of some the most relevant biophysical properties, physiological role, and molecular intimacies of this polymodal thermoTRP channel. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 172

SP  - 765-775
AB  - Global change is exerting a major effect on plant communities, altering their potential capacity for adaptation. Here, we aimed at unveiling mechanisms of adaptation to high altitude in an endemic long-lived monocarpic, Saxifraga longifolia, by combining demographic and physiological approaches. Plants from three altitudes (570, 1100, and 2100 m above sea level [a.s.l.]) were investigated in terms of leaf water and pigment contents, and activation of stress defense mechanisms. The influence of plant size on physiological performance and mortality was also investigated. Levels of photoprotective molecules (α-tocopherol, carotenoids, and anthocyanins) increased in response to high altitude (1100 relative to 570 m a.s.l.), which was paralleled by reduced soil and leaf water contents and increased ABA levels. The more demanding effect of high altitude on photoprotection was, however, partly abolished at very high altitudes (2100 m a.s.l.) due to improved soil water contents, with the exception of α-tocopherol accumulation. α-Tocopherol levels increased progressively at increasing altitudes, which paralleled with reductions in lipid peroxidation, thus suggesting plants from the highest altitude effectively withstood high light stress. Furthermore, mortality of juveniles was highest at the intermediate population, suggesting that drought stress was the main environmental driver of mortality of juveniles in this rocky plant species. Population structure and vital rates in the high population evidenced lower recruitment and mortality in juveniles, activation of clonal growth, and absence of plant sizedependent mortality. We conclude that, despite S. longifolia has evolved complex mechanisms of adaptation to altitude at the cellular, whole-plant and population levels, drought events may drive increased mortality in the framework of global change. © 2016 American Society of Plant Biologists.

VL  - 21

AB  - The movement of adult muskellunge, Esox masquinongy Mitchill, has been investigated in a variety of systems, but temperature selection by muskellunge has not been examined where well-oxygenated waters were available over a range of temperatures for much of the year. Thirty subadult and adult muskellunge tagged internally with temperature-sensing radio tags were tracked from March 2010 to March 2011 in a Tennessee reservoir. Mean tag temperatures were 18.9 degrees C in spring (March to May), 22.1 degrees C in summer (June to August), 16.5 degrees C in autumn and 9.8 degrees C in winter (December to February). When the greatest range in water temperatures was available (7.1-33.3 degrees C; May to early August 2010), their realised thermal niche (mean +/- 1SD) was 22.3 degrees C +/- 1.8; the realised thermal niche was affected by fish size (smaller fish selected slightly warmer temperatures) but not sex. An electric generating steam plant discharging warm water resumed operation in January 2011, and most (86%) tagged fish occupied the plume where temperatures were approximate to 10 degrees C warmer than ambient water temperatures. No mortalities were observed 15days later when plant operations ceased. Their affinity for the heated plume prompted concerns that muskellunge will be too easily exploited when the plant operates during winter.

TI  - Economic evaluation of climate chang impacts on road transportation in Atlantic Canada
SP  - 286-290
AB  - Climate change impacts such as an increase in mean temperature, change in precipitation patterns and sea level rise are affecting regional road transportation network (RRTN) in Atlantic Canada. Those impacts cause direct and indirect economic consequences for the network and regional economy. In our study, we constructed a dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGEM) to trace these consequences over time. Basic principles of the designed CGEM are discussed and the model's architecture is presented. The model's elements are estimated, and the obtained CGEM is tested with exogenously imposed shock. Evolutionary dynamics of regional temperature, precipitation and sea level is analyzed on the basis of comprehensive time series analysis. This dynamics will be later imposed on the designed CGEM as external productivity shocks. Some preliminary cumulative economic consequences are evaluated in monetary terms to obtain benchmarks for the mitigation measures associated with future development of the RRTN. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Divergent thermal specialisation of two South African entomopathogenic nematodes
VL  - 2015
IS  - 7
AB  - Thermal physiology of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) is a critical aspect of field performance and fitness. Thermal limits for survival and activity, and the ability of these limits to adjust (i.e., show phenotypic flexibility) depending on recent thermal history, are generally poorly established, especially for non-model nematode species. Here we report the acute thermal limits for survival, and the thermal acclimation-related plasticity thereof for two key endemic South African EPN species, Steinernema yirgalemense and Heterorhabditis zealandica. Results including LT50 indicate S. yirgalemense (LT50 = 40.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) has greater high temperature tolerance than H. zealandica (LT50 = 36.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C), but S. yirgalemense (LT50 = -2.4 +/- 0 degrees C) has poorer low temperature tolerance in comparison to H. zealandica (LT50 = -9.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C), suggesting these two EPN species occupy divergent thermal niches to one another. Acclimation had both negative and positive effects on temperature stress survival of both species, although the overall variation meant that many of these effects were non-significant. There was no indication of a consistent loss of plasticity with improved basal thermal tolerance for either species at upper lethal temperatures. At lower temperatures measured for H. zealandica, the 5 degrees C acclimation lowered survival until below -12.5 degrees C, where after it increased survival. Such results indicate that the thermal niche breadth of EPN species can differ significantly depending on recent thermal conditions, and should be characterized across a broad range of species to understand the evolution of thermal limits to performance and survival in this group.

TI  - Aquatic insects in a multistress environment: Cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation
VL  - 220
IS  - 7
SP  - 1277-1286
AB  - Exposing organisms to a particular stressor may enhance tolerance to a subsequent stress, when protective mechanisms against the two stressors are shared. Such cross-tolerance is a common adaptive response in dynamic multivariate environments and often indicates potential co-evolution of stress traits. Many aquatic insects in inland saline waters from Mediterranean-climate regions are sequentially challenged with salinity and desiccation stress. Thus, cross-tolerance to these physiologically similar stressors could have been positively selected in insects of these regions. We used adults of the saline water beetles Enochrus jesusarribasi (Hydrophilidae) and Nebrioporus baeticus (Dytiscidae) to test cross-tolerance responses to desiccation and salinity. In independent laboratory experiments, we evaluated the effects of (i) salinity stress on the subsequent resistance to desiccation and (ii) desiccation stress (rapid and slow dehydration) on the subsequent tolerance to salinity. Survival, water loss and haemolymph osmolality were measured. Exposure to stressful salinity improved water control under subsequent desiccation stress in both species, with a clear cross-tolerance (enhanced performance) in N. baeticus. In contrast, general negative effects on performance were found under the inverse stress sequence. The rapid and slow dehydration produced different water loss and haemolymph osmolality dynamics that were reflected in different survival patterns. Our finding of cross-tolerance to salinity and desiccation in ecologically similar species from distant lineages, together with parallel responses between salinity and thermal stress previously found in several aquatic taxa, highlights the central role of adaption to salinity and co-occurring stressors in arid inland waters, having important implications for the species' persistence under climate change. © 2017 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

VL  - 19
SP  - S5811-S5816
AB  - Feeding systems is an important factor for productivity and quality of casting. In this paper, the computation of feed-path based on temperature gradient method is proposed to remedy the deficiencies in the feeder optimisation through traditional numerical methods. Feed-path is the direction of microscopic flow of liquid metal during solidification. In the aspect of calculation, feed-path consists of a series of vectors in the direction of maximum temperature gradient at the evolving solid-liquid interface during the solidification process. With the help of feed-path, the feed-regions in castings can be identified, potential defects of cavity shrinkage as well as centreline porosity can be predict, and the direction and distance of feeding can be visualised intuitionally, providing reliable basis for feeder design. A typical casting is set as an example to illustrate the computation of feed-path based on temperature gradient method, and the facility of feed-path in the feeder optimisation is verified with a ladder sample. © W.

TI  - The potential for non-adaptive origins of evolutionary innovations in central carbon metabolism
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Biological systems are rife with examples of pre-adaptations or exaptations. They range from the molecular scale - lens crystallins, which originated from metabolic enzymes - to the macroscopic scale, such as feathers used in flying, which originally served thermal insulation or waterproofing. An important class of exaptations are novel and useful traits with non-adaptive origins. Whether such origins could be frequent cannot be answered with individual examples, because it is a question about a biological system's potential for exaptation. We here take a step towards answering this question by analyzing central carbon metabolism, and novel traits that allow an organism to survive on novel sources of carbon and energy. We have previously applied flux balance analysis to this system and predicted the viability of 1015 metabolic genotypes on each of ten different carbon sources. Results: We here use this exhaustive genotype-phenotype map to ask whether a central carbon metabolism that is viable on a given, focal carbon source C - the equivalent of an adaptation in our framework - is usually or rarely viable on one or more other carbon sources C new - a potential exaptation. We show that most metabolic genotypes harbor potential exaptations, that is, they are viable on one or more carbon sources C new. The nature and number of these carbon sources depends on the focal carbon source C itself, and on the biochemical similarity between C and C new. Moreover, metabolisms that show a higher biomass yield on C, and that are more complex, i.e., they harbor more metabolic reactions, are viable on a greater number of carbon sources C new. Conclusions: A high potential for exaptation results from correlations between the phenotypes of different genotypes, and such correlations are frequent in central carbon metabolism. If they are similarly abundant in other metabolic or biological systems, innovations may frequently have non-adaptive ("exaptive") origins. © 2016 The Author(s).

TI  - Abbreviation of larval development and extension of brood care as key features of the evolution of freshwater Decapoda
VL  - 88
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-116
AB  - The transition from marine to freshwater habitats is one of the major steps in the evolution of life. In the decapod crustaceans, four groups have colonized fresh water at different geological times since the Triassic, the freshwater shrimps, freshwater crayfish, freshwater crabs and freshwater anomurans. Some families have even colonized terrestrial habitats via the freshwater route or directly via the sea shore. Since none of these taxa has ever reinvaded its environment of origin the Decapoda appear particularly suitable to investigate life-history adaptations to fresh water. Evolutionary comparison of marine, freshwater and terrestrial decapods suggests that the reduction of egg number, abbreviation of larval development, extension of brood care and lecithotrophy of the first posthatching life stages are key adaptations to fresh water. Marine decapods usually have high numbers of small eggs and develop through a prolonged planktonic larval cycle, whereas the production of small numbers of large eggs, direct development and extended brood care until the juvenile stage is the rule in freshwater crayfish, primary freshwater crabs and aeglid anomurans. The amphidromous freshwater shrimp and freshwater crab species and all terrestrial decapods that invaded land via the sea shore have retained ocean-type planktonic development. Abbreviation of larval development and extension of brood care are interpreted as adaptations to the particularly strong variations of hydrodynamic parameters, physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton availability in freshwater habitats. These life-history changes increase fitness of the offspring and are obviously favoured by natural selection, explaining their multiple origins in fresh water. There is no evidence for their early evolution in the marine ancestors of the extant freshwater groups and a preadaptive role for the conquest of fresh water. The costs of the shift from relative r- to K-strategy in freshwater decapods are traded-off against fecundity, future reproduction and growth of females and perhaps against size of species but not against longevity of species. Direct development and extension of brood care is associated with the reduction of dispersal and gene flow among populations, which may explain the high degree of speciation and endemism in directly developing freshwater decapods. Direct development and extended brood care also favour the evolution of social systems, which in freshwater decapods range from simple subsocial organization to eusociality. Hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis, which have evolved in some terrestrial crayfish burrowers and invasive open water crayfish, respectively, may enable populations to adapt to restrictive or new environments by spatio-temporal alteration of their socio-ecological characteristics. Under conditions of rapid habitat loss, environmental pollution and global warming, the reduced dispersal ability of direct developers may turn into a severe disadvantage, posing a higher threat of extinction to freshwater crayfish, primary freshwater crabs, aeglids and landlocked freshwater shrimps as compared to amphidromous freshwater shrimps and secondary freshwater crabs. © 2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsp) also known as HspB are a large family of widely expressed proteins that contain a 90 residues domain known as α-crystallin. Here, we focus on the family member H11/HspB8 and its herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) homologue ICP10PK, and discuss the possible impact of this relationship on human disease. H11/HspB8 and ICP10PK are atypical protein kinases. They share multi-functional activity that encompasses signaling, unfolded protein response (UPR) and the regulation of life cycle potential. In melanocytes H11/HspB8 causes growth arrest. It is silenced in a high proportion of melanoma prostate cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and hematologic malignancies through aberrant DNA methylation. Its restored expression induces cell death and inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models, identifying H11/HspB8 as a tumor suppressor. This function involves the activation of multiple and distinct death pathways, all of which initiate with H11/HspB8-mediated phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). Both ICP10PK and H11/HspB8 were implicated in inflammatory processes that involve dendritic cells activation through Toll-like receptor-dependent pathways and may contribute to the onset of autoimmunity. The potential evolutionary relationship of H11/HspB8 to ICP10PK, its impact on human disorders and the development of therapeutic strategies are discussed. © 2012 Laure Aurelian et al.

VL  - 59

AB  - The regulation of body temperature in ectotherms has a major impact in their physiological and behavioral processes. Observing changes in thermal parameters related with reproduction allows is to better understand how Rhinella arenarum optimizes a thermal resource. The aim of this study was to compare the thermal parameters of this species between breeding and non-breeding periods. In the field, we recorded the body temperature from captured animals, the air temperature, and the temperature of the substrate. In the laboratory, we measured the temperature R. arenarum selected on a thermal gradient and the critical extreme temperatures. The results of our study show variations in thermal parameters between the two situations studied. This species makes efficient use of thermal resources during the breeding period by basking to significantly increase body temperature. Because calling is energetically costly for males, this behavior results in increased efficiency to callers during the breeding period. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(1): 347-353. Epub 2011 March 01.

TI  - Variation and constraints of local adaptation of a long-lived plant, its pollinators and specialist herbivores
VL  - 100
IS  - 6
SP  - 1359-1372
AB  - Due to geographically variable species interactions, plants may become locally adapted to their sympatric herbivores and pollinators. However, adaptation to the abiotic environment may significantly affect plant interactions with herbivores and pollinators. Local adaptation to the abiotic environment may constrain local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators under contrasting selection pressures, resulting in trade-offs in local adaptation. We studied local adaptation of a perennial herb, Vincetoxicum hirundinaria, in a reciprocal transplant experiment among four populations and measured plant fitness, pollination success and resistance to two specialist herbivores. We also estimated local adaptation of these two herbivores and generalist pollinators to their sympatric plant populations. Local adaptation was compared with within-population genetic variation, genetic and geographical divergence, and with divergence in terms of population size, environmental conditions and plant secondary chemistry. We further compared local adaptation to the environment, to local adaptation to herbivores and pollinators to detect possible trade-offs in local adaptation. The existence and degree of local adaptation varied among the plant populations. Plants from two populations were locally adapted to their sympatric leaf herbivores and plants from two populations were locally adapted to their abiotic environment. Herbivores from one population were locally adapted to their sympatric plant population. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria to the seed predator increased with increasing among-population divergence in precipitation and temperature. Local adaptation to the seed predator and the environment increased with increasing population genetic variation. Local adaptation of V. hirundinaria in fitness and in herbivore resistance also correlated positively, suggesting lack of trade-offs in local adaptation. Synthesis. These results demonstrate that species interactions can lead to a mosaic of locally adapted plant, herbivore and pollinator populations. In addition to natural enemies, genetic variation, the abiotic environment and mutualistic interactions contribute to the evolution of local adaptation in long-lived plants. These results provide new insights into the patterns and causes of variation in local adaptation and are among the first to demonstrate that conflicting selection pressures within a population do not constrain local adaptation in multiple traits. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - An efficient evolutionary approach to parameter identification in a building thermal model
VL  - 42
IS  - 6
SP  - 957-969
AB  - Thermal models of buildings are often used to identify energy savings within a building. Given that a significant proportion of that energy is typically used to maintain building temperature, establishing the optimal control of the buildings thermal system is important. This requires an understanding of the thermal dynamics of the building, which is often obtained from physical thermal models. However, these models require detailed building parameters to be specified and these can often be difficult to determine. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary approach to parameter identification for thermal models that are formulated as an optimization task. A state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm, i.e., SaNSDE, has been developed. A fitness function is defined, which quantifies the difference between the energy-consumption time-series data that are derived from the identified parameters and that given by simulation with a set of predetermined target model parameters. In comparison with a conventional genetic algorithm, fast evolutionary programming, and two state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, our experimental results show that the proposed SaNSDE+ has significantly improved both the solution quality and the convergence speed, suggesting this is an effective tool for parameter identification for simulated building thermal models. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this work, oil palm fibers (OFF) and clay particles were modified and then incorporated to reinforce high density polyethylene (HDPE). The hybrid composites were prepared and compounded with a compatibilizer by twin-screw extrusion followed by injection molding. The evolution of thermal, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical performances of the hybrid composites as a function of filler content was investigated. The morphological study showed that the alkali treatment of OFF fibers enhanced their surface interaction with the polymer, while the addition of a coupling agent increased the interfacial adhesion between both fillers and the polymer matrix leading to improved filler dispersion/distribution (homogeneity). The tensile properties results showed that the 12.5:12.5 hybrids composite had the best tensile properties with a gain of 49% in Young's modulus and 11% in tensile strength. For the dynamic mechanical characterization, an increase in the complex modulus was observed with filler addition. Finally, the thermal stability of the hybrid composites increased with clay addition which is more thermally stable than OFF. The results obtained confirmed the viability of the combination between fibers and particles, thus opening new perspectives for the use of these natural by-products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Development of a robust HPLC method for pharmaceutical analysis can be very challenging and time-consuming. In our laboratory, we have developed a new workflow leveraging ACD/Labs software tools to improve the performance of HPLC method development. First, we established ACD-based analytical method databases that can be searched by chemical structure similarity. By taking advantage of the existing knowledge of HPLC methods archived in the databases, one can find a good starting point for HPLC method development, or even reuse an existing method as is for a new project. Second, we used the software to predict compound physicochemical properties before running actual experiments to help select appropriate method conditions for targeted screening experiments. Finally, after selecting stationary and mobile phases, we used modeling software to simulate chromatographic separations for optimized temperature and gradient program. The optimized new method was then uploaded to internal databases as knowledge available to assist future method development efforts. Routine implementation of such standardized workflows has the potential to reduce the number of experiments required for method development and facilitate systematic and efficient development of faster, greener and more robust methods leading to greater productivity. In this article, we used Loratadine method development as an example to demonstrate efficient method development using this new workflow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 36

SP  - 385-391
AB  - Spatial and/or taxonomic bias in thermal tolerance and plasticity data can severely impact projections of climate change responses and limit the understanding of the evolution of thermal performance curves. Thus, further data from under-represented groups and geographical locations are important for synthesizing and predicting the physiological responses of insects to climate variability. For example, the magnitude of rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and seasonal acclimatization of low temperature tolerance are typically poorly documented for nondipteran species from the southern Hemisphere. Moreover, few studies assess RCH responses under different acclimation regimes. To address this paucity of data, the low temperature survival, RCH and acclimation ability of Chauliognathus lugubris (F.) are assessed from an adult aggregation collected in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Beetles are acclimated to either 27 or 20 °C for 1 week and then tested for their ability to survive cold shock or rapidly cold-harden. There is no effect of acclimation on low temperature survival (mean survival range at -5.4 °C for 2 h: 4-52% in 27 and 20 °C acclimation groups). In addition, beetles show no significant improvement in survival after acute thermal pretreatments. In conclusion, these data suggest a generally poor acclimation potential of low temperature survival and no RCH responses in adult Australian cantharid beetles, which is accordance with what might be expected given the microclimate experienced, their ability for behavioural regulation and the life history of the species. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Reproduction in less favourable conditions requires genetic adaptation and/or behavioural plasticity of the organism. In order to determine the effects of these mechanisms on environment-associated variability in polyandry, a phenomenon related to reproductive success, we explored the frequency of copulations in females of nuptial gift-giving bush-cricket Pholidoptera griseoaptera (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) using a laboratory experiment. In a factorial design, we reared two populations originating from contrasting altitudes in two temperature treatment conditions. After 3 weeks for possible copulations in established mating groups, females (n = 108) contained between 0 and 15 spermatodoses (a proxy for the number of copulations) in their spermatheca. The mean number of spermatodoses per female did not differ either between lowland and highland populations or between warm and cold treatments. Thus, we did not observe main effects of these two factors on adaptation or plasticity. In contrast, the frequency of copulations was significantly affected by female size as log(number of spermatodoses) increased by 0.41 ± 0.27 per each 0.1 mm of pronotum length. However, interactions between the body size (the trait that predicts females’ quality for reproduction) with environmental factors revealed that larger females originating from the highland population and larger females reared in cold treatment copulated more often than smaller ones, whereas females’ size did not affect copulation frequency in the lowland population or in warm treatment. It suggests stronger competition among females in harsher environmental conditions, whereas effect sizes of interaction terms showed that observed mating behaviour expressed a similar extent of genetic and plastic responses to female size. This first observation of environment-associated body size-dependent mating behaviour suggests the interplay of sexual and natural selection in a nuptial gift-giving species. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The effect of protectant solids (lactose, sodium caseinate, and their mixture) on the survival of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris was studied in a convective-air-drying environment using single droplet drying. The effect of drying the bacteria in the presence or absence of sodium ascorbate was evaluated, and the evolution of glass transition temperature in the drying process was examined. It was found that the protective efficiency of lactose and sodium caseinate was comparable at the concentrations tested. A mixed protectant matrix (lactose:sodium caseinate, 3:1) gave higher survival than with lactose or sodium caseinate alone at the same total solids level. Protectants enhanced bacterial survival by moderating the drying rate and achieving dryness at lower temperatures, and by facilitating the formation of a glassy matrix earlier in the drying process. The addition of sodium ascorbate was also examined. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 24

AB  - Thermal characteristics have a critical influence on the working stability, control accuracy, and even service life of a magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based clutch. The present study aims to reveal the thermal characteristics of a proposed liquid-cooled MR clutch under various operating conditions. In this paper, theoretical analyses of heating and heat dissipation of the MR clutch was performed firstly. Then a steady temperature simulation was carried out on the MR clutch, followed by a detailed illustration of the experiments, including MR fluid selection, experimental content and procedure. Thereafter, several heating tests were conducted on the MR clutch, and experimental results concerning the slip power loss of the clutch, temperature variation of the MR fluid, temperature effect on the torque output, and maximum allowable slip power of the clutch were presented and discussed. Experimental results indicate that the proposed liquid cooling method can effectively assist in the heat dissipation of the clutch. Moreover, the temperature increase can lead to a reduction of both the viscous torque and total output torque, especially after long-term service. Furthermore, the allowable steady slip power of the clutch is 35 kW and the allowable transient slip power reaches up to 53.2 kW for a slip time of 120 s under the present experimental conditions. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Thermal environment shapes cuticle melanism and melanin-based immunity in the ground cricket Allonemobius socius
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 521-531
AB  - The thermal melanin hypothesis posits that ectothermic individuals of larger size or from colder environments exhibit darker cuticles due to melanin's efficacy in absorbing solar radiation. However, melanin is also a crucial component of arthropod immunity. Thus, thermal selection for increased cuticle darkness may profoundly influence melanin-based immune function. In this study, we address the relationships between the thermal environment (season length), cuticular melanism and two aspects of melanin-based immunity across nine thermally distinct populations of the cricket Allonemobiussocius. We found that season length (i. e. degree days) and body size had a positive association with cuticle melanism in both sexes across populations, supporting the thermal melanism hypothesis. Despite their smaller size, males were found to have darker cuticles and superior melanin-based immunity. This pattern may be the result of additional selection on males due to sex-specific temperature-dependent activities, such as male calling song. Perhaps most interestingly, we found that short season length populations (i. e. colder) exhibited a greater phenoloxidase activity (aspect of the melanin-based immune system) in addition to darker cuticles in both sexes. This pattern is consistent with direct thermal selection on cuticular color, coupled with indirect selection on melanin-based immunity due to pleiotropy. Thus, thermal selection on cuticle darkness appears to indirectly shape the evolution of pathogen resistance in this system, and potentially for other terrestrial arthropod systems whose ranges encompass a significant thermal gradient. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 25
IS  - 9
SP  - 1877-1887
AB  - The evolution of reptilian viviparity is favoured, according to the cold-climate hypothesis, at high latitudes or altitudes, where egg retention would entail thermal benefits for embryogenesis because of maternal thermoregulation. According to this hypothesis, and considering that viviparity would have evolved through a gradual increase in the extent of intrauterine egg retention, highland oviparous populations are expected to exhibit more advanced embryo development at oviposition than lowland populations. We tested for possible differences in the level of egg retention, embryo development time and thermal biology of oviparous Zootoca vivipara near the extreme altitudinal limits of the species distribution in the north of Spain (mean altitude for lowland populations, 235 m asl.; for highland populations, 1895 m asl.). Altitude influenced neither temperature of active lizards in the field nor temperature selected by lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient, and pregnant females selected lower temperatures in the thermal gradient than did males and nonpregnant females across altitudinal levels. Eggs from highland populations contained embryos more developed at the time of oviposition (Dufaure and Hubert's stages 33-35) than eggs of highland populations (stages 30-34) and partly because of this difference incubation time was shorter for highland embryos. When analysed for clutches from both altitudinal extremes at the same embryonic stage at oviposition (stage 33), again incubation time was shorter for highland populations, indicating genuine countergradient variation in developmental rate. Our results indicate that temperature is an environmental factor affecting the geographical distribution of different levels of egg retention in Z. vivipara, as predicted by the cold-climate hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Aim: A focal task for invasion biology is to identify the environmental variables and biological traits that set and underpin realised and potential habitats of invasive species. Ecophysiology provides powerful empirical knowledge that connects theory with natural phenomena and may improve the accuracy of species distribution modelling. We used the introduced Kamchatka red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus of the Barents Sea as a prime case to show how thermal behaviour may drive the spreading of a marine invader in context of ocean warming. Finally, we discuss the conceivable consequences for a poleward spread of invasive top predators on native marine biota, conservation and management policies. Location: Barents Sea, Euro-Arctic shelves, Northeast Atlantic. Methods: We used novel and non-manipulative tests which allowed adult red king crab to freely select and monitor ambient temperature in situ across a < 1-14 °C gradient by means of a temperature data storage tag attached to the carapace. Results: Adult red king crab, irrespective of body size, maturation stage and nutritional state, (1) displays clear behavioural thermoregulation in a hetero-thermal environment and, (2) conclusively selects temperatures in the coldest end of a gradient and avoids temperatures > 4 °C. The final thermal preferendum matches completely present day Arctic shelf temperatures north and east in the Barents Sea. Main conclusions: This is the first published study on the thermal behaviour of a marine invasive top predator. Our tests and the concurrent realised habitat north-east of Kola Peninsula suggest that the introduced red king crab is capable of invading the Euro-Arctic shelves in less than three decades. We argue that current management practices of the introduced red king crab compromise Arctic biodiversity and conservation and, to counteract further spreading, we recommend free fisheries on this species across its entire distributional area in the Northeast Atlantic. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - An integrated approach through coupling response surface method (RSM) and genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to optimize the spray dryer operational condition for production of fish oil microcapsules. The inlet drying air temperature, aspirator rate, and peristaltic pump rate were independent and encapsulation efficiency (EE) and exergy efficiency were dependent variables. RSM was applied to establish the relationship between the independent and dependent variables followed by integrating the developed models using three mathematical approaches and measure the fitness value of GA. Consequently, the optimal drying condition for microencapsulation of fish oil was: inlet drying air temperature=177.23°C, aspirator rate=63.93%, and peristaltic pump rate=14.04% yielding exergy efficiency of 8.10% and EE of 79.14%. The results of confirmation experiments for selected drying condition proved the capability of utilized approach for determination of sustainable and qualified process in fish oil microencapsulation by spray drying. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - Lunar surface temperature of global moon: Preparation of database with topographic and albedo effects
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 110-114
AB  - Lunar surface temperature (LST) is important for both uncovering the thermal environment and evolution and planning lunar robotic and human exploration such as exploring water/ice. Therefore, an LST calculation method is proposed in this letter for the preparation of the LST database, with an improved effective solar irradiance model, including the topographic effect. As an example, the global LST map with the spatial resolution of 1° is shown, based on the topography and albedo data and retrieved parameters from in situ experiments. The topographic signatures can be identified in the map, including the boundaries between mare and highlands and the contours of craters. The good agreements of the global moon between the simulated temperature and the bolometric brightness temperature by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE) demonstrate the validity of our model and the credibility of the simulated global LST map. The better fitness with the DLRE data produced by our physical model than that by the analytic model proves the advantage of our method. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Heritability of flight and resting metabolic rates in the Glanville fritillary butterfly
VL  - 27
IS  - 8
SP  - 1733-1743
AB  - Dispersal capacity is a key life-history trait especially in species inhabiting fragmented landscapes. Evolutionary models predict that, given sufficient heritable variation, dispersal rate responds to natural selection imposed by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we estimate phenotypic variance components and heritability of flight and resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in an ecological model species, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, in which flight metabolic rate (FMR) is known to correlate strongly with dispersal rate. We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly influenced by maternal effects. This study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of dispersal-related traits, a pressing question in view of the challenges posed to many species by changing climate and fragmentation of natural habitats. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - The impact of seasonality on niche breadth, distribution range and species richness: A theoretical exploration of Janzen’s hypothesis
VL  - 283
IS  - 1835
AB  - Being invoked as one of the candidate mechanisms for the latitudinal patterns in biodiversity, Janzen’s hypothesis states that the limited seasonal temperature variation in the tropics generates greater temperature stratification across elevations, which makes tropical species adapted to narrower ranges of temperatures and have lower effective dispersal across elevations than species in temperate regions. Numerous empirical studies have documented latitudinal patterns in species elevational ranges and thermal niche breadths that are consistent with the hypothesis, but the theoretical underpinnings remain unclear. This study presents the first mathematical model to examine the evolutionary processes that could back up Janzen’s hypothesis and assess the effectiveness of limited seasonal temperature variation to promote speciation along elevation in the tropics. Results suggest that trade-offs in thermal tolerances provide a mechanism for Janzen’s hypothesis. Limited seasonal temperature variation promotes gradient speciation not due to the reduction in gene flow that is associated with narrow thermal niche, but due to the pleiotropic effects of more stable divergent selection of thermal tolerance on the evolution of reproductive incompatibility. The proposed modelling approach also provides a potential way to test a speciation model against genetic data. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reciprocal crosses between two populations of Trissolcus vassilievi (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) reveal maternal effects on thermal phenotypes
VL  - 105
IS  - 3
SP  - 355-363
AB  - The egg parasitoid Trissolcus vassilievi (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a significant natural enemy of the sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), the most important pest of wheat in Iran. This study examined the developmental time and egg-to-adult survival of two geographically separate populations of T. vassilievi on two corresponding host populations at five constant temperatures ranging from 15.0 to 35.0 +/- 1 degrees C. No wasps of either population emerged at 15.0 degrees C and the temperature threshold for development was similar between populations, ranging from 13.1 +/- 0.3 to 13.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C for males and 12.2 +/- 0.1 to 12.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for females, but the thermal constant varied with gender and parasitoid population. Development of wasps from the colder Tabriz location was slower, with thermal constants for males and females of 172.6 +/- 3.1 and 204.1 +/- 1.2 degree-days, respectively, compared to Varamin wasps with 164.7 +/- 3.0 and 195.6 +/- 1.3 degree-days, respectively. Based on genetic inheritance patterns, reciprocal crosses between the two populations were expected to result in females with thermal phenotypes intermediate to their parental populations, and males that resembled their mothers. However, female progeny of crosses more closely resembled their maternal population, indicating a maternal effect on thermal phenotype. Furthermore, the magnitude of the maternal effect on the thermal constant was asymmetric and was more strongly expressed by Varmin than Tabriz females. These results suggest the possibility of using selective crosses between wasp populations, in combination with artificial selection in the laboratory, to tune the thermal phenotype of parasitoids to specific regions prior to augmentative releases.

TI  - Upper temperature limits of tropical marine ectotherms: Global warming implications
VL  - 6
IS  - 12
AB  - Animal physiology, ecology and evolution are affected by temperature and it is expected that community structure will be strongly influenced by global warming. This is particularly relevant in the tropics, where organisms are already living close to their upper temperature limits and hence are highly vulnerable to rising temperature. Here we present data on upper temperature limits of 34 tropical marine ectotherm species from seven phyla living in intertidal and subtidal habitats. Short term thermal tolerances and vertical distributions were correlated, i.e., upper shore animals have higher thermal tolerance than lower shore and subtidal animals; however, animals, despite their respective tidal height, were susceptible to the same temperature in the long term. When temperatures were raised by 1 degrees C hour(-1), the upper lethal temperature range of intertidal ectotherms was 41-52 degrees C, but this range was narrower and reduced to 37-41 degrees C in subtidal animals. The rate of temperature change, however, affected intertidal and subtidal animals differently. In chronic heating experiments when temperature was raised weekly or monthly instead of every hour, upper temperature limits of subtidal species decreased from 40 degrees C to 35.4 degrees C, while the decrease was more than 10 degrees C in high shore organisms. Hence in the long term, activity and survival of tropical marine organisms could be compromised just 2-3 degrees C above present seawater temperatures. Differences between animals from environments that experience different levels of temperature variability suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying thermal sensitivity may vary at different rates of warming.

TI  - Patterns or mechanisms' Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule in moths along an elevational gradient
VL  - 17
IS  - 2
SP  - 137-148
AB  - Bergmann's rule predicts increasing body sizes at higher elevations. The elevational Rapoport's rule predicts an increase of elevational range size with higher elevations. Both rules have often been related to effects of temperature. Larger bodies allow more efficient heat preservation at lower temperature, explaining Bergmann's rule. Higher temperature variability may select for adaptations that allow increased range sizes, explaining Rapoport's rule. The generality of both rules has been challenged and evidence towards explanatory mechanisms has been equivocal. We investigated temperature and its variability as explanations for Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule in moths along an elevation gradient in Switzerland. In particular, we tested for relationships between elevation, temperature and body size across almost 300 species of Macrolepidoptera along a gradient from 600 to 2400 m a.s.l. The gradient was resampled throughout the vegetation season, which allowed assessing temperature effects independently from elevation. We controlled analyses for covariate traits of moths and their phylogeny. We found a positive relationship between body size and elevation, but no link with temperature. Furthermore, there was no positive link between average elevation and elevational range, but there was between temperature variability and elevational range. We conclude that mechanisms other than temperature can lead to increasing body sizes with elevation (supporting Bergmann's pattern, but not the mechanism). Contrary to that, data support the mechanism for Rapoport's rule: high temperature variability is associated with large ranges. However, because temperature variability is not necessarily increasing with elevation, it may not always lead to the geographic pattern predicted. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

TI  - Nasal airflow simulations suggest convergent adaptation in Neanderthals and modern humans
VL  - 114
IS  - 47
SP  - 12442-12447
AB  - Both modern humans (MHs) and Neanderthals successfully settled across western Eurasian cold-climate landscapes. Among the many adaptations considered as essential to survival in such landscapes, changes in the nasal morphology and/or function aimed to humidify and warm the air before it reaches the lungs are of key importance. Unfortunately, the lack of soft-tissue evidence in the fossil record turns difficult any comparative study of respiratory performance. Here, we reconstruct the internal nasal cavity of a Neanderthal plus two representatives of climatically divergent MH populations (southwestern Europeans and northeastern Asians). The reconstruction includes mucosa distribution enabling a realistic simulation of the breathing cycle in different climatic conditions via computational fluid dynamics. Striking across-specimens differences in fluid residence times affecting humidification and warming performance at the anterior tract were found under cold/dry climate simulations. Specifically, the Asian model achieves a rapid air conditioning, followed by the Neanderthals, whereas the European model attains a proper conditioning only around the medium-posterior tract. In addition, quantitative-genetic evolutionary analyses of nasal morphology provided signals of stabilizing selection for MH populations, with the removal of Arctic populations turning covariation patterns compatible with evolution by genetic drift. Both results indicate that, departing from important craniofacial differences existing among Neanderthals and MHs, an advantageous species-specific respiratory performance in cold climates may have occurred in both species. Fluid dynamics and evolutionary biology independently provided evidence of nasal evolution, suggesting that adaptive explanations regarding complex functional phenotypes require interdisciplinary approaches aimed to quantify both performance and evolutionary signals on covariation patterns. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Two-wavelength Raman imaging for non-intrusive monitoring of transient temperature in microfluidic devices
VL  - 25
IS  - 9
AB  - The present study proposes a non-intrusive visualization technique based on two-wavelength Raman imaging for in-situ monitoring of the unsteady temperature field in microfluidic systems. The measurement principle relies on the contrasting temperature dependencies of hydrogen-bonded and non-hydrogen-bonded OH stretching modes of the water Raman band, whose intensities were simultaneously captured by two cameras equipped with corresponding bandpass filters. The temperature distributions were then determined from the intensity ratio of the simultaneously-obtained Raman images, which enables compensation for temporal fluctuation and spatial inhomogeneity of the excitation laser intensity. A calibration experiment exhibited a linear relationship between the temperature and the intensity ratio in the range 293-343 K and least-regression analysis gave an uncertainty of 1.43 K at 95% confidence level. By applying the calibration data, time series temperature distributions were quantitatively visualized in a Y-shaped milli-channel at a spatial resolution of 6.0 × 6.0 μ m2 with an acquisition time of 16.5 s. The measurement result clearly exhibited the temporal evolution of the temperature field and was compared with the values obtained by thermocouples. This paper therefore demonstrates the viability of employing the two-wavelength Raman imaging technique for temperature measurements in microfluidic devices. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - For the purpose of developing biodegradable magnesium alloys with suitable properties for biomedical applications, Mg-Zn-Ca-Ag metallic glasses (MGs) were synthesized by copper-mold casting and melt spinning. The effects of Ag addition on the glass formation, thermal stability, microhardness, hydrogen evolution, corrosion resistance, and cytocompatibility of the Mg-based glassy alloys were studied in vitro. The corrosion resistance and the capability of suppressing the hydrogen evolution are enhanced for the Ag-containing alloys, in comparison to the Mg-Zn-Ca MG, though the incorporation of Ag decreases the glass-forming ability but influences insignificantly on microhardness. The higher cellular viability of the Ag-containing alloys than that of the Ag-free alloy was also revealed by direct cell-culture experiments. Thus, Mg-Zn-Ca-Ag MGs possess the potential to be employed as biodegradable materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Time-dependent analysis of agglomerating Pt thin films on YSZ single crystals
VL  - 14
IS  - 7
SP  - 590-600
AB  - The controlled assembly of nanostructures via shape instability mechanisms is a potential alternative to traditional top-down processes like e-beam lithography for nanostructuring surfaces. In this contribution, the dynamics of the nanostructures' assembly via thin film agglomeration have been analyzed. Pt thin films with a thickness of 50 nm were deposited via magnetron sputtering on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) single crystals and subjected to heat treatments at 1023 K for times ranging from 10 to 130 min. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), obtaining the hole growth dynamics and morphological parameters like the lateral correlation length and the nanostructures' Minkowski functionals. The experimentally obtained morphology evolution is compared to the simulated evolution of thin film structures resulting from a cell dynamical system (CDS) model. Three main observations have been made. (i) The hole radius is found to scale as function of time t with a rate proportional to t(-3/4) [log(-3) t]. This is in agreement with Srolovitz's instability theory describing hole growth predominated by surface diffusion. (ii) The morphological evolution of the Pt thin films has been analyzed as function of time t by means of Minkowski measures and the lateral correlation length. A discontinuity in the lateral correlation length and a significant deviation of the Minkowski functionals from the expected Gaussian behavior was found to be coupled with the coalescence of holes. (iii) By using the Ginzburg-Landau equation for the description of the fundamental diffusion process, the CDS model allows a computational reproduction of the experimentally obtained film morphologies in the early stages of agglomeration.

TI  - Divergent Sex-Specific Plasticity in Long-Lived Vertebrates with Contrasting Sexual Dimorphism
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-98
AB  - Sex-specific plasticity can profoundly affect sexual size dimorphism (SSD), but its influence in female-larger-SSD vertebrates remains obscure. Theory predicts that sex-specific plasticity may drive SSD evolution if the larger sex benefits from optimal-growth conditions when available (condition-dependent hypothesis), or if attaining a suboptimal size is penalized by selection (adaptive canalization hypothesis). Sex-specific plasticity enhances the size of the larger sex in male-larger-SSD turtles but whether the same occurs in female-larger species is unknown. Sexual shape dimorphism (SShD) is also widespread in nature but is understudied, and whether SShD derives from sex-specific responses to identical selective pressures or from sex-specific selection remains unclear. Here we tested whether sex-specific growth plasticity underlies the development of sexual size and shape dimorphism in the female-larger-SSD turtle, Podocnemis expansa. Individuals hatched from several incubation temperatures and were raised under common-garden conditions with varying temperature and resources. Body size and shape were plastic and sexually dimorphic, but plasticity did not differ between the sexes, opposite to the male-larger turtle Chelydra serpentina. Maternal effects (egg size) were significant on size and shape, suggesting that females increase their fitness by allocating greater energy to enhance offspring growth. Results ruled out the sex-specific plasticity hypotheses in P. expansa, indicating that SSD and SShD do not derive form differential responses to identical drivers but from sex-specific selective pressures. Our results indicate that differential plasticity does not favor males inherently, nor the larger sex, as would be expected if it was a pervasive driver of macroevolutionary patterns of sexual dimorphism across turtle lineages. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

VL  - 27

SP  - 459-471
AB  - The evolutionary potential and ecological importance of interspecific hybrids continues to be a controversial issue. Traditionally, hybridization - often associated with polyploidy and clonal reproduction - was considered an important mechanism for speciation in plants, but not in animals. More recently, investigations have shifted to the question: Under which genetic and ecological conditions do hybrid taxa and different ploidies arise and succeed, and when and where do they fail? Finding answers to this question is aggravated by the fact that suitable taxa for such studies are often far apart on the phylogenetic tree. Hence, results are influenced by many confounding variables. In this study, we reduce this problem by investigating the fitness within a complex of three closely related water frog taxa consisting of the two sexually reproducing parental species Pelophylax lessonae (genotype LL) and P. ridibundus (RR) plus their interspecific hybrid P. esculentus which comes in three ploidy types (LR, LLR and LRR), as well as with sexual and hemiclonal reproduction. Offspring of all five genotypes were produced by artificially crossing adults sampled from populations in Slovakia, Germany and Switzerland. This created genetic variation. They were then raised at two temperature levels: 18 and 24 °C. This created ecological variation. Larval performance under the two temperature regimes was analysed with respect to three fitness-related parameters: survival rate, days to metamorphosis and weight at tail resorption. Survival rate was significantly higher for offspring of the three hybrid types (LR, LLR and LRR) compared with those of the parental species (LL, RR), at both rearing temperatures. For days to metamorphosis and weight at metamorphosis, we found an interaction between offspring type and temperature. In both cases, performance of hybrid and parental offspring did not differ at 24 °C, but at 18 °C hybrids metamorphosed faster and at a lower weight than parentals. We discuss these results in relation to those from other studies and conclude that under cold conditions hybrids (especially the two triploid types) have higher fitness than both parental species. This genotype × environment interaction could be one reason why all-hybrid populations mainly occur at the cooler northern range of the water frog distribution. © 2013 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Larval melanism in a geometrid moth: Promoted neither by a thermal nor seasonal adaptation but desiccating environments
VL  - 84
IS  - 3
SP  - 817-828
AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in the degree of melanism is often considered in the context of thermal adaptation, melanism being advantageous under suboptimal thermal conditions. Yet, other mutually nonexclusive explanations exist. Analysis of geographical patterns combined with laboratory experiments on the mechanisms of morph induction helps to unveil the adaptive value of particular cases of polyphenism. In the context of the thermal melanism hypothesis and seasonal adaptations, we explored an array of environmental factors that may affect the expression and performance of nonmelanic vs. melanic larval morphs in different latitudinal populations of the facultatively bivoltine moth Chiasmia clathrata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae). Geographical variation in larval coloration was independent of average temperatures experienced by the populations in the wild. The melanic morph was, however, more abundant in dry than in mesic habitats. In the laboratory, the melanic morph was induced especially under a high level of incident radiation but also at relatively high temperatures, but independently of photoperiod. Melanic larvae had higher growth rates and shorter development times than the nonmelanic ones when both temperature and the level of incident radiation were high. Our results that melanism is induced and advantageous in warm desiccating conditions contradict the thermal melanism hypothesis for this species. Neither has melanism evolved to compensate time constraints due to forthcoming autumn. Instead, larvae solve seasonal variation in the time available for growth by an elevated growth rate and a shortened larval period in the face of autumnal photoperiods. The phenotypic response to the level of incident radiation and a lack of adaptive adjustment of larval growth trajectories in univoltine populations underpin the role of deterministic environmental variation in the evolution of irreversible adaptive plasticity and seasonal polyphenism. © 2015 British Ecological Society.

AB  - The optimization problem of an absolute radiometer's timing parameters is investigated for comparison experiments of Total Solar Irradiance Monitor (TSIM). Comparison experiments were performed to establish the TSIM's contact with other space radiometers for measuring total solar irradiance (TSI). Since the comparison experiments had to be performed on a tight schedule under the impact of weather conditions, the measurement parameters for the comparison experiments were selected carefully using optimized solutions of timing parameters. The optimized solutions were identified by a genetic algorithm (GA) based on a thermal model of an absolute radiometer. The thermal model includes terms of heat radiation, air conduction, etc. Fitness value function and constraints of GA are constructed using the thermal model. The experimental results indicate that the selected measurement parameters are sufficient to implement accurate calibration of TSI, providing more opportunities for solar observation. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

TI  - Latitudinal cogradient variation of development time and growth rate and a negative latitudinal body weight cline in a widely distributed cabbage beetle
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
AB  - The evolutionary and phenotypic responses to environmental gradients are often assumed to be the same, a phenomenon known as “cogradient variation”. However, only a few insect species display cogradient variation in physiological traits along a latitudinal gradient. We found evidence for such a response in the examination of the life history traits of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi from 6 different geographical populations at 16, 19, 22, 24, 26 and 28C. Our results showed that larval and pupal development times significantly decreased as rearing temperature increased, and that growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing temperature, consistent with the general pattern in ectothermic animals. Larval development time was positively correlated with latitude, whereas the growth rate decreased as latitude increased, showing an example of latitudinal cogradient variation. Body weight significantly decreased with increasing latitude in a stepwise manner, showing a negative latitudinal body weight cline. Females were significantly larger than males, consistent with the female biased sex dimorphism in insects. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing rearing temperature, whereas the differences in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) tended to decrease with increasing body weight, which biased our results toward acceptance of Rensch’s rule. We found that weight loss was an important regulator of SSD, and because male pupae lost significantly more weight at metamorphosis than female pupae, SSD was greater in adults than in pupae. Overall, our data provide a new example that a latitudinal cogradient variation in physiological traits is associated with a negative latitudinal body weight cline. © 2017 Tang et al.

VL  - 441
IS  - 3
SP  - 2181-2187
AB  - While Population III (Pop III) stars are typically thought to be massive, pathways towards lower mass Pop III stars may exist when the cooling of the gas is particularly enhanced. A possible route is enhanced HD cooling during the merging of dark-matter haloes. The mergers can lead to a high ionization degree catalysing the formation of HD molecules and may cool the gas down to the cosmic microwave background temperature. In this paper, we investigate the merging of mini-haloes with masses of a few 105Mȯ and explore the feasibility of this scenario. We have performed three-dimensional cosmological hydrodynamics calculations with the ENZO code, solving the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas by employing the astrochemistry package KROME. Our results show that the HD abundance is increased by two orders of magnitude compared to the no-merging case and the halo cools down to ~60K triggering fragmentation. Based on Jeans estimates, the expected stellar masses are about 10Mȯ. Our findings show that the merging scenario is a potential pathway for the formation of low-mass stars. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Shift in Thermal Preferences of Female Oviparous Common Lizards During Egg Retention: Insights into the Evolution of Reptilian Viviparity
VL  - 38
IS  - 3
SP  - 352-359
AB  - Pregnant female Zootoca vivipara select lower body temperatures than males or nonpregnant females, and this shift in the thermal preferendum is believed to be related to optimising the conditions for embryogenesis. Thus, subjecting embryos to the higher temperature selected by males and non-gravid females might have detrimental effects on embryonic development and on hatchling fitness, according to predictions of the "maternal manipulation" hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. To test the role of gestation environment on embryonic development in oviparous Z. vivipara, we kept a number of gravid females at the temperature selected by non-gravid females in a laboratory thermal gradient, whereas control females were allowed to regulate their body temperature without restrictions. Developmental stage at oviposition was more advanced for embryos of the experimental clutches, which were heavier than those of the control group. Forced gestation temperature also affected hatching success (58.62% in the experimental treatment vs. 97.37% in the control group). In addition, hatchlings from females subjected to high temperatures during pregnancy were smaller, had shorter head length and performed worse in running trials. Our results fulfil the prediction of the "maternal manipulation" hypothesis, and suggest that the shift in female body temperature during pregnancy optimizes embryogenesis and hatchling phenotype by avoiding the negative effects of the high incubation temperatures preferred by non-gravid females. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - The effect of temperature on the evolution of per offspring investment in a globally distributed family of marine invertebrates (Crustacea: Decapoda: Lithodidae)
VL  - 163
IS  - 3
SP  - 1-9
AB  - Within the marine environment, per offspring investment (POI) is associated with modes in larval development; an increase in POI has often been described with a decrease in temperature, as evidenced along latitudinal clines. However, the environmental drivers of POI remain largely hypothetical and have not yet been tested within an evolutionary context. Here, we test the hypothesis that developmental temperature is linked to POI within a globally distributed and diverse family of benthic crustaceans, the Lithodidae, also known as stone or king crab. To do this, we examine variations in egg diameter—a proven corollary of POI—within the Lithodidae. Based on a rare case of well-construed phylogeny, we test the relationship between egg diameter and two aspects of the maternal physical environment: water depth and temperature. We observe a significant relationship between decreasing environmental temperature and an increase in POI within genera of lithodid crabs, and independent of depth. There is a clear correlation of high levels in POI with a decrease in temperature in lithodid crab genera currently inhabiting the deep sea, all of which follow a food-independent (lecithotrophic) mode of larval development. In contrast, lithodid genera thriving in the warmer waters of shallow (continental shelf) seas follow a feeding (planktotrophic) mode in larval development. We conclude that temperature is an important factor governing POI, and discuss its importance in the evolution of larval lecithotrophy in marine invertebrates. © 2016, The Author(s).

TI  - Adaptive divergence in embryonic thermal plasticity among Atlantic salmon populations
VL  - 29
IS  - 8
SP  - 1593-1601
AB  - In the context of global changes, the long-term viability of populations of endangered ectotherms may depend on their adaptive potential and ability to cope with temperature variations. We measured responses of Atlantic salmon embryos from four populations to temperature variations and used a QST -FST approach to study the adaptive divergence among these populations. Embryos were reared under two experimental conditions: a low temperature regime at 4 °C until eyed-stage and 10 °C until the end of embryonic development and a high temperature regime with a constant temperature of 10 °C throughout embryonic development. Significant variations among populations and population × temperature interactions were observed for embryo survival, incubation time and length. QST was higher than FST in all but one comparison suggesting an important effect of divergent selection. QST was also higher under the high-temperature treatment than at low temperature for length and survival due to a higher variance among populations under the stressful warmer treatment. Interestingly, heritability was lower for survival under high temperature in relation to a lower additive genetic variance under that treatment. Overall, these results reveal an adaptive divergence in thermal plasticity in embryonic life stages of Atlantic salmon suggesting that salmon populations may differentially respond to temperature variations induced by climate change. These results also suggest that changes in temperature may alter not only the adaptive potential of natural populations but also the selection regimes among them. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 78

AB  - We investigated previously unknown associations between bacterial endosymbionts and bat flies of the subfamily Nycterophiliinae (Diptera, Streblidae). Molecular analyses revealed a novel clade of Gammaproteobacteria in Nycterophilia bat flies. This clade was not closely related to Arsenophonus-like microbes found in its sister genus Phalconomus and other bat flies. High population infection rates in Nycterophilia across a wide geographic area, the presence of the symbionts in pupae, the general codivergence between hosts and symbionts, and high AT composition bias in symbiont genes together suggest that this host-symbiont association is obligate in nature and ancient in origin. Some Nycterophilia samples (14.8%) also contained Wolbachia supergroup F (Alphaproteobacteria), suggesting a facultative symbiosis. Likelihood-based ancestral character mapping revealed that, initially, obligate symbionts exhibited association with host-specific Nycterophilia bat flies that use a broad temperature range of cave environments for pupal development. As this mutualism evolved, the temperature range of bat flies narrowed to an exclusive use of hot caves, which was followed by a secondary broadening of the bat flies' host associations. These results suggest that the symbiosis has influenced the environmental tolerance of parasite life history stages. Furthermore, the contingent change to an expanded host range of Nycterophilia bat flies upon narrowing the ecological niche of their developmental stages suggests that altered environmental tolerance across life history stages may be a crucial factor in shaping parasite-host relationships. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 178

SP  - 931-941
AB  - For many amphibians, high temperatures and limited precipitation are crucial habitat characteristics that limit species ranges and modulate life-history characteristics. Although knowledge of the ability of amphibians to cope with such environmental harshness is particularly relevant in the light of ongoing environmental change, relatively little is known about natural variation in age, maturation and associated life-history traits across species’ ranges. We used the analysis of growth rings in bones to investigate the link between environmental harshness and life-history traits, including age and body size distribution, in specimens from 20 populations of the Australian bleating froglet, Crinia pseudinsignifera. Despite the short lifespan of the species, bone slides revealed geographic variation in average age, body size and reproductive investment linked to variation in temperature and rainfall. We found no difference in age at maturation in different climatic harshness regimes. Frogs from harsher environments invested less in their first reproductive event but grew older than their counterparts in more benign environments, thereby allowing for more reproductive events and buffering them against the increased chance of reproductive failure in the harsher environments. For individual frogs, climatic harshness experienced during an individual’s life promoted larger body size. Overall, these results illustrate how bone structure analyses from preserved specimens allow both the testing of ecogeographic hypotheses and the assessment of the adaptive potential of species in the light of environmental change. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 46
SP  - 504-513
AB  - Species relative importance distribution pattern changes of the ground-beetle assemblages were analyzed along elevation strata of Tenerife Island. The species importance estimates were expressed in terms of (i) activity density, as total catching of ground-beetle adults obtained with pitfall traps over each elevation stratum for one year, and (ii) biomass, as the total number of specimens caught multiplied by a mean dry weight in milligrams for the species. The K-dominance curves indicated moderate or insignificant perturbances, and patterns were sigmoidal following a truncated log-normal slightly skewed to the right, by using the Kolmogoroff-Smirnov test. The results also showed perceptible deviations from the truncated log-normal pattern (p < 0.05) mainly with biomass data. The disturbance through successional progress and perturbances by environmental warming and cooling could be assumed by deviations from the log-normal distribution among species. Thus, assuming that the assemblages of strata exhibited generally low similarity, the results will be arranged around the following four tracks: (1) the assemblage progressed toward highest abundances, dominance and a low-diversity equilibrium state in the cloud montane stratum, (2) the assemblage was subject to severe warming and dryness, lowest abundances with dominance in biomass, such that log-normal pattern was not shown in the basal stratum, (3) a non-equilibrium state in summer-xeric montane stratum maintained the highest diversity and an archetypical log-normal pattern was described for assemblage, and (4) assemblage stressed by cold semi-arid climate showed a certain tendency to log-normality and decrease in the diversity for the summit stratum. These results indicate that variation in ground-beetle assemblages by way of advanced evolutionary and adaptive trade-offs can best be understood as consequences of selective pressures by adverse climatic changes - perturbances - or seasonal climatic fluctuations and population dynamics - disturbances - according to the elevation stratum, which can generate different deviations from the log-normal pattern; these are more directly related to magnitude and frequency of local natural disturbance regimes and the productivity of the ecosystem.

AB  - Among-population variation in insect thermal performance is important for understanding patterns and mechanisms of evolution and predicting insect responses to altered climate regimes in future or novel environments. Here we review and discuss several key examples of among-population variation in insect thermal performance, including latitudinal gradients in chill coma recovery time, variation in energy consumption and metabolic biochemistry, rapid changes in thermal biology with range expansion in invasive and introduced species, and potential constraints on variation in thermal performance traits. This review highlights that while there is substantial evidence for among-population variation that is generally correlated with local climate regimes, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the implications for whole-animal fitness in the field are well understood. We also discuss the potential limitations of interpreting evolved variation among populations and argue for a genes-to-environment approach to population-level variation in thermal biology of insects. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 107

AB  - Disentangling the responses of insects to variations in their thermal environment is central to our understanding of the evolution of temperature-dependent performance in these species. Here, we report results of experiments examining the effects of high (upper lethal temperature = ULT) and low (lower lethal temperature = LLT) temperature and exposure time on the survival of larvae and adults of a multivoltine, nocturnal moth species, Pareuchaetes insulata, a biological control agent whose impact on an invasive weed, Chromolaena odorata has been variable in South Africa. The influence of temperature and acclimation on locomotion performance of the moth was also investigated. Temperature and duration of exposure significantly affected survival of both adults and larvae of P. insulata with more extreme temperatures and/or longer durations proving to be more lethal. Third instar larvae and adults are both freeze intolerant and had LT50 of-5.9 and-4.7°C, respectively, after a 2 h exposure. Although cold acclimation was beneficial to the nocturnal larvae, temperatures below 10°C significantly reduce their locomotion activities. The average daily minimum temperatures in the coldest months at three locations in South Africa are over 5°C lower than those of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA, where P. insulata was originally collected. Our results suggest that lethal high or low temperatures at short timescales are trivial in explaining the variable performance of P. insulata, but reduced locomotion at sub-lethal temperatures may be an important driver of the population dynamics of the biocontrol agent (especially in winter months) and may consequently explain the low population levels of the moth because of possible reduced feeding by larvae during night-Time low temperatures.

VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-88
AB  - This study reports temperature effects on paralarvae from a benthic octopus species, Octopus huttoni, found throughout New Zealand and temperate Australia. We quantified the thermal tolerance, thermal preference and temperature-dependent respiration rates in 1-5 days old paralarvae. Thermal stress (1 degrees C increase h(-1)) and thermal selection (similar to 10-24 degrees C vertical gradient) experiments were conducted with paralarvae reared for 4 days at 16 degrees C. In addition, measurement of oxygen consumption at 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees C was made for paralarvae aged 1,4 and 5 days using microrespirometry. Onset of spasms, rigour (CTmax) and mortality (upper lethal limit) occurred for 50% of experimental animals at, respectively, 26.0 +/- 0.2 degrees C, 27.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C and 31.4 +/- 0.1 degrees C. The upper, 23.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, and lower, 15.0 +/- 1.7 C, temperatures actively avoided by paralarvae correspond with the temperature range over which normal behaviours were observed in the thermal stress experiments. Over the temperature range of 10 degrees C-25 degrees C, respiration rates, standardized for an individual larva, increased with age, from 54.0 to 165.2 nmol larvae(-1) h(-1) in one-day old larvae to 40.1-99.4 nmol h(-1) at five days. Older larvae showed a lesser response to increased temperature: the effect of increasing temperature from 20 to 25 degrees C (Q(10)) on 5 days old larvae (Q(10)=1.35) was lower when compared with the 1 day old larvae (Q(10)=1.68). The lower Q(10) in older larvae may reflect age-related changes in metabolic processes or a greater scope of older larvae to respond to thermal stress such as by reducing activity. Collectively, our data indicate that temperatures > 25 degrees C may be a critical temperature. Further studies on the population-level variation in thermal tolerance in this species are warranted to predict how continued increases in ocean temperature will limit O. huttoni at early larval stages across the range of this species.

VL  - 42
IS  - 11
SP  - 2298-2303
AB  - Defect-free blades with fine microstructure and excellent high temperature performance are needed by aero-turbine. The curved shape of SX (single grain) blade is usually very complicated, and its section varies sharply at the platform, the tip shroud, etc. Thus, stray grains are difficult to avoid during directional solidification. In order to optimize the process parameter, the physical model and the mathematical model of directional solidification of SX blade were established based on Panda thermodynamic database and finite element. The temperature field, the evolution of mushy zone and the SDAS (secondary dendrite arm spacing) during solidification of SX sample by different process were simulated, and the discipline and mechanism of defect formation were investigated. The numerical results agree well with the experimental. The calculated results indicate that with the higher withdrawal rate, the SDAS gets smaller but stray grains tend to occur; with the lower withdrawal rate, the possibility of stray grains gets lower but the SDAS gets larger. The directional solidification of complicated thin-walled hollow real SX blade was simulated as well. The results show that the SDAS is nearly uniform in the blade, stray grains may appear at the platform when the withdrawal rate is up to 3.5 mm/min. By the process with varying withdrawal rate, the stray grain can be avoided while most of secondary dendrite can be refined, thus improving the productivity and percent of pass.

VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 207-225
AB  - We investigated the role of cuticular lipids, body melanisation and body size in conferring contrasting levels of desiccation resistance in latitudinal populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila ananassae on the Indian subcontinent. Contrary to the well known role of cuticular lipids in water proofing in diverse insect taxa, there is lack of geographical variations in the amount of cuticular lipids per fly in both the species. In D. ananassae, quite low levels of body melanisation are correlated with lower desiccation resistance. By contrast, increased levels of desiccation resistance are correlated with quite high melanisation in D. melanogaster. Thus, species specific cuticular melanisation patterns are significantly correlated with varying levels of desiccation resistance within as well as between populations and across species. Role of body melanisation in desiccation resistance is further supported by the fact that assorted dark and light flies differ significantly in cuticular water loss, hemolymph and dehydration tolerance. However, similar patterns of body size variation do not account for contrasting levels of desiccation resistance in these two Drosophila species. Climatic selection is evidenced by multiple regression analysis with seasonal amplitude of thermal and humidity changes (Tcv and RHcv) along latitude on the Indian subcontinent. Finally, the contrasting levels of species specific distribution patterns are negatively correlated with RHcv of sites of origin of populations i. e. a steeper negative slope for D. ananassae corresponds with its desiccation sensitivity as compared with D. melanogaster. Thus, evolutionary changes in body melanisation impact desiccation resistance potential as well as distribution patterns of these two Drosophila species on the Indian subcontinent. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

VL  - 4

SP  - 141-152
AB  - Thermal perception is an essential sensory system for survival since temperature fluctuations affect various biologic processes. Therefore, evolutionary changes in thermosensory systems may have played important roles in adaptation processes. Comparative analyses of sensory receptors among different species can provide us with important clues to understand the molecular basis for adaptation. Several ion channels belonging to the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily serve as thermal sensors in a wide variety of animal species. These TRP proteins are multimodal receptors that are activated by temperature as well as other sensory stimuli. Among them TRPV1 and TRPA1 are activated by noxious ranges of thermal stimuli and irritating chemicals, and are mainly expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons. Comparative analyses of TRPV1 and TRPA1 among various vertebrate species revealed evolutionary changes that likely contributed to diversification of sensory perception. Whereas heat-induced TRPV1 responses have been conserved across many vertebrates, TRPA1 varied among species. Mutagenesis experiments using these two channels from various species also helped characterize the molecular basis for their activation and inhibition. Meanwhile, recent detailed comparative analyses using closely related species showed shifts in TRPV1 and TRPA1 thermal sensitivity that allowed adaptation to different thermal environments. Changes in TRPV1 heat responses appear to arise from just a few amino acid differences among species. These observations suggest that evolutionary changes in peripheral sensors are likely driving force for shifting thermal perception in adaptation processes. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

VL  - 497
SP  - 516-526
AB  - Previous studies showed that a significant number of the particles present in indoor air are generated by cooking activities, and measured particle concentrations and exposures have been used to estimate the related human dose. The dose evaluation can be affected by the particle charge level which is usually not considered in particle deposition models. To this purpose, in this paper we show, for the very first time, the electric charge of particles generated during cooking activities and thus extending the interest on particle charging characterization to indoor micro-environments, so far essentially focused on outdoors. Particle number, together with positive and negative cluster ion concentrations, was monitored using a condensation particle counter and two air ion counters, respectively, during different cooking events. Positively-charged particle distribution fractions during gas combustion, bacon grilling, and eggplant grilling events were measured by two Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer spectrometers, used with and without a neutralizer. Finally, a Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer was used to measure the charge specific particle distributions of bacon and eggplant grilling experiments, selecting particles of 30, 50, 80 and 100. nm in mobility diameter. The total fraction of positively-charged particles was 4.0%, 7.9%, and 5.6% for gas combustion, bacon grilling, and eggplant grilling events, respectively, then lower than other typical outdoor combustion-generated particles. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A study of latent heat effects in temperature profiles and lesion formation
VL  - 71
SP  - 285-294
AB  - The concept of thermal dose is widely adopted in the simulation of thermal therapies to estimate the formation of ablation lesions. However, such approaches typically use empirical assumptions, and treat the formation of a lesion as an end result from heating and not as a factor that could influence the temperature profile. In this study, the forming of lesions during high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy is interpreted as a denaturation process involving an irreversible phase transformation, and is a critical factor influencing the evolution of the temperature profile. Based on this notion and HIFU experiments performed on the pork tenderloin and egg white-based gel phantom, an important but often neglected phenomenon during the formation of the HIFU ablation lesion - referred to as the thermal confinement - was revealed. The thermal confinement, resulted from latent heat effects, exhibits features such as a substantial time delay in reaching maximum temperature around the ultrasound focal spot after turning off HIFU, and a lower-than-expected peak temperature attained during the ablation. A theoretical model capable of predicting the thermal confinement phenomenon and the changes in the temperature profile associated with it was successfully constructed. In addition, a modified bioheat transfer equation with the effect of latent heat from denaturation was proposed. The simulated temperature profiles further revealed the extent of the influence of the thermal confinement is strongly dependent on the position relative to the ultrasound focal spot.

TI  - Survival rate and expression of Heat-shock protein 70 and Frost genes after temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster lines that are selected for recovery time from temperature coma
VL  - 56
IS  - 12
SP  - 1889-1894
AB  - In this study, we investigated the physiological mechanisms underlying temperature tolerance using Drosophila melanogaster lines with rapid, intermediate, or slow recovery from heat or chill coma that were established by artificial selection or by free recombination without selection. Specifically, we focused on the relationships among their recovery from heat or chill coma, survival after severe heat or cold, and survival enhanced by rapid cold hardening (RCH) or heat hardening. The recovery time from heat coma was not related to the survival rate after severe heat. The line with rapid recovery from chill coma showed a higher survival rate after severe cold exposure, and therefore the same mechanisms are likely to underlie these phenotypes. The recovery time from chill coma and survival rate after severe cold were unrelated to RCH-enhanced survival. We also examined the expression of two genes, Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Frost, in these lines to understand the contribution of these stress-inducible genes to intraspecific variation in recovery from temperature coma. The line showing rapid recovery from heat coma did not exhibit higher expression of Hsp70 and Frost. In addition, Hsp70 and Frost transcription levels were not correlated with the recovery time from chill coma. Thus, Hsp70 and Frost transcriptional regulation was not involved in the intraspecific variation in recovery from temperature coma. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Temperature influences host instar selection in an aphid parasitoid: support for the relative fitness rule
VL  - 115
IS  - 4
SP  - 792-801
AB  - The relative fitness rule states that parasitoid females should adopt risk-prone reproductive behaviours when expecting low reproductive success. Temperature influences the reproductive success of insects by affecting their basal metabolic rate during development, their egg load at emergence, and their life expectancy as adults. Using an aphid-parasitoid model system, we investigated the influence of developmental and adult temperature on the risk-sensitive decision-making of females. We considered the use of a low-quality host nymphal instar by the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi to be a risk-prone behaviour. Immature females were reared at 12, 20 or 28 degrees C and had access to the four nymphal instars of the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae for oviposition at one of these temperatures. Host selection behaviour was continuously recorded during exploitation of an aphid patch. We observed that warm-developed females and parasitoids foraging at high temperature attacked low-quality hosts more frequently than females from other treatments. These results support the hypothesis that a decrease in expected parasitoid reproductive success resulted in risk-prone behaviours. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence suggesting that temperature influences host stage selection and risk-sensitive making decision in parasitoids, and the present study is the first to support the relative fitness rule.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London,

TI  - Phenology and overwintering of the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say in 2008–2015 in Estonia
VL  - 66
IS  - 6
SP  - 502-509
AB  - Before its establishment in Estonia at the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say was a notifiable quarantine pest for many years. In high-latitude environments it encounters strong evolutionary pressure to adapt to low temperatures due to high overwintering mortality and periodic influx of new individuals from more southern populations. Our study focused on gathering evidence for such a range shift leading to the formation of a permanent local population. The phenology and overwintering success of beetles was investigated from 2008 to 2015. Depending on weather conditions in the different years, the overwintered beetles emerged from the soil from the beginning of May to mid-June. Over 700 degree days accumulated in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 exceeding the limit needed for development of two generations. However, food supply and temperature distribution in the growing period enabled development of the second complete generation only in 2010 and 2013. Survival of overwintering beetles in field conditions varied between 18% and 47% in the different years. Winter mortality was not associated with low air temperature in any year as snow cover provided the necessary protection and winter soil temperatures at the depth of 30 cm remained at around 0°C for the duration of the whole observation period, with only some records as low as −3.5°C. The survival of overwintering beetles is more likely defined by factors other than low temperature. As a result of periodic invasions of beetles with naturally lower cold resistance originating from southern regions, the structure of the overwintering population in Nordic temperate conditions is not homogeneous. Moreover, this may also be derived from cultural practices, as commercial producers regularly apply agrochemicals while organic growers avoid them. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Effects of ambient oxygen and size-selective mortality on growth and maturation in guppies
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - Growth, onset of maturity and investment in reproduction are key traits for understanding variation in life-history strategies. Many environmental factors affect variation in these traits, but for fish, hypoxia and size-dependent mortality have become increasingly important because of human activities, such as increased nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), climate warming and selective fishing. Here, we study experimentally the effect of oxygen availability on maturation and growth in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two different selected lines, one subjected to positive and the other negative size-dependent fishing. This is the first study to assess the effects of both reduced ambient oxygen and size-dependent mortality in fish. We show that reduced ambient oxygen led to stunting, early maturation and high reproductive investment. Likewise, lineages that had been exposed to high mortality of larger-sized individuals displayed earlier maturation at smaller size, greater investment in reproduction and faster growth. These life-history changes were particularly evident for males. The widely reported trends towards earlier maturation in wild fish populations are often interpreted as resulting from size-selective fishing. Our results highlight that reduced ambient oxygen, which has received little experimental investigation to date, can lead to similar phenotypic changes. Thus, changes in ambient oxygen levels can be a confounding factor that occurs in parallel with fishing, complicating the causal interpretation of changes in life-history traits. We believe that better disentangling of the effects of these two extrinsic factors, which increasingly affect many freshwater and marine ecosystems, is important for making more informed management decisions. © The Author 2017.

TI  - What do metabolic rates tell us about thermal niches? Mechanisms driving crayfish distributions along an altitudinal gradient
VL  - 180
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-54
AB  - Humans are rapidly altering thermal landscapes, so a central challenge to organismal ecologists is to better understand the thermal niches of ectotherms. However, there is much disagreement over how we should go about this. Some ecologists assume that a statistical model of abundance as a function of habitat temperature provides a sufficient approximation of the thermal niche, but ecophysiologists have shown that the relationship between fitness and temperature can be complicated, and have stressed the need to elucidate the causal mechanisms underlying the response of species to thermal change. Towards this end, we studied the distribution of two crayfishes, Euastacus woiwuru and Euastacus armatus, along an altitudinal gradient, and for both species conducted experiments to determine the temperature-dependence of: (1) aerobic scope (the difference between maximum and basal metabolic rate; purported to be a proxy of the thermal niche); and (2) burst locomotor performance (primarily fuelled using anaerobic pathways). E. woiwuru occupied cooler habitats than E. armatus, but we found no difference in aerobic scope between these species. In contrast, locomotor performance curves differed significantly and strongly between species, with peak locomotor performances of E. woiwuru and E. armatus occurring at ~10 and ~18 °C, respectively. Crayfish from different thermal landscapes may have similar aerobic thermal performance curves but different anaerobic thermal performance curves. Our results support a growing body of literature implying different components of ectotherm fitness have different thermal performance curves, and further challenge our understanding of the ecology and evolution of thermal niches. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 1372-1385
AB  - Bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius Gory) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a specialist wood-borer endemic to North America, is prone to periodic outbreaks that have caused widespread mortality of birch (Betula spp.) in boreal and north temperate forests. It is also the key pest of birch in ornamental landscapes. Amenity plantings have extended the distribution of birch in North America, for which we report an updated map. Life history and phenology also are summarized. Larvae feed primarily on phloem tissue of stems and branches, which can girdle and kill trees. Stressors such as drought, elevated temperature, and defoliation predispose trees to bronze birch borer colonization and trigger outbreaks, which implicates the availability of suitable host material in the bottom-up regulation of populations. Stress imposed by climate change may increase the frequency of outbreaks and alter the distribution of birch. Bronze birch borer has a diverse array of natural enemies, but their role in top-down population regulation has not been studied. There is substantial interspecific variation in resistance to this insect. North American species share a coevolutionary history with bronze birch borer and are much more resistant than Eurasian species, which are evolutionarily naive. Potential resistance mechanisms are reviewed. The high susceptibility of Eurasian birch species and climatic similarities of North America and Eurasia create high risk of widespread birch mortality in Eurasia if the borer was inadvertently introduced. Bronze birch borer can be managed in amenity plantings through selection of resistant birch species, plant health care practices, and insecticides. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.

VL  - 39
SP  - 437-450
AB  - Air conditioning is widely applied for the improvement of standard of living in human life. This present investigation focused on the prediction of indoor air quality characteristics of air conditioned car using fuzzy logic algorithm. The conditioned space was selected and the experiments were planned as per design of experiments to study the effect of human load, fresh air supply and air velocity on the human comfort conditions. The mathematical models were developed to predict the comfort conditions, namely temperature, CO2 level and relative humidity over a specified range of input conditions. Carbon dioxide exhalation rate differs person to person based on their body weight and burning rate of calories, etc. Fuzzy logic predicted the intermediate response of IAQ parameters for varying input conditions in this present investigation. The proposed multi response fuzzy model predicted better results comparing with nonlinear regression models. The absolute error percentage of fuzzy model for carbon dioxide level, temperature and relative humidity is 2.05%, 3.81 % & 2.24 % respectively. © Shiraz University.

TI  - Fire behaviour of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with CFRP laminates: Protection systems with insulation of the anchorage zones
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 1545-1556
AB  - This paper presents experimental and numerical investigations about the fire behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) beams flexurally strengthened with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The main objective was to assess the efficacy of different fire protection systems and to evaluate the viability of their use in floors of buildings. Fire resistance tests were conducted on an intermediate scale oven to investigate the behaviour under fire (ISO 834) of loaded CFRP-strengthened RC beams. The fire protection systems comprised calcium silicate boards and layers of vermiculite/perlite cement based mortar, with thicknesses of 25 mm and 40 mm, applied along the bottom soffit of the beams that was directly exposed to fire. In addition, the anchorage zones of the CFRP laminates were highly thermally insulated in order to evaluate the benefits of this particular constructive detail. Member deflection and temperatures throughout the midspan section were measured and recorded during the tests. When the strengthening system was left unprotected in the exposed length of the beam, the CFRP laminate anchorage debonded after about 23 min. When the above mentioned fire protection materials were applied in the exposed length of the beams, the strengthening system debonded after between 60-89 min (25 mm thickness) and 137-167 min (40 mm). Two-dimensional finite element thermal models of all beams tested were also developed in order to predict the evolution of temperatures in the materials. The calculated temperatures compared reasonably well with those measured in the tests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 4

SP  - 648-661
AB  - Several recent studies have suggested that sperm concentrations and semen quality have been decreasing over the past several decades in many areas of the world. The etiology of these decreases is currently unknown. Acute events can have significant impacts on spermatogenesis and are often readily identified during the male fertility evaluation. The majority of male factor infertility, however, is idiopathic. Chronic, low-dose exposures to chemicals and nutrients are more difficult to identify, but are extremely prevalent. These exposures have been shown to have dramatic effects on both individual and community health and interest in the cumulative and synergistic impacts of such agents on spermatogenesis has been increasing. While our understanding of these potential hazards is evolving, it is clear that they may significantly influence male reproductive potential. This review explores the literature related to effects of chronic exposures from drug use, dietary intake, and the environment on spermatogenesis in humans and animals. © 2016 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology

TI  - Spatial control of functional response in 4D-printed active metallic structures
VL  - 7
AB  - We demonstrate a method to achieve local control of 3-dimensional thermal history in a metallic alloy, which resulted in designed spatial variations in its functional response. A nickel-titanium shape memory alloy part was created with multiple shape-recovery stages activated at different temperatures using the selective laser melting technique. The multi-stage transformation originates from differences in thermal history, and thus the precipitate structure, at various locations created from controlled variations in the hatch distance within the same part. This is a first example of precision locationdependent control of thermal history in alloys beyond the surface, and utilizes additive manufacturing techniques as a tool to create materials with novel functional response that is difficult to achieve through conventional methods. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Measures of thermal tolerance quantify the subset of temperatures under which a species can maximize fitness defining a major component of a fish's abiotic niche. Thermal tolerance and a fish's physiological capacity for temperature have applications in both theoretical and applied biology. Although the theoretical discussions of thermal tolerance in evolutionary contexts of biogeography, macroecology, and biological laws will be introduced, the foci of this article are the different measures of thermal tolerance and how they may be used in applied thermal biology. Given predicted changes in temperature due to global climate change, knowledge concerning the thermal limits of all organisms and how to access these limits are keenly important. Of the various methods used to estimate thermal tolerances in fishes, the lower or upper incipient lethal temperature method (static temperature) and critical thermal minimum or maximum method (dynamic temperature) are the two most widely used and accepted. Fishes have lower and upper lethal temperatures that range from less than 0. °C to more than 45. °C. Temperature tolerances are strongly influenced by a suite of abiotic and biotic factors that include (but are not limited to) acclimation temperature, photoperiod, seasonality, environmental stressors, genetics, reproductive status, and ontogeny. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 353
SP  - 21-29
AB  - Productivity of forest tree plantations can be maximized by matching genetically adapted planting stock to environments where they perform best. We used multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis with environmental predictors to quantify and characterize the nature of genotype by environment interactions (G x E) of radiata pine diameter at breast height (DBH) grown in New Zealand. The analysis was carried out for 21 provenance trials, and 48 progeny trials of second-generation selections that are widely used in plantation forestry today. To quantify the maximum variance explained by G x E, we used unconstrained clustering of genotypes based on their performance across all sites. Subsequently, the clustering was constrained by climate and soil variables, i.e. the putative causes for G x E. Unconstrained clustering explained 62% and 58% of the observed G x E variance in provenance and progeny trials, respectively. Constrained clustering explained approximately 50% and 25% of the G x E variance in provenance and progeny trials, respectively. Minimum temperature was identified as an important driver of G x E in both provenance and progeny trials. Environments can be grouped into warm humid sites, where most second-generation selected genotypes performed better, and cold sites, where specific genotypes performed best. Based on the progeny trials, only marginal (ca. 3%) gains can be made by targeted deployment to warm humid sites, but more substantial (approx. 20%) genetic gain can be made on cold sites, compared to current deployment strategies.

TI  - Cold temperature preference in bacterially infected Drosophila melanogaster improves survival but is remarkably suboptimal
VL  - 93
SP  - 36-41
AB  - Altering one's temperature preference (e.g. behavioral fever or behavioral chill) is a common immune defense among ectotherms that is likely to be evolutionarily conserved. However, the temperature chosen by an infected host may not be optimal for pathogen defense, causing preference to be inefficient. Here we examined the efficiency of temperature preference in Drosophila melanogaster infected with an LD50 of the gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To this end, we estimated the host's uninfected and infected temperature preferences as well as their optimal survival temperature. We found that flies decreased their preference from 26.3 degrees C to 25.2 degrees C when infected, and this preference was stable over 48 h. Furthermore, the decrease in temperature preference was associated with an increased chance of surviving the infection. Nevertheless, the infected temperature preference did not coincide with the optimum temperature for infection survival, which lies at or below 21.4 degrees C. These data suggest that the behavioral response to P. aeruginosa infection is considerably inefficient, and the mechanisms that may account for this pattern are discussed. Future studies of infected temperature preferences should document its efficiency, as this understudied aspect of behavioral immunity can provide important insight into preference evolution.

AB  - Background: Aging or senescence is a complex biological phenomenon. Artificially selected Drosophila for extended longevity is one of the experimental models used to understand the mechanisms involved in aging and to test various theories. Objective: To examine the life history traits and biochemical defenses in relation to aging in an extended longevity phenotype of Drosophila melanogaster. Methods: Life history traits viz., survivability, fecundity, development time, dry weight, wing size, lipid content, starvation, desiccation and cold resistances, locomotory ability, antioxidant enzyme activities and reactive oxygen species level between control and selected lines of D. melanogaster were investigated. Results: In our model of Drosophila, extended longevity is associated with no trade-off in fecundity and shows variable resistance to environmental stress such as starvation, cold and desiccation. Enhanced biochemical defense involving the antioxidant enzymes was positively correlated with longevity. Conclusion: Extended longevity phenotypes of Drosophila represent genomic plasticity associated with variable life history traits attributed to the genetic background of the progenitor population and the environment of selection. Oxidative stress resistance seems to be a significant factor in longevity. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.

TI  - Projected heat-related mortality under climate change in the metropolitan area of Skopje
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Excessive summer heat is a serious environmental health problem in Skopje, the capital and largest city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This paper attempts to forecast the impact of heat on mortality in Skopje in two future periods under climate change and compare it with a historical baseline period. Methods: After ascertaining the relationship between daily mean ambient air temperature and daily mortality in Skopje, we modelled the evolution of ambient temperatures in the city under a Representative Concentration Pathway scenario (RCP8.5) and the evolution of the city population in two future time periods: 2026-2045 and 2081-2100, and in a past time period (1986-2005) to serve as baseline for comparison. We then calculated the projected average annual mortality attributable to heat in the absence of adaptation or acclimatization during those time windows, and evaluated the contribution of each source of uncertainty on the final impact. Results: Our estimates suggest that, compared to the baseline period (1986-2005), heat-related mortality in Skopje would more than double in 2026-2045, and more than quadruple in 2081-2100. When considering the impact in 2081-2100, sampling variability around the heat-mortality relationship and climate model explained 40.3 and 46.6 % of total variability. Conclusion: These results highlight the importance of a long-term perspective in the public health prevention of heat exposure, particularly in the context of a changing climate. © 2016 Martinez et al.

TI  - Divergence for tolerance to thermal-stress related traits in two Drosophila species of immigrans group
VL  - 38
IS  - 7
SP  - 396-406
AB  - We investigated associations of the species specific divergence of thermal adaptations of Drosophila nasuta and Drosophila immigrans with seasonal as well as geographical changes in the relative abundance. In D. immigrans, cold resistance and egg-to-adult viability after a cold-shock have shown a positive cline with latitude, whereas no such clinal patterns were evident for heat resistance as well as egg-to-adult viability after heat stress. In contrast, basal heat tolerance and egg-to-adult viability after a heat-shock increased towards the equator i.e. from north to south in D. nasuta. Further, we also found species-specific divergence in seasonal climatic selection responses for heat as well as cold resistance i.e. warmer and higher humidity conditions of the rainy season have evidenced ~2-fold higher heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but lower temperature as well as lower humidity conditions of the autumn significantly increased (~3-fold) cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Geographical variations were significant for the absolute and relative hardening capacity for cold tolerance in D. immigrans, but for heat resistance of D. nasuta. Results of multiple regression analysis of changes in thermal tolerance level in latitudinal populations as a simultaneous function of climatic variables (Tave and RH) have shown that average yearly relative humidity levels significantly affect heat tolerance of D. nasuta, but both Tave and RH contribute to changes in the cold tolerance of D. immigrans. Thus, our results suggest that climatic selection responses for basal and hardened thermo-tolerance levels affect relative abundance of D. nasuta and D. immigrans across a latitudinal transect as well as seasons. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Interacting environmental and chemical stresses under global change in temperate aquatic ecosystems: stress responses, adaptation, and scaling
VL  - 17
IS  - 7
SP  - 2061-2077
AB  - Unfavorable environmental conditions—abiotic stress—constitute one of the key drivers of evolution leading to environmental adaptation. Since the start of industrial revolution, natural populations are also facing a new stress—global warming—that, in turn, leads to alteration of the severity of most of the existing stress factors and emergence of novel stress combinations. Biological adaptation to environmental perturbations occurs at all levels of biological organization, but the current knowledge on the role of adaptation in responses of ecosystems to global change is limited, especially concerning the interplay of climatic and chemical/pollutant stressors. Particularly limited is the understanding of how biological adaptation alters the performance of aquatic ecosystems that integrate the pollution and nutrient loads from large catchment areas. This review describes the responses, tolerance, acclimation, and adaptation of species at different levels of aquatic food chain to globally changing environmental drivers with emphasis on arctic to temperate ecosystems. The analysis highlights major variations in tolerance and in extent and speed of acclimation and adaptation to various environmental drivers within and among species and among species groups at different trophic levels. The variety of responses to novel stressors causes modifications in species composition and diversity and can lead to asynchronous peak activities of organisms at different trophic levels. All these effects are expected to profoundly alter the aquatic ecosystem productivity, resilience, and adaptation capacity and can ultimately modify the global feedbacks between ecosystem-level processes and environmental drivers. We argue that joint efforts of researchers working at different levels of biological organization are needed to understand and predict global change effects on various functional types of organisms and scale up from physiological responses to large-scale integrated ecosystem responses in future climates. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

TI  - Temperature selection by juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) is not influenced by temperatures experienced as embryos
VL  - 69
SP  - 261-266
AB  - reptiles thermoregulate to achieve body temperatures needed for biological processes, such as digestion and growth. Temperatures experienced during embryogenesis may also influence post-hatching growth rate, potentially through influencing post-hatching choice of temperatures. We investigated in laboratory settings whether embryonic temperatures (constant 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 22 degrees C) influence selected body temperatures (T-sel) of juvenile tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus), providing a possible mechanism for differences in growth rates. We found that incubation temperature does not influence T-sel. Although the average daily mean T-sel was 21.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C, we recorded individual T-sel values up to 33.5 degrees C in juvenile tuatara, which is higher than expected and above the panting threshold of 31-33 degrees C reported for adults. We found diel patterns of T-sel of juvenile tuatara, observing a general pattern of two apparent peaks and troughs per day, with T-sel being significantly lower around dawn and at 1500 h than any other time. When comparing our results with other studies on tuatara there is a remarkable consistency in mean T-sel of similar to 21 degrees C across tuatara of different ages, sizes and acclimatization histories. The ability of juvenile tuatara to withstand a wide range of temperatures supports their former widespread distribution throughout New Zealand and warrants further investigation into their plasticity to withstand climate warming, particularly where they have choices of habitat and the ability to thermoregulate.

TI  - Effects of pregnancy on body temperature and locomotor performance of velvet geckos
VL  - 65
SP  - 64-68
AB  - Pregnancy is a challenging period for egg laying squamates. Carrying eggs can encumber females and decrease their locomotor performance, potentially increasing their risk of predation. Pregnant females can potentially reduce this handicap by selecting higher temperatures to increase their sprint speed and ability to escape from predators, or to speed up embryonic development and reduce the period during which they are burdened with eggs ('selfish mother' hypothesis). Alternatively, females might select more stable body temperatures during pregnancy to enhance offspring fitness ('maternal manipulation hypothesis'), even if the maintenance of such temperatures compromises a female's locomotor performance. We investigated whether pregnancy affects the preferred body temperatures and locomotor performance of female velvet geckos Amalosia lesueurii. We measured running speed of females during late pregnancy, and one week after they laid eggs at four temperatures (20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees and 35 degrees C). Preferred body temperatures of females were measured in a cost-free thermal gradient during late pregnancy and one week after egg-laying. Females selected higher and more stable set-point temperatures when they were pregnant (mean =29.0 C, T-set =27.8-30.5 degrees C) than when they were non-pregnant (mean =26.2 degrees C, Tset =23.7-28.7 degrees C). Pregnancy was also associated with impaired performance; females sprinted more slowly at all four test temperatures when burdened with eggs. Although females selected higher body temperatures during late pregnancy, this increase in temperature did not compensate for their impaired running performance. Hence, our results suggest that females select higher temperatures during pregnancy to speed up embryogenesis and reduce the period during which they have reduced performance. This strategy may decrease a female's probability of encountering predatory snakes that use the same microhabitats for thermoregulation. Selection of stable temperatures by pregnant females may also benefit embryos, but manipulative experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.

TI  - Preventing potential disease and pest epidemics under a changing climate
SP  - 50-70
AB  - For a disease or pest to cause yield losses, the host and pathogen or pest must coincide within a favourable environment. With changing weather patterns and cropping systems, abiotic and biotic components influencing potential epidemics are modified and new interactions occur. Since they affect plant phenology and the survival and multiplication rates of microorganisms and insects, temperature and humidity are key factors of epidemics. The incidence of pathogens and pests has noticeably evolved in recent years; globalization, in particular, has increased threats from new transboundary pests and diseases. Factors driving new outbreaks include extraordinary climatic events and trends in temperature selecting pathogens and their natural enemies towards new critical thresholds for inoculum survival. Disease cycle components such as survival, infection, colonization processes and latency period, in addition to production and dispersal of inoculum, are all affected. Climate is most likely a strong driver of evolutionary change in plant and pathogen populations by interfering with host-pathogen interactions, gene expression and population dynamics. Disease monitoring and identifying the parameters affecting pest outbreaks improve epidemic risk assessment and knowledge of the enemy. Strategies to prevent the negative effects of pests and diseases include stringent quarantine regulations, adopting cropping systems that favour biocontrol or avoidance and, most importantly, resistance breeding, cultural practices and sound phytosanitary measures. This review highlights recent changes in microbial communities and the evolution of selected pathosystems encompassing small grains, tubers and agroforestry. The value and effectiveness of integrated crop management and sustainable approaches for controlling potential new disease and pest epidemics, in the context of climate change, are emphasized. © CAB International 2010.

AB  - During the last termination (from similar to 18 000 years ago to similar to 9000 years ago), the climate significantly warmed and the ice sheets melted. Simultaneously, atmospheric CO2 increased from similar to 190 ppm to similar to 260 ppm. Although this CO2 rise plays an important role in the deglacial warming, the reasons for its evolution are difficult to explain. Only box models have been used to run transient simulations of this carbon cycle transition, but by forcing the model with data constrained scenarios of the evolution of temperature, sea level, sea ice, NADW formation, Southern Ocean vertical mixing and biological carbon pump. More complex models (including GCMs) have investigated some of these mechanisms but they have only been used to try and explain LGM versus present day steady-state climates. In this study we use a coupled climate-carbon model of intermediate complexity to explore the role of three oceanic processes in transient simulations: the sinking of brines, stratification-dependent diffusion and iron fertilization. Carbonate compensation is accounted for in these simulations. We show that neither iron fertilization nor the sinking of brines alone can account for the evolution of CO2, and that only the combination of the sinking of brines and interactive diffusion can simultaneously simulate the increase in deep Southern Ocean delta C-13. The scenario that agrees best with the data takes into account all mechanisms and favours a rapid cessation of the sinking of brines around 18 000 years ago, when the Antarctic ice sheet extent was at its maximum. In this scenario, we make the hypothesis that sea ice formation was then shifted to the open ocean where the salty water is quickly mixed with fresher water, which prevents deep sinking of salty water and therefore breaks down the deep stratification and releases carbon from the abyss. Based on this scenario, it is possible to simulate both the amplitude and timing of the long-term CO2 increase during the last termination in agreement with ice core data. The atmospheric delta C-13 appears to be highly sensitive to changes in the terrestrial biosphere, underlining the need to better constrain the vegetation evolution during the termination.

TI  - Environmental and economic assessment of glycerol oxidation to dihydroxyacetone over technical iron zeolite catalysts
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
SP  - 106-118
AB  - The gas-phase oxidation of glycerol over MFI-Type iron zeolite catalysts comprises an attractive technology to prepare dihydroxyacetone with a high productivity, in contrast with the currently practiced biocatalytic system. Herein, we address two crucial aspects in view of a prospective industrial application, i.e., the development of the technical iron zeolite-based catalysts and the environmental and economic assessment of the process by life cycle analysis. Regarding the first task, we show that iron silicalite with the desired structural, acidic and catalytic properties can be prepared by hydrothermal synthesis at the kg-scale and using reagents meeting industrial safety, ecological and cost criteria. The design of suitable mm-sized bodies encompassed the use of shaping methods which minimise the introduction of additional acidity as well as iron clustering and migration from the zeolite to the binder phase. In this respect, silica outperforms kaolin as the binder, pelletisation and polyether-Assisted extrusion are superior to water-based extrusion and the calcination and steam activation of the as-crystallised zeolite are preferably done after the forming step. The optimal technical catalyst displays equivalent activity, selectivity and stability to lab-scale pure iron silicalite powder in a 72 h test. From a life cycle perspective, all environmental indicators are drastically improved and the operating cost is halved using a chemocatalytic zeolite-based process for the preparation of high-purity dihydroxyacetone compared to the conventional enzymatic route. This is justified by the high atom economy of the transformation which reduces waste and by the minimisation of the energy input via heat integration and the use of less energy-intensive separation units to purify the substantially more concentrated outlet stream. Since the purity demand for the dihydroxyacetone feedstock to produce lactic acid is lower than that required in the cosmetic and polymer industries, a potential glycerol oxidation process for the former application has an even greater advantage in terms of greenness and cost. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Recent high-redshift surveys for 21cm absorption in damped Lyα absorption systems (DLAs) take the number of published searches at z abs &gt; 2 to 25, the same number as at z abs &lt; 2, although the detection rate at high redshift remains significantly lower (20% compared to 60%). Using the known properties of the DLAs to estimate the unknown profile widths of the 21cm non-detections and including the limits via a survival analysis, we show that the mean spin temperature/covering factor degeneracy at high redshift is, on average, double that of the low-redshift sample. This value is significantly lower than the previous factor of eight for the spin temperatures and is about the same factor as in the angular diameter distance ratios between the low- and high-redshift samples. That is, without the need for the several pivotal assumptions, which lead to an evolution in the spin temperature, we show that the observed distribution of 21cm detections in DLAs can be accounted for by the geometry effects of an expanding universe. That is, as yet there is no evidence of the spin temperature of gas-rich galaxies evolving with redshift. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geographic Variation in Sex Determination Patterns in the River Turtle Podocnemis lewyana: Implications for Global Warming
VL  - 50
IS  - 2
SP  - 256-262
AB  - Species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) are more vulnerable to climate change than species with genetically based sex determination because an increase in average environmental temperature could lead to biased offspring sex ratios. In TSD species, the relationship between sex ratio and constant incubation temperature is characterized by two parameters: the pivotal temperature (Tpiv) and the transitional range of temperature (TRT) that produces both sexes. Species with variation in either of these parameters should have more potential to adapt to new climatic conditions, therefore putting them at lower risk to global warming. In this study, we incubated eggs of the turtle Podocnemis lewyana (Testudines: Podocnemididae) from two geographically isolated populations (Magdalena and Sinú rivers) under controlled microclimatic conditions to corroborate the TSD pattern previously reported for this species and to estimate the degree of inter- and intrapopulation variation in Tpiv and TRT. We used these estimates, together with information found in the literature on other life history traits of P. lewyana, to evaluate its adaptive potential or vulnerability to climate change. We found interpopulation variation in TRT and intrapopulation variation in Tpiv. This latter parameter exhibited a high broad-sense heritability, demonstrating this species' potential to adapt to climate change; however, when considering the narrow TRT found in this study, the species' equatorial distribution and related adaptations to relatively more stable climates, its fragmented populations and low vagility that prevent gene flow, and its low genetic variability, we concluded that the ability of P. lewyana to adapt to climate change is limited. © Copyright 2016 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.

VL  - 35
IS  - 7
SP  - 338-347
AB  - Komodo dragons from hatchlings ( approximate to 0.1 kg) to adults ( <= 80 kg) express the full magnitude of varanid species size distributions. We found that all size groups of dragons regulated a similar preferred body temperature by exploiting a heterogeneous thermal environment within savanna, forest and mangrove habitats. All dragons studied, regardless of size, were able to regulate a daytime active body temperature within the range 34-35.6 degrees C for 5.1-5.6 h/day. The index of effectiveness of thermoregulation (a numerical rating of thermoregulatory activity) was not different among size groups of dragons. However, the index of closeness of thermoregulation, which rates the variability of body temperature, suggests a greater precision for regulating a preferred body temperature for medium compared to small and large dragons. Reference copper cylinders simulating small, medium and large Komodo dragons heated and cooled at the same rate, whereas actual dragons of all size groups heated faster than they cooled. Larger dragons heated and cooled more slowly than smaller ones. The mean operative environmental temperatures of copper cylinders representing medium sized dragons were 42.5, 32.0 and 29.4 degrees C for savannah, forest and mangrove habitats, respectively. The index for average thermal quality of a habitat as measured by the absolute difference between operative environmental temperature and the dragon's thermal range suggests the forest habitat offers the highest thermal quality to dragons and the savannah the lowest. The percent of total daytime that the operative environmental temperature was within the central 50% of the body temperatures selected by dragons in a thermal gradient (Phillips, 1984) was 45%, 15%, and 9% for forest, mangrove and savannah, respectively. Forest habitat offers the most suitable thermal environment and provides the greatest number of hours with conditions falling within the dragon's thermal activity zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of Body Elongation in Gymnophthalmid Lizards: Relationships with Climate
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
AB  - The evolution of elongated body shapes in vertebrates has intrigued biologists for decades and is particularly recurrent among squamates. Several aspects might explain how the environment influences the evolution of body elongation, but climate needs to be incorporated in this scenario to evaluate how it contributes to morphological evolution. Climatic parameters include temperature and precipitation, two variables that likely influence environmental characteristics, including soil texture and substrate coverage, which may define the selective pressures acting during the evolution of morphology. Due to development of geographic information system (GIS) techniques, these variables can now be included in evolutionary biology studies and were used in the present study to test for associations between variation in body shape and climate in the tropical lizard family Gymnophthalmidae. We first investigated how the morphological traits that define body shape are correlated in these lizards and then tested for associations between a descriptor of body elongation and climate. Our analyses revealed that the evolution of body elongation in Gymnophthalmidae involved concomitant changes in different morphological traits: trunk elongation was coupled with limb shortening and a reduction in body diameter, and the gradual variation along this axis was illustrated by less-elongated morphologies exhibiting shorter trunks and longer limbs. The variation identified in Gymnophthalmidae body shape was associated with climate, with the species from more arid environments usually being more elongated. Aridity is associated with high temperatures and low precipitation, which affect additional environmental features, including the habitat structure. This feature may influence the evolution of body shape because contrasting environments likely impose distinct demands for organismal performance in several activities, such as locomotion and thermoregulation. The present study establishes a connection between morphology and a broader natural component, climate, and introduces new questions about the spatial distribution of morphological variation among squamates. © 2012 Grizante et al.

VL  - 121
SP  - 40-42
AB  - Environmental temperatures can significantly influence the behavior and physiology of terrestrial ectotherms. Small-bodied terrestrial ectotherms can moderate their body temperatures behaviorally via thermoregulation; however, favorable thermal refuges may be limited across heterogeneous landscapes. In such cases, differences in the thermal environment may generate variation in preferred body temperatures among disparate populations. We tested whether geographic variation in preferred body temperatures existed for the Arizona bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, an arachnid widely distributed across the Sonoran Desert. We predicted that geographic variation in thermal preference would exist between populations from a xeric, low-elevation site in western Arizona (Quartzsite) and a cooler, high-elevation site in eastern Arizona (Pinaleno Mountains). We found that scorpions from the Pinaleno Mountains were smaller in body size and exhibited significantly warmer diurnal body temperatures compared to scorpions from Quartzsite. However, no significant difference was detected in the preferred nocturnal temperatures of scorpions from either locality. Scorpions from the Pinaleno Mountains may have shifted their thermoregulatory patterns and selected warmer temperatures during the day as a way to maximize their exposure to favorable temperatures. Less time with mean temperatures within the preferred range of body temperatures may have also lowered metabolic rates of C sculpturatus in the Pinaleno Mountains, resulting in their smaller female body sizes. The ability of C sculpturatus to adapt to different thermal regimes may reflect variation in a life history trait which has allowed them to thrive and expand their distribution across the American Southwest.

VL  - 53
SP  - 71-75
AB  - The survival of selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with in vitro probiotic potential was studied during storage of cv. Halkidiki green olives previously subjected to inoculated Spanish-style fermentation. After fermentation olives were packed in polyethylene pouches, covered with freshly prepared brine (9%, w/v, NaCl), acidified with 2‰ (w/v) citric acid and 1.5‰ (w/v) ascorbic acid, and stored at 4 and 20 °C for 357 days. Four packing treatments were studied, namely olives previously fermented by (i) the indigenous microbiota (control); (ii) Lactobacillus pentosus B281; (iii) Lactobacillus plantarum B282; and (iv) a co-culture of both LAB strains. Microbiological analyses were performed on the olives in parallel with physicochemical changes (pH, titratable acidity, salt content, aw and colour) at the early (day 1), middle (day 197) and final stage (day 357) of storage, as well as sensory evaluation at the end of the storage. The survival of probiotic strains was confirmed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). LAB decreased throughout storage reaching a final population of ca. 3.5-4.0 log CFU/g and 4.5-5.0 log CFU/g at 4 and 20 °C, respectively. The pH values ranged between 3.90 and 4.61 during storage depending on packaging condition. PFGE analysis revealed that L. pentosus B281 and L. plantarum B282 showed a high survival rate with a recovery of 100 and 96%, respectively, at 4 °C, and less than 20% for both strains at 20 °C. Finally, in the packing treatment with a co-culture of both strains, L. pentosus dominated over L. plantarum throughout storage at both temperatures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 7

SP  - 1226-1237
AB  - To predict the effects of global change on marine populations, it is important to measure the effects of climate stressors on performance and potential for adaptation. Adaptation depends on heritable genetic variance for stress tolerance being present in populations. We determined the effects of near-future ocean conditions on fertilization success of the sea urchin Pseudoboletia indiana. In 16 multiple dam-sire crosses, we quantified genetic variation in tolerance of warming (+3°C) and acidification (-0.3 to 0.5 pH units) at the gastrulation stage. Ocean acidification decreased fertilization across all dam-sire combinations with effects of pH significantly differing among the pairings. Decreased pH reduced the percentage of normal gastrulae with negative effects alleviated by increased temperature. Significant sire by environment interactions indicated the presence of heritable variation in tolerance of stressors at gastrulation and thus the potential for selection of resistant genotypes, which may enhance population persistence. A low genetic correlation indicated that genotypes that performed well at gastrulation in low pH did not necessarily perform well at higher temperatures. Furthermore, performance at fertilization was not necessarily a good predictor of performance at the later stage of gastrulation. Southern range edge populations of Pseudoboletia indiana may benefit from future warming with potential for extension of their distribution in south-east Australia. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Dynamics of seed potato utilization in high temperature conditions under semi-arid ecosystem
VL  - 9

SP  - 619-626
AB  - In order to understand dynamics of seed potato utilization, a joint survey was conducted by CIP and CPRI during 2009 covering 93 respondents from three randomly selected villages of Gandhinagar district in Gujarat. Kufri Badshah was the leading potato variety followed by Kufri Pukhraj and Kufri Lauvkar. The research paper describes the farm size category wise seed potato replacement rate, seed potato supply source, replacement and retention of own seed potato, method employed for seed potato production and rate of seed potato use. Size of seed tubers used along with the form of seed use i.e. cut or whole was also studied for all farm size categories of the respondents. Variety wise potato productivity and adoption rate of different varieties provide crucial information not only to the varietal developmental programmes/teams, but also to the policy makers in order to take informed decisions for keeping a check on unhealthy fluctuations in the prices of seed potato.

VL  - 3

AB  - Although changes in phenology and species associations are relatively well-documented responses to global warming, the potential interactions between these phenomena are less well understood. In this study, we investigate the interactions between temperature, phenology (in terms of seasonal timing of larval growth) and host plant use in the polyphagous butterfly Polygonia c-album. We found that the hierarchy of larval performance on three natural host plants was not modified by a temperature increase as such. However, larval performance on each host plant and temperature treatment was affected by rearing season. Even though larvae performed better at the higher temperature regardless of the time of the rearing, relative differences between host plants changed with the season. For larvae reared late in the season, performance was always better on the herbaceous plant than on the woody plants. In this species, it is likely that a prolonged warming will lead to a shift from univoltinism to bivoltinism. The demonstrated interaction between host plant suitability and season means that such a shift is likely to lead to a shift in selective regime, favoring specialization on the herbaceous host. Based on our result, we suggest that host range evolution in response to temperature increase would in this species be highly contingent on whether the population undergoes a predicted shift from one to two generations. We discuss the effect of global warming on species associations and the outcome of asynchrony in rates of phenological change. A temperature increase is expected to affect an insect's host plant-interactions as well as its number of reproductive cycles. We showed how the performance of a butterfly species (Polygonia c-album) is modified in terms of growth and survival by the combined effects of temperature, host plant use and voltinism. The results suggest that in this species, host range evolution in response to a temperature increase would depend on whether the population undergoes a shift in voltinism. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Living coyotes modify their behavior in the presence of larger carnivores, such as wolves. However, little is known about the effects of competitor presence or absence on morphological change in coyotes or wolves over long periods of time. We examined the evolution of coyotes and wolves through time from the late Pleistocene, during which many large carnivorous species coexisted as predators and competitors, to the Recent; this allowed us to investigate evolutionary changes in these species in response to climate change and megafaunal extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene. We measured postcranial skeletal morphologies of wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (C. latrans) from Pleistocene-aged tar deposits, as well as early, mid, and recent Holocene populations of both. We found few morphological differences between Pleistocene and Holocene wolf populations. Conversely, we found many differences in coyotes: Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust than Holocene populations. However, within 1,000 y of the megafaunal extinctions, coyotes are morphologically indistinguishable from modern populations. We cannot attribute these differences directly to climate change because modern coyotes do not follow Bergmann's rule, which states body size increases with decreasing temperature. Instead, we suggest that Pleistocene coyotes may have been larger and more robust in response to larger competitors and a larger-bodied prey base. Although we cannot separate competition from predator-prey interactions, this study indicates that the effects of biotic interactions can be detected in the fossil record.

TI  - Phylogeny influences the relationships linking key ecological thermal metrics for North American freshwater fish species
VL  - 70
IS  - 7
SP  - 964-972
AB  - Habitat temperature is a major determinant of performance and activity in fish. We summarize published studies of 173 North American freshwater fish species to examine the interrelationships among thermal response metrics associated with three types of individual performance: growth (optimal growth temperature (OGT), final temperature preferendum (FTP)), survival (upper incipient lethal temperature (UILT), critical thermal maximum (CTMax)), and reproduction (optimum spawning temperature (OS), optimum egg development temperature (OE)). We found that all metrics were highly correlated, especially those associated with a specific performance type. Differences in thermal metrics were also significantly linked to traditional thermal guild classifications, spawning season, and strategy. We found an overall decline in correlation strength when we used phylogenetically independent contrasts to control for the effect of phylogeny. This decline was much greater for growth and survival metrics than for reproduction. This suggests that the role of evolutionary history in determining thermal sensitivity at the species level varies greatly across the range of performance types that can be used to characterize the behaviour of an individual.

TI  - Identification of outliers in a genomic scan for selection along environmental gradients in the bamboo locust, Ceracris kiangsu
VL  - 5
AB  - Identification of loci under divergent selection is a key step in understanding the evolutionary process because those loci are responsible for the genetic variations that affect fitness in different environments. Understanding how environmental forces give rise to adaptive genetic variation is a challenge in pest control. Here, we performed an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genome scan in populations of the bamboo locust, Ceracris kiangsu, to search for candidate loci that are influenced by selection along an environmental gradient in southern China. In outlier locus detection, loci that demonstrate significantly higher or lower among-population genetic differentiation than expected under neutrality are identified as outliers. We used several outlier detection methods to study the features of C. kiangsu, including method DFDIST, BayeScan, and logistic regression. A total of 97 outlier loci were detected in the C. kiangsu genome with very high statistical supports. Moreover, the results suggested that divergent selection arising from environmental variation has been driven by differences in temperature, precipitation, humidity and sunshine. These findings illustrate that divergent selection and potential local adaptation are prevalent in locusts despite seemingly high levels of gene flow. Thus, we propose that native environments in each population may induce divergent natural selection.

TI  - Molecular and functional characterization of Bemisia tabaci aquaporins reveals the water channel diversity of hemipteran insects
VL  - 77
SP  - 39-51
AB  - The Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is an economically important pest of food, fiber, and ornamental crops. This pest has evolved a number of adaptations to overcome physiological challenges, including 1) the ability to regulate osmotic stress between gut lumen and hemolymph after imbibing large quantities of a low nitrogen, sugar-rich liquid diet; 2) the ability to avoid or prevent dehydration and desiccation, particularly during egg hatching and molting; and 3) to be adapted for survival at elevated temperatures. One superfamily of proteins involved in the maintenance of fluid homeostasis in many organisms includes the aquaporins, which are integral membrane channel proteins that aid in the rapid flux of water and other small solutes across biological membranes. Here, we show that B. tabaci has eight aquaporins (BtAqps), of which seven belong to the classical aquaporin 4 related grade of channels, including Bib, Drip, Prip, and Eglps and one that belongs to the unorthodox grade of aquaporin 12-like channels. B. tabaci has further expanded its repertoire of water channels through the expression of three BtDrip2 amino-terminal splice variants, while other hemipteran species express amino- or carboxyl-terminal isoforms of Drip, Prip, and Eglps. Each BtAqp has unique transcript expression profiles, cellular localization, and/or substrate preference. Our phylogenetic and functional data reveal that hemipteran insects lost the classical glp genes, but have compensated for this by duplicating the eglp genes early in their evolution to comprise at least three separate clades of glycerol transporters.
