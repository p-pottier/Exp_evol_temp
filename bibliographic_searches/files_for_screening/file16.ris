TI  - Factors Affecting Mating, Monitoring and Phenology of Grape Berry Moth, Paralobesia viteana, in Michigan Vineyards
SP  - 162
AB  - Paralobesia viteana (Clemens), the grape berry moth (GBM), is a major economic pest of cultivated grapes in Eastern North America. Although pheromone lures and traps are available for monitoring this pest, male moth captures in these traps are not consistent between Michigan grape-growing regions, and male captures decline as the infestation increases through the multiple generations that occur during a season. This makes it difficult to use traps to monitor this pest’s population dynamics and complicates the timing of pest management activities. Substantial regional variation exists in the magnitude of the response of male GBM to sex pheromone-baited traps in Michigan vineyards. Males are readily captured in traps in the southwest region, whereas in the northwest very few males are captured. However grape berry moth larval infestation is found in fruit in both regions. Using Y-tube choice tests and trapping trials with captive females, I determined that males from Southwest and Northwest Michigan responded similarly to the standard pheromone blend, and males did not preferentially choose females from the same population. From these results I conclude that the regional differences in male captures are not due to differential responses of males in these respective areas. I postulate that the reason fewer males are trapped in Northwest Michigan is because the P. viteana population is much smaller than in Southwest Michigan. To test whether seasonal changes in the plant canopy affect captures of male grape berry moth, I manipulated grapevine fruit density or canopy structure in multiple growing seasons, and measured male captures under these conditions. Removal of either 50 or 100% of the fruit clusters from vineyard plots did not consistently affect captures in pheromone traps. In a separate canopy manipulation experiment, I detected significant differences in male captures between unaltered and open canopies for some sample periods, and there was a trend toward numerically more male captures in unaltered than in open canopies. I conclude that fruit presence, fruit density and canopy fullness do not reduce male P. viteana captures late in the season, and thus do not explain the seasonal pattern of development and abundance of this insect. Experiments that measured the frequency, intensity and duration of mating and reproductive behaviors in colonies held under different temperature and photoperiodic conditions were used to determine that temperature is the likely driving force behind the seasonal variation in male P. viteana captures, and thus shapes the observed phenology of this pest. The frequency of male flights, mating and oviposition increased with temperature. This amplified activity helps to explain the intensification of oviposition and subsequent larval feeding damage in vineyards during the summer and early fall when conditions are warm. My data also show the proportion of male flights that occur when females are not receptive to mating is greater at lower temperatures, which helps explain why more males are trapped in the spring when temperatures are cool. Traps baited with lures that contained different quantities of P. viteana sex pheromone were used to determine that the increased amount of pheromone released by lures during hot periods can reduce male captures. My research shows that temperature is an important factor that governs the behaviors associated with mating and reproduction, and also influences the main tool for monitoring this pest, the pheromone trap. Taken as a whole, the effects of temperature on behavior and trapping strongly shape the observed phenology of this pest.

AB  - PART I: The amidohydrolase urease is critical for the survival and pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori. Urease catalyzes the hydrolysis of one molecule of urea to two molecules of ammonia. It is through the generation and excretion of basic ammonia that H. pylori can survive the acidic gut. It has been well established that inhibition of the enzyme renders the pathogen defenseless against the harsh human stomach. Therefore it is not surprising that urease has become an ideal target for H. pylori eradication. However, despite considerable research efforts, few practical urease inhibitors exist. Additionally, increasing antibiotic resistance has generated a need for effective therapies against H. pylori. Urease’s unique ability to generate a basic product simplifies activity detection using pH indicators such as phenol red. The first phenol red-based (pH-based) high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for small molecule inhibitors of H. pylori urease has been developed and optimized. The phenol-red based assay, which allows for rapid screening at room temperature, has exhibited high quality and reproducibility, with an OD Z’- factor = 0.6109 ± 0.2123. The assay has been utilized to screen upwards of 200,000 compounds against recombinant H. pylori urease, with 255 primary hits (0.13%), 61 reconfirmed hits, and 26 valid inhibitors. Additionally several novel compounds that exhibit low and submicromolar inhibition against H. pylori urease have been identified. Further characterization of these inhibitors is ongoing, including co-crystal structures of the inhibitors with H. pylori urease. Overall, the phenol red assay unlocks opportunities to discover and develop highly effective, direct treatment against H. pylori urease that will eradicate the chronic bacterial infection in humans. PART II: Cytochrome P450 represents a superfamily of heme-containing oxidase enzymes responsible for transmuting xenobiotics into more water-soluble compounds. Amongst the cytochrome P450 isoforms, CYP3A4 is the most profuse, and one of the most clinically relevant xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in humans. Moreover, CYP3A4 is the most chemically versatile P450, with the ability to oxidize a variety of molecules ranging in size and chemical structure. In addition to drugs, CYP3A4 is involved in the transformation of toxins, environmental pollutants, and carcinogens. Variations in expression and activity of CYP3A4 can greatly affect drug efficacy or toxicity. Additionally, various synthetic or naturally derived agents such as furanocoumarin derivatives can either enhance or inhibit CYP3A4 activity. Although inhibition of CYP3A4 can result in undesirable drug toxicity and/or drug-drug interactions, carefully controlled inhibition can be exploited to increase the bioavailability of drugs that would otherwise be rapidly metabolized. Controlled inhibition is already being exploited in HIV and HCV combination treatment with ritonavir. Initially designed as an HIV protease inhibitor, ritonavir was later found to be an effective CYP3A4 inhibitor. However, neither ritonavir, nor its derivatives were developed using pharmacophore models, rational design, or CYP3A4 crystal structures. Therefore, little is understood on the mechanism of inhibition. Using the ritonavir-CYP3A4 crystal structure as a guide, a preliminary pharmacophore model of CYP3A4 inhibition was proposed. Through scaffold modification and rational design, the requirements for successful CYP3A4 inhibition are now more clearly understood. To date, several modest, yet highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitors have been developed. Ultimately, these rationally designed pharmacoenhancers may assist in more effective combination treatment and lower drug costs.

TI  - Predicting Nitrogen Mineralization in California Agroecosystems
SP  - 85
AB  - Concerns over the fate of excess nitrogen (N) from fertilizers in California agroecosystems has prompted the need for more accurate N budgets. While many growers have adopted decision support tools to improve fertilizer use efficiency, these tools often overlook the N released from soil organic matter (SOM) through mineralization (Nmin), which can contribute significant quantities of crop available N over a growing season. While methods exist for assessing the Nmin potential of soils, they are often time consuming and impractical. Furthermore, attempts to model Nmin have revealed the need for regional specificity. The goal of this study was to develop a predictive model for Nmin from native SOM (no organic amendments) based on soil properties and temperature in California soils for real-time decision making and improved N fertilizer use efficiency. In the spring of 2016 and 2017, undisturbed soil cores (4.5 cm x 15 cm), representative samples, and samples for a greenhouse trial were taken from 57 soils under annual crop rotations in productive growing regions throughout central and northern California, including the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Salinas Valleys, as well as Sacramento River Delta and Tulelake Basin. Cores were incubated at 3 temperatures, 5, 15, and 25 °C, for 10 weeks at 60% water-filled pore space before being analyzed for final mineral N (ammonium-N and nitrate-N). Representative soil samples were analyzed for a number of soil properties, including initial mineral N (Nint), total carbon (Ctotal), total N (Ntotal), particulate organic matter C (CPOM), particulate organic matter N (NPOM), permanganate oxidizable C (CPOX), microbial biomass C (Cmic), fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), texture, bulk density (pb), water holding capacity (WHC), and dithionite and pyrophosphate extractable iron (Fed and Fep, respectively). Nitrogen mineralization was calculated by subtracting Nint from the final mineral N. Stepwise multivariate regression was used to select soil properties for generation of a predictive model of Nmin. In greenhouse trials, soils (0.8 – 1.5 kg) were mixed with sand (2:1 soil:sand), planted with tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea var. Cajun II), and grown for ~218 days with intermittent harvests to track N uptake over time. These trials served as a validation of the incubation derived model and to assess plant influences on Nmin. Stepwise regression was also conducted on greenhouse obtained Nmin values. Nitrogen mineralization ranged from 10.5 to 133.7 mg kg-1 at 25 °C, and 0.24 to 6.1 % of Ntotal. Generally, Nmin was greater in soils from the Delta and Tulelake regions as compared to the other regions. The temperature response of Nmin was similar across all soil types and was fit with an S-shaped curve. Concerning modeling, Akaike Information Criterion suggested that two separate models should be created; one for high SOM soils (SOMhigh; > 3%) and one for low SOM soils (SOMlow; < 3%). For SOMhigh soils, WHC, Ntotal 2, CPOM, NPOM, NPOM 2, FDA, and C:N were the variables included in the model with the best fit (adjusted R2 = 0.89). For SOMlow soils, pb, Ctotal, Ctotal2, CPOM, FDA, CPOX were included in the best predictive model (adjusted R2 = 0.36). In SOMlow soils, previous crop, residue management, and tillage significantly contributed to residual variance, though no quantitative data were collected. The temperature model coupled with core incubation data tended to over-predict Nmin in the greenhouse trials by a factor of 1.71, on average. When using greenhouse derived Nmin values for regression, one model across all sites was found to be better than two separate models. The variables included were Nint, Ctotal, Ctotal 2, Ntotal, NPOM2, log(sand), Fep, CPOX, C:N, POM C:N, and soil-mix WHC (adjusted R2=0.86). Differences between lab incubations and greenhouse trials could have resulted from sub-optimal moisture contents, plant-microbe interactions including rhizosphere priming, and experiment duration and the depletion of mineralizable N pools.

TI  - Genomics and Transcriptomics of Antarctic Nematodes Reveal Drivers of Life History Evolution and Genome Evolution
SP  - 167
AB  - Elemental stoichiometry defines a critical understanding of the relationship between nutrient availability and usage throughout different levels of the biological community. We found there is a link between available phosphorus (P), cellular phosphorus, and nematode development as postulated by the growth rate hypothesis (GRH). I predicted that in a P-poor environment, cellular RNA concentrations would be lower than they are in P-rich environment, and thus the 18srRNA expression level will have reduced. To most efficiently regulate the uptake of limited P, I predicted that nematodes in P-poor environments would decrease the number of copies of the 18s rRNA gene in their genome. I measured life history traits as well as rRNA gene expression and gene copy number. We found that elemental stoichiometry predicts evolutionary changes consistent with the Growth Rate Hypothesis. We sequenced and assembled a draft genome of P. murrayi. Although we expected to find genes responsible for stress tolerance, we hypothesized that in response to strong selection pressure associated with living in a simplified ecosystem, over time the genome of P. murrayi should have undergone significant decay (gene loss) relative to species in ecosystems structured more strongly by biotic interactions. We found significantly fewer genes in P. murrayi . To compare patterns of gene expression between two highly divergent Antarctic nematode species, we sequenced and assembled the transcriptomes of S. lindsayae and P. murrayi. Under laboratory conditions at 4 °C, S. lindsayae had significantly lower rates of gene expression but expressed a significantly larger number of genes. We speculate that the differences in gene expression are correlated with life history traits (developmental rates) while the differences in the number of genes expressed can be explained by their different genetic systems (S. lindsayae is amphimictic, P. murrayi is parthenogenic) and the soil environments to which they are adapted. Since we previously showed that differences in available P content can influence the evolution of gene expression via gene copy number, and that this ultimately influences growth rate, we wondered how much of this response is driven by genetics versus how strongly these patterns are driven by temperature. To better understand this, we maintained wild type populations of P. murrayi in P-rich and P-poor conditions at 5 °C, 10 °C and 15°C in the laboratory for over 40 generations and sequenced the transcriptomes prepared from each treatment group. We found that nutrient levels played an important role in gene expression when the temperature is optimal for P. murrayi culturing and that temperature is more important in gene expression when the available P is limited. This work underscores the utility of using principles of elemental stoichiometry coupled with genomic and transcriptomics research tools to make and test predictions about life history evolution. The results of my work also inform inferences about the ways in which nutrient availability also drives the organization of trophic interactions and ultimately ecosystems.

TI  - Receptor Binding Domains and Coronavirus Adaptation and Evolution
SP  - 231
AB  - Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and other animals. The continued circulation of human coronaviruses and the large reservoir of non-human coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans represent a significant health concern. Similar to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, and evolution and adaptation has accompanied the diversification of coronaviruses. The coronavirus spike protein is a viral membrane protein involved in host receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Reported here is work performed on the spike proteins of two human common cold causing coronaviruses: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. Specifically, the X-ray crystal structures of the following were determined: i) the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein of HCoV-229E in complex with human aminopeptidase N (hAPN) and ii) the carbohydrate binding domain (CBD) of the S-protein of HCoV-OC43 in complex with 9-O-Acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac 2). In addition, viral sequence analysis, binding studies, and comparative sequence and structural analysis among closely related coronaviruses were performed. The observation that the greatest variability shown by natural viral isolates of HCoV-229E is located in the receptor binding loops is quite surprising from a receptor binding standpoint. However, this observation suggests that the receptor binding region is changing due to viral selection. Indeed, our results indicate that the optimization of receptor binding affinity and/or immune evasion, two known determinants of viral fitness, are operative in the emergence of new viral isolates. Although less well characterized at this point, natural viral sequence variation at or near the carbohydrate binding site of HCoV-OC43 is also observed, an indication that similar selection pressures are operative. Together, our results provide mechanistic insights into coronavirus adaptation and evolution.

TI  - Sex-Specific Behavioral Strategies for Thermoregulation in the Common Chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater)
SP  - 121
AB  - Intraspecific variability of behavioral thermoregulation in lizards due to habitat, temperature availability, and seasonality is well documented, but variability due to sex is not. Sex-specific thermoregulatory behaviors are important to understand because they can affect relative fitness in ways that result in different responses to environmental changes. The common chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater) is a great model for investigating sex differences in thermoregulation because males behave differently from females while they actively defend distinct territories while females may not. I recorded body temperatures of wild adult chuckwallas continuously from May to July 2016, as well as operative environmental temperatures in crevices and aboveground sites used by chuckwallas for basking. I compared the effect of sex on indices of thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, aboveground activity, and the time chuckwallas selected body temperatures relative to their preferred temperature range (34–39 °C) for May-July. Males and females achieved the same thermoregulatory accuracy and effectiveness, and amount of time at preferred body temperatures, but males were more active aboveground than females, especially in June. These results indicate that different behavioral strategies can accomplish the same thermoregulatory outcomes. Further, chuckwallas might be able to cope with predicted changes in climate that result in a shorter amount of time they could be active at preferred body temperature because these lizards were only active aboveground for one to four hours per day, a fraction of the time available.

TI  - The Evolutionary Significance of Body Size in Burying Beetles
SP  - 151
AB  - Body size is one of the most commonly studied traits of an organism, which is largely due to its direct correlation with fitness, life history strategy, and physiology of the organism. Patterns of body size distribution are also often studied. The distribution of body size within species is looked at for suggestions of differential mating strategies or niche variation among ontogenetic development. Patterns are also examined among species to determine the effects of competition, environmental factors, and phylogenetic inertia. Finally, the distribution of body size across the geographic range of a species or group of closely related is looked at for indications of the effects of climate and resource availability on body size at different latitudes and altitudes. In this collection of research, I address the evolution and importance of body size in burying beetles (genus Nicrophorus). Body size is important to several aspects of burying beetle natural history, including competitive ability, fitness, parental care, climate tolerance, and locomotor activity. In Chapter 1, I use a large data set of body size measurements for seventy of the seventy-three Nicrophorus species to make inferences about the distribution of body size within the genus, across its geographic range, and the importance of body size in speciation. I found that the range of body sizes is not normally distributed, with an overrepresentation of small-sized species. I also found that expansion of the burying beetle range has been restricted by their inability to tolerate warm, dry climates, and therefore the majority of burying beetle diversity occurs in the temperature mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Body size also seems to be important in speciation, as almost all sister taxa are significantly different in body size. In Chapter 2 I use common garden experiments to assess the importance of body size for males and females in competition, reproductive output, and starvation resistance. Body size is equally important for both sexes in starvation resistance, but it is more important for males in competitions for carcasses and for females in reproductive output. In Chapter 3 I test for fitness consequences of multigenerational effects of body size in offspring. I found that the larger offspring that are produced by larger mothers and on larger carcasses had higher fitness than small offspring. In Chapter 4 I test for the possibility of brood parasitism in two species of burying beetles, N. guttula and N. marginatus, which co-occur over part of their geographic ranges. I found that both species are able to detect and remove parasitic larvae. Finally, in Chapter 5 I compiled parent and offspring body sizes from seven species of burying beetles and use them to compare the heritability of body size among species using comparative techniques and a meta-analysis. I found that body size heritability is different between species, but is low for the genus as a whole. Together, these projects provide valuable information on the evolutionary significance of body size in Nicrophorus , and indicate compelling questions for future research into the evolution of body size in burying beetles.

TI  - Influence of Natural and Anthropogenic Light Levels on Female Preferences in Eastern Gray Treefrogs (Hyla versicolor)
SP  - 98
AB  - Chapter 1: While the influence of environmental variables, particularly temperature and rainfall, on the breeding behavior of amphibians is widely recognized, relatively few studies have addressed how the moon affects amphibian behavior. Yet, the lunar cycle provides several rhythmic temporal cues that animals could use to time important group events such as spawning, and the substantial changes in light levels associated with the different moon phases may also affect the behavior of nocturnal frogs. Using seven years of field observation data, we tested for lunar effects on the reproductive activity of male and female Eastern gray treefrogs ( Hyla versicolor). We found that chorusing and breeding activity was statistically more likely to occur around the first quarter of the moon and during intermediately bright nights, but that reproductive activity also occurred during various other times during the lunar cycle. We discuss these findings in relation to the two main hypotheses of lunar effects on animals: predator avoidance and temporal synchronization of breeding. Chapter 2: Nocturnal light levels vary throughout the course of the lunar cycle, being darkest during the new moon and brightest during the full moon. Many nocturnal animals change their behavior in response to this natural variation in moonlight intensity. Frequently, these behavioral changes can be attributed to the way in which moonlight affects the ability of predators to spot potential prey. Mate sampling females may expose themselves to predators, making mate choice a behavior likely influenced by moonlight. Because mate choice is an important cause of sexual selection, understanding the causes of variation in mate choice decisions can yield a better understanding of the strength and direction of sexual selection under natural conditions. We predicted that female Eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) would prefer longer calls (i.e., more attractive males) and/or be choosier, under darker conditions, because cover of darkness may aid in predator evasion. However, light treatment did not affect how females responded to variation in call duration, nor did it affect female choosiness or aspects of their approach behavior. This suggests that in gray treefrogs, variation in light levels associated with the changing phases of the moon does not alter the sexual selection regime on male call traits. Chapter 3: Human activities are drastically changing the amount of artificial light entering natural habitats. Because light pollution alters the sensory environment, it may interfere with behaviors ranging from prey detection and vigilance to mate choice. Here we test the hypothesis that anthropogenic light pollution affects the mate choice behavior of female Eastern gray treefrogs (Hyla versicolor). We tested this hypothesis under two experimental light treatments that simulate the light pollution created by streetlights (i.e., expansion of lit areas and increased light intensity), and the light pollution created by headlights of passing vehicles (i.e., rapid fluctuations between bright and dark conditions). The hypothesis predicts that females tested under conditions simulating light pollution will show behavioral changes geared towards mitigating detection by predators, such as relaxed preferences, decreased choosiness for the normally preferred call, and differences in approach behavior (either more directional, faster, or stealthier movements, or no approach at all). Contrary to our prediction, we found that light pollution did not affect mate choice behavior in gray treefrogs, and should therefore neither interfere with population persistence nor affect the sexual selection regimes on male call traits of this species. However, we caution that this result does not imply that anthropogenic light pollution is of no concern for amphibian conservation, because behavioral responses to variation in nocturnal light levels (both in the natural as well as anthropogenically enhanced range) seem to be highly species-specific in anurans. We encourage additional studies to help gage the vulnerability of anurans to anthropogenic light pollution.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity drives phenological change in Mandt's Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle mandtii)
SP  - 66
AB  - The ability of individuals to change breeding time is predicted to be an important aspect of adapting to climate change. Changes in breeding time could occur through either behavioural adjustment of breeding time or evolution. To date, few studies have investigated these processes in Arctic environments, where temperature is rising at a greater rate than the global mean. I evaluated the contribution of behavioural adjustment of breeding time and evolution to changes in breeding time associated with annual variation in snow melt and female breeding age over a 42-year dataset from an Arctic population of Black Guillemots (Cepphus grylle mandtii). I used an Animal Model to decompose the variance observed in breeding time and I used three fitness metrics in a bivariate Animal Model to estimate selection on clutch initiation DOY. Finally, I examined the temporal trend in the genetic component of variation in clutch initiation date to determine if evolution contributed to the shift in breeding time. During the study period mean clutch initiation date advanced 7.8 days, snow melt date advanced 7.6 days, and the average female breeding age increased by 4.7 years. Earlier clutch initiation was associated with experienced mothers, earlier snow melt, and higher fitness. Individuals advanced clutch initiation at different rates as they aged but responded similarly to variation in snow melt. Heritability of clutch initiation date was negligible (h2 = 0.04, 95% CI [0.00-0.11]), and there was no evidence of evolution contributing to the change in breeding time. My results suggest that covariation between clutch initiation date and fitness is driven by environmental, but not genetic factors. Consequently, changes of breeding time in Black Guillemots are likely driven by plastic behavioural adjustment with limited potential for evolutionary change.

TI  - Sociality and Stress in Female Chacma Baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa: Behavioral Flexibility and Coping Mechanisms
SP  - 270
AB  - The physiological stress responses that animals exhibit to the myriad stressors in their environment can be used to assess the state of their health and well-being, and even survival capability. Although the stress response is adaptive in many cases, chronic stress responses may be maladaptive in some situations when it leads to dysfunction of the physiological system involved in the stress response itself, and can also cause deleterious effects on health, reproduction and survival. The stress response includes physiological responses to both environmental perturbations and psychosocial stress and anxiety associated with social perturbations. The latter factor is particularly important for social animals such as primates. One way in which primates may respond to stressors is by adjusting their social bonds as well as their behaviors so as to cope with stressors and mitigate their negative effects. In my dissertation research, I studied the effects of three types of stressors—social, environmental and anthropogenic—on the glucocorticoid (GC) hormone levels and behavior of females in three troops of chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. I collected behavioral data from 33 females, i.e., all females that were adults at the start of the study period, and I also collected and analyzed fecal samples to determine GC levels. My study has three components, as follows: 1. Social stressors: I examined the effects of social instability caused by death and rank changes of males on GC hormone levels of females, as well as female behavioral responses to these events and their use of social bonds as coping mechanisms. In response to male instability, females increased the strength of their social relationships with other females, while focusing less of their social effort on males. Females differed in their adjustment of social relationships by reproductive state, with cycling females increasing their grooming of males and lactating females—who are at most risk of infanticide—reducing their grooming of females during the period of instability associated with the alpha male's injury. These changes in behavior may have effectively mitigated the negative impacts of social stressors, as GC levels did not increase during periods of male instability. 2. Environmental stressors: Living on the southern tip of Africa naturally exposes the baboons to extremes of temperatures, with hot, dry summers characterized by shortened day lengths and cold, wet winters with longer day lengths. In this study, I found that females had higher GC levels in the winter months and changed their activity budgets to accommodate their seasonally varying needs. Females spent a larger proportion of time feeding in the winter, with its shorter days, while at the same time reducing their time spent on other activities such as socializing and resting. There is some indication that the baboons used behavioral mechanisms for thermoregulation, as they spent more time in open, sunny areas in the winter possibly to absorb more heat, and they spent more time in closed forested areas in the summer, possibly as a way to remain cool. 3. Anthropogenic stressors: The study population of baboons lives in close proximity to humans in the Cape Peninsula and the home range of each troop is a patchwork of natural and developed habitats. When the baboons range in the more developed and urbanized areas, they have regular interactions with humans, often of a conflict nature. I examined the effects of this anthropogenic presence on female GC hormone levels as well as on their use of self-directed behaviors (SDB). Females had higher GC levels when they spent more time ranging in areas where they interacted more with humans and more often came into conflict with them. In some troops, ranging in areas of human presence was also associated with higher rates of self-directed behaviors. The results of this study are meaningful and timely as anthropogenic disturbance and anthropogenic climate change are significant forces acting on animal communities, changing selection pressures and potentially driving evolutionary change. This study adds to our understanding of the variation of responses among taxa, as well as the behavioral flexibility exhibited by animals, and whether and how this flexibility may be adaptive in enabling animals to survive stressors and anthropogenic change. More broadly, my research aims to contribute to an understanding of the behavioral flexibility exhibited by primates in response to social and ecological variation and the adaptive value of this flexibility.

TI  - Adaptability and Management of Alfalfa Overseeded Into Warm-Season Perennial Grasses in Mississippi
SP  - 119
AB  - Alfalfa overseeded into warm-season perennial grasses such as bahiagrass or bermudagrass has the potential to increase forage quality and dry matter yield as well as extend the growing season. Many of the challenges associated with alfalfa in mixtures have been observed in warm-season grasses, but few studies have attempted to explain the dynamics between these grasses and alfalfa when grown together. Two studies were designed to note these relationships: The objective of the first study was to observe the effect of seeding rate and sod preparation on alfalfa and bermudagrass persistence over three years by using minimum tillage and alfalfa seeding rates of 17, 22, 28, and 39 kg ha-1. Results indicated that sod preparation had no effect on establishment compared to no-tillage. Seeding rates resulted in similar biomass yields and species composition by the second year suggesting that increased seeding rates were unnecessary. Forage quality and yield were improved throughout the year, but alfalfa composition generally decreased towards the end of summer. The objective of the second study was to quantify the amount of nitrogen recovered when alfalfa was overseeded into bahiagrass and bermudagrass and fertilized with ammonium nitrate during late summer. This was accomplished by using two nitrogen rates of 15N labeled fertilizer (28 and 56 kg N ha-1) and two application times (after 2nd and 3rd harvest) and in two separate planting environments (planting I and II). It was found that bahiagrass was more competitive than bermudagrass when overseeded with alfalfa. Alfalfa/grass mixtures did not increase forage dry matter yield, nutritive value or grass composition with N application. Nitrogen fertilizer recovery was variable between plantings due to a large variation of alfalfa persistence within different soil types. Where alfalfa was limited, grass fertilizer recovery was over 60%, but when grass composed less than 10% in the mix, then alfalfa had the potential to recover over 40% of the applied fertilizer. The greatest N recovery by grass were favored during late N application. On the other hand, alfalfa N recovery was favored by early fertilizer application.

TI  - Persistent Effects of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Exposure Across Generations: A Bioenergetic and Mitochondrial Perspective
SP  - 181
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. PAHs are toxicologically important for both humans and wildlife in large part due to their mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic properties. While the effects of adult and developmental exposures to PAHs are relatively well characterized, the potential for PAHs to have effects across generations is an emerging concern in the field of environmental health. In epidemiological studies, prenatal exposure to PAHs is associated with adverse birth outcomes as well as later life metabolic, neurological, and reproductive disorders— which have become global human health epidemics. These findings have been validated in animal models, with reduced survivorship, increased morphological deformities, and alterations in behavior, physiology, and disease risk in multiple subsequent generations. However, the mechanisms underlying the multigenerational effects of PAHs are poorly understood. This dissertation focuses on mitochondrial contributions to the maternal and cross-generational toxicity of PAHs. Mitochondria are essential to the development, health, survival, and reproduction of all aerobic organisms. The importance of maintaining mitochondrial function for health is supported by the prevalence of mitochondrial diseases, which clinically manifest in at least 1 in 4,300 people. Mitochondrial diseases often present with metabolic, neurological, and reproductive consequences, similar to those associated with prenatal PAH exposures. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is maternally inherited and undergoes bottlenecks (i.e. reductions in mtDNA copy number per cell) during oogenesis and early embryonic development, creating potential for maternal and cross-generational inheritance of mitochondrial diseases. Inheritance of mitochondrial dysfunction across generations has been established for genetic, pharmacological, and dietary etiologies. Notably, mitochondria are important targets of environmental contaminants such as PAHs, which affect bioenergetics at multiple levels of biological organization. However, the potential for environmental toxicant-induced mitochondrial dysfunction to have persistent effects across multiple generations is still largely uncharacterized. This is the knowledge gap we address in this dissertation. To this end, we evaluate the persistent bioenergetic effects of BaP – a model PAH and known mitochondrial toxicant – in F1 (maternally exposed) and F2 (cross-generationally exposed or germline exposed) generations following a chronic maternal (F0) dietary exposure using the model teleost Danio rerio. Maternally exposed F1 embryos exhibit reduced mitochondrial DNA integrity, reduced mitochondrial function and efficiency, and impaired antioxidant defense systems during development, largely in the absence of effects in exposed F0 females. Metabolic shifts during development create potential for disease pathologies and reduced organismal fitness later in life. In F1 adults, mitochondrial dysfunction presents in cardiac tissue with reductions in mitochondrial reserve capacity. Cardiac function and plasticity are key determinants of fitness in the environment, and impaired function confers disease risk in humans. Maternally BaP exposed F1 fish also exhibit altered locomotor activity throughout life and reduced fear/anxiety behaviors as adults. PAH-induced changes in mitochondrial function and metabolic plasticity persist in the F2 embryos, two generations removed from the original BaP exposure, suggesting cross-generational reductions in fitness may follow a single exposure event. Metabolic consequences occur in F2 embryos at F0 exposure levels that do not cause significant dysfunction in the F1 generation, with important implications for evaluating the risk associated with the persistent effects of pollution (e.g. lasting impacts of oil spill events) in the environment. The ability to adjust metabolism is crucial for organisms to effectively respond to a variety of natural and anthropogenic stressors, suggesting that organisms with alterations in fundamental bioenergetic processes may be more sensitive to secondary stressors. Herein we demonstrate that F2 organisms with a cross-generational history of exposure exhibit altered metabolic response to thermal stress, reduced thermal tolerance, and fitness tradeoffs. Cross-generational exposure to BaP potentiates metabolic effects under thermal stress even in the absence of effects at baseline temperature. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to PAHs such as BaP affects mitochondrial function, organismal physiology, behavior, and secondary stress response capacity across generations, creating potential for downstream population and ecosystem level effects.

TI  - From Species to Populations: Genetic and Eco-physiological Divergence Across Puerto Rican Anolis Lizards
SP  - 126
AB  - Species pairs of Puerto Rican anoles inhabit distinct thermal environments and are locally adapted to those environments with regard to physiological traits. In chapter 1, I analyzed multilocus nuclear genetic data and genome-wide SNP data to test for simultaneous divergence and gene flow between physiologically divergent species pairs. I utilized new model-based methods that rigorously test for shared evolutionary history by jointly estimating divergence times for multiple species while implementing models of divergence with and without gene flow, and compared results from Sanger and SNP datasets to determine which dataset is best suited for comparative phylogeographic analyses. These analyses indicate that ‘xeric’ adapted lizards may have evolved synchronously, but in general, recent speciation of Puerto Rican anoles proceeded idiosyncratically. Recent models show that tropical ectotherms may respond to increasing temperatures by undergoing range shifts, acclimatizing, or becoming locally extinct. These models often overlook standing genetic variation and assume that tropical ectotherms will not be able to adapt rapidly enough to track global climate change. In chapter 2, I used multilocus nuclear genetic data and genome-wide SNP data to investigate phylogeographic patterns in A. cristatellus across Puerto Rico, and to test whether genetic variation correlates with environmental climate layers. These analyses identified multiple genetic populations of A. cristatellus that correlate with thermal environment indicating that selection on physiological traits may drive population divergence. Surprisingly, I found asymmetrical gene flow from xeric to mesic populations. Genes flowing ‘out’ of xeric habitats fits a pattern in which selection against ‘warm-adapted’ genotypes in cool habitats is weak, whereas selection against ‘cool-adaptive’ genotypes in warm habitats is relatively strong. Phylogeographic approaches identify geographic and ecological features that generate and maintain genetic diversity in co-distributed taxa. I analyzed genome-wide SNP data for three species of widespread Puerto Rican anoles to test the relative contributions of geography and ecology in driving population divergence. While only one species (A. cristatellus) had phylogeographic structure associated with ecological transitions, all three (A. cristatellus, A. pulchellus, and A. stratulus) shared concordant population breaks and simultaneous divergence across the San Loiza Basin in eastern Puerto Rico. These results are consistent with phylogeographic work on other Puerto Rican vertebrates including frogs, indicating the San Loiza Basin as an important geographic feature driving population divergence across diverse ecological groups on Puerto Rico. Divergent selection and local adaptation are recognized as primary drivers of reproductive isolation. However, thermoregulatory behavior may buffer divergent selection acting on thermal physiology, resulting in high gene flow across thermal gradients. I tested this prediction by analyzing genome-wide SNP data to investigate genetic clines along elevation gradient for populations of A. cristatellus that differ in operative temperatures and body temperatures. I also ran ecological association analysis of SNPs to test for signatures of selection resulting from temperature and precipitation. I found sharp genetic clines, despite thermoregulatory behavior that should buffer natural selection, indicating that precipitation may be the main agent of selection along the elevational gradient in southern Puerto Rico.

TI  - Phenology of a Southern Population of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonous ponderosae)
SP  - 137
AB  - Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae, Hopkins) is a major disturbance agent in pine ecosystems of western North America. Adaptation to local climates has resulted in primarily univoltine (one generation per year) generation timing across a thermally diverse latitudinal gradient. We hypothesized that this pattern in total development time is shaped by selection for slower developmental rates, altered developmental thresholds, or oviposition rates in southern populations inhabiting warmer climates. To investigate traits responsible for latitudinal differences we measured lifestage-specific development of southern mountain pine beetle eggs, larvae and pupae across a range of temperatures. We also describe and model oviposition of southern US MPB. Using a novel technique that included frequent X-ray imaging, oviposition rate and fecundity were estimated separately and shown to both be significant and independent sources of variation. When compared with previously collected data for a northern MPB population, total oviposition time predicted for southern MPB at a constant 20°C was slightly longer than that of northern MPB, but the delay was too small to account for significant differences between the populations in total development time. Developmental rate curves for eggs, larvae, and pupae were fit using maximum posterior likelihood estimation with a Bayesian prior to improve fit stability. When compared to previously published data fora northern population (Régnière et al. 2012), observed developmental rates of the southern and northern populations were similar across all studied lifestages at 20 and 25°C, although southern individuals were generally faster at temperature extremes (10 and 27°C). These findings were inconsistent with our hypothesis that southern individuals would have consistently slower rates. Optimal development of southern individuals occurred at higher temperatures, with higher development thresholds, as compared with northern individuals. Our results suggest that evolved traits in the remaining unstudied lifestage, teneral (i.e., pre-emergent) adult, likely influence latitudinal differences in mountain pine beetle generation time.

TI  - Intraspecific and Interspecific Competition in Two Species of Anurans: Hyla Savignyi and Bufotes Viridis
SP  - 46
AB  - Inter- and intraspecific density-dependent effects may influence amphibians in temporary pools. Two factors were tested in my thesis: oviposition site selection in response to Hyla savignyi intraspecific density and larval performance of the two species interacting intraspecifically and interspecifically in response to density – survival to, size at, and time to metamorphosis.The first outdoor mesocosm experiment tested the effect of 3 levels of density (0, 10 and 40 tadpoles) on oviposition site selection and larval performance of Hyla savignyi using plastic tubs as mesocosms filled with 20 L of water, simulating temporary pools. Mass to metamorphosis was strongly and negatively affected at the high density. Gravid females chose oviposition sites with no or low density of conspecific tadpoles. The main mesocosm experiment was set as a replacement design to test intraspecific and interspecific competition between H. savignyi and Bufotes viridis due to the fact that these two species co-occur in the same habitats and at the same time, and appear to both be predominantly periphyton grazers. The design included five treatments of different densities for each species (0 Hyla + 20 Bufotes; 0 Hyla + 40 Bufotes; 20 Hyla + 20 Bufotes; 20 Hyla + 0 Bufotes; 40 Hyla + 0 Bufotes) and a control with no tadpoles in order to test the effect of tadpole density on the invertebrate community. As demonstrated in the preliminary experiment, mass at metamorphosis of H. savignyi was affected by intraspecific competition in the second experiment as well. Time to metamorphosis was also affected by intraspecific competition with strong tendency towards statistical significance. Although tadpoles of B. viridis did not exhibit density-dependent effects, temperature had a positive correlation with survival and a negative correlation with time to metamorphosis. Since literature suggests that when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific competition coexistence is possible, my results might explain the co-occurrence of these two species.Alternate abstract:השפעות תלויות-צפיפות, תוך-מינית ובין-מינית עלולים להשפיע על דו-חיים המאכלסים בריכות חורף עונתיות. שתי השפעות נבחנו במסגרת התיזה שלי: בחירת אתר הטלה של נקבות כתגובה לצפיפות תוך-מינית של אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla )והתפתחות לארוולית של שני מינים באינטראקציה בין-מינית ותוך-מינית כתגובה לצפיפות - שרידות במטמורפוזה, משקל במטמורפוזה וזמן למטמורפוזה. הניסוי הראשון אשר בוצע בשטח ומדמה ככל הניתן את התנאים הטבעיים של בריכה עונתית, בדק את השפעת 3 רמות של צפיפות )0 ,10 ו-40 ראשנים( על בחירת האתר הטלה של נקבות ועל ההתפתחות הלארוולית של אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla .)נעשה שימוש בגיגיות פלסטיק כאשר כל גיגית מולאה ב-20 ליטר מים, על מנת לדמות בריכה עונתית. לצפיפות גבוהה של ראשנים הייתה השפעה חזקה ושלילית על משקל הראשנים במטמורפוזה. נקבות בחרו להטלה אתרים ללא ראשנים או עם מספר נמוך של ראשנים מאותו המין. הניסוי הראשי והמרכזי עוצב כך שיוכל לבחון תחרות בין-מינית ותחרות תוך-מינית של שני מיני דו-חיים: אילנית מצויה )savignyi Hyla )וקרפדה ירוקה ) Bufotes viridis ,)מתוך העובדה ששני מינים אלו חולקים את אותו בית גידול, באותה תקופה וככל הנראה גם ניזונים מפריפיטון. הניסוי כלל חמישה טיפולים של צפיפויות משתנות לכל מין )0 אילנית+20 קרפדה; 0 אילנית+40 קרפדה; 20 אילנית+20 קרפדה; 20 אילנית+0 קרפדה; 40 אילנית+0 קרפדה( וטיפול אחד נוסף ללא ראשנים כלל ששימש כביקורת במטרה לבחון את השפעת צפיפות הראשנים על אוכלוסיית חסרי החוליות. בדומה לכפי שהוצג בניסוי ההתחלתי, משקל במטמורפוזה של האילנית המצויה הושפע מתחרות תוך-מינית גם בניסוי המרכזי. זמן למטמורפוזה גם כן הושפע מתחרות תוך-מינית עם נטייה חזקה למובהקות סטטיסטית. למרות שראשני הקרפדה הירוקה לא הראו השפעות תלויות-צפיפות, טמפרטורה הייתה בקורלציה חיובית עם שרידות הראשנים ובקורלציה שלילית עם זמן למטמורפוזה. ההצעה הנה שתחרות תוך-מינית חזקה עשויה להסביר את הדו-קיום של שני המינים שנבדקו במחקר זה.

TI  - Geologic Insights from Zircon Inheritance
SP  - 376
AB  - Numerous studies illustrate that the mineral zircon is the preeminent material resource for understanding fundamental geologic processes that occur in continental crust. Zircon can grow and exist in a broad range of igneous and metamorphic environments within the Earth's crust, and incorporates trace concentrations of elements (U, Th, Hf, REE) that allow age and chemical fingerprinting of these "environmental" influences. This dissertation explores the tectonic and petrologic ramifications of zircon inheritance in the rock cycle, focusing primarily on insights from xenocrystic zircons found in igneous rocks. Pre-magmatic (xenocrystic) domains in zircons can convey otherwise inaccessible details regarding the composition and history of deep--seated magma source regions from which the xenocrysts were derived. The pre--Cenozoic kinematic and tectonic history of the Arctic Alaska Chukotka terrane (AAC) is explored in Chapters 1 and 2. Constraining the pre-opening paleogeography of the Canadian and Alaskan margins of the Canada Basin is a first-order objective in resolving the plate tectonic evolution of the Amerasia Basin of the Arctic Ocean. Paleogeographic models of Northern Alaska are tested using detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology of 12 samples from Middle Mississippian to Early-Middle Jurassic strata (Ellesmerian and lower Beaufortian megasequences) obtained from wells and outcrop along Alaska's North Slope. Arctic Alaska received sediments recycled from the Devonian foreland clastic wedge and underlying Franklinian Basin strata along the Canadian margin-- indicating northern Alaska was part of the foreland fold and thrust belt of the Franklinian mobile belt prior to the opening of the Canada Basin. During the Mesozoic, the AAC was involved in crustal shortening, followed by magmatism and extension, with localized high--grade metamorphism and partial melting, all of which obscured its pre--orogenic geological relationships. New zircon geochronology and isotope geochemistry results from Wrangel Island and western Chukotka basement rocks establish and strengthen intra-- and inter--terrane lithologic and tectonic correlations of the AAC. Temporal patterns of zircon inheritance and O--Hf isotopes are consistent with Cryogenian--Ediacaran AAC magmatism in a peripheral/external orogenic setting (i.e., fringing arc on rifted continental margin crust). In Chapters 3 and 4 fundamental questions about lithology, age, structure, and thermal evolution of the deep crust of the retro--arc hinterland of the North American Cordilleran orogen are addressed through systematic investigation of zircons from Cretaceous and Paleogene granitic rocks in the Snake Range, Kern Mountains, and Deep Creek Range in the east-central Great Basin. Regional metamorphism in Neoproterozoic strata succeeded by (and facilitating?) local underthrusting of low δ18O Paleoproterozoic cratonal basement at depth best explains the observed patterns of inheritance associated with retroarc magmatism during Late Cretaceous time. Ubiquitous mid--Cretaceous to Paleogene zircon overgrowths on xenocrysts from 40 Ma muscovite porphyry dikes indicate that fertile conditions for zircon growth existed throughout the time span of the Sevier and Laramide orogenies, persisting until 45 Ma. "Closed--system" like conditions allowed the overgrowths to preserve similar δ18O compositions to their cores. After 40 Ma in the study area, increased mantle heat flow related to foundering of the Farallon oceanic lithosphere exceeded conditions for pre--magmatic zircon preservation, making xenocrysts a unique archive of the deep crust history here.

TI  - Understanding and Tuning Thermal Transport at the Nanoscale
SP  - 141
AB  - Thermal transport in nanoscale materials is highly sensitive to the presence of defects and imperfections. For applications in areas ranging from electronics thermal management to energy harvesting, it is crucial to understand how material microstructure impacts thermal conductivity. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and point defects can all scatter vibrational energy carriers leading to a modulation of the local thermal resistance. This work examines these phenomena over a range of defect length scales, in materials ranging from isotropic three-dimensional (3D) to highly anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) layered systems, using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy (time-domain thermoreflectance, or TDTR) as a probe. First, we discuss thermal transport measurements and modeling of heat conduction in thin-films of polycrystalline diamond, down to ~500 nm in thickness, where phonon scattering at grain boundaries plays a crucial role. The complex nucleation and growth kinetics lead to the formation of a columnar grain structure, which results in a highly anisotropic (~5×) and inhomogeneous thermal conductivity tensor. We construct a geometrical model that relates the spatial evolution of the thermal conductivity to the underlying competition and survival of growing crystallites. Second, we describe thermal conductivity measurements of epitaxially-grown short-period (~4 nm) III-V superlattice thin-films, where phonon-interface scattering plays a central role. Detailed theoretical analysis using a phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) model reveals that lattice-matching in this system leads to high-quality interfaces that scatter phonons specularly. The implications of these results for the design and operation of mid-infrared Quantum Cascade Lasers are discussed. Third, we shift our focus to understanding thermal transport in van der Waals layered 2D materials and devices. We describe measurements of the fundamental mean free path (MFP) spectrum of heat-carrying phonons along the c-axis of MoS2, via thickness-dependent cross-plane thermal conductivity measurements of films as thin as ~20 nm. We uncover a surprising fact about the prominent contribution of long MFP phonons (MFPs as long as ~100s of nm) to thermal transport. Combining our experimental data with first principles phonon calculations, we show that the spectrum of heat-carrying vibrational modes (traveling normal to the layers) extends from ~5 nm to ~1 µm in crystalline MoS2. Finally, we present a novel thermal application of a dynamically tunable microstructure based on a layered 2D material. We show how point-defects, namely intercalated Li ions, can be used to reversibly modulate cross-plane thermal transport in MoS2. These electrochemical thermal transistors, only ~10 nm thick, show large thermal "on/off" ratios approaching nearly one order of magnitude. Using a novel in operando thermal conductance microscopy technique, we demonstrate "live" visualization of Li ion redistribution during charging and discharging of the MoS2 thermal transistor, with a spatial resolution down to ~1 µm. Atomic force microscopy on chemically intercalated samples shows that Li insertion into the van der Waals gap in MoS2 increases its c-axis lattice constant, and introduces mesoscopic disorder. Using first principles density functional theory and molecular dynamics calculations, we sort out the relative contributions of different factors that lead to the large modulation in thermal conductivity, including increased phonon scattering by Li 'rattler' modes, acoustic mode-softening due to lattice-expansion, and disorder at the atomic and mesoscopic length scales.

TI  - Ecophysiology of Overwintering in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera, L.)
SP  - 118
AB  - Winter is a great challenge for all animals living in the temperate climates. Among insects, honey bees are unique for their overwintering behavior. While virtually all other insect species go into diapause (a dormant state), honey bee colonies comes to a reproductive arrest but existing worker bees form a thermoregulatory cluster to generate and maintain heat against the ambient temperature (Döke, Frazier, & Grozinger, 2015). During this process, the colony solely depends on food they have collected through the previous spring and summer and stored in the form of honey for energy (Owens, 1971). Moreover, the workers in fall must survive until the end of winter since there simply cannot be worker turn-over during this broodless period (Mattila, Harris, & Otis, 2001). Thus, in fall, workers with a distinct physiological state and increased longevity are produced in the colony, replacing the short-lived summer bees (Fluri, Lüscher, Wille, & Gerig, 1982; Z. Y. Huang & Robinson, 1995).Populations of honey bee colonies maintained in the same area for several generations can adapt to their environment and moving colonies between climatic regions can lower their overwintering survival, suggesting existence of selectable, genetic components for overwintering success (Büchler et al., 2014; Hatjina et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2010). On the other hand, all of the individuals throughout the year are half-sisters – daughters of a multiply mated queen – making them genetically similar. Yet worker bees of summer and winter are radically different in their physiology and behavior suggesting existence of differentially expressed genes that modify the individual phenotype according to environmental cues. The research presented in this dissertation establishes a solid foundation for the genetic, transcriptomic, physiological, and social components of honey bee overwintering and its regulation.Chapter 1 reviews the current state of research on honey bee overwintering and best practices to maximize survival rate of managed honey bee colonies. Additionally, using the literature, a testable hypothetical model for the environmental cues acting on honey bee overwintering is offered. We believe this model will be a useful framework for researchers in testing the effect of individual environmental parameters on honey bee overwintering, and indeed we initiate testing of this model in Chapter 5.Chapter 2 examines the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique “winter bee” physiological state. We evaluate expression patterns of key metabolic and antioxidant genes in the abdominal fat body tissues and thoracic flight muscles of nurses, foragers, and winter bees collected from the same colonies throughout the year. When the three groups are compared using gene expression patterns in the abdominal fat body tissues, winter bees resemble nurses. However, when the gene expression in thoracic flight muscle is compared, winter bees resemble foragers. These findings suggest two distinct genetic toolkits working in tandem in different tissues to mixand- match expression profiles of summer workers tending different tasks to generate a novel phenotype; the winter bee.Chapter 3 explores the interactions between host physiological state and parasites, including the unique phenotype of the winter bee. Nosema is a microsporidian parasite infecting honey bees, which has been shown to alter the physiology of their hosts and increase behavioral maturation rates from nursing the foraging. However, these studies have been largely conducted by infecting one day old bees, and thus the impacts of Nosema on nurses, foragers, and winter bees have not been evaluated. Findings from this chapter show the effect of infection on longevity is greatly affected by host physiology. Moreover, previously identified “Nosema responsive” genes in honey bees (whose expression was altered by Nosema infection of young, cage-reared bees) were here shown to be primarily affected by the physiological state of the host rather than the infection state, suggesting that previous transcriptional studies were capturing the impact of Nosema on host maturation rather than a direct host immune response. Overall, these findings demonstrate the need for contextual experiments for realistic assessment of the effects infectious diseases have on their hosts.Chapter 4 compares the overwintering success colonies from southern (TX & FL) and northern (WV & VT) United States when placed in the same apiaries in temperate central Pennsylvania to examine the effect of genotype on winter survival and investigate whether northern stocks are locally adapted to colder and longer winters. Findings from this chapter suggest that while there locally adapted to colder and longer winters. Findings from this chapter suggest that while there are small – but detectable – genetic differences between populations of honey bees reared in the northern and southern United State, these differences are not associated with variation in overwintering survival. Instead, overwintering survival is greatly dependent on the size of the colony and can vary dramatically with the specific location – and its associated floral resources and climatic conditions - in which the colony is placed.Chapter 5 investigates the theory that landscape floral nutritional resources and climatic conditions influence social interactions and demographic structure in the colony, which then in turn mediates the production of winter bees and prepares the colony for winter. As was proposed in Chapter 1, two worker-produced pheromones (brood pheromone and forager pheromone) can act antagonistically, creating a push and pull model for the initiation and maintenance of winter phenotype. Testing this hypothesis, we did not find evidence to support a direct effect of the pheromones on colony vigor or survival. However, this study was limited by the fact that we experimented solely in the field where multiple confounding factors likely acted on the colonies.Lastly, Chapter 6 summarizes the findings from this dissertation, integrates results with current scientific literature, and discusses the future of research on honey bee overwintering.

TI  - Digital micromirror devices and femtosecond laser pulses for rapid laser micromachining
AB  - Laser machining techniques are almost ubiquitous in industry for micro- to nanoscale fabrication. It is essential for the advancement of the field that faster, cheaper processes be developed. Enhancements in speed and fidelity of production can be made to both additive and subtractive writing techniques by using Digital Micromirror Devices (DMD), particularly when coupled with femtosecond laser pulses. The objective of this thesis is the demonstration of DMDs used in conjunction with ultrafast laser pulses for both novel and rapid machining applications; primarily image-projection based techniques, using DMDs as dynamic intensity masks, will be used for subtractive patterning, laserinduced transfer, multi-photon polymerisation and centimetre-scale micro-machining. The dynamic nature of the DMD enables its application to the field of multiple exposures, and the centimetre-scale machining is applied to functional biological assays. Adaptive mask techniques are used to enhance the image reproduction achieved, correct for positional errors introduced by translation stages, as well as to attain greyscale intensity control with a DMD in single ultrashort pulses. A new technique for producing digital holograms is developed, and will form the basis of future work. Image projection-based patterning using DMDs as dynamic intensity masks is shown via ablation, multiphoton polymerisation and Laser-Induced Transfer (LIT). Ablation was achieved in a range of materials (including, but not limited to: gold, graphite, diamond, bismuth telluride and antimony telluride, glass, nickel, glucose, and gelatin), with 2 micron resolutions in samples and overall sizes of 1cm2. A multiple exposure technique reduced final structure resolution by 2.7 compared to the diffraction limit possible in a single exposure – from 1m to 370nm on one experimental setup, and from 727nm to 270nm on a second setup. The first demonstration of shaped, solid-phase LIT deposits has been made, both in forward and backward directions of transfer. Adaptive optics techniques have been developed for DMD mask corrections, and have reduced the positional error of samples introduced by translation stages. Greyscale intensity patterns have been projected at samples using the strictly binary-style DMD display technology, and the loss of intensity in high spatial frequencies at the sample has been addressed. A novel method for the generation of binary holograms is introduced, which allows for several additional degrees of control over spatial intensity patterns when using DMDs, such as the effective mask position relative to imaging optics, greyscale control, the formation of images at multiple planes, phase control, and overall lateral shifts of the intensity distribution below a single DMD pixel width.

TI  - Comparative Ecology and Physiology of Critically Endangered Madagascar Tortoises
SP  - 116
AB  - For ectotherms, physiology and behavior are critically tied to environmental conditions. Feeding, metabolism, reproduction, and even movement are strongly influenced by temperature, cover availability, and resource quality. The underlying mechanisms of these interactions are, however, poorly understood. The use of seasonal baseline hormone concentrations and data on ranging behavior can be used to determining the potential reproductive output in both wild and captive populations. Using three closely related, critically endangered Malagasy tortoise species as models, I assessed the tempo and mode of reproductive potential, activity, and health (stress and body condition) by measuring circulating stress and sex steroid hormones in conjunction with environmental, physical, activity, and behavioral features. Over a period of four years, I monitored circulating plasma hormone concentrations in conjunction with associated ecological and behavioral parameters to define and describe baseline and divergences which may be linked to reproductive adaptations to changing environments (weather and habitat features). Using wild, successfully reproducing populations and two captive populations for comparison, I tested the hypotheses that 1) timing, onset, duration, and frequency of reproductive cycles are a function of environmental conditions; 2) physiological stress influences behavior and reproduction, representing behavioral adaptability; 3) animals housed in captive conditions will exhibit chronic stress which reduces reproductive output; and 4) that perturbations in environment alters normal activity patterns and preferences. Elucidating the causal relationships that trigger divergence from homeostasis (stressors) will facilitate the development of effective management strategies, which are presently needed for Critically Endangered species (threatened by extinction in the wild; IUCN 2016).

TI  - Characterization of Surface Sulfate Species on Mixed Metal Oxide Catalysts: Insights From Spectroscopic Studies
SP  - 65
AB  - Solid acid and super acid catalysts are promising alternatives for very important reactions usually catalyzed industrially by homogeneous acid reactions. Sulfated metal oxides are among many examples of solid super acids which work well for acid catalyzed reactions. These catalysts have applications in isomerization, alkylation, acylation and oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. A characteristic example encompasses products from tert-butylation of phenol which have tremendous importance in chemical, petrochemical as well as pharmaceutical industry. In spite of significant amount of work devoted in this area, the catalysts being commercially used have low yields. Hence we channel our efforts in enhancing the productivity of the alkylation of phenol reaction by using sulfated metal oxides as it has shown in our preliminary work improved catalytic activity. In this work, we focus on the preparation and characterization of sulfated mixed metal oxides. Specifically, sulfated-Tin-Zirconium oxides (STZ) are produced by coprecipitation method using hydrated Zirconium Oxychloride(ZrOCl 2.8H2O) and Tin Chloride(SnCl4.5H2O) as metal precursors and ammonia as the precipitating agent. Different proportions of hydrous tin and zirconium oxides (molar ratios of 1:10,1:1 and 10:1) are synthesized. Sulfation of the prepared hydrous oxides is performed using wet impregnation method with 1M and 0.5M sulfuric acid solution. Calcination of the prepared sulfate mixed hydroxides follows at 600°C. Our work focuses on the incorporation of vibrational spectroscopic teqniques at the individual steps of the synthesis procedure. To that end, first we utilize Raman spectroscopy to study the speciation of the metal salts precursors in water and at various pH range. The broad spectral envelope is assigned to specific vibational modes of the various species. XRD analysis is done to understand the crystalline phases of the catalyst. Additionally, we study the temperature evolution of the deposited sulfated species by means of in-situ Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR-FTIR) and in-situ Raman spectroscopy using high temperature reaction chamber. The results show that the molecular structure of the surface sulfate species varies significantly with increasing temperature as underscored by the changes of S=O vibrational bands. It was found that the sulfated species getting attached to the catalyst support can majorly be present as bidentate, tridentate and polymeric species and are a function of the temperature as well as the Sn:Zr ratio. Tuning the molecular structure of the sulfated species could potentially alter the acidic properties of the catalysts as indicated by the Lewis/Bronsted acid sites. Lastly, it was found that the crystalline phases of the the regenerated catalyst remain unaffected along with the sulfated groups.

TI  - Driven by Affect to Explore Asteroids, the Moon, and Science Education
SP  - 1
AB  - Affect is a domain of psychology that includes attitudes, emotions, interests, and values. My own affect influenced the choice of topics for my dissertation. After examining asteroid interiors and the Moon's thermal evolution, I discuss the role of affect in online science education. I begin with asteroids, which are collections of smaller objects held together by gravity and possibly cohesion. These "rubble-pile" objects may experience the Brazil Nut Effect (BNE). When a collection of particles of similar densities, but of different sizes, is shaken, smaller particles will move parallel to the local gravity vector while larger objects will do the opposite. Thus, when asteroids are shaken by impacts, they may experience the BNE as possibly evidenced by large boulders seen on their surfaces. I found while the BNE is plausible on asteroids, it is confined to only the outer layers. The Moon, which formed with a Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO), is the next topic of this work. The LMO is due to the Moon forming rapidly after a giant impact between the proto-Earth and another planetary body. The first 80% of the LMO solidified rapidly at which point a floatation crust formed and slowed solidification of the remaining LMO. Impact bombardment during this cooling process, while an important component, has not been studied in detail. Impacts considered here are from debris generated during the formation of the Moon. I developed a thermal model that incorporates impacts and find that impacts may have either expedited or delayed LMO solidification. Finally, I return to affect to consider the differences in attitudes towards science between students enrolled in fully-online degree programs and those enrolled in traditional, in-person degree programs. I analyzed pre- and post-course survey data from the online astrobiology course Habitable Worlds. Unlike their traditional program counterparts, students enrolled in online programs started the course with better attitudes towards science and also further changed towards more positive attitudes during the course. Along with important conclusions in three research fields, this work aims to demonstrate the importance of affect in both scientific research and science education.

TI  - Functional Studies of Novel Mosquito Stage-Specific Genes in the Malaria Parasite Plasmodium berghei
SP  - 70
AB  - The development and survival of the malaria parasite Plasmodium within its mosquito vector is not very well understood. When the parasite is taken up by an Anopheles mosquito, it is exposed to digestive enzymes, reactive oxygen species, increasing pH, decreasing temperature, and a diverse microbial flora. Our lab is studying the adaptive mechanisms underlying parasite survival in this hostile environment, one of which is movement out of the midgut. In order to escape the midgut, the parasite develops into an elongated, motile form called the ookinete. I am investigating two genes, thioredoxin-like protein 1 (trxl-1) and subpellicular microtubule protein 1 (spm-1) that are specifically upregulated during the development into an ookinete. Based on our own previous findings and other literature in a related protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, I hypothesize that these genes are important for the generation and maintenance of the essential polar shape of the ookinete. In order to determine the function of these genes, I used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate trxl1KO and spm1KO transgenic parasite lines. The results of this study are presented in this thesis.

TI  - Calibration-free Spectrophotometric Measurements of Carbonate Saturation States in Seawater
SP  - 71
AB  - This work describes efforts to improve methodologies and instrumentation for investigation of the marine CO2 system. In the first section of my thesis, a method was developed that provides simple, calibration-free measurements of seawater carbonate saturation states (Ωspec) based solely on the use of a laboratory spectrophotometer. Measurements of pH are made in paired optical cells, one with and one without added nitric acid. The amount of added nitric acid is determined through the direct proportionality between nitrate concentration and UV absorbance. After an initial calibration, the method is calibration-free and requires no volumetric or gravimetric analyses thereafter. Saturation state measurements can be obtained in twelve minutes and attain Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network accuracy goals over a wide range of conditions. This simple one-step measurement protocol is ideal for monitoring ocean acidification conditions in coastal areas, fish hatcheries and shellfish farms. The second section of my thesis outlines the development of a next-generation handheld photometer for field measurements of seawater pH. The hand-held instrument is simple to use, inexpensive, and has a pH measurement accuracy of ±0.01. Each photometer is calibrated by relating pH-indicator absorbance ratios (R B) obtained with the broadband photometer to indicator absorbance ratios (RN) obtained with a high quality, narrowband scanning spectrophotometer. The RB vs RN relationship for each photometer is entered into the instrument’s software, providing discrete, real-time pH observations from measurements of RB, salinity and temperature. Measurement accuracy is assessed through comparisons of photometer pH with pH observations obtained using standard measurement procedures and high-quality spectrophotometers. The targeted user-groups for these instruments include middle and high school students, citizen scientists, and resource managers.

TI  - Self-optimisation of automated continuous reactors
AB  - The optimisation of problematic reaction steps in the synthesis of a drug compound is crucial for pharmaceutical process development. In recent traditions, this has carried out using design of experiments (DoE), which shows the key reaction variables and provides optimum reaction conditions. The process can require a lot of experiments and be time and resource consuming. The speed of optimisation experiments can be increased by using automated platforms complete with online analysis, which carry out reactions and acquire analytical samples without any human intervention. If these experiments can be carried out in continuous reactors then they will benefit from faster kinetics, enhanced heat and mass transfer, improved safety and higher productivity over their batch counterparts. An automated self-optimising flow reactor combines a continuous reactor with online analysis and feedback loop. The feedback loop contains full computerised control and monitoring of all equipment as well as a minimising algorithm, which will use the results from the online analysis to predict new optimum conditions. The technique has been shown to optimise the synthesis of small organic compounds but has, so far, yet to be widely used in pharmaceutical process development. This thesis has improved self-optimising technologies in order to make it a useful technique in pharmaceutical process development. First, the final bond forming step in the synthesis of an active pharmaceutical ingredient was optimised for yield. Studies were primarily carried out on a model compound in order to establish the correct reactor setup before transferring to the active compound, which found an optimum yield of 89%. The work also provided mechanistic evidence for generation of impurities. Next, response surface models were successfully fitted to the data obtained from a branch and fit algorithm optimisation of a Claisen-Schmidt condensation. In depth statistical calculations show how DoE models can be generated from self-optimisation data with good fit and predictability (R2 > 0.95, Q2 > 0.90), and with the aid of commercial DoE software. Further work developed the use of direct mass spectrometry (MS) as the online analytical method. The short method times and real-time analysis of MS allowed a steady state detection function to be built, followed by a linear calibration model of all the species in the amidation of a methyl ester. The reaction was optimised for yield using branch and fit algorithm, and DoE, with excellent agreement between the two techniques in both optimum conditions and responses. Finally, changes were made to the optimisation program to reduce the amount of material required for automated optimisations. Reaction pulses of sub-reactor volumes were pumped through the reactor, dispersed in a continuous phase of miscible solvent. Residence time distribution experiments were carried out to characterise the dispersion of the reactor and calculate the minimum reactor pulse volume. Optimisations were primarily carried out using pattern search algorithm and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, the latter of which generated a three target function optimum, reducing the amount of waste by 81%. Overall this work has shown how self-optimisation can be a valuable tool for pharmaceutical process development. The existing technique has been improved by demonstrating its use in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, combining it with existing DoE techniques, adding new forms of online analysis, and reducing the amount of material required to deliver a multi-target optimum.

TI  - Thermal adaptation of thalassiosira pseudonana using experimental evolution approaches
AB  - Diatoms contribute about 50% of global primary production and are on of the most diverse phytoplankton groups. Additionally, they form the basis of most marine food webs and play an important role in elemental cycles such as carbon and silica. Global warming impacts the diversity and productivity of marine ecosystems as temperature is considered a strong selecting agent underpinning global diversity patterns of marine phytoplankton. In order to gain insights into diatom distribution and diversity in the Atlantic Ocean, we analysed 18S rDNA ribotypes over a broad spatial scale from the Fram Strait to the South Atlantic. Diversity patterns were related to environmental metadata in order to identify main drivers. Our results indicate that salinity had a negative effect on diatom diversity in the Fram Strait transect with stations showing low diversity at high salinities. In contrast, diatom diversity in the Atlantic Ocean was negatively correlated to temperature with high temperature showing low diatom diversity. The order of Coscinodiscales showed a, formerly unknown, cosmopolitan distribution and was the overall most abundant species. With this study we provided an updated estimate of diatom distribution and diversity in the Atlantic Ocean. Phytoplankton physiology is highly temperature dependent and despite the importance of temperature as a major driver of marine phytoplankton evolution, the molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution under temperature selection are largely unknown but instrumental for predicting how marine phytoplankton will respond to a changing ocean. Here we provide evidence, based on experimental evolution experiments with the marine model diatom Thalassisoria pseudonana that thermal tolerance can rapidly evolve within 300 generations. Our results indicate that upper and lower temperature limits were fixed, however temperature optima for growth shifted towards the selection temperature. Furthermore, temperature had a significant impact on average cell diameter, bSi content and cellular stoichiometry (C:N:P). Physiological adaptation to high temperature was underpinned by differential expression of genes related to protein metabolism (protein binding and folding), and down-regulation of mismatch repair mechanisms potentially causing a high number of SNPs in the genome. Furthermore, several transposable elements showed strong, temperature specific up-regulation suggesting epigenetic enabled genome plasticity. Our results highlight the relation of adaptive pheno- and genotypes driven by temperature selection. This knowledge is key to our understanding of how the environment shapes the evolution of microbes and the biogeochemical processes they drive.

TI  - Synthesis and characterisation of barium titanate nanoparticles for second harmonic generation applications
AB  - This thesis presents findings of hydrothermally synthesised barium titanate nanoparticles for biomarker applications. Hydrothermal barium titanate (H-BT) and barium strontium titanate (H-BST) nanoparticles were successfully synthesised and were characterised for their second harmonic generation applications. X-Ray powder diffraction (laboratory and synchrotron) highlighted that H-BT and H-BST had a mixed tetragonal and cubic phase fraction present by Rietveld peak fitting analysis. Regardless of the phase fractions present, all nanoparticles emitted SHG (including a commercial cubic BaTiO3 sample that appeared cubic by XRD). The smaller sized H-BST nanoparticles (45 nm) required an increase in incident laser power compared to the H-BT sample (~140 nm). The phase of the nanoparticles and origin of SHG was investigated by electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy and high resolution HAADF-STEM imaging. In-situ electron diffraction of barium titanate showed that the tetragonal diffraction pattern transformed to a cubic pattern when heated above the Curie point. The phase transition was also investigated by EELS measurements of the Ti-L3 edge t2g-eg peak separation at room temperature and 400 oC showing the reduction in t2g-eg peak separation when the sample transforms from a tetragonal to cubic phase. The surface of the nanoparticles also showed an atomically rough layer with incomplete unit cells, and the ‘bulk’ of the nanoparticles showed random Ti-atom distortions by HAADF-STEM Ti-atom displacement analysis. This suggests the origin of SHG is likely to be both a cause of surface roughness and local asymmetric distortions in the nanoparticle bulk. The hydrothermally prepared and PLL-coated nanoparticles were measured to assess the cell viability and DNA damage of cells after a 24-hour exposure. The nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering to understand the behaviour of uncoated and PLL-coated nanoparticles suspended in different media. The uncoated nanoparticles showed little reduction in cell viability and genotoxicity, whereas the PLL coated nanoparticles showed a reduction in cell viability and a failed comet assay at concentrations ≥10 µg/mL. The nanoparticles were confirmed to be taken up into the cells by electron microscopy of critically point dried and resin embedded cell sections. Cryo-TEM of the H-BT-PLL nanoparticles suspended at 100 µg/mL in complete cell culture media showed that some nanoparticles were coated with a calcium phosphate coating and others not. This resulted in, either cells having a direct exposure to PLL and positively charged nanoparticles, or all the calcium was removed from the media that is required for cell signalling pathways which could lead to a reduction in cell viability.

TI  - Paling in Comparison: The Role of Sex and Temperature in Melanin-Based Immune Function
SP  - 51
AB  - Sex differences in disease susceptibility have been observed across a wide range of species, yet we lack a strong understanding of how environmental context influences these patterns. In this thesis, I take a life-history approach to investigating the plasticity of immunological sex differences in insects. Insects rely on the pigment melanin for both immune function and the structure and coloration of the cuticle (i.e. integument). Although many studies have shown evidence of correlations between immunity and cuticle pigmentation, most do not take into account the many potential modes of selection acting on cuticle melanism. Given that the biochemical precursors of melanin are a common currency in thermoregulation, sexual ornamentation, and immune function in insects, we hypothesized that sex differences in melanin-based resource allocation contribute to sex differences in immunity, and that the thermal environment will moderate this influence. My thesis work focused on the interactive effects of sexual selection and thermal selection on cuticle melanism and immunity in the Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus). After rearing crickets under multiple temperatures, we found, as predicted, that females invested more in immunity, males invested more in cuticle melanism, and both immune function and cuticle melanism were reduced in individuals that developed under warmer temperatures. Our results suggest that sex-specific investment in melanin corresponds with sex differences in immunity and that thermoregulation may act as an immune constraint under high temperatures, thus regulating the extent to which males and females diverge in disease susceptibility. By quantifying melanin-based traits underlying strategies for both reproduction and survival in insects, this study sheds light onto the selective forces shaping sex differences in immunity and insect life-history in general.

The goal of this project was to expand upon the current scientific knowledge base for Cisco within Eastern Lake Ontario [ELO] by providing an up-to-date assessment of the current status of this population. This thesis focusses on two distinct topics, each related to a distinct natural history characteristic of the ELO Cisco population that could represent a factor limiting population recovery in this region: fisheries-induced alterations to life-history traits, and fluctuations in year-class strength. In order to identify whether fisheries-induced change has occurred in this population, I compared the size-at-age and maturation of the ELO population both before [1926-1928] and after [1992-2016] the collapse of the fishery. The modern population had larger body sizes at a given age compared to the historical group, as well as a lower age-at-maturity [size-at-maturity remained similar]. It appears as though Cisco within the historical population may have been experiencing fisheries-induced selection in size-at-age, with potential recovery of this trait occurring in the modern population after a reduction in fishing pressure. This suggests that Cisco have a high capacity for adaptation through either phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary change. To assess patterns in year-class strength [YCS] within the ELO population, I used a residual catch-curve method to first calculate relative YCS, and then used linear models to correlate any fluctuations in YCS with environmental variables [temperature, ice cover, wind velocity]. The ELO population of Cisco demonstrated high variability in YCS, and only the timing of first consistent ice cover appeared to be correlated with these fluctuations. The environmental conditions influencing YCS in Lake Ontario may be different from those acting in other Great Lakes, highlighting the importance of local assessment. Advancing our knowledge of Cisco life-history within Lake Ontario provides important insights into the current condition of this population, which could have potential implications for future rehabilitation in this region.

TI  - The Potential of Green Roofs to Provide Habitat for Native Plant Conservation
SP  - 188
AB  - Many species have lost their natural habitat due to anthropogenic land use change. Ecologists are increasingly looking at habitat in cities to bolster efforts to conserve biodiversity. Green roofs are examples of urban habitats that are becoming more common globally. Green roofs can provide resources to support life in an otherwise inhospitable space. However, the harsh abiotic conditions found on green roofs preclude many species from establishing and persisting. Typically, non-native succulent species are planted on green roofs because of their ability to survive and provide beneficial ecosystem services to humans. However, greater support for biodiversity could be achieved with an increased diversity of plants. To support the fullest range of biodiversity possible, green roofs would support species diversity, community diversity, and genetic diversity. In my dissertation, I aim to determine if green roofs can contribute to all three aspects of biodiversity and thereby aid in the conservation of native plant species in cities. The first two chapters of my dissertation examine how species diversity on green roofs changes over time and which traits plant species possess to help them to survive for many generations. I hypothesized that the diversity of unmanaged plants and arthropods on green roofs would change in a deterministic pattern and be affected by abiotic factors. I also hypothesized that persistent plant populations would possess similar traits that contributed to stress tolerance. I used long-term vegetation surveys and collected plant and arthropod data from a 1–93 year chronosequence of green roofs in northeast Germany to addresses these hypotheses. I found that the plant and animal diversities did not change on green roofs in predictable ways but that site conditions such as substrate depth and water infiltration may affect how many species are present. Functional diversity explained more of the patterns in the vegetation than species diversity alone, as over time green roofs became dominated with plants that shared similar traits. Persistent species tended to have traits to tolerate stress and repeated disturbance. Together, these results highlight the need to carefully consider the characteristics of species that are originally planted, and continue to manage green roofs to support a rich diversity of both plants and arthropods. The third and fourth chapters of my dissertation address the potential for green roofs to support greater community diversity by experimentally testing a proposed habitat analog approach. This approach looks to mimic natural plant communities with abiotic properties similar to those of green roofs. I surveyed dry prairies in northeast Illinois and attempted to mimic the cover of the most common species on green roofs with both continuous substrate and modular trays. The plant communities from the most analogous habitat were the most successful at establishing in the continuous substrate, supporting my hypothesis that a habitat analog approach can promote community diversity. However, green roofs are typically built to provide ecosystem services to humans and do not typically consider biodiversity support the main priority. Therefore, I also evaluated the ability of the native plant communities to provide the ecosystem services of stormwater retention and thermal insulation and compared their performance to commonly planted non-native succulent Sedum species. I found that the industry standard Sedum communities provided more thermal insulation but that native prairie communities absorbed more stormwater and could release it quickly to be ready for more rain. I, therefore, suggest that a combination of native plants and non-native succulents might be best to maximize green roof function that includes both ecosystem services and biodiversity support. The fifth chapter of my dissertation uses a two-part study to address how genetic diversity can be supported on green roofs. I used neutral alleles at ten microsatellite loci to compare the genetic diversity of a self-compatible forb, Penstemon hirsutus, between natural prairie populations and established green roof populations. I hypothesized that the green roof populations started from nursery stock would fail to capture the full amount of genetic diversity that was found in natural populations because commercially produced plants tend to underrepresent the genetic diversity found in the wild. My hypothesis was supported, although the sampled natural populations had higher inbreeding than the populations on the green roofs. In the case of self-compatible species like P. hirsutus, pollinators are necessary to maximize gene flow by carrying pollen between populations. But previous work has found that some pollinators are lacking on green roofs, especially the small bees that pollinate P. hirsutus . Therefore, for the second part of this study, I measured the degree of inbreeding between ten parental green roof populations and their offspring and conducted a paternity analysis to measure the frequency with which bees move pollen between populations.

TI  - Temperature Effects on the Routine Metabolic Rates of Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) Eggs, Alevin and Fry: Implications for Climate Change
SP  - 142
AB  - Early developmental stages of cold-adapted ectotherms such as brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are at risk of mortality with increasing water temperatures because of their sensitivity to changes in their environment. I studied the mass and routine metabolic rate (RMR) of wild-origin brook trout eggs, alevin and young fry reared at normal (5°C) and elevated (9°C) temperatures for the duration of the study or at mismatched temperatures. This setup determined if preconditioning acclimation for one temperature benefits or hinders the organism later in life. Three levels of biological organization (ancestry, population, family) were studied using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) to identify models that best accounted for variation in the data. Family, mass and temperature were most important in predicting body mass and mass-adjusted RMR, although population and ancestral-level differences were also detected at some life stages. Strong variation in body mass and mass-adjusted RMR among families may indicate adaptive potential within brook trout populations to respond to increases in water temperature with climate change.

TI  - Demographic Processes in Forest Trees in the Rocky Mountains
SP  - 156
AB  - Forests provide numerous ecological and economic services including regulation of biogeochemical cycles, fiber production, watershed protection, as well as less tangible aesthetic and recreational benefits. Forests are being substantially altered by a range of consumptive uses related to expanding human population and economies. Superimposed on other anthropogenic impacts is global climate change. Global circulation models unambiguously reveal the role of greenhouse gas forcings associated with industrial processes in driving global temperature trends (Hanson et al. 2005). Meteorological observations indicate that global mean temperature has increased by approximately 0.6 °C over the past century relative to a base 1951 to 1980 period, with record high temperatures occurring in 2010. Paleoclimatic reconstructions based on proxy data indicate that modern rates of warming may be unprecedented in the context of the past 1000 years. Rates of warming are geographically heterogeneous. Temperature anomalies in the Rocky Mountain ecoregion, for example, are 2?3 times higher than the global mean temperature increase. Some models and observational data suggest that temperature trends are elevation dependent with greater warming at high altitudes and with greater increases in daily minimum temperatures than maximum temperatures. Documented increases in minimum temperature is associated with earlier spring thaw events, driven by minimum temperatures that exceed 0 °C and a lengthening of the growing and fire seasons. In the Rocky Mountains, an altered climate system is projected to result in a higher frequency and intensity of drought events. Precipitation over the previous 100 years lacks clear trends across the region as a whole, but models of snow water equivalent (SWE) indicate declining moisture availability since the mid-20th century. Early spring snowmelt and warming driven increases in rates of evapotranspiration may correlate with reduced stream flow and declines in effective soil moisture late in the growing season. Warming temperatures and reductions in moisture availability have been associated with significant increases in area burned by wildfire in some forest systems, particularly at high elevations where climate variability rather than fuel conditions is the primary driver of fire activity. Changing climate may also be expanding the ranges and altering the dynamics of forest insects, such as the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), resulting in extensive tree mortality. The recent widespread acceptance of climate change has highlighted the need for regional and species specific adaptation strategies. However, a lack of reliable projections describing the responses of organisms and communities to climate change has been identified as a major impediment to the development and implementation of climate adaptation strategies within federal agencies. Potential vegetation responses include migration to track preferred habitats or adaptation through phenotypic or genetic plasticity. Heat stress and prolonged drought have been associated with rapid shifts in the range limits of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and in significantly elevated rates of background tree mortality for tree species and forest environments worldwide. Mortality events associated with physiological stress or environmental disturbances may accelerate changes in the distributions of long-lived tree species that might otherwise persist in sub-optimal environments. The distribution and abundance of plants are largely determined by physiological, life history, and ecosystem processes, and how these processes interact or respond to climate. A mechanistic understanding of these processes and their physiological thresholds is required to accurately predict forest response to climate change. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group has argued that current predictive vegetation models are limited by a failure to adequately quantify relationships between climate, critical life history processes, and disturbance regimes. The main objective of this research is to quantify life history processes for select tree species in the Rocky Mountain ecoregion. Specifically, non-linear regression models will be developed to quantify variation in both tree fecundity and growth as a function of climate variables, edaphic gradients, and competition. Comprehensive field data will be used to train flexible functions in a maximum likelihood framework. Competing models representing alternative hypotheses will be evaluated using information theory. The overarching objective of this project is to provide detailed quantitative life history information that may subsequently be used to parameterize dynamic simulation models for the prediction of forest response to alternative future climate scenarios. An additional component of this research involves the reconstruction of historical temperatures in the southern portion of the Rocky Mountain ecoregion using chronologies of radial growth from several high elevation tree species occurring in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Historical temperatures have been reconstructed for northern portions of the Rocky Mountain ecoregion. A comparable reconstruction for the southern portion of the region has not been developed. Global climate models predict that parts of the Rockies may experience future climates with no previous analogs. Historical temperature reconstructions based on proxy indicators will provide historical context for both modern climate variation and simulations of future conditions.

TI  - Resilient Cities of the Future Utilizing Natural Intelligence to Retrofit the Urban Systems
SP  - 95
AB  - Accentuated by the industrial revolution, the climate change is aging our cities, which are now facing an ecological, economical, and political imbalance resulting into the degraded quality of urban living. Not only has global warming altered the earth’s natural patterns, but it also altered the economic and socio-cultural urban patterns. With the growing needs of rapidly expanding urban population due to the industrial revolution, the cities underwent unplanned sprawling of urban agglomerations. However, our globalized economic system has evolved the way we live, work, and play, transforming the modern infrastructure growth models significantly. Our architects, urban planners, and policy makers are powered by the environmental scientist’s years of research and analysis, yet are struggling to replenish the post-industrial age rust belt mayhem with sustainable solutions. As the transition from industrial to ecological age become eminent, by investigating into the natural intelligence’s survival techniques, we could extract practical solutions to using clean and renewable energy systems to support life. This thesis aims at analyzing the current trends in redesigning and retrofitting the urban-systems with the eco-systems at the micro- and macro-scales, thus providing with sustainable solutions to the new city center of the sixth largest town in Canada, Mississauga. Caused by rapid urbanization, population growth & migration, increased emission of green house gases, and overuse & pollution, our deteriorating infrastructure is grappling for mitigation against climate change, and global warming. Using natural intelligence to shift from linear to a closed loop system, the solutions provided herein aims at increasing the infrastructure’s resource efficiency and changing from fossil fuel to solar economy. Catalyzed by the proposed Midwestern high-speed rail line, the project in Mississauga (Ontario, Canada) seeks to introduce the hybrid, mixed-use, transit oriented development to instigate the shift towards eco-cities. These intermodal transit infrastructure aims to bring a strategically sustainable change at a neighborhood scale, thus eventually refurbishing the entire city, one territory at a time. The idea of these utopian cities may seem unachievable at a larger scale, but the cities like Hammarby Sjöstad, Tianjin, and Dongtan seem to lead, inspire, and equip the ignorant with their sustainable approach to growth. By transitioning towards an ecological age, there seems a way to negating the effects of human induced climate change, and make our planet sustainable for the future generations to survive.

TI  - Salmonella's Desiccation Survival and Thermal Tolerance: Genetic, Physiological, and Metabolic Factors
SP  - 279
AB  - Salmonella can survive for long periods under extreme desiccation and low water activity conditions (aw < 0.6) while becoming tolerant to heat. This stress tolerance poses a risk for food safety, but relatively little is known about the molecular and cellular processes involved in this adaptation mechanism and its potential for cross-protection. This dissertation consists of three distinct studies focused on elucidating this mechanism. The objective of the first study was to identify the genes involved in Salmonella’s resistance to desiccation. A global transcriptomic analysis comparing S. enterica serovar Typhimurium cells equilibrated to low aw (aw 0.11) and cells equilibrated to high aw (aw 1.0) determined that 719 genes (16% of the total number of genes in the genome) were differentially expressed between the two conditions. The genes that were up-regulated at aw 0.11 (290) were mostly involved in metabolic pathways, DNA replication/repair, regulation of transcription and translation, and virulence. Based on the transcriptomic analysis, we created deletion mutants for two virulence genes, sseD and sopD, and tested their ability to survive desiccation and low aw on glass beads. The two mutants exhibited significant cell viability reductions after desiccation compared to the wild-type and additional decrease after exposure to aw 0.11 for 7 days. Under scanning electron microscopy, the mutants displayed a different cell morphology and extracellular matrix production when compared to the wild-type under the same conditions. The findings of this study suggested that sopD and sseD are required for Salmonella’s survival during desiccation. The objective of the second study was to determine the effect of food and inert matrices, nutrient availability, and growth conditions on desiccation survival and thermal tolerance of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Salmonella was grown in LBglc and M9 media, in the presence or absence of EDTA and dipyridyl. Cultures were inoculated on toasted oat cereal (TOC) or glass beads, dried, and equilibrated for a week at aw 0.11 and 1.0, before being thermally treated at 75, 85, 90, and 95°C. For all growth conditions and temperatures tested, cells exposed to aw 0.11 had inactivation rates (δ-values) at least 10-fold longer than cells equilibrated at aw 1.0. Our results showed that growth in the presence of EDTA or Dipyridyl did not have any effect on Salmonella ’s thermal tolerance at either aw on TOC. In control conditions, recovery after drying and thermal tolerance was higher on TOC than on glass beads, suggesting that the food matrix was protective for desiccation and thermal treatment. Growth in M9 resulted in lower survival to drying and exposure to low aw on glass beads, compared to LBglc. On the contrary, thermal tolerance increased in cells grown in M9 compared to LBglc at both aw. Cells grown in LBglc and M9 displayed differences in the production of extracellular matrix, in particular during equilibration to aw 0.11 and after thermal treatment at both aw. Additionally, when Salmonella was grown on glass beads in LBglc as biofilm, the thermal tolerance was greater than free cells dried on beads. Our observations suggest that the presence of nutrients during growth and before exposure to desiccation and thermal treatment influenced Salmonella’s ability to survive desiccation and develop thermal tolerance. The objective of the third study was to identify proteins involved in Salmonella’s resistance to desiccation and thermal treatment using iTRAQ. Proteins were extracted from S. enterica servorar Typhimurium cells dried, equilibrated at high aw (1.0) and low aw (0.11), and thermally treated at 75°C. Our analysis determined that 734 proteins were differentially expressed among samples, and of these 175 proteins were the most significant in determining differences in the proteomic profiles among treatments. Based on their proteomic expression profiles, the samples were clustered in two main groups by PCA analysis, “dry” samples and “wet” samples, while we did not observe significant differences between the thermally treated samples and the non-heated samples, at both aw. Protein profiles indicated shifts in cell metabolism in both samples, as well as a strict regulation of DNA repair, replication, transcription, and translation. “Dry” samples had higher levels of 50S and 30S ribosomal proteins, indicating that ribosomal proteins might be important for extra-ribosomal regulation of cellular response even when the synthesis of proteins is slowed down. Stress response proteins were more frequently present in “wet” samples compared to “dry” samples, including SspA, GorA, and Dps, suggesting that “wet” cells were activating stress systems in response to rehydration. In conclusion, our study indicated that pre-adaptation to dry conditions was linked to increased thermal tolerance, while reversion from a dry state into a wet state implied a significant change in protein expression that is linked with reduced thermal tolerance.

TI  - The Role of Seasonal and Geographic Temperature Variation in the Life Cycle of the Clonal Sea Anemone Diadumene Lineata (Verrill)
SP  - 121
AB  - Clonality is the general term that encompasses all manner of pinching, splitting, budding, and fragmenting behaviors by which organisms divide their somatic body tissues into more or less independent units. It can be as straight forward as fragments of a sponge surviving after being rent apart by a hurricane or as convoluted as the telescoping generations of parthenogenic aphids. Clonality is a widespread feature of animal life cycles and the degree of clonal investment is expected to affect everything from spatial genotypic and genetic structure to evolutionary dynamics and ecology interactions. Yet, the shear diversity and complexity of clonal behavior has hampered efforts to develop a general understanding of how and why clonality evolves as the adaptive benefits of these behaviors may be as idiosyncratic as the mechanisms by which cloning occurs. Contrary to some past formulations of the problem, the production of clonal progeny is not typically an alternative to sexual reproduction, as most clonal organisms also reproduce sexually. While there is often an immediate tradeoff where a unit of energy can either be invested in gametes or clonal progeny at any given time, there is not inherently a tradeoff between asexual and sexual reproduction over the span of a lifetime. Dividing somatic tissue in to separate units can be a way of increasing total lifetime fecundity by increasing total biomass, more efficiently colonizing open space or promoting longevity by spreading the risk of mortality over spatially-separated somatic units. With this perspective, understanding the adaptive value of clonality becomes a matter of analyzing the holistic suite of fitness effects that arise from variation in allocating energy among unitary growth, clonal propagation and gametogenesis. The amount of energy available and the fitness value of a particular investment strategy are governed in large part by the environment and so understanding the environmental context is key to understanding the forces shaping life cycle evolution. Temperature, in particular, affects the metabolic cost of maintaining body tissues and is key in determining the energetically optimal body size for a unitary animal. Where temperatures fluctuate seasonally or where clonal replicates may spread across a heterogeneous landscape, the reaction norm of fission rate, body size or traits associated with gamete production may be an important target of selection, influencing which life cycle patterns can evolve. In this dissertation I examine the influence of seasonal and geographic temperature variation on fission rate, body size and gamete production of the clonal sea anemone, Diadumene lineata (Verrill 1869), to better understand the constraints and tradeoffs that govern the evolution of resource allocation strategy; and ultimately, the factors that drive the evolution of clonality in this species. Through a combination of laboratory experiments, field observations, optimality modeling and genetic tools I demonstrate that (1) fission rates are strongly temperature dependent, resulting in seasonal and geographic variation in clonal behavior, (2) the production of gametes is closely tied to body size and shows an inverse latitudinal pattern with fission rate, (3) the observed reaction norm of fission rate with temperature is consistent with selection to maximize gamete production across the locally experienced range of temperatures, as opposed to selection for maximum clonal proliferation, per se, and (4) there is a latitudinal decrease in genotypic richness and diversity that corresponds with changes in fission rate, suggesting that variation in fission rate leads to changes in the spatial structure of genetic variation among sites. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that clonality is adaptive under conditions where individual body size is constrained by the environment. Under these conditions more gametes may be produced over a lifetime by genets dividing somatic tissue into multiple small units rather than remaining a single large unit. In this species, there is an immediate cost to dividing a large body into two pieces as the number of gametes produced by two small individuals sums to less than those produced by a large individual, yet, the lost reproductive potential may be able to be compensated for over time by an increased growth rate at a smaller body size. Additional costs and benefits imposed by changes in mortality rate, competitive ability or mate choice as fission rate changes remain to be investigated and may be equally important in understanding and predicting the evolution of clonal behavior in this and other species.

TI  - Geographic and Seasonal Effects on Community Compositions and Functional Traits of Frugivorous Drosophila and Leptopilina Parasitoids
SP  - 207
AB  - One of the most important processes driving adaptive evolution and diversification of organisms is ecological interactions among species. Geographic and temporal variation in intra- and interspecific interactions among species then can result in diverse geographic patterns of coevolution. In my dissertation, I explored how species interaction may play the role driving future coevolution is host-parasitoid system. Frugivorous Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) and its Leptopilina parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) were used as a study system. I carried out a large field study to characterize the Drosophila host - Leptopilina parasitoid community composition in the Eastern North America. As part of characterization of the community compositions, I first reviewed and described three previously undescribed species in eastern North American Leptopilina species. In total, 32 Drosophila species and six Leptopilina species were documented. Second, I characterized the Drosophila host - Leptopilina parasitoid community composition across geographic locations and between the breeding seasons. The result showed species diversity of both host and parasitoids were higher in the northern sites compared to the southern sites, and latitude was the main factor structuring the community composition of both hosts and parasitoids. Moreover, species co-occur in my community data indicated potential species interaction. Third, I investigated if geographic/seasonal variation in functional traits were correlated with local host-parasitoid community diversity or environmental factors. I used body size and ovipositor related traits of L. boulardi as example. Mean body size displayed larger in the North than in the South sites, and also larger in the late breeding season than in the early season. Because larger parasitoids typically have greater fat storage, this pattern may be adaptive in northern sites to enhance overwinter survival. The result also showed body size of L. boulardi was not correlated with host-parasitoid species diversity, but negatively correlated with thermal environments. Moreover, the width of the ovipositor but not ovipositor length varied geographically and was positively correlated with host adult size. The functional significance of this trait is not known, however it may allow the wasp to attack larger, more active larvae, or the host larvae with thicker cuticles. My data lay the groundwork for future studies to test the geographic mosaic theory of coevolution.

TI  - Essays in Economic Development
SP  - 148
AB  - The dissertation consists of three essays: “Benefits of diversification in agriculture: Evidence from Malawi”, “Corruption and economic growth revisited” and “How close is your government to its people? Worldwide indicators on localization and decentralization”. All three essays focus on issues, which are particularly important for developing countries: food security, corruption, decentralization. In the first essay I use data from a farmers’ survey in Malawi to compare two agricultural technologies: monoculture maize and crop diversification (maize-legume intercrop). I match farmers locations with data on rainfall and air temperature to test whether more biodiverse agriculture is better at absorbing weather shocks. The data make it possible to compare variation not only over time, but also over different plots within the same time period, which helps reduce omitted variable bias. The instrumental variable method is used to eliminate rainfall measurement error. For a number of specifications, and controlling for fertilizer use, crop diversification is both more productive than monoculture maize and more resistant to weather shocks. Although I am not able to identify the average population effect, I show that the effect I identify is likely to prevail if the Malawian government decides to shift the focus of its agricultural subsidy at the margin from fertilizer to legume seeds and education. The focus of the second essay is on corruption. While literature finds many channels through which corruption can hurt economic growth, the link proved hard to establish in empirical cross-country studies. In this paper I show that part of the explanation of this puzzle is that there is a reverse causality: everything else equal, exogenously-driven economic growth can increase corruption. The reason is that the boost to output increases tax revenue, and hence pool of resources that corrupt public officials can embezzle. I show the workings of this channel in a simple stylized model, which is then accompanied by numerical simulations in a dynamic general equilibium overlapping-generations model, which allows for corruption and tax evasion. I also present empirical evidence, which supports my findings. The third chapter assembles and analyzes a unique data base on local governance that provides a first approximation of the institutional architecture of local governance that has emerged as a result of the silent revolution (decentralization reforms) of the last three decades on moving governments closer to people. An important feature of this data set is that, for comparative purposes, it measures government decision making at the local level i.e. the order of government that is closest to the people and hence providing a better indicator of decentralized decision making as compared to the "sub-national governments" that also include intermediate tiers of provinces and states, used by the existing literature. This unique data set for 182 countries attempts to capture institutional dimensions of political, fiscal and administrative autonomy enjoyed by local governments under diverse multi-order governance regimes using a common framework. These dimensions are aggregated to develop a "decentralization index" and then adjusted for heterogeneity to develop a "government closeness index" that provides an overall ranking of countries on the closeness of their government to the people.

TI  - The Genetic Architecture Underlying Rapid Seasonal Evolution in Natural Populations of Drosophila Melanogaster
SP  - 228
AB  - The rate and tempo at which populations respond to environmental change is fundamental in understanding the adaptive process. Evolution is generally considered to be a gradual process and it is unclear if populations can adapt rapidly to environmental selection pressures. Annual seasonal rhythms produce rapid, predictable environmental changes that may result in rapid adaptation in multivoltine species that reproduce multiple times each year. This work demonstrates that Drosophila melanogaster adapts rapidly and predictably to seasonal environmental changes across five years and multiple locations. Suites of complex fitness traits change in a predictable way over the 10–15 generations from spring to fall. After surviving the harsh environmental selection of the winter, the spring flies are characterized by a increased investment in somatic maintainance: higher resistance to thermal stress, higher tolerance to pathogenic infection, faster development time and better learning. These traits decline throughout the summer when ripening fruit is abundant due to correlated trade-offs with reproduction. Parallel changes in G-matrixes over this seasonal timescale counters the basic assumption of stable covariance over time and indicates that selection acts rapidly to alter the genetic architecture of a population. We show that there are alleles that have functional effects on these important life history traits that oscillate in frequency as a function of seasonal time, but that non-additive epistatic interactions are prevalent and shape the genetic architecture of change across seasonal time. Functional analysis of candidate genes shows that epistatic interactions among seasonally oscillating alleles facilitate rapid adaptation by producing emergent fitness phenotypes. Together, these findings demonstrate rapid, repeatable adaptation to abiotic and biotic environmental parameters that cycle as a function of seasonal time. Epistatic interactions within and among genes facilitate the rapid evolutionary change that is occurring over timescales previously considered static.

TI  - The Evolutionary Consequences of the Transition to Non-bloodfeeding in the Pitcher Plant Mosquito Wyeomyia smithii
SP  - 78
AB  - The pitcher plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii maintains a broad geographic range from the Gulf of Mexico to central Canada, and throughout its range is genetically and phenotypically variable, though fully interfertile. Many of the traits that vary across the broad range of this mosquito owe their diversity to selection on populations, which maximize fitness in the unique environment in which each populations finds itself. While a diversity of traits vary by latitude and merit the interest of evolutionary biologists, including critical photoperiod, voltinism, and thermal tolerance, of interest in the following thesis is the variation in blood-feeding propensity within this single species of mosquito. In no other mosquito species are some populations obligate non-biters while in other populations willingly hematophagous. This thesis explores the evolutionary transition from biting to non-biting in the pitcher plant mosquito at multiple levels of biological integration, starting first by establishing a heritable basis for the transition, then moving to the fitness and life historical consequences of both the natural system and of a line artificially selected in the lab. The latter half of this thesis moves on to probe the genetic architecture underlying the shift in phenotype and ends after examining the transition to non-biting at the level of the gene using an RNA-sequencing experiment. The results stemming from this thesis are thoroughly discussed: in short, we find that fitness differs between biting and non-biting populations, that complex genetic architectures underlie the transition to non-biting in nature, but not under artificial selection, and finally, that many candidate loci are differentially regulated in biting populations relative to non-biting populations and that these loci most often cluster with metabolic biological pathways.

TI  - The Ecology and Evolution of Top-down and Bottom-up Control in Mountain Lakes
SP  - 117
AB  - Determining factors that control how biomass is distributed among plants, animals, microbes and non-living components of ecosystems is a major goal of ecology. Theoretical and empirical work have demonstrated that ecosystem structure and function may vary with the environment, but studies often overlook the role of adaptation and shifts in species composition that will occur over longer timescales relevant to climate change. For my doctoral research I used a ‘natural experiment’ in Sierra Nevada mountain lakes to ask questions about the strength of top-down and bottom-up forcing in a natural system where communities have assembled and adapted to differences in the environment over periods from years to millennia. In Chapter 1 I compare fish and fishless lakes along an elevational gradient, and show that an interaction between fish presence and temperature alters food web structure, ecosystem function, species and trait composition. Top-down forcing from fish on plankton biomass was stronger in warm lakes, suggesting that a warmer climate will magnify the effect of introduced predators on biomass distribution. Fish and warmer temperatures select for the same species and traits of zooplankton in lakes, suggesting that lakes containing invasive predators may be less sensitive to warming. In Chapter 2 I test this hypothesis using a large-scale community transplant experiment, where I transplanted plankton communities that assembled and evolved at different elevations and predator regimes to new elevations and the addition or removal of fish. I found that past exposure to fish caused an evolutionary response in keystone members of the zooplankton community that increased their fitness in environments without fish. This suggests that past selection can change how communities will respond to further environmental change. In Chapter 3, I show that bottom-up processes influence fish growth, with higher growth rates occurring in warmer, clearer lakes. My thesis helps to elucidate the effects of temperature and predators on physiology, evolution, species ranges and community interactions, which is necessary to forecast the response of ecosystems to climate change. My thesis integrates across these levels of organization to understand the origin of ecosystem resilience in a changing climate.

TI  - The Evolution and Genetic Control of Stress Tolerance in a Complex World
SP  - 186
AB  - Natural populations are highly complex and consist of genetically variable individuals that belong to continuously varying age classes. Genotype and age interact to determine how individuals respond to environmental stress, which ultimately determines the evolutionary trajectories and persistence of populations in variable environments. For small ectothermic species, seasonal and diurnal variation in temperature is an important source of environmental stress that impacts activity patterns and suites of phenotypes directly related to whole organism fitness. I used the genetic and ecological model Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the influence of seasonal and diurnal thermal variability on survival and reproduction in genetically diverse populations. First, I characterized changes in cold tolerance and phenotypic plasticity within a natural population as it responded to seasonal shifts in developmental and short-term acclimation and thermal selection. I found that seasonal variation in cold tolerance was significantly influenced by developmental acclimation that occurred in the field as well as in the lab, where flies that developed under warmer conditions had reduced cold tolerance relative to flies that developed under cooler conditions. Second, I characterized the effect of variation in age on stress response phenotypes in a genetically variable population. I measured genotype- and age-specific responses to multiple environmental stressors, and identified regions of the genome that were associated with age-specific stress tolerance. Genome-wide association mapping revealed that age-specific phenotypes were influenced by distinct sets of polymorphisms and genes, suggesting that the evolution of age-related decline in phenotypes is driven by mutation accumulation within phenotypes, but both mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy between phenotypes. Next, I characterized the costs and benefits of acclimation for survival and reproduction to understand how physiological and behavioral plasticity interact to determine fitness. I found that phenotypic plasticity and the capacity for acclimation significantly influenced behavioral reproductive success, but the thermal cues that led to adaptive acclimation response in survival also led to decreased reproductive success. However, genotypes with the capacity to acclimate were more likely to survive thermal variation and more likely to reproduce, suggesting that genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity has important implications for whole organism fitness. Finally, I measured the effect of acclimation on the induction of diapause and ability to survive cold stress in the recently introduced invasive species Drosophila suzukii. D. suzukii is endemic to Asia and was first detected in California in 2008 and in Topeka, KS in 2013. Its recent invasion history thus provides an interesting model to understand the role of plasiticy in the response to a novel and variable environment. I found that diapause was induced through a plastic response to acclimation and short photoperiod, though diapause was more drastically induced by acclimation. Overall, my research provides critical insights into how organisms respond to thermal variation by intergrating quantitative genetics, ecology, evolution, and life history tradeoffs. Collectively, my research demonstrates that the ability of organisms to survive thermal stress is a function of genetic capacity to tolerate stress, genetic capacity for phenotypic plasticity, prior exposure to thermal variation, and the age of the individual.

TI  - The Genetics of Adaptation of ssDNA Viruses
SP  - 135
AB  - The process of adaptive evolution is complex, determined in part by the set of beneficial muta- tions available to adapting populations, the distribution of their effects, and the extents to which pleiotropy and epistasis impact the relationships between genotype, phenotype, and fitness. As- sumptions about epistasis, pleiotropy, and the availability of beneficial mutations are made by theories and models of adaptation and determine their predictions. Through the experimental evolution of bacteriophages, we tested model assumptions and predictions about epistasis, hybrid viability, the causes of parallel evolution, the distribution of beneficial fitness effects, the genotype-fitness landscape, antagonistic pleiotropy, and the cost of complexity. We did this in an effort to answer standing questions in the study of evolution regarding the process of adaptation and the forces that govern it. To characterize the effects of epistasis on determining the viability and persistence of novel hybrids, we generated experimental hybrids of highly divergent and highly related pairs of phage strains. We found that incompatibilities resulting from disruption of favorable epistatic interactions within the genome manifested as fitness costs, even in very closely related genotypes, but that ancestral fitness levels could be recovered through only a handful of compensatory mutations. Remarkably, we found that by permitting movement over wide expanses of sequence space in a single step—coupled with subsequent adaptation—hybridization allowed one phage genotype to explore a substantially higher and previously inaccessible peak in its fitness landscape. Thus, if conditions permitted hybrid genotypes to persist long enough to allow for compensatory evolution, even very low fitness hybrids could be viable in populations with their ancestral genotypes, potentially facilitating the establishment of stable hybrid zones and the creation of new species. Competing selectionist and mutationist viewpoints argue that parallel evolution is the result of either selection repeatedly fixing the same, optimal adaptive solution to a recurring evolutionary problem or a product of mutational constraint presenting selection with a biased subset of potentially suboptimal adaptive strategies. To characterize the rate of parallel evolution and the underlying forces driving parallelism, we performed 20 replicate first steps of adaptation for four phage genotypes. We found parallel and convergent adaptation to be common at every level of biological organization both within and among genotypes, from the level of mutational effects to the levels of protein, gene, amino acid, and nucleotide substitution. We also found that contrary to expectations, the mutation of greatest benefit in each genotype was never the most frequently fixed, and only fixed once in each of two genotypes. Patterns of parallel evolution are often offered as strong evidence of adaptation. However, we found that parallelism was driven at least as much by mutational biases and constraints as by selection, indicating that frequent observations of parallel adaptive evolution in natural and experimental populations may not be driven primarily by selection, but rather by selection acting on a biased subset of all available mutations, possibly, as in the case with our results, yielding suboptimal adaptive outcomes. We also fit a distribution to the set of fitness effects for each set of 20 replicates. The form of the distribution of beneficial fitness effects shapes the predictions of models of adaptation and affects the properties of adaptive walks, particularly the average size of mutational steps and the likelihood of parallel evolution. We found that all four genotypes were best described by a distribution of beneficial fitness effects with a finite upper bound, conflicting with the assumption of some models that this distribution is exponential. In another experiment, we constructed double-mutant genotypes containing all possible pairings of three sets of five beneficial mutations generated under three different selective regimes: selection on growth rate only, selection on growth rate and thermal stability, and selection on growth rate and pH stability. The purpose of this experiment was to characterize patterns of pairwise epistasis for beneficial mutations, and in particular to measure interactions for each of the phenotypes underlying fitness. We found that mutations interacted antagonistically with regard to growth rate and fitness, in line with other recent work which has generally found a trend of antagonistic interactions between beneficial mutations. However, we found that mutations behaved on average more additively with regard to capsid stability. We concluded that mutations interact additively with regard to phenotype when considered at a basic, biophysical level, and that epistasis for fitness emerges from an intermediate phenotypic optimum and pleiotropy between its underlying phenotypes, manifested in adapting populations as a pattern of diminishing returns and antagonism between beneficial mutations. Finally, we performed adaptive walks for two pairs of wild-type and growth-optimized phage genotypes under selection on growth rate and capsid stability to test the hypotheses that adaptation of these two traits is constrained by antagonistic pleiotropy and that organisms evolving under complex environmental or selective pressures incur a cost of complexity manifested as a lower rate of adaptation. Despite expectations that antagonism would prevent optimization of growth rate and stability, both traits were significantly improved over the course of replicate adaptive walks. Additionally, we found no evidence for a cost of complexity, as the rate of adaptation under complex selection was actually higher than under simple selective conditions and did not require any additional mutational steps relative to one-trait selection. Our results indicated that increased organismal complexity, or an increase in the number of traits under selection, may not decrease an organism’s rate of adaptation, even when mutations affect all of the traits under selection simultaneously, contrary to model predictions.

TI  - Population and Family Effects on Gene Transcriptional Profiles of Eight Hybrid Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) Populations: Implications for Conservation and Aquaculture
SP  - 115
AB  - Aquaculture has been the fastest growing food industry worldwide since 1985 and has contributed significantly to the Canadian economy. Thus, methods for increasing aquaculture production are currently being investigated, such as selective breeding programs. Here I developed transcriptional profiles of eight hybrid half-sibling populations of Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and examined them for evidence of local adaptation and as a potential marker for marker-assisted selection method. I found evidence of local adaptation among the populations, further supporting this as a driving force behind the large variation witnessed in Chinook salmon life history variation. I used the transcriptional profiles developed for each population in the freshwater (juvenile) stage and tested for correlations with saltwater performance (growth rate and survival). I found significant correlations between saltwater performance factors and juvenile transcription, suggesting that saltwater performance in Chinook salmon can be predicted using freshwater transcription patterns. There were also significant correlations between freshwater and saltwater transcription, indicating possible mechanisms behind the correlation between freshwater and saltwater traits. Freshwater Chinook salmon transcriptional profiles are a promising novel marker for application in marker-assisted selection breeding programs in aquaculture. Overall, transcriptional profiling using selected known-function genes provide the ability to study both local adaptation and performance in Chinook salmon populations.

TI  - The Combined Effects of Increased Temperature and Ocean Acidification on the Early Life History Stages of Caribbean Coral and Its Implications for the Recovery Potential of Florida Reefs
SP  - 133
AB  - The early life history stages of coral are an essential component determining the recovery potential of coral reefs through sexual reproduction and recruitment. The pelagic larval phase is inherent in all coral species regardless of differing reproductive strategies and is the only time in coral life history where large scale movement is possible allowing for the repopulation of reef areas both within and outside the natal reef habitat. In the face of climate change, the larval dispersal and recruitment phase will take place in a warmer more acidic ocean if we continue on the path of unabated fossil fuel emissions. While much research has focused on how increased temperature or ocean acidification affect coral larvae independently, our understanding of how these factors interact to shape larval response is limited, especially in regards to Caribbean coral species. To gain a better understanding of how the early life history stages of Caribbean coral may be affected by climate change, this dissertation investigates the effects of increased temperature (2.5 °C above historical averages in the Florida Keys) and carbon dioxide levels (900–1000 parts per million CO2) on corals from the Florida Reef tract by investigating the effects on larval metabolism, survivorship, settlement, and post-settlement growth and survival. Additionally, a coupled biophysical model was developed to determine the potential changes in connectivity that may result from the biological effects of increased temperature and ocean acidification on the larval phase. The larval respiratory response of three Caribbean coral species revealed Orbicella faveolata as the most environmentally responsive with significant increases in respiration after 1 day exposure to increased temperature (68% greater than control conditions) with a counteracting effect of ocean acidification significantly decreasing respiration. The changes in metabolism over time correlated with decreased time to competency under elevated temperature in O. faveolata larvae, resulting in a greater number of settlers (76% greater than control) and a relative increase in local retention and self-recruitment rates as revealed by the biophysical model (5 and 7% greater than control respectively). However, when increased temperature occurred in combination with elevated CO2 levels, respiration was not significantly increased relative to control conditions and development of competency is minimally impacted. This resulted in a smaller increase in settlers (13% greater than control) and no significant changes in connectivity patterns. The post-settlement phase was similarly impacted with counteracting effects of increased temperature and ocean acidification on recruit growth. Overall, this dissertation reveals the potential for adaptation to increased temperature in at least one important coral species ( Orbicella faveolata) that is greatly diminished when encountered in combination with ocean acidification. These results encourage the reduction of carbon emissions to give coral species the chance to adapt to elevated temperatures through the recruitment of more resilient individuals without the additional stress of ocean acidification.

TI  - Determinants of Life History Variability in the Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of Western Alaska
SP  - 116
AB  - Chinook Salmon from western Alaska have experienced recent declines in abundance, size, and age at maturity. Declines have led to hardships for the region’s dependent subsistence and commercial users. Thus there is a managerial need to better understand factors effecting life-history expression in these populations. I used retrospective scale analysis and run reconstructions to investigate the causes of declines in age at maturity and the effect of the marine environment on growth, maturation, and survival in two western Alaskan Chinook Salmon populations subject to long-term monitoring: the East Fork Andreafsky River and the Kogrukluk River (tributaries of the Yukon River and Kuskokwim River respectively). The expression of age at maturation exhibited sex-specific responses to variability in growth. Additionally, thresholds for maturation, as described by a newly presented measure of maturation reaction norms that accounts for growth history, were found to have declined in both sexes. This can be interpreted as indirect evidence that observed declines in age at maturity represent an evolutionary response. I also found that sea surface temperatures in the Bering Sea exert strong control on the expression of life history variability. Warmer sea surface temperatures appear to lead to a younger age at maturity, largely through the vector of augmented growth. However, warmer sea surface temperatures additionally appeared to decrease the average age of male recruits by lowering growth thresholds for early male maturation. Despite the demonstrated relationship between Bering Sea surface temperatures and age at maturation, a lack of a temporal trend in sea surface temperatures during the period of analysis (1977–2013) suggests that temperature alone cannot explain documented declines in average age. However, this result suggests that the average age at maturation of western Alaskan Chinook Salmon will continue to decline with future predicted warming of the Bering Sea as a consequence of climate change.

TI  - Effects of Variable and Changing Environments on Demography: Inferences From a Lesser Snow Goose Colony
SP  - 159
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures have caused changes in both the mean and variance of environmental conditions, with associated effects on the demography of natural populations. The demographic effects of environmental change can manifest through direct (i.e., physiological) or indirect pathways (i.e., through shifts in species interactions). For many populations, environmental change will affect multiple life cycle stages simultaneously, thereby altering vital rate correlation structures with potentially important impacts on evolutionary fitness. The effects of environmental change will also often be habitat-specific, particularly when species interactions modify demographic sensitivity to climate. As a result, the effects of climate change are likely to vary across a species range, with important implications for range expansion and population viability. In chapter 2, I examine the effects of joint vital rate responses to environmental drivers on the evolution of life histories in variable environments. I show that vital rate covariation, generated when multiple vital rates respond to a shared environmental driver, can fundamentally alter evolutionary selection pressures. Negative vital rate covariation promotes the evolution of demographic lability (stronger demographic responsiveness), while positive covariation promotes buffering (weaker demographic responsiveness), altering the range of life histories over which the evolution of buffered and labile vital rates are a predicted evolutionary outcome. By identifying the life histories for which selection pressures are most sensitive to environmentally-driven vital rate covariation, this study provides a richer understanding of both life history evolution and the capacity of species to cope with ongoing changes to contemporary environments. In chapter 3, I use a long-term study of lesser snow geese to test the hypothesis that demographic and developmental responses to climate will be weakest in habitats where resource diversity is greatest. I find support for this hypothesis, and my results indicate that gosling demography is much more responsive to climate in recently colonized, freshwater habitats where landscape diversity and gosling diet diversity is low. These results underscore the potential importance of accounting for biotic interactions when predicting spatio-temporal responses to climate. In chapter 4, I quantify the consequences of observed climate change for lesser snow goose population dynamics across habitats. I find that climate change increases population growth in all habitats, but that such increases are disproportionately large in novel inland freshwater habitats. These results suggest that in a warmer and more variable climate, the breeding range and population growth of lesser snow geese is likely to increase, counteracting current management efforts to reduce overabundant populations.

TI  - Using Multiple Methodologies to Understand Within Species Variability of Adelges and Pineus (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha)
SP  - 95
AB  - The species of two genera in Insecta: Hemiptera: Adelgidae were investigated through the lenses of genetics, morphology, life cycle and host species. The systematics are unclear due to complex life cycles, including multigenerational polymorphism, host switching and cyclical parthenogenesis. I studied the hemlock adelgids, including the nonnative invasive hemlock woolly adelgid on the east coast of the United States, that are currently viewed as a single species. I used multivariate morphometric analyses to identify morphological differences among hemlock adelgid lineages. With principal component analyses and MANOVA, the six lineages that were used in this study were found to be significantly different from each other. The findings of this project provide evidence for taxonomic designation of different hemlock adelgid lineages, which will hopefully inform regulation of these distinct lineages, as these distinctions between the lineages of hemlock adelgids could equate to other biological differences, ex. cold tolerance, host specialization, fecundity and dispersal ability. I also investigated the relationship between species Pineus similis, Pineus abietinus through phylogeny, genetic distances, life cycle and host species. This was done through using three mitochondrial (COI, COII, cytB) and one nuclear (EF1a) gene, in Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analyses, along with genetic distance measurements. The P. similis and P. abietinus on Pinus could not be separated within the Bayesian analyses, and P. similis and P. abietinus on Abies had low calculated distance measurements (2.98%) compared to the average distance between species within the genus (28.07%). These two studies emphasize the current confusion within the Adelgidae family, and the results presented in this thesis stress the importance of using components of multiple species concepts to better understand the systematics of these lineages.

TI  - Evolutionary Innovations in Ants to Thermally Stressful Environments
SP  - 124
AB  - Temperature is a fundamental environmental force shaping species abundance and distributions through its effects on biochemical reaction rates, metabolism, activity, and reproduction. In light of future climate shifts, mainly driven by temperature increases, how will organisms persist in warmer environments? One molecular mechanism that may play an important role in coping with heat stress is the heat shock response (HSR), which protects against molecular damage. To prevent and repair protein damage specifically, Hsps activate and become up-regulated. However, the functional diversity and relevance of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in extending upper thermal limits in taxonomic groups outside marine and model systems is poorly understood. Ants are a good system to understand the physiological mechanisms for coping with heat stress because they have successfully diversified into thermally stressful environments. To identify and characterize the functional diversity of Hsps in ants, I surveyed Hsp orthologues from published ant genomes to test for signatures of positive selection and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Within Hymenoptera, ants utilize unique sets of Hsps for the HSR. Stabilizing selection was the prevailing force among Hsp orthologues, suggesting that protein activity is conserved. At the same time, regulatory regions (promoters) governing transcriptional up-regulation diversified: species differ in the number and location of heat shock elements (HSEs). Therefore, Hsp expression patterns may be a target for selection in warm environments. I tested whether Hsp expression corresponded with variation in upper thermal limits in forest ant species within the genus Aphaenogaster. Whole colonies were collected throughout the eastern United States and were lab acclimated. There was a positive relationship between upper thermal limits (Critical Thermal maxima, CTmax) and local temperature extremes. Upper thermal limits were also higher in ant species that lived in open habitats (shrub-oak and long-leaf pine savannah) than species occupying closed habitats (deciduous forest). Ant species with higher CTmax expressed Hsps more slowly, at higher temperatures, and at higher maximum levels than those with low CTmax. Because Hsps sense and repair molecular damage, these results suggest the proteomes of open relative to closed canopy forests are more stable. Although deciduous forest ant species may be buffered from temperature stress, it is likely that temperature interacts with other environmental stressors such as water and nutrient availability that may impact upper thermal limits. I measured the influence of dehydration and nutrition stress on upper thermal limits of forest ants from a single population. Ants that were initially starved were much less thermally tolerant than controls and ants that were initially desiccated. Because ants are likely to experience similar combination of stressors in the wild, upper thermal limits may be severely overestimated in single factor experiments. Therefore, realistic forecasting models need to consider multiple environmental stressors. Overall, adaptive tuning of Hsp expression that reflects better protection and tolerance of protein unfolding may have facilitated ant diversification into warm environments. However, additional stressors and mechanisms may constrain the evolution of upper thermal limits.

TI  - Thermal biology of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
SP  - 181
AB  - Acclimation of adult E. chloroticus for 90 days at projected seawater temperature for the next century (i.e., 24 C) resulted in decreased feeding, respiration, negative growth and complete loss of reproductive output. The thermal limits (median lethal temperature (LT50) and lethal temperature) of adult E. chloroticus were not affected by duration of acclimation at 18 and 24 C (i.e., one or four weeks) or by acclimatization summer (21 C) seasons. However, acclimatization of animals to winter season resulted in lower thermal limits. Expression of hsp70 mRNA in adult E. chloroticus increased with temperature during a thermal shock (1 C day-1) with a maximum expression at ca. 27-28 C regardless of the acclimation/acclimatization temperature. Performance of early development at different temperatures (18, 21, 24 C) was evaluated using gametes obtained from acclimated and non-acclimated wild adults. Development was successful in all treatments, and larvae raised at 24 C developed faster and were larger compared to larvae cultured at 18 and 21 C. Culture temperature did not affect respiration rate, lipid and protein content of the gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. Whereas for the 8-arm larval stage, larvae cultured at 18 C had more lipid compared to those from 24 C, and larvae cultured at 24 C had more protein compared to those from the 18 C treatment. When cultured at 24 C, both gastrula and 2-arm larvae showed higher LT50. Thermal shock had an effect on the hsp70 mRNA expression of gastrulae, 2- and 4-arm larvae. The genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions during early development of E. chloroticus were evident, with some genotypes performing better than others at higher temperatures. In addition, including a second stressor (i.e., low salinity, 29 ppt) during the first 24 hours of development affected fertilization, development rate, gastrulation success and normal development, with seawater temperature only affecting development rate and gastrulation. Nonetheless, an increase in temperature from 18 to 21 C minimized the negative effect of low salinity on development rate and gastrulation of E. chloroticus. Overall, the sea urchin E. chloroticus may have the potential to adapt to warmer seawater conditions induced by climate change due to the presence of developmental plasticity in the early life stages to withstand higher seawater temperatures and lower salinities. However, adaptation would require the presence of competent reproductive adults able to carry on plasticity through generations. Considering the total loss of reproductive output observed at higher temperatures, an increase in seawater temperature could dramatically influence the persistence of northern populations of E. chloroticus, leading to flow-on effects in the subtidal ecosystem. Finally, the results obtained in this research provide detailed information on the physiological and molecular responses of both adults and early life stages of E. chloroticus under current and projected seawater temperatures in a climate change scenario.

TI  - Next-Generation Salmonid Alphavirus Vaccine Development
SP  - 161
AB  - Aquaculture is essential to meet the current and future demands for seafood to feed the world population. Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout are two of the most cultured aquaculture species. A pathogen that threatens these species is salmonid alphavirus (SAV). A current inactivated virus vaccine against SAV provides cross-protection against all SAV subtypes in salmonids and reduces mortality amongst infected fish. However, protection is not 100% and due to virus growth at low temperature, the vaccine production process is time consuming. In addition, the vaccine needs to be injected into the fish, which is a cumbersome process. The work described in this thesis aimed to increase the general knowledge of SAV and to assess current vaccine technologies, and to use this knowledge in designing next-generation vaccines for salmonid aquaculture. An alternative cell line to support SAV proliferation was identified, however, the virus production time could not yet outcompete the current SAV production system. Making use of the baculovirus insect cell expression system, multiple enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP), and core-like particle (CLP) prototype vaccines were produced in insect cells at high temperature. An in vivo vaccination study showed, however, that these vaccines could not readily protect Atlantic salmon against SAV. The low temperature-dependent replication of SAV was attributed to the glycoprotein E2, and it was found that E2 only correctly travelled to the cell surface at low temperature, and in the presence of glycoprotein E1. The biological impact of this finding was confirmed in the development and in vivo testing of a DNA-launched replicon vaccine. The effective DNA-launched replicon vaccine was extended by delivery of the capsid protein in trans. It was hypothesized that viral replicon particles (VRP) were formed in vivo, which would cause an additional single round of infection and might further elevate the immune response in comparison to the replicon vaccine. A second animal trial indicated that the inclusion of capsid did not yet improve vaccine efficacy. This trial however did show that a DNA vaccine transiently expressing the SAV structural proteins provided superior protection over both replicon vaccines (with and without capsid). In this thesis, some virus characteristics, such as the cause of temperature-dependency of SAV replication, of an unique aquatic virus were further explored. The production and in vivo testing of multiple next-generation vaccines defined the prerequisites for induction of a potent immune response in Atlantic salmon. A prototype DNA-launched replicon vaccine has shown potential for further development. The research described in this thesis contributes to the development of next-generation vaccines in the challenging area of fish vaccinology.

TI  - Genomic Responses to Environmental Variation and Change in the Ocean
SP  - 176
AB  - Human activities are driving dramatic changes in the global environment. One consequence of this change is the rapid warming and acidification of the ocean. Throughout the Earth's history, sudden environmental change has often been associated with mass extinctions. However, in some cases species can adapt to changing environments via natural selection on heritable genetic variation. Most genetic variation, however, is not important for adaptation, and instead reflects the influences of mutation and drift on variants with minimal fitness consequences. For this reason, it has been difficult to assess the adaptive potential of populations and species even when genetic data are available. This thesis uses new genome-wide approaches to the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation to determine the spatial distribution and abundance of the functional genetic variation that could drive adaptive responses to environmental change. In the first chapter, I use gene co-expression network analysis to identify gene networks that mediate both fixed and plastic differences between coral colonies of the species Acropora hyacinthus in susceptibility to coral bleaching, the stress-induced breakdown of coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis. In the second chapter, I show that variation in gene expression within and between marine populations, including coral, abalone, mussels, and urchins, is often related to variation in the frequencies of genetic variants that change the expression of the allele on which they are found. In the third chapter, I show that persistent differences in the frequencies of genetic variants that cause changes in gene expression and protein sequence in stress-related genes are associated with the evolution of increased bleaching resilience in a cryptic lineage of Acropora hyacinthus. In the fourth chapter, I use low-coverage whole-genome re-sequencing of 114 coral colonies to identify "supergenes," or closely linked co-inherited sets of multiple genes, that were associated with differences in bleaching outcomes during the third global bleaching event within and between cryptic species of Acropora hyacinthus. Taken as a whole, this thesis demonstrates the existence of high levels of functional diversity spread across contemporary environmental mosaics, and suggests that this diversity will play a critical role in assessing and managing the responses of populations to rapid anthropogenic change.

TI  - Coupling Electrochemistry and Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to Observe Transient Electrochemical Intermediates
SP  - 108
AB  - The observation of electrochemical reaction species directly after electrochemical generation has been a goal of electrochemists for years, and is a problem that has been approached using many different analytical techniques. The challenge in acquiring faster response times exists in transferring electrochemically generated species quickly from solution to the gas phase for MS detection. The development of DESI allows for analyses to be made on surfaces under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature with a sampling time on the order of milliseconds. In collaboration with Prof. Hao Chen, we present a new DESI-ECMS technique for the mass spectrometric detection of fleeting reaction intermediates in electrochemical reactions utilizing a "waterwheel" working electrode setup is presented here. This setup takes inspiration from DESI-MS to sample directly from the surface of a working electrode for in situ electrochemical mass spectrometric analysis in seeking shorter analysis timescales. A number of systems is presented here verifying the viability of the waterwheel for DESI-ECMS analysis to observe fleeting electrochemical intermediates.

TI  - Electron impact source, development and applications
AB  - Many modern x-ray instruments are based at synchrotrons, with corresponding limited accessibility and high costs. This has driven the development of imaging/microscopes using table-top x-ray sources. This thesis presents experimental measurements for both electron impact sources and laser plasma source, also it details the developments for the third generation microfocus x-ray source MKIII and associated optical systems for various applications. For non-pulsed radiation, the commissioning and set up of the new third generation microfocus x-ray source MK III is in progress. The Microfocus x-ray source MKI had been characterised and used for imaging biological samples. Absorption and phase contrast images were obtained for biological samples. In addition, for the first time, the MKI device was used to perform experiments to study the phase contrast x-ray image sensing techniques (PCXI), using a sand paper analyser. Images were successfully recorded and analysed using laboratory electron impact x-ray source (MKI) and laser plasma source (Astra Gemini laser at RAL). The PCXI technique can be developed with the new MKIII x-ray source by using two crystals, one a monochromatic and second as a reflection analyser. Additionally, the MKI and MKIII sources can be coupled with a silica mirror or multilayer monochromator and zone plates to provide high spatial resolution images (hundreds of nanometers beam spot sizes) allowing use for various applications. New interchangeable targets (chromium, titanium, and copper) were designed for MKIII and these can provide a range of different x-ray energies, and may allow a considerably smaller x-ray focal spot size ≈ 1 µm, increasing the range of applicability of the source. Furthermore, having different melting points for target materials, a compensation between electron beam size and energy should be taken to avoid exceeding the target melting point. The heat generated at the surface of different targets was calculated and the survival of the present targets (aluminium and carbon) verified. In this MKI regime, an electron beam of 10 keV is focused to a few tens of micrometres diameters on the solid target and x-rays are emitted. The emission spectrum was characterised using mica and KAP crystal spectrometers. The K-edge intensity lines were recorded and analysed for both aluminium and carbon targets using imaging plate and an x-ray CCD camera. Experimental optimisation of the electron gun electrode operating modes was achieved and verified against the literature. The maximum current measured was 250-300 µA. The x-ray spot size was measured and the minimum spot size recorded was 26.1 × 47.9 µm2. Smaller spot sizes are possible but with a low electron beam current. The design of a focusing magnetic lens suitable for use in the new third generation MKIII x-ray microfocus device was undertaken. The focusing lens was designed and manufactured at Imperial College London. A professional software package was used to design the lens through computational modelling. The experimental maximum magnetic field B measured for the focusing lens was 0.512 T at the lens aperture. The aim is to achieve 1 µm electron beam diameter focused at the target surface, although by this computational model, a satisfactory diameter had been achieved ~20-50 µm, but a smaller electron beam could be achieved. The validity of the solutions generated by computational model needs to be precisely experimentally examined in order to achieve the required beam diameter and suitable beam current incident on the target.

TI  - Climate change time machine: adaptation to 30 years of warming in the baltic sea
AB  - Earth mean surface temperature has increased by 1 °C since the industrial revolution, and this has already had considerable effects on animal and plant species. Ecological responses to the warming climate – often facilitated via phenotypic plasticity – are ubiquitous. However, even though evolution can occur rapidly there are only few examples of genetic adaptation to climate change.In my thesis, I used a near-natural system to study if and how organisms have adapted to 30 years of warming, and how this has affected competitive species interactions. I investigated Baltic Sea populations of the aquatic snails Galba truncatula and Theodoxus fluviatilis, which had been subjected to cooling water discharge from power plants, resulting in water temperatures 4 to 10 °C higher than in the surrounding sea.G. truncatula had high upper thermal limits and large acclimation potential. This plasticity may have helped the species to survive under the new conditions, allowing evolution through natural selection to take place. I found that the populations of the two thermal origins had diverged in SNP markers associated with warmer temperature, whereas divergence in selectively neutral markers was mainly related to geographical distance. Adaptation occurred from standing genetic variation, emphasizing the importance of genetic diversity and population size in enabling the persistence of populations. Changes in thermal sensitivity of growth and survival were subtle yet significant, and complied with theoretical models of thermal adaptation in ectotherms. At the community level, pre-adaptation to warmer conditions aided the native T. fluviatilis when competing with the alien Potamopyrgus antipodarum. However, interspecific competition limited the snails most in those traits favored under warming, highlighting the challenge of adapting to different selecting forces during global change.The persistence of species and populations under climate change depends on several factors - plasticity allowing for initial survival, evolvability in allowing the genetic changes, and species interactions affecting the new ecological niches. The results of my thesis indicate that persistence under climate change is possible when these factors align, but the relative roles of ecology and plasticity may explain why there are so few observed instances of evolution in response to climate change.

TI  - Insect life history responses to global change
AB  - Understanding life history variation in insects requires an assessment of how resources are allocated between reproductive and somatic traits. Associated data are not only a potential indicator of species adaptation, but also of environmental influences on fitness. So far, however, there is a dearth of data on factors affecting resource allocation, in particular in real environments. Using an integrative nutrient assay protocol, this study assessed the effects of body size and environmental conditions on resource allocation strategies in terrestrial and aquatic semelparous insects: the indian mealmoth, Plodia interpunctella under laboratory conditions, and two caddisfly species (Hydropsyche siltalai and Rhyacophila dorsalis) in the field. In Plodia interpunctella, larger females had higher potential lifetime fecundity due to their prolonged lifespan, while smaller females maintained greater initial egg loads and a shorter life-span. Assays revealed that current reproduction requires greater nutrient allocation in somatic and reproductive tissue, illustrating potentially fundamental factors underlying reproduction-longevity trade-offs. Field studies showed how trichopteran larvae have species-specific responses to physicochemical conditions located along an altitudinal gradient (20 m - 230 m asl) in the River Usk. Nutrient allocation in Rhyacophila dorsalis did not differ between upstream and downstream sites. In contrast, upstream Hydropsyche siltalai emerged with greater nutrient reserves consistent with early reproduction while those in warmer downstream environments must reallocate resources for somatic maintenance reducing available resource for reproduction. Consistent with this result, translocation of late instar H. siltalai over a thermal gradient (1.5 - 4.5 °C) showed how thermal exposure can affect adult fitness by reducing body size and increasing nutrient allocation for somatic maintenance. These results show how insects adjust nutrient balance for reproduction and survival under different circumstances. The most significant result is that global warming might reduce body size and advance reproduction in some species with consequences for fitness. This is proposed as an area ripe for further study to understand the evolutionary consequences of global change.

TI  - Planning and operating energy storage for maximum technical and financial benefits in electricity distribution networks
AB  - The transmission and distribution networks are facing changes in the way they will be planned, operated and maintained as a result of the rise in the deployment of Low Carbon Technologies (LCTs) on the power grid. These LCTs provide the benefits of a decarbonised grid and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and large centralised generation. As LCTs are close to the demand centres, a significant amount will be deployed in distribution networks. The distribution networks face challenges in enabling a wide deployment of LCTs because they were traditionally built for centralised generation and most are operated passively as demand patterns are well understood and power flows are unidirectional to load centres. The opposite will be the case for distribution networks with LCTs. Utilities that own and operate distribution networks such as the DNOs in the UK will face a host of problems, such as voltage and thermal excursions and power quality issues on their networks. Traditional reinforcement methods will be expensive for DNOs, so they are considering innovative solutions that provide multiple benefits; this is where Energy Storage Systems (ESS) could play a role to provide multiple technical and economic benefits across the grid from voltage and power flow management to upgrade deferral of network assets. This is due to the multifunctional nature of ESS allowing it to act as generation, transmission, demand or demand response based on requirements at any specific time based on the requirements of the stakeholder involved with the asset. ESS is technically capable of providing benefits to DNOs and other stakeholders on the electricity grid but the business case is not proven. Unless multiple benefits are aggregated, investment in ESS is challenging as they have a substantial capital cost and some components will require more frequent replacement than traditional network assets which typically last between 20 – 40+ years. As a result there is a reluctance to include them in future distribution network planning arrangements. IV Furthermore, the electricity regulatory and market design, which was set up in the time of traditional centralised generation and networks, limits investment in ESS by regulated bodies such as DNOs. The regulations and market structures also affects revenue streams and the resulting business case for ESS. This thesis investigates the feasibility of ESS in distribution networks by first studying the effect of current electricity regulatory and market practices on ESS deployment, investigating how ESS can be used under the present rules, and establishing whether there are limitations that can be reduced or removed. Secondly, short and medium term planning is carried out on model Medium Voltage distribution networks (6.6 kV) provided by the IEEE and Electricity North West Limited to establish the technical and financial viability of investing in ESS over conventional reinforcement methods by:  Assessing the impact of the proliferation of LCTs in distribution networks using both deterministic and stochastic methods under different scenarios based on current developments and government policies in the UK. This stochastic evaluation considers both spatial and temporal aspects of LCTs in distribution networks with datasets obtained from real distribution network customers;  Developing and applying ESS voltage and power flow management, and market control algorithms to resolve distribution network issues resulting from growing LCTs and allowing ESS to participate in the electricity spot market over a planning period up to the year 2030;  Providing a framework for assessing the business case of ESS under a DNO or third-party ownership structure where technical and commercial benefits from network asset upgrade deferral, energy arbitrage, balancing market and ancillary services (frequency response and short term operating reserves), distribution and transmission system use of system benefits are evaluated; V  Optimising the operation of ESS considering multiple technical and commercial objectives to establish the technical benefits and revenues that can be obtained from an ESS deployment and the trade-off of benefits that applies for differing ownership types. The simulation results show that, under the scenarios investigated, ESS can be used as a technical solution for DNOs. They show that the ESS capital costs can be offset by aggregating benefits from both technical and commercial applications in distribution networks if regulatory and market changes are made. The conclusions offer a perspective to DNOs and third parties’ considering investing in ESS on the electricity grid as it evolves towards a more active, decarbonised system.

TI  - Phenotypic and genetic variation in the dothistroma-pinus pathosystem
AB  - Trees and forests are under increasing threat from pathogens which cause huge economic and ecological damage. The unprecedented global movement of pathogens into new areas creates novel pathosystems, while the changing climate affects the dynamics of endemic pathosystems. Co-evolution within endemic pathosystems affects the genetic composition of hosts and pathogens. Spatial heterogeneity in pathogen pressure leads to genetic variation in disease-related traits among host populations. In contrast, novel hosts or populations are expected to be highly susceptible to exotic pathogens as there has been no evolution of defence responses. Host response to disease can therefore be an indicator of a novel or endemic pathosystem. The long term resilience of forests to pathogens depends on the adaptive capacity of both the host and pathogen species. Establishing the extent of genetic and phenotypic variation within both the host and pathogen is therefore fundamental in understanding past, current and future pathosystem dynamics. The most significant current threat to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum which is assumed to be exotic to Great Britain. This study aimed to increase understanding of the genetic and phenotypic variation in this pathosystem. Results from this study show that there are high levels of variation in the Dothistroma – Pinus pathosystem. Genetic variation, elucidated using neutral genetic markers, mating type specific markers and in vitro analysis of phenotypic variation in D. septosporum collected from Scottish pinewoods, was found to be high: there was high allelic diversity, particularly within plantation forests outside the native pinewood range, and high phenotypic plasticity in response to different temperature treatments. Both mating type idiomorphs were found in one forest which demonstrates their potential for sexual as well as asexual reproduction. There is also tentative evidence from this study that the pathogen is either introduced to Great Britain or that endemic pathogen populations have been augmented with introduced pathogens. Artificial and natural inoculations of native Scots pine provenances with D. septosporum indicate that there is considerable variation in susceptibility to DNB across the native range in Scotland and that variation in this trait is both highly heritable and evolvable. Furthermore, provenance mean susceptibility to DNB is negatively and significantly associated with water-related variables at site of origin, a finding that is potentially indicative of a co-evolutionary history between host and pathogen. Genetic differences among individuals which are ‘resistant’ or ‘susceptible’ to DNB were identified in Pinus radiata for which there has been extensive research in this pathosystem, by comparing the transcriptome sequences of the two phenotypic groups. Nearly half of the genetic differences identified among phenotypes were found in genes with a putative defence function. In conclusion, native Scots pine provenances contain the necessary heritable genetic diversity to evolve a decrease in their susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to elevated prevalence of this pathogen. However, implementation of key native pinewood management strategies, including encouraging regeneration in particular, are necessary in order to facilitate the adaptive evolution of native forests to increased levels of DNB. The effectiveness of this response will depend on the rapidity of adaptation of the pathogen. Measures to limit adaptation where possible, including the use of pathogen monitoring and control in nurseries and the limitation of pathogen movement into native pinewoods, should be continued.

The work maps the availability of solar energy throughout the country, and investigates the feasibility of implementing the technology at two case study locations. These are the existing power generation grid sites of Wadi Aldawasir (located 20° 23′ 22.00″ N 45° 12′ 32.00″ E), and Shuaibah (located 20° 37′ 22.84″ N 39° 33′ 44.02″ E). The first case study site, Wadi Aldawasir, covers an area of 48,900 m2, where parabolic trough solar thermal technology is proposed for power generation. The second case study site, Shuaibah power plant is one of the largest desalination and fossil fuel plants in the world with a 1,030,000 m3/ day capacity. Both case studies were assessed in terms of site specifications with selection based on Direct Normal Irradiation (DNI). A feasibility study examining Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) potential was conducted for both locations, with analysis of weather data, particularly monthly and annual, global horizontal and beam normal irradiation data. From these data, a reasonable estimate of CSP potential, and viability of the technology was determined. Simulation was then performed using Solar Advisor Model (SAM) and Renewable Energy Technology Screen (RETScreen) software, taking into account the location weather data, (DNI, dry-bulb and dew-point temperatures, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and wind speed), technical specification, (solar field, Solar Multiple (SM) Solar collector Assemblies (SCAs), power cycle and thermal storage) and economic parameters (energy unit cost, maintenance, etc.). Simulation evaluated annual energy performance (solar radiation resource of the solar field, electrical energy delivered by solar thermal plant, system losses, required solar field area), levelised cost of unit of power generated, CO2 emissions savings, and other financial feasibility indicators. The work shows that the energy yield of the new solar power plants using proposed CSP technology in both case studies is feasible.

TI  - Synthesis, characterisation and applications of new polyesters for drug delivery
AB  - In recent years, a number of reports have focused on the use of polyesters in drug delivery due to their intrinsic biocompatibility and biodegradability. In this thesis, aliphatic polyesters were synthesized by polycondensation reaction and ring opening polymerization reactions. The properties of the polymers and drug delivery potential of the resultant materials were evaluated. In the polycondensation reactions, a series of aliphatic polyesters of similar molecular weight were synthesized by reacting 1,10-decanediol with different ratios of succinic acid/phenylsuccinic acid and the effects of phenyl group side-chain substitution on polymer properties was investigated. A solvent-free melt polycondensation method using scandium (III) triflate as catalyst at an industrially relevant temperature (120 °C) was used. As the phenyl content increased, the polymers changed from semicrystalline to amorphous in state. The loading capability of polymers was checked by formulating nanoparticles containing coumarin 6 as a fluorescent dye analogue of active drugs. A polymer with a 70/30 ratio of succinic acid and phenylsuccinic acid showed the highest dye loading among the set of materials synthesised. This polymer was found to be degradable over time under selected experimental conditions. Amphiphilic block co-polymers from the PluronicTM class were used to stabilize, in PBS, nanoparticles formed from these polyesters by nanoprecipitation routes. The metabolic activity, cell membrane integrity and lysosomal functions of C3A cells dosed with the polymers were determined to observe the cytocompatibility of the highest dye-loaded nanoparticles. Activity relative to undosed C3A cells was retained at more than 80% in the all of the assays. Imaging of Pluronic coated and uncoated nanoparticles in C3A cells suggested that both types of the nanoparticles were endocytosed in the early stage of the study (within 10 min). The internalization of nanoparticles was increased progressively over the study time. These results indicated the possible utility of the selected polymers in diagnostic and delivery applications. Ring opening polymerization (ROP) reactions were used for the synthesis of a diblock (mPEG-b-PεDL) and a triblock (PεDL-b-PEG-b-PεDL) copolymer from a seven membered ε-decalactone (ε-DL) monomer obtained from renewable sources. A diblock (mPEG-b-PεDL) copolymer was compared with structurally similar mPEG-b-PCL copolymer synthesized via ROP of ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) monomer, which can be considered as a non-renewable monomer. A six membered δ-decalactone (δ-DL) was also used for the synthesis of a diblock copolymer (mPEG-b-PδDL) to compare the reaction kinetics and properties of the copolymers. The copolymers were prepared via bulk polymerisation using 1,5,7-Triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) as a metal-free catalyst to replace the conventionally used stannous octoate [Sn(Oct)2]. A higher polymerization efficiency was achived with TBD compared to Sn(Oct)2 catalyst. However, a notable difference in the reaction temperature required for ε-DL and δ-DL polymerization was observed. The comparison with a structural analogue, i.e. ε-CL, demonstrated that the ε-DL polymerization was inhibited due to the presence of the alkyl chain of ε-DL monomer. However, a higher reaction time (12 h for TBD and 24 h for Sn(Oct)2) in CROP of ε-DL was addressed by using microwave based ring opening polymerization (MROP) reaction. The MROP was adopted as a ‘green’ and cheap heating method alternative to conventional heating (CROP) for the synthesis of mPEG-b-PεDL diblock copolymers using TBD as a catalyst. All the reactions were conducted in bulk. The MROP was designed based on the dielectric properties of all the reacting materials, as it was found that ε-DL monomers showed good absorption of MW radiation (tanδ>0.5). Accordingly, MROP resulted in a higher rate of ε-DL polymerization compared to CROP but comparison of the synthesis of mPEG-b-PCL copolymer by MROP indicated that the presence of the alkyl chain in ε-DL monomer significantly reduced the rate of polymerization. The synthesized mPEG-b-PεDL copolymer was investigated as a potential drug delivery vehicle for solubilization and controlled delivery of indomethacin. The indomethacin loading and release from mPEG-b-PεDL micelles (amorphous core) was compared against well-established mPEG-b-PCL micelles (semicrystalline core). The drug-polymer compatibility was also determined through a predictive computational approach to access the drug solubilisation (or drug loading) into hydrated micelles. The micelles were prepared by solvent evaporation method and characterized for size, morphology, indomethacin (IND) loading and release. Both of the micelle formulations showed a uniform distribution of spherical micelles with size <60 nm. However, a significantly higher size of empty mPEG-b- PεDL micelle was observed compared to mPEG-b-PCL micelles. A higher compatibility of the drug was predicted with PCL core as determined by modified Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (sp) using the Hanson solubility parameter (HSP) approach. The compatibility of the drug was determined for both of the segments (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) of the copolymers and found to be in the order of sp (PεDL)> sp (mPEG)> sp (PCL). The predictions suggested that more IND should encapsulate within the micelles with PCL core compared to PDL core, but the IND loading experiments revealed an overall higher loading in PεDL core (6.55 wt%) compared to PCL core (5.39 wt%) (P < 0.05, unpaired student’s t-test). However, consideration of the IND loading per unit volume of the micelles revealed that the PCL cored micelles was able to load 1.5 times more compared to the PεDL cored micelles. This result illustrated the higher compatibility of the IND with PCL core in accordance with the solubility parameter calculations. These data also suggested that the overall higher IND loading in PεDL core was attributable to the amorphous nature of the core which increased the core volume by 1.81 times compared to the PCL core. Drug release studies showed the sustained release pattern from both of the micelle systems although the semicrystalline PCL core (80% drug release in 110 h) was able to release the drug for a longer period compared to PεDL core (80% drug release in 72 h). Cell viability tests demonstrated the cytocompatibility of the mPEG-b-PεDL polymer. The micelles were internalized effectively in the early stages of the study and progressively increased with time. The results of the present thesis suggested that novel aliphatic polyester can be good candidates for the drug delivery applications and further studies can explore the possible applications of these polymers in the biomedical field.

TI  - Modelling of sorption enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (se-clsr) of methane in a packed bed reactor
AB  - In the sorption enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) process, hydrogen (H2) can be produced in concentration up to 98 vol. % (dry basis) in a single reactor packed with a mixture of reforming catalyst and carbon dioxide (CO2) sorbent. This is defined as pre-combustion capturing of CO2 and the high purity H2 produced can be used as a fuel for electricity generation, synthesis of ammonia-derived fertilisers, or hydrotreating of naphtha and other heavy gas oil in petroleum refinery. A cyclic operation between the production of H2 and regeneration of CO2 sorbent is required, but the energy demand for the sorbent regeneration is high. A proposed method to decrease this energy demand is to couple SE-SMR with chemical looping (CL), which naturally separates the nitrogen (N2) from the syngas via the highly exothermic cyclic oxidation with air of a metallic material, which acts as the reforming catalyst when reduced (oxygen transfer material or ‘OTM’). The combination of SE-SMR and CL makes the process energy efficient and eliminates the need for (i) high temperature as compared to the conventional steam methane reforming (SMR) process (typical temperature range is 750- 950°C), (ii) the water gas shift (WGS) reactors downstream of the reformer, and (iii) external heating using the natural gas fuel in the reformer. However the H2 generation of a high purity from one reactor operation is intermittent, as part of a cyclic operation, with the reactor alternately operating in Fuel Reactor mode (FR), with fuel and steam feed or Air Reactor mode (AR), with air feed. Adsorption of CO2 shifts the equilibrium of reaction towards more H2 production and ultimately increases the efficiency of the process towards H2 production. Production of H2, CH4 conversion and overall efficiency of the process depend upon many operating parameters. The effects of inlet temperature, reactor pressure, molar steam to carbon ratio (S/C) in the feed, and gas mass velocity on the SE-SMR and the sorption enhanced chemical looping steam reforming (SE-CLSR) of methane processes is reported in this thesis. The formulation of the SE-CLSR process model requires the modelling of packed bed reactors. This mathematical modelling covers various individual models (sub-models) for; SMR, SE-SMR, OTM reduction and oxidation of reduced OTM. The gPROMS model builder 4.1.0® is used to solve the model equations. In this work, an experimental IV kinetics study and model of SMR process over 18 wt. % NiO/α-Al2O3 catalyst are presented for an adiabatic fixed bed reactor in the temperature range of 300-700°C at 1 bar pressure. The model is validated by comparing the results with the experimental data obtained as part of this work. The simulation results are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The equilibrium results are generated using Chemical Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) software. The effect of various operating parameters (temperature, pressure and S/C) on the CH4 and water conversion (%) is modelled and compared with the equilibrium values. The mathematical model of SE-SMR was developed based on the industrial operating conditions of temperature and pressure. The 873-973 K was found to be the optimum range of temperature, under the high pressure (30 bar) conditions, for the production of H2 of purity exceeding 85%. The developed model of SE-SMR was validated against the literature data. The mathematical model of SE-CLSR process was developed under adiabatic conditions. This model is the combination of reduction of catalyst followed by oxidation of the reduced catalyst. The individual models of reduction and oxidation are developed by using kinetic data available in the literature and later on validated with experimental results proposed in the literature. The already developed model of SE-SMR process is combined with the OTM reduction model to mimic the dynamic process occurring in the fuel reactor (FR) system. This FR is combined with air reactor (AR) and the combined model is run for 10 cycles. The sensitivity of the process is studied under the various operating conditions of temperature (873-1023 K), pressure (1-30 bar), molar S/C (2-6) and mass flux of the gas phase (Gs = 2-7 kg m-2 s-1). In this work, the operating conditions used for the production of H2 represent realistic industrial production conditions. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the developed model of SE-CLSR process has the flexibility to simulate a wide range of operating conditions of temperature, pressure, S/C and Gs.

TI  - Respiratory responses in the freshwater snail (Pomacea bridgesii) are differently affected by temperature, body mass and oxygen availability
SP  - 61
AB  - Pomacea bridgesii is a snail species native to tropical and sub-tropical regions, where it usually faces variability in water, temperature and oxygen level. This study of the effect of temperature on mass-specific oxygen consumption (M˙O2) and its relation to body weight shows that the M˙O2 of juvenile snails in normoxia (18-21 kPa) acclimated at temperature of 25°C ranged from 5 to 58 µMol O2/g/h, with a mean of 41.4 ± 18.3 µMol O2/g/h (n=7). Adult snails in normoxia at 25°C show less variation, ranging from 13 to 23 µMol O2/g/h, with a mean of 24.4 ± 6.1 µMol O2/g/h (n=12). The Q 10 value for juvenile snails was higher in the interval 25-30°C (Q10=5.74) than in the interval 20-25°C (Q10= 0.286). In adult snails, Q10 was higher in the interval 20-25°C (Q 10=3.19). M˙O2 of P. bridgesii in relation to body weight showed a negative linear correlation between metabolic rate and body weight with b values between 0.23 and 0.76. Also, both juvenile and adult snails exhibited weak O 2 regulation. In general, the different respiratory characteristics between juvenile and adult snails might be related to the differences of individual life history, which caused them to perform differently in face of temperatures change. Additionally, Pomacean snails species originated in tropical habitats where there is a lack of thermal fluctuation. For this reason, Pomacean snails may be less likely to have evolved effective thermal acclimation capabilities.

TI  - Mechanisms of population divergence along elevational gradients in the tropics
SP  - 121
AB  - Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to population divergence and eventually initiate speciation is a key step for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Most theories of differentiation and speciation have traditionally focused on geographically isolated populations. However, there is growing evidence that speciation can occur due to divergent selection despite initially high gene flow. My doctoral dissertation project investigates the effects of environmental heterogeneity and geography in promoting phenotypic and genetic divergence along elevation gradients in natural populations of a poison frog, Epipedobates anthonyi, across the landscape with a focus on environmental variation along elevational gradients. I studied populations distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0–1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. First, I examined the relative roles of geographic distance and environmental gradients on genetic and phenotypic divergence. I found that populations are phenotypically divergent in size, color, and male advertisement calls, but they exhibit low genetic divergence at neutral loci. There is substantial gene flow between populations throughout the lowlands, but populations at higher elevations are relatively isolated. This is mainly due to a mountain ridge acting as a physical and possibly environmental barrier between northern and southern populations. Within elevational gradients, geographic distance corrected for topography is the main factor explaining both genetic and phenotypic divergence. However, when controlling for the effect of topographic distance, environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation between sites best explain observed patterns of genetic divergence, whereas environmental conditions at a given site best explains differences in phenotypic traits, presumably due to divergent selection pressures. To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on adaptive divergence, I measured thermal tolerance of tadpoles across elevation. I found that populations from higher elevation had higher cold tolerance, suggesting that changes in temperature along elevation may cause divergent selection in thermal tolerance. Additionally, tadpoles from all sites have the ability to shift their thermal tolerance in response to previous exposure to different temperatures. Finally, to examine the degree of local adaptation to environmental conditions at high and low elevations, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. I evaluated populations from high and low elevations from two elevational transects. Overall, I found that all populations have higher reproduction rates at low elevation. In fact, at high elevation, populations had very low reproductive rates or did not reproduce at all. However, variation in life-history traits differed between transects. Populations from one transect revealed a pattern that was consistent with the expectation under local adaptation, namely, low elevation frogs had higher reproduction than high elevation frogs at the low elevation site. In contrast, populations from the other transect had a pattern that would be expected under countergradient variation, namely higher elevation frogs had higher reproduction at the low elevation site. Intriguingly, low elevation frogs had overall higher reproduction rates than high elevation frogs, suggesting that frogs from low elevation have higher fecundity than their counterparts at high elevation. Overall, the findings of my dissertation suggest that (i) phenotypic divergence occurs in the face of gene flow, (ii) environmental variation along elevation, particularly temperature, is a force that drives population divergence, and (iii) the influences of environmental conditions on populations are variable at the intraspecific level.

TI  - Potential for Adaptation to Climate Change in Interpopulation Hybrids of the Copepod Tigriopus californicus
SP  - 40
AB  - Accurately predicting how species respond to climate change is increasingly important as current methods suggest most will be unable to adapt. But can organisms respond to climate change faster than studies of selection alone suggest? Here we investigate potentially extreme phenotypes of heat tolerance resulting from complimentary gene action. We do so by hybridizing two populations in allopatry of Tigriopus californicus with high genetic divergence from similar temperature regimes. Parentals as well as F1, F2 and F6+ generations are subjected to acute heat stress at a sublethal and lethal temperature. We also look at life history traits for these hybrids to understand the overall viability of these populations. 8 of the 20 F6+ lines had survivorships significantly higher than parentals after being stressed at the sublethal temperature. 3 of those 8 had significantly higher survivorship after being stressed at the lethal temperature. Aside from breakdown resulting from hybridization alone, no further degradation of life history traits were seen in the 8 lines exhibiting extreme thermal tolerance. These results suggest that hybrids of populations in allopatry can respond faster to climate change than studies on selection alone have suggested.

TI  - Investigation of Lipid Profile Patterns Along Latitude in an Eastern Australian Cline and After Stress Selection in the Laboratory, and Experiments on Stress Tolerance with RNAi Knockdown of Lipid Biosynthesis Genes
SP  - 239
AB  - Homeoviscous adaptation in membranes and changes in energy storage lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAGs) are the two main themes of adaptation to environmental conditions. Basal patterns of lipid compositional profile of Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal gradient in the eastern coast of Australia indicate variations of lipidome associated with climatic patterns. Lipidome data were collected for eight locations along the eastern Australian cline for both sexes in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. To further investigate the relationship between lipidome patterns and environmental factors, we utilized laboratory selection studies using stress conditions including high temperature tolerance, desiccation survival, and chill-coma recovery. Furthermore, to gain insights into possible underlying mechanisms between lipid biosynthesis and stress tolerance, knockdowns using RNA interference (RNAi) for various lipid biosynthesis enzymes were investigated. Observations in geographic patterns in the eastern Australian cline include a higher degree of acclimation in membrane lipids in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE/PC) ratio for higher latitude populations. There are increases of abundance for polyunsaturated and monounsaturated phospholipids as latitude increased Additionally, D. melanogaster populations originated from the only urban population consist of higher abundances for most lipid classes when compared to all other locations along the latitude. In selection studies, PE/PC ratio did not have any noticeable variations under any of the stress selections. There is an increase of diacylglycerols (DAGs) in heat tolerance selected lines, this finding is consistent with the previous study of physiological response to heat stress. Furthermore, there is the unexpected finding of few responses to selection for chill-coma recovery in the laboratory. For RNAi knocked down studies, there is the surprising finding of chill-coma recovery patterns differ significantly between two isoforms of stearoyl-CoA desaturases knockdowns. Moreover, there are decreases in heat tolerance when TAG synthesis was disrupted. The cline study generates patterns of variation in lipids that suggests adaptation in wild populations. Insight into the evolution of lipid composition was obtained from stress-based laboratory selection experiments. Disruptions of lipid biosynthesis pathways provided insight into the relationship between lipids and stress tolerance.

TI  - Lilliput Effect Dynamics across the Cretaceous-Paleogene Mass Extinction: Approaches, Prevalence, and Mechanisms
SP  - 203
AB  - An organism’s body size entails both physiological and ecological costs. Furthermore, as a parameter in analyzing organisms, it represents a fundamental and essential morphometric character. Reductions in size following mass extinction is a commonly observed phenomenon in the fossil record. This study examines the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon termed the: 'Lilliput Effect' by proposing that it represents a rapid evolutionary response to altered selection pressures during a mass extinction. This primary hypothesis is evaluated against two additional hypotheses of size reduction: 1) stunted growth as a response to stressed ecosystems, and/or 2) mass extinctions are size selective. These hypotheses were tested using data from shell size measurements and morphology primarily from molluscs and brachiopods from both North America and Denmark. Morphological differences were evaluated using Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) of outline shape in conjunction with Principle Components and Canonical Variate Analysis. The first part of this study provides a detailed methodology for data collection and analysis. New methods were developed which display promise in improving the degree to which differences and similarities in shape can be elucidated using EFA. These methods were then employed to test hypotheses of morphological change through minor events of local significance in the Florida Neogene and following the K/Pg mass extinction. Data sources for the K/Pg mass extinction were from high resolution (10 cm intervals) collection of bulk samples from the Brazos River in Texas as well as reposited museum specimens for the Braggs locality in Alabama and Danish samples. Study of size and evolution through more minor local events in the fossil record entailed measurements and shape analysis of left valves of bivalves from the genus Chine. Various environmental changes occurred at various points during the Neogene in Florida Neogene, most profoundly documented during the Plio-Pleistocene with accompanying faunal turnover. The Chione specimens analyzed were derived from a discontinuous sequence encompassing ∼18 Ma and represent material from the Miocene Chipola Formation through to the Recent. The size of Chione increased from the Miocene to the Pliocene and then decreased from the Pliocene into the Pleistocene possibly due to lower primary productivity. The later part of the Pleistocene into the Recent was characterized by increased size relative to the early Pleistocene and size was stable through this interval. Morphologically, Chione changed in shape from the Miocene to the Pliocene, but remained in stasis from the Pliocene to the Recent suggesting that stabilizing selection may work well during periods of rapid, minor, environmental perturbations. There were a number of global changes occurring within the late Maastrichtian pr and the results of size measurements of molluscs demonstrate a decrease in size prior to the K/Pg mass extinction in Texas likely in response to a number of global scale events occurring towards the close of the Cretaceous that was also associated with morphological evolution in the small bivalve Breviarca webbervillensis. Paleocene material from Texas was dominated by smaller, newly evolved allochthonous grazing gastropods. These gastropods are thought to be newly evolved lineages as their first occurrence is marked in the Paleocene. Smaller sized nuculid bivalves were also a prominent feature in the Texas Paleocene and showed a rapid size beginning 40 cm above the boundary clay. At Braggs, Alabama, two groups, gastropods and oysters showed decreases in size across the boundary, and these changes are most likely a product of animpoverished Paleocene ecosystem. The pectinids were the only group of bivalve mollusc to reduce in size following extinction in Denmark most likely in response to a reduction in bryozoan substrate which resulted in a very soft coccolith-derived mud substrate in the mass extinction’s aftermath. Size measurements from the Danish brachiopods showed reductions in size across the boundary in all genera except Rugia. There was a marked size reduction in specimens from the upper Maastrichtian at Stevns Klint as compared to the lower Maastrichtian at Mons Klint. The reasons for this are most likely due to lower temperatures at Stevns based on isotope data as well as lower productivity evidenced by lower δ13C values. There was a change in morphology for Terebratulina chrysalis in the earliest Paleogene due to shifted selective pressures favoring increased surface area as an adaptation to softer substrates. Size reduction within Danish sequences is evolutionary in nature as the Danian is characterized by different species within existing Maastrichtian genera and two new genera. The results of this study demonstrate that changes in body size can be a result of evolution from changing selective pressures as well as ecological perturbations. Distinguishing evolutionary forcings from ecological requires the collection and understanding of morphological data. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.)

TI  - Population genetic structure and reproductive ecology of Crocodylus across local and regional scales
SP  - 194
AB  - New world crocodilians constitute a monophyletic group comprising four species: Crocodylus rhombifer (Cuban crocodile), Crocodylus acutus (American crocodile), Crocodylus intermedius (Orinoco crocodile), and Crocodylus moreletii (Morelet’s crocodile). All of these are in the IUCN Red list of Threatened Species and exhibit geographic distributions covering small to widespread ranges across the Americas and insular Caribbean. With the overarching goal of generating relevant information for the conservation of endangered new world crocodilians, this dissertation integrates genetic and ecological information to provide a context spanning a scale from the species level to specific populations, to analyses of mating systems and breeding strategies in Crocodylus. In addition, my research applies tools of ecological inference to model the influence of environmental factors and natural habitat disturbances in the reproductive success of Crocodylus using a long-term dataset. This work uses C. intermedius and C. acutus as model species to explore four focal questions organized in distinct chapters related to the biology and ecology of crocodilians. In Chapter I, I compare previously reported reproductive traits among C. acutus populations across its geographic range. This comparative analysis reveals a high degree of variability in reproductive traits across C. acutus range and provides potential adaptive explanations for the patterns observed. Crocodylus acutus appears to be one of the most adaptable of crocodilians in terms of nesting requirements, total nests per breeding season, nest mode (hole vs. mound), timing of egg-laying, female minimum reproductive size, clutch size, female nest defence behavior, and female parental care. Besides regional comparisons, this chapter focuses on the largest nesting population of C. acutus located in southeastern Cuba, where the species still occurs at its natural population numbers. In Chapter II, I use molecular tools to elucidate the mating system of the Orinoco crocodile in a reintroduced population in the Llanos of Venezuela. Analyzing 17 polymorphic microsatellite loci from 20 clutches I found multiple paternity in C. intermedius, with half of the clutches fathered by two or three males. Sixteen mothers and 14 fathers were inferred by reconstruction of multilocus parental genotypes. Results showed skewed paternal contributions to multiple-sired clutches in four of the clutches (40%), leading to an overall unequal contribution of offspring among fathers with six of the 14 inferred males fathering 90% of the total offspring, and three of those six males fathering more than 70% of the total offspring. Results of this chapter provide the first evidence of multiple paternity occurring in the Orinoco crocodile and confirm the success of reintroduction efforts of this critically endangered species in Venezuela. In Chapter III, I apply generalized linear mixed models to infer the effect of tropical cyclones and environmental variability on the nesting success of C. acutus in the largest nesting population of the species in southeastern Cuba for a period of 21 years. Results of this chapter report the highest-density nesting for the species documented to date, and one of the highest densities of nesting in relation to other crocodilian species, with an average of 164 nests per year and a density of 17 nests per hectare. Two of the five analyzed nesting sites had consistently higher nests and higher nesting success for the whole 21-year period. Much of the temporal variation in nesting success could be explained by the occurrence of tropical cyclones. I found that occurrence of tropical cyclones within a nesting season negatively affected nesting success, whereas the occurrence of tropical cyclones one or two years before the nesting season positively affected nesting success. Additionally, results of this chapter suggest that higher ambient temperature negatively affected nesting success. Higher-intensity tropical cyclones are expected to strike the coasts of Cuba due to climate change, potentially devastating C. acutus nests if they occur during the nesting season. As the recruitment of C. acutus populations in Cuba heavily rely on nesting success, we propose incorporating information on crocodilian’s nesting success and density, as well as the impact of tropical cyclones on the latter, as key components of coastal resilience when designing plans for coastal adaptation in the context of climate change. In the last chapter, I employed data on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and 12 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci to assess the degree of population structure of C. acutus between and among localities in South America, North America, Central America and the Greater Antilles. All analyses for both mtDNA and nuclear markers show evidence of strong population genetic structure in the American crocodile, with unique populations in each of the sampling localities. My research results reinforce previous findings showing the greatest degree of genetic differentiation between the continental C. acutus and the Greater Antillean C. acutus. Three new haplotypes unique to Venezuela were reported. These were considerably less distant from Central and North American haplotypes than Greater Antillean haplotypes. Overall evidence of this chapter suggests that Cuban and Jamaican C. acutus share a mtDNA haplotype but currently represent at least two different genetic populations when using nuclear, faster evolving, microsatellite markers. Findings of this chapter offer the first evidence of genetic differentiation among the populations of Greater Antillean C. acutus, the first ever reported haplotypes for the species in Venezuela, and provide important information for the regional planning and in-situ conservation of the species. In conclusion, research findings of my dissertation are the product of combining ecological data collected in the field, genetic data generated in the lab, and the use of a suite of classic and inference-based methodological approaches to gain a better understanding of the behavior and evolution of crocodilians. The dissertation presents the first genetic research on C. intermedius, shows the importance of coastal mangrove conservation for the persistence of C. acutus in Cuba, and depicts phylogeographic linkages among distinct C. acutus populations across the Americas and Greater Antilles. The outcomes of this research provide science-based information to influence decision-making processes for the conservation of threatened crocodilians and their habitats across the study areas.

AB  - Ips typographus (European spruce bark beetle) is economically and ecologically a very important species in European forests. As a tree parasite, it causes significant damage to spruce forests in Europe. From the ecological point of view, it is involved in the first step of the decomposition of a weakened or diseased spruce tree. Its development is influenced by abiotic factors, such as temperature, as well as biotic factors, e.g. bark thickness and particularly its predators and parasitoids. The survey was conducted in the altimontane elevation belt of Slovenia (Pohorje), where there are a lot of spruce forests, which is why the area is a potential target for mass attacks of I. typographus. In our study we tried to determine the effects of temperature on the colonization of a felled spruce tree and on the development time of I. typographus. We also analyzed the saproxylic community associated with the European spruce bark beetle. We tried to establish the parasitoid and predatory complex of the discussed species. We also examined the effects of altitude (temperature) and type of forest and the impact of sampling year on the abundance of bark beetles, their predators and parasitoids, as well as the diversity of the mentioned groups of insects. In addition, the effects of natural enemies on the population of I. typographus were assessed. Average daily temperatures of our research locations from mid-May to late August were between 13.1 and 15.5°C. Bark thickness of our samples was between 4 and 7 mm. We had established that the temperature of the microhabitat inhabited by I. typographus differs from the air temperature in the proximity of the tree by as much as 3°C. Also, temperatures of microlocations on the same trunk were quite different because of their orientation and exposure to direct solar irradiation. The differences were as high as 2.3°C. The European spruce bark beetle prefers to colonize those parts of the trunk that have higher under-bark temperatures, and these were also the locations where the brood developed more rapidly. We found a positive correlation between temperatures and the number of adult specimens of I. typographus. The effective temperature sums needed for development of one generations were 661 degree days. The number of I. typographus adults decreased with increasing bark thickness, however, this was not statistically significant. In Kladje (1304 m altitude), I. typographus developed one generation in the year of our research. The time needed for development of this generation was between 60 and 86 days (73 days on average). In the three years of our research, we found 62 species that inhabit the spruce tree in the first year of colonization. We found 9 species of bark beetles, 12 species of parasitoids and 27 species of predators of bark beetles. The most abundant species was I. typographus with 5216 individuals. The predatory and parasitoid complex of this species was identified. The most important predatory species were Thanasimus formicarius (Coleoptera) (83 individuals) and species of Medetera (88 individuals) and Lonchaea (Diptera) (170 individuals). By far the most important parasitoid was Roptrocerus xylophagorum (Hymenoptera) with 1072 individuals. We found out that the number of predators and parasitoids increased in the second year of our study. In addition, we observed lower parasitoid diversity at highest altitudes and in a spruce monoculture. I. typographus emerges from the bark at roughly the same time as its most common parasitoid R. xylophagorum, however, predators emerge with one-week delay. Predators and parasitoids had an important impact on population of I. typographus, as it decreased by 40% in the first year and by as much as 68% in the second year. The predators caused 50% of I. typographus’ mortality, while parasitoids only caused 12%.

TI  - The influence of climate change and evolution on mosquito life history traits and pathogen transmission
SP  - 87
AB  - Many aspects of mosquito biology are highly sensitive to variation in temperature, which has led to predictions that climate change will alter the transmission of many vector-borne pathogens. However, it is unknown how mosquitoes will evolve in response to changing climates. We utilized common garden experiments and novel time-compressed climate change scenarios to examine standing geographic variation, species variation, and evolutionary change in the temperature dependence of four life history traits of mosquitoes (larval and adult survival, development rate, and biting rate). First, we quantified spatial variation in life history traits for four populations of Culex pipiens mosquitoes, a primary vector of West Nile Virus in North America, to examine the extent to which mosquitoes might be adapted to local thermal environments. We found substantial variation in life history traits among mosquito populations that was uncorrelated with local thermal conditions. This variation will shape the response of mosquito species to changing climates and will make the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease more variable and less predictable than previously thought. Second, we quantified variation in life history traits and vectorial capacity for the two dominant mosquito vectors of Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Differences in life history traits were mixed with Ae. albopictus having faster development, higher larval survival, and more frequent feeding, whereas Ae. aegypti had higher adult survival. Ae. aegypti was a slightly more efficient vector of all four viruses, and vectorial capacity was highest for yellow fever virus followed by Zika, Chikungunya and dengue. Lastly, we reared Ae. aegypti under three rates of temperature increase (+2°C, +4°C, and +5°C) and three control conditions (a 2°C decrease, and two temperature profiles with no net change) for one year to examine the potential evolutionary response to climate change. Although there was significant among-treatment variation in four life history traits between the starting population and the six climate treatments, these differences were uncorrelated with the temperature regime the mosquitoes experienced, suggesting that the mosquitoes were adapting more to the increased variance in temperatures in the experiment than the differences in mean temperature.

TI  - Latitudinal variation of life history strategies in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis
SP  - 43
AB  - How organisms allocate resources to growth, reproduction, and body maintenance is expected to vary along latitudinal gradients. Two hypotheses explaining latitudinal variation are local adaptation and counter-gradient variation. The local adaptation hypothesis proposes that populations do best in their source location and, as a result, do less well in other environments. The counter gradient hypothesis proposes that one population out performs others across an environmental gradient because the first population’s source location has greater selective pressure than other locations. Temperature is one selective pressure that varies along latitudinal gradients, and life histories are expected to be sensitive to the variation. We test local adaptation and counter-gradient variation in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis. We looked at patterns of reproduction in populations from Wisconsin (high latitude), Indiana (medium latitude) and Oklahoma (low latitude). Carcass preparation, reproductive success, and developmental timelines were quantified at temperatures representing typical environmental conditions of the breeding months for each population. Along a latitudinal range N. orbicollis, show variation in their ability to initiate reproduction, successfully rear offspring, and the number of offspring they are able to raise on a carcass. This variation suggest local adaptation in that, (1) beetles are less likely to initiate breeding at extreme temperatures, especially when that temperature is representative of ones experienced in their source range; (2) once beetles initiate reproduction, source populations produce relatively larger broods, and are more successful at source location temperature extremes. This experiment shows that N. orbicollis is able to use temperature as a reliable environmental cue to determine whether or not reproduction should be initiated, providing unique insight into how behavior modification can be used to avoid costly reproductive attempts. However, all other measurements of developmental timelines in our experiment (i.e. number of days to prepare a carcass, eggs laid, feeding hole, 1st instar arrival on carcass, and days developing on the carcass) were only affected by temperature. This suggests a temperature tolerance constraint that may be shaping reproductive behavior and distribution. This research gives unique insight into how N. orbicollis cope with temperature conditions along latitudinal gradients by behaviorally avoiding costly reproductive attempts.

TI  - Reproductive and molecular ecology of the european lobster: implications for conservation management
AB  - The European lobster (Homarus gammarus) is an ecologically important benthic decapod which supports fisheries that are critical to the economic prosperity of coastal communities. However, populations across its range are pressured by rising exploitation, from which management has failed to prevent stock collapses in the recent past. Fisheries management of the species is significantly hindered by deficiencies in our knowledge of fundamental characteristics of population biology, including the connectivity and genetic diversity of stocks. As a result, the effectiveness of strategies designed to conserve recruitment and ensure harvests are sustainable is poorly understood. This thesis focuses on elucidating aspects of reproductive and molecular ecology in H. gammarus which can be used to inform and appraise conservation management initiatives, currently applied via both the regulation of capture and the wild release of hatchery-reared juveniles. The size-specific fecundity of reproducing females was defined around southwestern UK, and spatial variation in clutch size between populations was linked to a longitudinal gradient in oceanic temperature range across Northern Europe. The reconstruction of paternal genotypes show that single males fertilise individual clutches, which hints at demographic stability within a productive Atlantic fishery. Population genetic structure, investigated at a fine spatial scale in the same region, evidenced high connectivity and suggests that the localised interventions of an active hatchery do not lead to juveniles being released beyond areas they might naturally recruit via planktonic dispersal. However, genetic differentiation and isolation-by-distance at a broad geographic scale indicate that direct gene flow between remote populations is limited, so that (i) a failure to maintain spawning stock biomass may negatively affect local recruitment, (ii) the utilisation of non-resident broodstock for hatchery stocking may cause a loss of adaptive potential, and (iii) the recovery of depleted stocks is likely to be problematic. Finally, simulations indicated that genetic parentage assignment will prove accurate in distinguishing cultured individuals from natural stock among admixed populations in the wild, an important development that should facilitate the optimisation of hatchery stocking and lead to rigorous assessments of the conservation value of releasing lobsters reared in captivity.

TI  - Physiological and Ecological Impacts of Changing Environmental Temperatures on Bees
SP  - 190
AB  - In this dissertation, I investigated the mechanistic basis for the effects of changing temperatures on bees. Physiological impacts of changing temperatures on bees were assessed by investigating the levels of energy stores and the composition of lipids and the ecological impacts were assessed by studying the role of temperatures in determining bee-parasite interactions. I developed and validated an optimized protocol for extraction and quantification of three major energy substrates (lipids, sugars and glycogen) for application with bees. The fraction of total energy contributed by lipids, sugars and glycogen varied with body size and across altitude for bumblebees but was invariant for honey bees. Prevalence and loads of Nosema cerana, the only parasite detected in bumblebees, was reduced at high altitudes relative to low altitudes. No parasites were detected in honey bees with the exception of one sample, which likely had Crithidia spp. (to be confirmed through sequencing of the PCR product). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis of fatty acid composition revealed significant differences among bee genera that differed in thermal physiology and feeding behavior. Organisms take advantage of a diversity in lipid types to alter membrane lipid composition thereby maintaining membrane fluidity, and thus membrane functionality across a wide range of temperatures, as proposed by the homeoviscous adaptation (HVA) hypothesis (Sinensky 1974). Bees collected across altitudes and the growing season had changes in lipid composition as would be predicted by the HVA hypothesis, likely in response to colder temperatures at higher altitudes and early in spring and warmer temperatures at low altitudes and later in the summer. These variations in lipid composition (in particular, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, UFA:SFA and the unsaturation index) may arise from variation in the lipid composition of the pollen, the primary food source, or may be a direct physiological response to the temperatures bees experience. I therefore assessed the effects of acclimation to three temperature cycles for four days on lipid composition of bees. I found no change in unsaturation index for these temperature-treated bees but body size was a covariate, which determined the effects of acclimated temperatures on UFA:SFA. Future studies should go further deeper and assess the quantities of energy in different body compartments as decrease in one substrate in a given part may be contrasted by an increase in quantity of the same substrate in another part. Further, investigation on the effects of temperatures in energy levels and bee-parasite interaction should be conducted at molecular levels with increased sample size. In regards to the fatty acid composition, assessing fatty acid composition in different body parts and using techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to determine actual fluidity of the membranes will provide better insights into the topic. Last but not the least, assessment of acclimation effects on fatty acid composition needs to be rigorously and clearly done over a longer-time period, particularly over generations to get a better understanding into how acclimation to varying temperatures at different time periods affects the fatty acid composition in organisms.

TI  - Genotypic and Phenotypic Dynamics of Adaptation in Experimentally Evolved Escherichia coli
SP  - 162
AB  - Despite its centrality to Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection, the process of adaptation is still not fully understood. In particular, the dynamics of the genotypes and phenotypes associated with an adaptive response remain to be fully elucidated. In my dissertation, I utilized laboratory evolution experiments to study how the genotypes and phenotypes of Escherichia coli change over time as they adapted to high temperature. Chapter 1 explored how metabolic phenotypes of 115 evolved E. coli clones changed as a result of 2,000 generations of adaptation to 42.2°C. Using phenotypic microarrays (Biolog plates), I quantified 94 phenotypes of these evolved clones, as well as their ancestor under stressed (42.2°C) and unstressed (37.0°C) conditions. Comparing the evolved phenotypes to the ancestral phenotypes revealed that adaptation was predominantly restorative, shifting evolved phenotypes from the stress state toward the unstressed state. I also uncovered associations among common genotypic changes found in the evolved clones and their phenotypes. Chapter 2 investigated the different mutational dynamics in populations traversing two different adaptive pathways typified by mutations in the rpoB and rho genes, respectively. These genes were predicted to be differentially pleiotropic, and were therefore expected to create differences in compensatory evolution when mutated. I used temporal sequencing data of four rpoB and four rho populations to reconstruct their mutational trajectories over the course of adaptation to 42.2°C. These trajectories revealed that rpoB and rho mutations occurred early on during adaptation, canalizing the adaptive process. Furthermore, rpoB populations accumulated more mutations and experienced more clonal interference over the course of adaptation than rho populations. Chapter 3 was a study of the Lazarus effect, a phenomenon of population recovery under lethal selection conditions. I evolved ∼300 E. coli populations to the lethal temperature of 43.0°C and measured their cell density over five days. I sequenced those populations that recovered and found mutations in two operons—hslUV and rpoBC—to be the major drivers of Lazarus events. These mutations differed in their frequency in the experiment, degree of parallelism within and between weeks, and fitness tradeoffs at 37.0°C, suggesting different origins and adaptive dynamics between them.

TI  - Automation, Optimization, and Characterization of Adaptive Laboratory Evolution
SP  - 125
AB  - Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has emerged as an effective tool for scientific discovery and addressing biotechnological needs. A typical ALE experiment requires significant attention over the course of the experiment and can last up to months. When designing such experiments much consideration is given to the logistics of maintaining the experiment. Due to the difficult logistics, the consistency and throughput are often reduced. Overcoming these shortcoming is now possible with an automated platform. The automated platform was designed and built giving consideration to alleviating the design constraint that the time-sensitive processes impose on the experiment. Much of ALE’s utility is derived from reproducibly obtained fitness increases. Identifying causal genetic changes and their combinatorial effects is challenging and time-consuming. Understanding how these genetic changes enable increased fitness can be difficult. A series of approaches that address these challenges was developed and demonstrated using Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 on glucose minimal media at 37ºC. By keeping E. coli in constant substrate-excess and exponential growth, fitness increases up to 1.6-fold were obtained over wild-type. These increases are comparable to previously-reported maximum growth rates in similar conditions but obtained over a shorter time frame. Across the 8 replicate ALE experiments performed, causal mutations were identified using three approaches: identifying mutations in the same gene/region across replicate experiments, sequencing strains before and after computationally-determined fitness jumps, and allelic replacement coupled with targeted ALE of reconstructed strains. Three genetic regions were most often mutated: the global transcription gene rpoB, an 82bp deletion between the metabolic pyrE gene and rph, and an IS element between the DNA structural gene hns and tdk. Model-derived classification of gene expression revealed a number of processes important for increased growth that were missed using a gene classification system alone. The methods put forth here represent a powerful combination of technologies to increase the speed and efficiency of ALE studies. The identified mutations can be examined as genetic parts for increasing growth rate in a desired strain and for understanding rapid growth phenotypes. The evolution process is increasingly being leveraged in laboratory settings for industrial and basic science applications. Despite an increasing deployment, there are no standardized procedures available for designing and performing adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) experiments. Thus, there is a need to optimize the experimental design, specifically for determining termination criteria and for balancing outcomes with available resources (i.e., lab supplies, personnel, and time). To design and better understand ALE experiments, a simulator, ALEsim, was developed, validated, and applied to optimize ALE experimentation. The effects of various passage sizes were experimentally determined and subsequently evaluated with ALEsim to explain differences in experimental outcomes. Further, a beneficial mutation rate of 10-6.9-10-8.4 mutations per cell division was derived. A retrospective analysis of ALE experiments revealed that passage sizes typically employed in batch culture ALE experiments led to inefficient production and fixation of beneficial mutations. ALEsim and the results herein will aid in the design of ALE experiments to fit the exact needs of the project while taking into account the tradeoff in resources required, and lower the barrier of entry to this experimental technique. With successful completion of an automated ALE platform and multiple applied cases, there became a need to expand the ALE protocol for variations of ALE. Specifically to accommodate adaptation to environments that cannot initially sustain growth. Two algorithms were developed to implement two variations of ALE, pathway activation of latent enzymes (PALE ALE) and tolerization (TALE). The purpose of the PALE ALE protocol was to adapt and organism to growth using a substrate is it natively is unable to utilize. An algorithm was developed to put significant selection pressure on the population to adapt all while maximizing the amount of genetic diversity being created. The purpose of the TALE module is to adapt an organism to an increasing amount of stress (e.g. temperature, physical, chemical, etc…). The algorithm specifically targeted putting enough stress on the culture as reasonable but also ensuring that the culture is still able to grow. This is critical since if growth is arrested the genetic diversity in the culture drops off significantly. These two algorithms were successfully implemented into the automated ALE platform.

TI  - Quantitative proteomic and metabolomic characterization of glucose transporter mutant promastigotes of leishmania mexicana
AB  - Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania possess a highly adaptable metabolic system which ensures their survival in two significantly contrasting in terms of metabolism hosts. A critical component of leishmanial metabolic machinery is the central carbon metabolism which encompasses a major fraction of metabolites and constitutively expressed enzymes whose localization, function, and manner of regulation in response to changes in nutrient levels in the different host niches, however, remain unclear. In a quest to elucidate how the Leishmania parasites overcome conditions with diminished levels of the primary nutrient D-glucose, a null-mutant cell line that was deprived of the ability to acquire the hexose by genetic ablation of three related glucose transporters was created. As previously shown, the glucose transport deficiency in the null-mutant Leishmania mexicana (Δlmgt) is associated with reduced growth of the promastigote form in an axenic culture and the sand fly vector, no detectable utilization of the sugars D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, D-galactose, and D-ribose, reduced biosynthesis of sugar-containing glycoconjugates and virulence factors, increased sensitivity to nutrient starvation, elevated temperatures, and oxidative stress, and dramatically reduced levels of growth and parasitemia of the amastigote form in an axenic culture and macrophages. Considering all phenotypic characteristics observed previously, the main aims of this study were to determine whether the Δlmgt promastigotes use alternative carbon and energy sources, to investigate which pathways are altered as a result of possible utilization of alternative carbon sources, and to illustrate, as comprehensively as possible, the molecular events behind the changes in the central carbon metabolism in the Δlmgt promastigotes. For that purpose, a number of proteomic and metabolomic techniques were applied to identify and quantify modulations in protein and metabolite abundance in the Δlmgt promastigotes. The results revealed that the main energy and carbon sources for the Δlmgt promastigotes appear to be amino acids, with the tricarboxylic acid cycle playing a central role in amino acid catabolism. Furthermore, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, mannose metabolism, purine salvage pathway, and β-oxidation of fatty acids were also among the pathways affected by the glucose transporter incapacity of the Δlmgt promastigotes. Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis was shown to operate in a gluconeogenic mode and to be used for the synthesis of hexose phosphates. The oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutathione metabolism were found to be down-regulated in the Δlmgt promastigotes, which is believed to be the main reason behind the increased sensitivity of these parasites to oxidative stress. Mannose metabolism, which provides activated substrates for the synthesis of the variety of leishmanial secreted and membrane-bound glycoconjugates and the carbohydrate reserve material and virulence factor mannogen, was also down-regulated and that finding corroborated with the previous observation of reduced glycoconjugate and mannogen synthesis in the Δlmgt promastigotes. Pyrimidine metabolism was not significantly modulated but the purine salvage pathway was down-regulated in the Δlmgt promastigotes. Nonetheless, the Δlmgt promastigotes appear to salvage ribose from nucleotide degradation and recycle it for the synthesis of new nucleotides. β-Oxidation of fatty acids was also decreased in the Δlmgt promastigotes, suggesting that lipids are not a major source of energy for these cells. Altogether, the data showed that the Δlmgt promastigotes i/ decrease high energy-consuming processes such as DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, ii/ rely heavily on amino acid catabolism via the tricarboxylic acid cycle for energy generation, iii/ use alternative carbon sources for the production of biosynthetic precursors, iv/ have reduced capabilities to synthesize key metabolites such as sugar phosphates and sugar-containing macromolecules, and v/ are characterised with impaired regeneration of the antioxidant defence system and decreased production of virulence factors which appear to determine the susceptibility of these organisms to oxidative stress.

AB  - This project explores a situation where two distinctive species hybridize extensively at zones of contact yet appear not to be collapsing into a single species. Lack of impending merger is inferred when regions made up of organisms of mixed ancestry (‘hybrid zones’) are not increasing in extent but instead are stable. There is growing recognition that this phenomenon is common nature. Several forces have been proposed to function in preventing lineage merger in these situations. Selection for different ecological conditions (‘exogenous selection’) is widely acknowledged to maintain species limits, especially when the contacting lineages are associated with different habitats. Genome incompatibilities (when hybridization leads to the breakdown of co-adapted gene complexes, or ‘endogenous selection’) have also been cited as contributing to hybrid zone stability. Positive assortative mating, where individuals preferentially mate with similar individuals, has also been put forward as a process that could prevent the merger of species. Two species of lungless salamanders, Plethodon shermani and P. teyahalee, have parapatric distributions in the southern Appalachian Mountains and form hybrid zones where their distributions meet. I investigated hybrid zone stability and potential factors maintaining species limits between these salamanders. In Chapter 1, I use coalescent simulations to identify a lower bound on the timing of secondary contact, which in turn leads to an expected hybrid zone extent under a model of neutral diffusion. By comparing observed and expected hybrid zone extent, I show that the two species are not in the process of freely merging despite extensive introgression of molecular markers. In Chapter 2, I evaluate predictions of ex- and endogenous selection using ground-level temperature data and character clines fitted to molecular and morphological data. I find evidence for exogenous selection but not for endogenous selection. In Chapter 3 I present data from courtship trials performed in the laboratory that reveal that despite frequent interspecific hybridization, these two species show a preference for conspecifics. These findings shed light on Plethodon hybrid zone dynamics and the maintenance of species limits for hybridizing species.

TI  - Climate, embryonic development, and potential for adaptation to warming water temperatures by Bristol Bay sockeye salmon
SP  - 111
AB  - Rapidly warming water temperatures associated with climate change represent a substantial disturbance to the habitat of aquatic ectothermic organisms. For salmonid fishes (family Salmonidae), early life history survival and timing of reproduction and development are closely tied to temperature, such that altered thermal regimes could alter patterns of survival or shift phenology into a mismatch with the environment. Because temperature is the dominant driver of developmental rates, empirical statistical models have been developed to predict the timing of hatching and fry emergence based on incubation temperature. In this thesis I explored how the timing of hatching and emergence may shift in response to warming temperatures and how spawning timing across an Alaskan landscape is shaped by incubation temperatures experienced by sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) embryos and alevin. Additionally, I quantified the relative roles of genetics and environmentally induced plasticity on the timing of hatching in two populations of sockeye salmon from the Iliamna Lake system, Alaska by rearing them in common garden conditions in the laboratory. To meet these goals I reformulated a widely cited developmental model to incorporate variability in natural regimes and use it to predict hatching timing over the course of the spawning duration for 25 populations of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon. Additionally, I hind- and forecasted lake temperature based off historical and predicted air temperatures to estimate and predict hatching for a single population. I found that predicted hatching timing for wild populations varied between 58 and 260 days, and was largely variable as a result of habitat thermal heterogeneity and parental spawn time. I also predicted a three-week decrease in hatching timing over the course of the next century for a single beach spawning population, which was just beyond historic variability. Counter to expectations, for a subset of populations hatching and emergence timing variability exceeded that of spawning timing, indicating the relationship between spawning timing and incubation temperature may be weaker than expected. The results of the common garden experiment revealed indistinguishable differences between populations in hatching timing across five temperature scenarios, but strong plasticity as timing differed between 74 and 189 days in the warmest to coolest treatment. Furthermore, I detected family-specific differences in hatching timing both within and among treatments, consistent with heritable developmental rates and gene by environment interactions in days to hatch, where the interaction between treatment and family was as high as 10 days difference in hatching. Population or family-specific survival in this experiment did not differ in response to temperature suggesting a lack of thermal adaptation in this regard during this life stage in these populations. Alevin mass and length upon hatching varied little among treatments (<10%), but did significantly decrease with cooling temperatures. Taken as a whole this study indicates that the effects of climate change during the early life history stages may be buffered by phenotypic plasticity and variability in populations and habitats will be important for maintaining diversity in the face of climate change.

TI  - A Qualitative Analysis of the Drivers of Employee Disengagement across Four Generations of U.S. Employees
SP  - 119
AB  - Employee disengagement is an emerging phenomenon in the workplace, and is defined as the absence of engagement. This generic qualitative study explored the drivers of employee disengagement and whether or not the drivers are the same across the four generations of workers in the United States workforce. It is estimated that 70 % of American employees are disengaged resulting in lost productivity totaling approximately $450 to $550 billion. The study explored the drivers of employee disengagement and was conducted through semi-structured interviews of randomly selected workers from each generation residing in the tri-county region of Southern Florida. The participants were employed in sectors such as Education, Healthcare, Accounting, Information Technology, Hospitality, Sales, Animal Services, Office Clerical, Retail, Library Services and Construction. The results of the study indicate six emergent themes (1) respect and recognition from management (2) communication between management and employees (3) quality of leadership (4) confidence in management and the delivery of rewards (5) the physical surroundings and the work itself and (6) technology. The results led to the conclusion that three of the six themes were drivers of disengagement. Employees tended to disengage when there was a lack of respect and recognition; when communication was inadequate or missing and when the quality of leadership was weak. Recommendations are for continuous training for managers on the value of showing respect and recognition to their employees; regular meetings should be mandated to improve communication and HRM practitioners should devise a way to quickly enhance or replace any signs of weak leadership within the organization. Implementation of these measures it is believed would effectively reduce disengagement among workers. It is also recommended that additional research be conducted from a quantitative approach using a larger sample to establish the validity of the factors as indeed drivers of disengagement. Future research may also be able to provide valuable information for HRM policy makers as they continue to work towards reducing the impact of employee disengagement in the United States.

TI  - Anthropogenic Impacts on Native Olympia Oysters: Understanding the Roles of Local Adaptation and Multiple Stressors
SP  - 168
AB  - The effects of anthropogenic global change on organismal performance and ecosystem functioning have been investigated across many systems. However, our ability to project future effects is limited by many uncertainties. For example, there is a pressing need to understand how multiple stressors interact and how populations of the same species vary in their response to environmental stress. This dissertation assesses impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), a foundation species of conservation concern in west coast estuaries. In particular, I tested whether populations of Olympia oysters are differentially susceptible to low salinity and predation pressure from invasive species and whether the timing of multiple climate-related stressors affects oyster survival. First, using oysters raised under common laboratory conditions for up to two generations, I assessed whether populations of Olympia oysters are locally adapted to their home sites and whether such adaptive differentiation leads to some oyster populations that are more tolerant than others of extreme low salinity. Field experiments revealed results that were consistent with local adaptation and laboratory experiments demonstrated that second-generation oysters from the site that experienced low salinity most frequently were more robust in the face of extreme low salinity events than oysters from other sites. These results suggest that environmental conditions may select for robust phenotypes in certain regions. Second, I tested whether Olympia oysters could detect and respond to invasive predator cues and whether the response varied among populations based on their evolutionary histories with the predators. All oyster populations detected waterborne predator cues and responded with antipredator morphological changes. However, the magnitude of the response differed among populations with laboratory-reared, second-generation oysters originating from the site with the highest predator density exhibiting the greatest response. The evidence suggests that some oyster populations may have undergone rapid evolution of cue sensitivity in the face of an invasive predator. Lastly, I examined the effects of multiple stressors (low salinity and high air temperature) and different amounts of time between stressors on Olympia oyster survival. When applied coincidentally, these stressors resulted in synergistic effects, with oysters exhibiting higher mortality than expected based on adding single stressor effects. However, when stressors were decoupled by two or four weeks, the synergistic effects were eliminated, suggesting that the temporal patterns of stressors in nature may have profound effects for the vulnerability of organisms. Collectively, my dissertation chapters further our understanding of factors that mediate the response of coastal marine organisms to stress. In particular, the fact that populations of the same species may respond differently to stress is critical in predicting anthropogenic impacts and managing species of concern. Additionally, an understanding of temporal patterning of multiple stressors will likely improve projections regarding how organisms and ecosystems will fare in a rapidly changing world.

TI  - Exercise, Emotion, and Executive Control
SP  - 178
AB  - Both acute and habitual exercise are consistently associated with a number of benefits to physical and mental health, including cardiovascular function, body weight, mood, and cognition. For instance, habitual exercise improves mood, such as depressive symptoms in individuals with major depressive disorders, and acute exercise elevates emotion during and after exercise, particularly in physically fit individuals. Both habitual and acute exercise may also influence domain general cognitive control, such as response inhibition and selective attention, and domain specific cognitive control, such as the cognitive control of emotion. The present series of three experiments evaluated how both habitual and acute exercise relate to mood, emotion, domain general cognitive control, and the cognitive control of emotion, specifically cognitive reappraisal success. The first experiment employed a cross-sectional design and found that habitual exercise predicted lower depression and anxiety and enhanced domain general cognitive control and cognitive reappraisal success. The second experiment utilized near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to track time-dependent changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (O2 Hb and dHb) levels in the PFC as a function of parametrically manipulated target exercise intensity during relatively short bouts of acute exercise, i.e. 30 minutes cycling. NIRS is an ideal method to measure changes in O 2Hb and dHb levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to better understand the locus of exercise-related changes in emotion and cognitive processes. O2Hb and dHb levels in the PFC, as well as positive emotion, increased as a function of both exercise intensity and duration. The third experiment elongated the exercise duration to a 90 minute run, and found that such endurance exercise elevated positive emotion. The run reduced PFC oxygenation, but did not influence domain general cognitive control or the cognitive control of emotion. In sum, the present experiments suggest that habitual exercise predicts enhanced mood, cognitive control, and the cognitive control of emotion, and whereas acute exercise appears to enhance emotion regardless of the duration, future research is necessary to pinpoint the intensity at which exercise influences domain general cognitive control and the cognitive control of emotion.

TI  - Environmental, biological, and genetic factors influencing local adaptation of Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in Auke Creek, Alaska
SP  - 150
AB  - Pacific salmon form distinct, locally adapted populations because of the spatial and temporal precision with which they home to their natal streams. Local adaptation is recognized as an important component underlying the productivity and sustainability of salmonid populations, yet there remains uncertainty of the scale at which it occurs. This uncertainty was addressed by analysis of demographic, genetic, and experimental data collected from seasonally structured brood lines of Pink Salmon that spawn in Auke Creek, Alaska. An extensive background of research on this system has indicated that the timing of the adult and juvenile migrations is closely aligned with fitness and productivity in this stream; this background provided a framework for synthesizing the results of the analyses to address these questions: (1) What ecological factors influence productivity of the freshwater and marine life history stages; (2) Do these factors suggest a mechanism for evolution of migration time; (3) What are the consequences of disrupting fine-scale local adaptation of migration time? Freshwater productivity appeared to be influenced primarily by competition for spawning habitat, rather than variability in environmental conditions. Marine productivity, conversely, was associated with physical processes that influence survival of juveniles in the nearshore environment. Consistent with these findings, genetic evolution of earlier migration time, which was observed in both adults and juveniles over two generations, appeared to be driven by earlier vernal warming of the nearshore environment. Despite these environmental changes and resulting selection against late-migrating fish, recruitment to Auke Creek has remained stable, thereby indicating that seasonal structure of migration time has supported sustained productivity in a changing climate. Experimental relaxation of natural barriers to gene flow that maintain the seasonal structure resulted in intermediate adult migration times in two generations of hybrid fish. These patterns were consistent with an additive genetic basis for migration time and suggest that ecological outbreeding depression is a post-zygotic mechanism that maintains adaptive variation of migration time in Auke Creek. Collectively, these results provide evidence that fine-scale local adaptation can enhance productivity of salmonid populations while providing resilience to climate change.

TI  - The influence of abiotic and biotic environmental factors at high elevation on the life cycle of a facultatively paedomorphic salamander
SP  - 42
AB  - Environmentally cued polymorphisms are excellent models for studying the origins of phenotypic plasticity. Facultative paedomorphosis in salamanders is a form of discrete phenotypic plasticity in which aquatic larvae respond to environmental cues by either metamorphosing into a terrestrial subadult (complex life cycle) or maturing as a paedomorph in the aquatic larval body form (simple life cycle). There are two proposed selective mechanisms for the maintenance of paedomorphosis in salamanders: (1) “paedomorph advantage” (PA), in which a favorable aquatic habitat offers greater fitness to larger individuals than the terrestrial habitat and smaller individuals metamorphose to escape competition and (2) “best of a bad lot” (BBL), in which small individuals maximize fitness in a growth-limiting environment by forgoing metamorphosis thereby allowing reproduction during the first breeding season and large individuals metamorphose to escape the suboptimal aquatic habitat. In this study, I examined the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the life cycles of a facultatively paedomorphic salamander, Ambystoma talpoideum, at the highest elevation within its range in the southern Appalachian Mountains in western North Carolina. This species has been studied extensively at low elevations, but the selective factors of the environment may be different at high elevations. This study consisted of three parts: (1) field surveys to characterize the breeding phenology and population structure, (2) a mesocosm experiment manipulating temperature to determine the selective mechanism of facultative paedomorphosis in these populations, and (3) aggression trials between metamorphic A. talpoideum and a fully terrestrial salamander endemic to this region to explore the potential for competitive exclusion of metamorphic A. talpoideum in the terrestrial environment. Field surveys revealed that these high-elevation populations are majority paedomorphic, and paedomorphs can breed after metamorphs have left the wetland. While temperature did not have an effect on the final body size of larvae in the mesocosm experiment, density did. No individuals metamorphosed before the first breeding season, but some metamorphosed the following spring. Individuals that grew to a larger body size were more likely to metamorphose, which supports the BBL selective mechanism for facultative paedomorphosis in these populations. Aggression trials found low levels of aggression between metamorphic A. talpoideum and the fully terrestrial salamander, Plethodon shermani. This might be because these two species inhabit different spatial niches as they use burrows at different depths. This study suggests that facultative paedomorphosis can have different adaptive mechanisms under a different regime of environmental conditions.

TI  - The mechanisms and consequences of phenological evolution
SP  - 190
AB  - Phenological shifts are clearly biologically important as they contribute to both ecological speciation and persistence during global warming. However, the genetic and physiological mechanisms behind shifts remain unclear. This is due to complicated genetic and genomic bases, as well as the cryptic nature of the phenotype. The consequences of phenological shifts also remain largely unexplored. We expect that a novel temporal habitat will have a different thermal profile than the ancestral habitat due to seasonal thermal variation. Therefore, for successful phenological shifts we predict correlated evolution in thermal tolerance. My dissertation investigates both the mechanisms and evolutionary consequences of phenological shifts, and adds to a growing body of literature on these topics. I first investigate the physiological mechanism underlying evolution in life-history timing of corn borers. Using metabolic trajectories, I find that variation in the length of the diapause termination phase underlies an ~30-day shift observed in seasonal timing between E and Z-strains. While the E-strain exits diapause within 7 days, the Z-strain remains in diapause termination for ∼30 more days. These metabolic trajectories are further used to target days for whole transcriptome profiling to nominate molecular mechanisms for the shift in timing. I nominate 48 candidate genes within the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seasonal timing, and find that shorter E-strain termination is defined by a burst of genome-wide transcriptional activity involved in cell cycling, the stress response, and hormone production. I next interrogate the genomic architecture surrounding the QTL for differences in seasonal timing. I investigate if a chromosomal inversion could be present near the QTL for timing as previous studies found evidence of a large region of suppressed recombination in this region. Our results confirm that there is evidence for a large-scale rearrangement covering at least 20% of the Z (sex) chromosome that harbors the basis for seasonal timing differences. A final study looks at the consequences for evolved differences in seasonal timing between corn borer strains. As shifts in phenology displace populations across a season, they also expose populations to novel thermal environments. I find that earlier-emergence from winter diapause is correlated with enhanced cold-tolerance.

TI  - An evaluation of spatio-temporal changes in the population genomics of a butterfly hybrid zone over a thirty year period of climatic change
SP  - 254
AB  - As a result of human activities, changes in global climatic patterns are predicted to dramatically alter contemporary geographic patterns of biological and genetic diversity. However, due to the complexity of biological communities, accurate predictions of species responses will depend on our understanding of the factors influencing these responses. Evolution (adaptation) and species interactions are both factors that have the capacity to mitigate and exacerbate organism’s responses to climate change. Unfortunately our understanding of these factors is still poorly understood. Here, I take advantage of a historically sampled and ecologically well studied butterfly hybrid zone to explore how historical changes in climate have influenced the genetic composition of this hybrid zone across space and through time. Specifically, by combining molecular (genetics and genomics) and simulation modeling approaches I explore how spatio-temporal changes in climate have influenced the geographic and genomic landscape of divergence between these hybridizing species. First, I characterized the extent of divergence across the hybridizing genomes of P. glaucus and P. canadensis and explored how this divergence varied geographically and with climatic and ecological factors. I found evidence of climate maintaining genome-wide patterns of divergence, particularly on the Z chromosome where divergence was greatest. Next, I determined that the hybrid zone, based on a genome-wide set of genetic and a morphological trait, has shifted northward, coinciding with a lengthening growing season from 1980-2012. Using simulation modelling I discovered that spatio-temporal changes in climate during this period of warming has led to differential phenological responses that were dependent on genetic background. Further, I found that climate-mediated changes in voltinism may be leading to different reproductive phenological pathways that can have a dramatic influence on geneflow across the hybrid zone. Last as part of a working group I researched the capacity of citizen science to inform natural resource management and policy. In short, we found that citizen science has already affected natural resource management and policy in positive and measurable ways and that there is enormous potential for public participation to continue to improve the efficacy of scientific research.

TI  - Regulation and Natural Functions of Lipopeptide Biosynthesis in Pseudomonas
SP  - 175
AB  - Lipopeptides (LPs) are surface-active, antimicrobial compounds composed of a lipid moiety linked to a short linear or cyclic oligopeptide. In bacteria, LPs are synthesized by large nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) via a thiotemplate process. Compared to the understanding of LP biosynthesis, little is known about the genetic regulation. The aims of this PhD thesis were to identify new regulatory genes of LP biosynthesis and to unravel the natural functions of LPs in plant-associated Pseudomonas species. Using a combination of various ‘omics’-based technologies, we identified two small RNAs, designated RsmY and RsmZ, that, together with the repressor proteins RsmA and RsmE, regulate the biosynthesis of the LP massetolide in the rhizosphere bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SS101. Four other regulatory genes (phgdh, dnaK, prtR and clpA) of massetolide biosynthesis were identified via random mutagenesis. Mutations in each of these four genes caused a deficiency in massetolide production, swarming motility and biofilm formation, two natural functions associated with the production of LPs in Pseudomonas. Results further indicated that the ClpAP protease complex regulates massetolide biosynthesis via the pathway-specific, LuxR-type regulator MassAR, the heat shock proteins DnaK and DnaJ, and proteins of the TCA cycle.

Countless studies, however, have demonstrated that individual organisms and populations can shift their upper thermal limits through either acclimation, in which individuals exposed to increased temperatures shift their physiology, or adaptation, in which whole populations shift their thermal limits through natural selection for the most heat tolerant genotypes. These processes are especially relevant to foundation species, such as reef-building corals, as these organisms are often sessile, and so cannot easily shift their range. In this dissertation, I examined patterns and processes involved in acclimation and adaptation in reef-building corals, including their impacts on upper thermal limits, the genes and cellular pathways involved, and the relative roles of the two mechanisms over small and large spatial scales. In Chapter 1, I conducted a time series analysis of acclimation. I found an increase in heat tolerance after one week at higher temperatures and a corresponding shift in gene expression, resulting in a dampened response to heat stress. In Chapter 2, I utilized a small-scale natural temperature gradient to search for genetic variants associated with corals adapted to different temperatures. I found 114 genetic variants that differed between warm and cool microclimates separated by less than 1km. In Chapter 3, I tested these variants using a reciprocal transplants between warm and cool microclimates. I found that corals from warm microclimates survived more often, but a subset of genetic variants associated with survival were also associated with lower growth, suggesting a tradeoff in overall fitness. In Chapters 4 and 5, I examined tradeoffs and mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation over a large spatial scale: across latitude. Using a combination of acclimation and heat stress experiments, I found evidence for a high degree of plasticity in upper thermal limit for corals at both low and high latitudes. Despite this plasticity, however, there were still significant fixed effects between locations, suggesting large roles for both acclimation and adaptation in determining heat tolerance across latitude. In Chapter 5, I examined the molecular basis of these shifts in thermal tolerance. I found divergence at both the sequence and gene expression levels for populations from low and high latitude locations, eventually leading to the discovery that the two populations were separate cryptic species: a warm adapted congener and a more broadly distributed congener. This allowed me to compare gene expression patterns between the two cryptic species with different evolutionary histories, finding transcriptional differences across a broad range of cellular functions that could be involved in adaptive thermal tolerance. I also found a set of genes whose expression was tightly linked with bleaching status; these genes are therefore good candidates 'biomarkers' that could be used for prediction of heat stress and tolerance. Together, these studies highlight important roles for both acclimation and adaptation in determining thermal tolerance in corals and provide insights useful for predicting the response of these ecologically and economically important taxa to future climate change.

TI  - Optimising Growth Performance in Juvenile Hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios): An Insight into the Physiology of a Novel Finfish Aquaculture Species
SP  - 194
AB  - The current study aimed to understand how certain environmental and commercial conditions affect the production performance of a novel aquaculture species in New Zealand, the hapuku Polyprion oxygeneios. Additionally, the current study aimed to construct a simple energetic model for this species by collating the metabolic costs of feeding, growth and swimming within the physiological framework set by aerobic metabolic scope (AMS). AMS represents the physiological capacity for non-maintenance activities by setting the limit for aerobic ATP production. This work was done under the hypothesis that production performance is linked the capacity to perform physiological work and that maximal growth can only occur when AMS is non-limiting. Juvenile hapuku were employed to assess whether respirometric tests and thermal preference methods could be used to resolve the optimum temperature for growth and feed conversion efficiency in novel culture species. The conclusions of this initial study are three-fold: i) hapuku select temperatures that optimise both AMS and growth, ii) AMS and Tpref appear tightly linked with SGR and could be used to predict the optimum temperature for growth in novel species and iii) AMS and Tpref have no utility in predicting the optimum temperature for growth rate and feed conversion ratio, FCR. Specific dynamic action (SDA) was measured in juvenile hapuku at two temperatures and two different ration sizes: 15 C (0.75 percent body weight [BW] and 1.5 percent BW) and 21 C (1.5 percent and 3 percent BW). Specifically, elevated growth potential through larger SDA responses were present at the higher temperature of 21 C, but the higher maintenance cost (i.e. SMR) of fish at this temperature constrains growth if a restricted 1.5 percent BW ration is delivered. FCR was largely independent of ration size and was significantly less efficient at 21 C, despite fish having a larger SDA response. No single SDA parameter was found to predict the SGR and FCR performance of juvenile hapuku but future research might focus on the SDA response of fish to multiple (vs. single) feeds per day as this conveyed a significant growth benefit to hapuku for reasons not yet explained by metabolism. The applicability of exercise training for juvenile hapuku was examined as induced-swimming can improve the growth and FCR of finfish aquaculture species, such as salmonids and Seriola sp. Combining the SDA of hapuku with the metabolic costs of swimming showed that hapuku have sufficient physiological capacity to support growth and swimming at all ERs. The current study therefore suggests that exercise-induced growth was not limited by AMS and possibly varies as a function of species, life stage and/or inherent growth trajectories. As a follow on from the exercise trials, the role of exercise in altering the flesh quality of juvenile hapuku was examined. Flesh samples were taken from fish that had been exercised for 8 weeks. Muscle fibre density (MFD) and flesh firmness were negatively related to ER and decreased significantly between 0.0 BL s-1 and 0.75 BL s-1 suggesting a stimulation of muscle fibre hypertrophy with continuous swimming. Fibre size distributions also showed an increase in median muscle fibre size with the increasing exercise regimes. The assumptions of the energetic equations, the apparent discrepancy between digestible energy intake and energy usage and factors that would modify energy usage are all discussed in detail and compared to other species of interest. To conclude, recommendations for farming practice and future work are made based on the empirical data of the model.

TI  - Adjusting to the extreme: thermal adaptation in a freshwater gastropod
AB  - Temperature is a ubiquitous force influencing biological processes ranging from cellular responses to life span. The thermal environment for many organisms is predicted to change with globally increasing temperatures and studies conducted in natural systems incorporating various evolutionary forces, such as gene flow, is needed. In my thesis, I investigate how snails (Radix balthica) originating from distinct geothermal environments within Lake Mývatn in northern Iceland have adapted, both genetically and phenotypically, to the respective thermal regime. Locations were classified as either cold, warm or seasonal depending on the average and variance in temperature. A high resolution spatial distribution of genetic variation within Mývatn was obtained using both neutral and outlier AFLPs. In addition, the genetic profile enabled me identify warm origin snails irrespective of geographic location in Iceland. Warm environments were often more stressful than cold or seasonal environments but snails originating from a high temperature location benefited from increased performance elsewhere. Patterns of growth were identical in both common garden and reciprocal transplant experiment; warm origin snails grew faster than both cold and seasonal origin snails. This result is in concordance with quantitative genetics models of thermal adaptation but suggesting cogradient rather than countergradient variation. Although warm origin snails generally had superior performance, survival at cold temperatures (< 12 °C) was reduced. All snails matured at similar size in the common garden experiment but cold origin snails were observed to mature later and lay fewer eggs. Also, snails had a common optimum for growth rate at 20 °C irrespective of thermal origin. This is arguably the reason why snails were observed to have a common thermal preference. Interestingly, warm origin snails had a reduced tolerance to high temperatures compared to cold and seasonal origin snails which did not differ in tolerance. Putatively, natural selection has reduced a putatively unnecessary trait (high temperature tolerance in a stable thermal environment) in favour of higher growth rate and performance in warm habitats. In conclusion, the price of high performance in a warm environment was paid in terms of reduced survival at low temperatures and a potential disadvantage of reduced genetic variability.

TI  - Influences of temperature and salinity on asexual reproduction and development of scyphozoan jellyfish from the british isles
AB  - Jellyfish (Phylum Cnidaria, Class Scyphozoa) play important roles in pelagic ecosystems as predators and prey. Seasonally they form blooms facilitating reproductive success, but that are at times problematic for human enterprise. Medusa abundance has been correlated with environmental variables in several instances. However, the direct mechanisms for changes in medusa abundance are unclear. As global sea surface temperatures continue to change there is increasing concern that warming may enhance conditions favourable for the generation of jellyfish medusae. It is important to understand the ways in which temperature affects all life history stages of jellyfish if we are to begin to understand factors associated with jellyfish bloom formations, but how temperature and salinity affects life history stages of scyphozoan jellyfish from British waters remains largely unknown. In Chapter 1 I provide a general introduction to some key issues important to the formation of jellyfish blooms. In Chapter 2 I present results for experiments testing the effects of temperature on settlement and metamorphosis of planulae larvae of Cyanea capillata, Cyanea lamarckii, Chyrsaora hysoscella, and Aurelia aurita. Chapter 3 reports on the effects of temperature and salinity on survival, and asexual reproduction of scyphistomae of the same species. Chapter 4 reports on the effects of temperature and salinity on growth of newly released ephyrae of each of the above mentioned species, as well as the effects of starvation on survivorship on ephyrae of A. aurita originating from two distinct populations of scyphistomae. In Chapter 5 I provide a brief summary of significant findings for each life history stage, their theoretical implications when taken together, and next steps for future research. I also offer recommendations for ecosystem managers with an eye toward affecting the numbers of near-shore jellyfish medusae generated each season in the waters surrounding the British Isles.

TI  - Arabian gulf food web and the effect of salinity on feeding and growth rate of young threespine sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus)
AB  - Marine environments are facing several threats from climate change. The threats include changing salinity, temperature and acidity. Changes in these environmental aspects can have an influence on individual foraging and patterns of growth in marine fish and ultimately entire food webs. Understanding the foraging biology of marine fish is important because their feeding habits and their diet selection are vital characteristics of trophic relationships in marine ecosystems. In this thesis, I explored the food web structure of the Arabian Gulf Marine Fishery, the growth rate of estuarine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish, and their diet choice. The focus for all three studies was the potential threat caused by the elevation of salinity, temperature and associated changes in productivity and diet. In Chapter 2, I present a study on diet selectivity in larval and juvenile G. aculeatus along a salinity gradient of how this environmental parameter along with temperature, prey species richness, prey diversity and productivity affected the diet choice of these fish. I found that prey selectivity, which I defined as the difference between size in gut and size in pond, declines with salinity but that selectivity was unaffected by temperature, productivity, prey species richness, and prey diversity. In Chpater 3 I present a study of how salinity, temperature, productivity and zooplankton food size affects the growth rate of larval and juvenile threespine sticklebacks. I found that salinity, zooplankton prey size and zooplankton species richness all affected the growth rate of these fish, while no effect was observed for temperature, productivity and other features of the environment. In Chapter 4 I present the largest marine food web ever constructed, for the Arabian (=Persian) Gulf. The Arabian Gulf is experiencing increased salinity in spawning ground areas due to alterations of freshwater influx. I examined the structure of this community in comparison to other previously reported marine food webs and found it to be similar. I also explored how the structure of the food web changes when only species were considered (taxonomic food webs) versus of the consideration of life stages as species (disaggregated food webs). I also explored the impact on the food web structure due to the removal of all commercial species from both webs. One of the major findings was that copepods, mainly calanoids, were the most common prey. Thus, their productivity is vital to the fishery. My work in this thesis on larval and juvenile fish growth and on diet choice shows that larval and juvenile fish are sensitive to the changes in environmental parameters, particularly salinity. My work also shows that calanoid copepods are a major prey in a large fishery. In general, this suggests that it is very important to understand the sensitivity of larval and juvenile fish to environmental characteristics and the management of their prey (e.g. copepods).

TI  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics of Great Lakes percid fishes
SP  - 258
AB  - A burgeoning field of research is developing around the theory that evolutionary change can occur much more rapidly than expected, driving population responses to anthropogenic stressors and creating feedbacks on ecological timescales. Many of these rapidly evolving traits represent important life history characteristics, such as maturation, growth, reproductive investment, and offspring size. This dissertation focused on two important aspects of fish reproductive ecology: the process of maturation and the mechanisms driving variation in offspring size and fitness. These traits appear to vary on both spatial and temporal scales, and this variation can be driven by a complex interplay of phenotypically plastic responses to local environments and genetically-based adaptation to changing selection pressures. My research addressed: 1) temporal variation in maturation schedules of Great Lakes yellow perch, with special attention to potential changes in maturation due to commercial fishing; 2) how tradeoffs between growth, mortality, and maturation influenced sex-specific variation in maturation schedules among populations of Great Lakes yellow perch in recent time; 3) the influence of adaptation, plastic responses to thermal conditions, and maternal effects on egg size and intra-female egg size variation among walleye (Sander vitreus) populations, 4) the importance of genetic diversity to early life growth and survival in yellow perch, and 5) how maternal effects may influence life history trait evolution in response to and during recovery from fisheries exploitation. Yellow perch maturation schedules exhibited surprisingly rapid recovery toward maturity at larger sizes and older ages in Lake Michigan during a fishing moratorium, suggesting recovery from fisheries-induced evolution is possible in some fish stocks. Female and male maturation schedules exhibited dimorphic relationships with growth and mortality rates, highlighting how sex-specific variation in life history tradeoffs influences their evolution. Walleye exhibited consistently positive maternal effects on egg size and marked among-population variation in egg size related to average thermal conditions, suggesting adaptation of offspring size to local environments, while intra-female egg size varied plastically with annual temperatures, suggesting conditions regulating both energy acquisition and allocation to eggs influence offspring size in this species. Heterozygosity was significantly correlated with increased size in juvenile yellow perch under harsh environmental conditions, and the largest individuals were also most related to one another, further highlighting the importance of local environments to offspring size and fitness. Finally, an eco-genetic model testing the evolutionary response of life history traits to fishing mortality over various levels of maternal effect showed that positive maternal effects can increase the rate of evolutionary recovery of these traits when fishing is ceased. This research identified important factors that drive life history shifts in fish stocks; vital information as management agencies seek to restore or maintain the valuable fisheries and ecosystem services these species provide. More broadly, analyses of plastic and adaptive change of life history traits in populations experiencing several anthropogenic stressors could improve predictions of population responses to future change.

TI  - Application of the qbd principles throughout the lifecycle of a recombinant protein process
AB  - The biotech community is under increasing pressure from the regulators to demonstrate effective implementation of the Quality by Design (QbD) principles and hence exhibit greater process understanding. Essential to achieving this goal is the implementation of a systematic framework that integrates experimental and predictive modeling techniques whilst accounting for the inherent variability of biologics. The aim of this thesis was to create a comprehensive framework for applying the principles of QbD throughout the lifecycle of a commercially distributed therapeutic protein produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture. A systematic approach incorporating QbD principles was applied, involving risk assessment of potential process failure points, small-scale model development and qualification, design and execution of experiments, definition of operating parameter ranges and process performance acceptance criteria for validation and classification of operating parameters in the second generation process for this therapeutic protein. This methodology was illustrated through detailed process characterisation of a fed-batch production culture step and a virus inactivation step. One of the most prominent interactions found in the fedbatch production culture model was the three factor interaction of pH × temperature × seeding density. In the virus inactivation model, an increase in temperature (30 °C), incubation time (180 min), a reduction in pH (pH 3.5) at a relatively high protein concentration (5.5 g/L) resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of aggregated protein. Continuous process improvement and robustness are fundamental components in the QbD paradigm and are an integral component in the comprehensive framework described in this thesis. Following commercial implementation, Multivariate analysis (MVA) was employed to build upon the knowledge gained from process characterisation studies by identifying not only the process parameters but also the cell culture factors such as daily nutrient and metabolite levels which influenced protein titre and product quality attributes across scales. This analysis provided valuable knowledge for future troubleshooting and process refinement activities. Application of a statistical tool such as MVA adds scientific rigor to the data analysis thus improving the prediction of scale-up effects on the final product. Process robustness opportunities are often only realised when the process is run over multiple batches at manufacturing-scale. In this process, a perfusion culture which is employed to provide high cell densities to inoculate a production culture was identified as a potential risk to process and product supply and therefore identified as an area of focus for process optimisation activities. Application of a cell conditioning strategy enabled the generation of a seed fed-batch culture which achieved relatively high cell densities to inoculate the production culture. Shorter culture duration in the fed-batch culture also yielded comparable cell culture performance and productivity in production cultures relative to historical process performance. Successful commercial implementation and validation of the second generation process and the subsequent manufacture of hundreds of batches of this therapeutic protein verified the approaches described in this thesis as a suitable model for the development, scale-up and operation of any biopharmaceutical manufacturing process. This methodology is aligned with the QbD principles and can be applied to any biopharmaceutical manufacturing process, thus delivering sustainable, compliant and in-control processes throughout the product life-cycle.

TI  - Effects of heat stress on oocyte quality and embryo viability in swine
SP  - 71
AB  - Heat stress during oocyte maturation causes well-defined changes in the oocyte cytoplasm that leads to reduced developmental potential. Previous work has been done that supports this hypothesis, but the underlying reasons are still not fully understood. Our objective is to determine these underlying mechanisms that contribute to this reduction in overall development potential of the oocytes and the embryos. Oocytes underwent in vitro maturation (IVM) for 40-44 hours in one of two environments: 39°C (control), or 41°C (heat stress). The oocytes underwent multiple experiments: stage of meiosis after maturation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) size, total amount of Ca2+ stored in the ER, pattern of Ca2+ signal following in vitro fertilization (IVF), and embryo development after IVF. After 40-44 hours of IVM, oocytes were stained and their chromatin configuration was recorded. Heat-stressed oocytes showed a significant decrease in the ability to reach metaphase II of meiosis compared to the control group. Heat stressed oocytes also lowered the percentage of embryos developing to the blastocyst stage. Mobilized Ca2+ from the ER affects fertilization and subsequent embryo development. Administration of ionomycin caused oocytes to, in Ca2+-free medium, released Ca2+ from the intracellular stores. The average amplitude of the Ca2+ peaks was significantly higher compared to that of the heat stressed group. However time of release and time to maximum peak did not seem to have a discernable affect between the groups. Lower Ca2+ store content could be caused by one of two events: reduction in ER size or an alteration in ER function. Literature suggests that the ER should emulate a spider web-type structure contained throughout the entire cytoplasm. In some cases, heat stress oocytes exhibited an incomplete reorganization of the ER as compared to the control group. Fertilization is dependent on the phospholipase C zeta (PLC ζ) content of the sperm to hydrolyze and cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP 3 to cause a release of Ca2+ from the ER. The released Ca2+ triggers a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the activation of the oocyte and subsequent embryo development. Oocyte lipid composition is important for the generation of energy substrates as well as phospholipid second messengers. Lipid analysis experiments did not show a significant difference in fatty acid make up. High amounts of triglycerides are seen in each experiment performed in positive mode. Phospholipids and DAG are in very low concentrations prior to fertilization. The DESI technique may not be sensitive enough to obtain the data from both groups. An alteration in fatty acid content as well as phospholipids can have a detrimental effect on Ca2+ mobilization and entry. Ca2+ transients, after fertilization, are responsible for the lifting of the meiotic arrest and initiation of cell division. When we measured the changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the oocytes we found that heat stress during maturation caused marked alterations in the mean amplitude of Ca2+ transients during IVF, while frequency of the oscillations remained the same. We believe that the observed changes described above are responsible, at least in part, for the reduced developmental potential of the heat stressed oocytes.

TI  - Functional and Drought Survival Strategies of California Perennial Grasses in the Context of Restoration
SP  - 122
AB  - Over the next 100 years, ecosystems in California are expected to experience warmer temperatures and an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts. California grasslands are also heavily invaded by European annual grasses, and climate change may further favor these exotic invaders over native species. Restoration efforts in California grasslands would benefit from ways to identify taxa that are best suited to withstand increasing drought stress, including the traits that are common among the most successful drought survivors. The traits and strategies promoting severe drought survival in native perennial grasses have been relatively little explored, and drought survival is rarely studied in conjunction with seasonal patterns of growth or ecologically important (i.e., "functional") traits. In the first chapter of this dissertation, we integrated physiological and functional trait-based approaches to characterize seasonal growth dynamics and drought survival strategies in eight California wildland perennial grass species. We paid special attention to summer dormancy, an adaptation to drought that is known to be expressed by several California perennial grasses, but has received very little empirical study. Summer dormant species in our study were characterized by greater springtime productivity; earlier reproduction; a shallower, finer root system; and high tolerance of tissue dehydration. Together, these traits suggest that in spring, summer dormant taxa exhibit a resource acquisitive functional strategy, escaping drought via efficient competition for resources and early reproduction. Owing to functional similarity with many exotic annual grasses, we suggest that summer dormancy may play an important ecological role in restoring native perennial species to California grasslands. Local plant populations are recommended for ecological restoration to avoid maladaptation to current site conditions; however, whether they will be well adapted to future climate scenarios, including increasing drought stress, is a major concern for practitioners. In the second chapter, we extended the approach from Chapter 1 to characterize intraspecific variation in drought survival, seasonal growth dynamics, and functional traits in a suite of five populations of Elymus glaucus, a native perennial bunchgrass commonly used in restoration. We chose populations from sites with contrasting climates to determine how trait and environmental variability are related. We found strong intraspecific variation in dehydration tolerance, which was tightly correlated with summer dormancy. Dehydration tolerance was associated with a conservative functional strategy, and with increasing summer climatic water deficit at populations’ sites of origin. Trait variation was most associated with annual climatic water deficit, rather than summer aridity, which highlights the need to measure traits during both the drought period and the more productive growing season when considering species from temporally variable climates. Our results suggest that restoration practitioners may be able to predict dehydration tolerance from summer aridity alone, but that climate during the growing season may be just as important for ecological restoration. Local adaptation evolves in response to both abiotic and biotic selective pressures. Biotic factors like competition have received far less empirical study, but functional ecology predicts that they will be more important in productive environments. In the third chapter, we used a reciprocal transplant experiment to determine whether patterns of trait variation expressed in Chapter 2 were indicative of local adaptation. Because populations were collected from contrasting productive and stressful sites, we asked whether intraspecific competition was a more important modulator of plant fitness in productive coastal sites, and whether coastal populations were more competitive. We did not find consistent evidence of local adaptation in our populations. We found that competition was more important to reproductive output at coastal sites, but only for resident populations. This result suggests that, especially at coastal sites, receiving all the benefits of locally sourced plant materials in grassland restoration requires careful consideration of the optimal intraspecific planting neighborhood.

TI  - Climate Change and Reproductive Phenology: Context-Dependent Responses to Increases in Temperature and Implications for Assisted Colonization
SP  - 163
AB  - Contemporary changes in climate have rapidly increased temperatures worldwide, extending the length of the growing season and eliciting large shifts in reproductive and growth traits across a diversity of plant taxa. The role of phenotypic plasticity in alleviating immediate changes in selection pressures must be thoroughly explored in order to identify the circumstances under which the survival of particular species may require active management. The major goals of my thesis were to characterize the contexts in which responses to warming occur and are adaptive, and to provide insight on the feasibility of assisted colonization (the movement of species beyond their current range boundary to climatically favorable habitat) and assisted gene flow (the relocation of multiple, genetically distinct populations to facilitate local adaptation). Focusing on the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, I applied artificial warming to simple plant communities to mimic the thermal regimes expected by the mid-21st century. Among experiments, I manipulated aspects of the abiotic and biotic environment likely to contribute to variation in plastic responses to warming, including plant genotype, community diversity, population density, internal patterns of resource allocation, and the frequency of rainfall. Reproductive phenological traits varied in their degree of response to warming, and photoperiodic constraints prevented optimal responses in populations of C. fasciculata from lower latitudes. In all cases, temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity was adaptive or neutral, but only sufficiently alleviated selection pressures in particular situations. Variation in competitive dynamics, pollinator access, and rainfall frequency did not modify responses to changes in temperature. This work identified barriers to assisted colonization across latitudes that arise when reproductive phenology is dependent on photoperiodic cues. Phenotypic plasticity may ameliorate some of the negative effects of increases in temperature, but persistent, directional selection pressures will require the evolution of life history traits for adaptation to climate change.

In my thesis, I explored the effects of temporal and spatial heterogeneity on several important aspects of populations—levels of genetic variation, the potential of future adaptation, and gene expression plasticity—using replicated experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving under alternative regimes: constant regimes maintained in either cadmium- or salt- enriched larvae diets (Cad and Salt, respectively) and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or spatially (Spatial) between the two diets. Whole-genome resequencing of these populations found that for sites likely under differential ecological selection (and those closely linked to them), the pattern of within-population diversity is Spatial > Temp > Salt, Cad. However, for sites that are not affected by differential selection, the pattern is Spatial > Salt, Cad > Temp. Quantitative genetic variance patterns for three fitness related traits are partially consistent with the genomic diversity. Spatial populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations or those under a constant environment that is the same as the assay environment. The adaptability of these populations was further assessed by exposing them to high temperature while being maintained in their original larval diet regimes. Both types of heterogeneous populations had a larger adaptive response to high temperature than homogeneous populations for female productivity but not for male siring success. Finally, the transcriptome was measured in both diets for each population to examine gene expression plasticity. Relative to the constant populations, both heterogeneous populations showed increases in adaptive plasticity. Spatial populations are more readily to increase adaptive plasticity than Temp. Whereas for the genes selected for similar expression in both diets, Temp populations more readily evolve to the adaptive state than Spatial.

TI  - Phenotypic variation in cold tolerance of an invasive insect (Epiphyas postvittana Walker): Implications for forecasting risk
SP  - 165
AB  - Predicting the spread and potential impacts of biological invasions is vital to management and policy decision-making. For much of North America, cold temperatures dictate portions of the geographic boundaries of ectotherm survival and are often included as a key component of risk models and maps for invasive insects. However, current risk assessments typically assume an invading species' response to cold and other environmental stressors is immutable over short to medium time horizons, in part due to a paucity of relevant biological data. Such assumptions may lead to mis-estimated probabilities of establishment and spread of invasive insects, such as a recent invader to the U.S.A, the light brown apple moth (Epiphyas postvittana Walker). My research examined multiple sources of potential variation in cold tolerance of E. postvittana, a species that is predominantly freeze avoidant but also shows some amount of partial freeze tolerance in its overwintering stage. First, I evaluated the effects of larval host plant on direct tolerance to acute partial-freezing in late instars. There was a nearly ten-fold change in survival after partial freezing based on larval host, as well as changes in mean supercooling points. Importantly, the degree of cold tolerance could be predicted by the developmental suitability of a given host. Second, I compared the fitness tradeoffs following exposure to two subzero temperatures (-10°C or the supercooling point) in late instars and pupae. Both lifestages could survive brief exposure to -10°C without significant fitness cost, and displayed small proportions of partial freeze tolerance. However, individuals that survived partial-freezing did so with a reproductive fitness cost. Lastly, I conducted a long-term laboratory selection experiment to evaluate the potential for adaptation to partial freezing in late instars. While there did not appear to be sufficient additive genetic variance to see a consistent response to selection, there was considerable variability through time in survival after partial-freezing. Importantly, this variability cycled in a regular pattern (~six generations), driven by a yet unknown mechanism. The variation in E. postvittana cold response seen in this study resulted in different forecasts of geographic distribution, which can have important management and regulatory implications.

TI  - The influence of thermal effluent on life history evolution in the Western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis
SP  - 53
AB  - The evolutionary consequence of heated effluent on the Western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, was studied at Lake Fairfield, in Freestone County, Texas. The Lake Fairfield reservoir receives heated effluent from Luminant’s Big Brown Power Station. Heated effluent from the power station is discharged into a ‘hot pond’ reservoir before it is allowed to return after cooling to the main reservoir, or ‘main lake’ of Lake Fairfield. Heated effluent elevates the temperature of the hot pond throughout the year and the elevation in water temperature has selected various life history traits in G. affinis that are divergent from the main lake G. affinis population, such as growth rate, clutch size, reproductive allotment, lipid content, and size at maturity. This work builds upon previous research demonstrating evidence for genetic divergence between the two populations of G. affinis residing in the heated and non-heated regions in Lake Fairfield, and takes the logical next step by exploring these same populations for genetic shifts in life history traits that are directly connected to rates of population growth. This was accomplished by examining patterns of phenotypic life history variation (phenotypic assays) in preserved specimens collected monthly over the course of a year, by performing two sets of reciprocal transplant experiments, and a complimentary common garden experiment. The assessment of phenotypic variation between sites revealed that G. affinis in the hot pond exhibit smaller clutch sizes, smaller reproductive allotment, larger lipid stores, and larger male maturation sizes than G. affinis in the main lake. The results of two independent reciprocal transplant experiments as well as a common garden experiment provide evidence for locally adapted differences as mosquitofish fish from the main lake exhibited faster rates of growth than fish from the hot pond and such differences were generally larger when all populations were reared in the main lake. The assessment of environmental parameters between the hot pond and main lake showed that water temperature was consistently higher in the hot pond and that potentially covarying factors, such as dissolved oxygen, conductivity, salinity, and pH, did not differ between the divergent environments. The observed life history differences between the hot pond and main lake are therefore best explained as driven by elevated water temperature due to the release of heated effluent. Given that the Big Brown Power Station commenced operation in 1971 and has been continuously operating since that time, our results substantiate that human driven alteration to thermal regimes can drive significant evolutionary changes within 44 years. This study provides information on the extent to which species can rapidly adapt to increased environmental temperatures in the form of artificial heating and alter the expression of life history traits when isolated in environments that receive heated effluent. The results of this study also represent an important step in the integration of evolutionary biology and conservation science, and offer information to be considered when adopting management plans for conserving aquatic communities.

TI  - Characterizing the genetic basis of susceptibility to atrazine exposure in male Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 110
AB  - Human induced environmental toxicants, such as pesticides, antibiotics and heavy metals, are influencing both target organisms and non-target organisms. Understanding the mechanisms of how environmental toxicants affect different organisms will allow us to better understand the potential for organisms to respond to these environmental changes. One such toxicant, atrazine, is a commonly applied herbicide in the US and has been shown to cause adverse effects on male reproductive performance in a wide variety of vertebrates. Much less is known, however, about the effects of atrazine on invertebrates. Here I use the model genetic system, Drosophila melanogaster, as a toxicology model to identify genes influencing susceptibility to atrazine exposure. I used RNA-seq to identify ninety-eight genes which are putatively differentially expressed in male Drosophila after chronic exposure to food containing 20 ppm atrazine and verified a subset of these genes using qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR). As expected, a gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that genes involved in stress response were overrepresented (including three cytochrome P450 genes) but interestingly so were genes involved in reproduction, suggesting that atrazine might also affect invertebrate reproduction. I then selected 50 lines from the Drosophila Genetics Reference Panel (DGRP) mapping population and scored male reproductive performance when reared on control food and food containing 2 ppm atrazine. Measures of reproductive performance included mating rate, male-induced refractoriness to remating and measures of male fertility. There was extensive genetic variation for reproductive susceptibility to atrazine exposure and male mating rate showed highly significant line by treatment interactions. The DGRP lines are fully sequenced and I performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for mating rate. Several genes involved in membrane transport were associated with susceptibility to atrazine including two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and three ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters. One ABC transporter, CG5789, has a derived, non-synonymous mutation which shows fitness trade-offs in the different environments suggesting a cost to resistance. The mapping results suggest that export of atrazine out of the cells, rather than detoxification is the likely mechanism of resistance.

TI  - Short term adult plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster and its role in climatic adaptation
SP  - 97
AB  - Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity is a fundamental aspect in evolutionary biology. A constantly changing environment puts continuous stress on organisms, and causes spatially and temporally varying selection regimes where survival depends on responsiveness. Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism enabling this responsiveness, which manifests upon exposure to an environmental stressor and facilitates a more resistant phenotype. Environmental heterogeneity exposure at the adult life stage of an organism produces a plastic response that is important for local adaptation and persistence. Hence, adaptive plasticity is an important mechanism of adaptation to localized environmental variation. To study short term exposure plasticity, we sampled Northern and Southern populations of Drosophila melanogaster, originating from distinct geographic regions and habitats in eastern North America. To elicit a plastic response these populations were exposed to two environmental variables, temperature and photoperiod, for a short-term (five-day) treatment. Flies that had been exposed to this treatment were then tested for phenotypic stress response using chill coma tolerance, heat shock and starvation resistance assays, all of which act as proxies for fitness. To test their response to the natural environment, the same populations were exposed to outdoor field conditions for a treatment equivalent to that in the lab, after which their stress response to heat and cold tolerance was recorded. Whole genome level plasticity was observed by sequencing the transcriptome of lab flies exposed to the same treatment of crossed temperature and photoperiod regimes as the phenotyped flies; thus, allowing for a complimentary gene expression plasticity study. Geographic origin and temperature treatment determined the phenotypic stress response for the three stress assays. Photoperiod showed significant interaction with temperature, indicating that D. melanogaster is responding to both cues in order to modify its life-history strategies. The field results showed the Northern population had a faster chill coma recovery time when exposed to extreme cold temperatures relative to the Southern population, where this was not observed, suggesting adaptive cold response plasticity is important in the Northern population’s fitness. Lastly, the Northern and Southern populations showed a differential expression plasticity response, which is consistent with the expected patterns based on spatially varying selection.

TI  - Local adaptation and reproductive isolation in the copepod Tigriopus californicus
SP  - 158
AB  - The evolution of reproductive barriers between species, in many cases is a consequence of genetic divergence that evolves between populations that have become geographically isolated. In this case, processes such as local adaptation and genetic drift will contribute to this divergence, to the point where if the populations come into contact again, some form of reproductive isolation between them will have evolved. Understanding local adaptation, and how it affects a population’s ability to deal with environmental changes has also become of interest to biologists, as way to assess how organisms will deal with predict climate changes. In chapter 2 of this dissertation I address how the evolution of reproductive isolation due to intrinsic postzygotic barriers (hybrid sterility and inviability) is affect by the presence/absence of sex chromosomes, which have been deemed important for the evolution of these reproductive barriers. I show that taxa that have heteromorphic sex chromosomes reach higher levels of intrinsic postzygotic isolation at lower levels of genetic divergence. On the other hand, taxa without sex chromosomes remain compatible until much higher levels of genetic divergence. In chapter 3, I look at genome-wide patterns of hybrid inviability in crosses of different levels of genetic divergence between populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus. Theory and data in other species suggest that the more divergent cross should show higher levels of intrinsic reproductive isolation, caused by a larger number of genomic regions that are incompatible between the hybridizing populations. Results however show that the least divergent cross suffers the largest effects due to hybrid inviability, suggesting that either this cross has a larger number of incompatibilities than the other two crosses, or that the architecture of these incompatibilities leads to a larger inviability effect. In chapter 4 I focus on the effects that differences in local adaptation play on a population’s ability to deal with changes in thermal variability in their environment. The results show the populations studied have very different profiles of gene expression across the different temperature treatments, and changes in thermal variability elicited large differences in transcriptome wide expression changes, especially in the least thermal tolerant populations.

TI  - Assessing the effect of beach dynamics on nest site selection of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in Playa Cabuyal, Costa Rica
SP  - 54
AB  - Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) across their entire range due to declining population numbers over the past 30 years. This study assessed the effect of beach dynamics, including beach erosion and temperature, on nest site selection across four nesting seasons, at Playa Cabuyal, Guanacaste, Costa Rica (10°67’N, 85°65’W). The study site is located in Northwest Costa Rica on the Pacific Ocean where climate is affected by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The nest locations showed that green turtles at this site had a preference for nesting in Zone 3, the highest nesting area of the beach, under the canopy of trees. This zone was covered with vegetation and had open areas underneath the canopy of trees where the nests would be shaded for a portion of the day. Nesting females also showed a preference for nesting in the southern most portion of Playa Cabuyal designated as Area C, which is made up of the southern third of the beach. Factors studied to be contributing to this nest site preference were tidal inundation, distance from high tide and erosion activities. These were catalogued during the 2014-2015 nesting season to establish a baseline level of these influences by Zone (sections of the beach, 1-3, from the water) and Area (delineation of the beach from North to South into 3 distinct areas A-C). An inverse relationship was found between number of nests laid in each Zone and the number of erosion and inundation events in each zone. Zone 3 was found to have no erosion or inundation events and had the highest percentage of observed in-situ (nests that have not been relocated) nests. Zone 1 (below the high tide line) was found to have the highest percentage of erosion events and had the lowest number of nests. In addition the turtles had a significant preference for nesting in shaded areas. Shaded portions of Zone 3 had lower nest temperatures than those nests in unshaded areas. This could result in higher production of males and could also affect hatching and emergence success. Additionally, nests underneath trees had a decreased amount of surface roots so nesting females had fewer impediments when excavating a nest cavity. This could increase the chance of a successful nesting attempt and may also increase hatching and emergence success as there are fewer roots to impede hatchling development and emergence. The preference of green turtles for nesting in Zone 3 at this site is different than at other sites such as Colola, Mexico where green turtles show a preference for Zone 2. This is most likely due to the beach in Cabuyal being narrower than the beach in Colola. Turtles also showed a preference for nesting on the southern third of the beach, Area C, for three out of the four years of this study. In the 2013-2014 year there was a preference for the middle third, Area B, of the beach. In all years of the study turtles showed the least preference for the first third of the beach to the far North. These preferences may be a result of the beach being wider on the southern portion of the beach versus to the North where a rock cliff frequently causes the beach to be completely inundated. Although there was a distinct difference in levels of inundation in the three Areas of beach from North to South, the occurrence of erosion events, or seasonal changes in deposition and attrition, was similar in each Area. Site fidelity by females classified into three different categories, those with a high level of fidelity, laying all nests within 100 meters, those with low fidelity, laying all nests greater than 100 meters apart, and clustered, consisting of females with at least two nests within 100 meters of each other. There were no differences in fidelity in between zones. Turtle size was also determined if it was related to nesting strategy but no correlation was found.

AB  - Thermoelectrics are a promising energy conversion technology for power generation and cooling systems. The thermal and electrical properties of the materials at the heart of thermoelectric devices dictate conversion efficiency and technological viability. Studying the fundamental properties of potentially new thermoelectric materials is of great importance for improving device performance and understanding the electronic structure of materials systems. In this dissertation, investigations on the thermoelectric properties of a prototypical complex oxide, SrTiO3, are discussed. Hybrid molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is used to synthesize La-doped SrTiO3 thin films, which exhibit high electron mobilities and large Seebeck coefficients resulting in large thermoelectric power factors at low temperatures. Large interfacial electron densities have been observed in SrTiO3/RTiO 3 (R=Gd,Sm) heterostructures. The thermoelectric properties of such heterostructures are investigated, including the use of a modulation doping approach to control interfacial electron densities. Low-temperature Seebeck coefficients of extreme electron-density SrTiO3 quantum wells are shown to provide insight into their electronic structure.

TI  - Mechanistic modelling of the links between environment, mosquitoes and malaria transmission in the current and future climates of West Africa
AB  - Malaria transmission in West Africa is closely tied to climate, as rain fed water pools provide breeding habitat for the anopheles mosquito vector, and temperature affects the mosquito's ability to spread disease. This thesis presents a framework of highly detailed, spatially explicit mechanistic modelling to explore the relationships between the environment and malaria in the current and future climate of West Africa. A mechanistic model of human immunity was incorporated into an existing agent-based model of malaria transmission, allowing us to move beyond entomological measures such as mosquito density and vectorial capacity to analyzing the prevalence of the malaria parasite within human populations. The result is a novel modelling tool that mechanistically simulates all of the key processes linking environment to malaria transmission. Simulations were conducted across climate zones in West Africa, linking temperature and rainfall to entomological and epidemiological variables with a focus on nonlinearities due to threshold effects and interannual variability. Comparisons to observations from the region confirmed that the model provides a reasonable representation of the entomological and epidemiological conditions in this region. While current generation climate models agree that mean temperatures in West Africa will likely increase by 2 to 4°C in the future by the end of the 21st century, they disagree on the magnitude and the direction of the change in rainfall. We analyzed the performance of CMIP5 climate models in simulating West African rainfall and temperature before selecting the most credible predictions of future climate. We used these predictions to simulate the expected change in malaria transmission in sensitive regions of West Africa. We found that the western subregion of West Africa is likely to become drier in the coming decades. The warmer temperatures will shorten mosquito life spans, and the drying will limit mosquito reproduction. As a result, we expect malaria transmission in this region to decrease. However, the eastern half of the region is expected to become wetter. In some areas, the positive effects of increased rainfall on mosquito reproduction may surpass the negative effects of high temperatures on mosquito longevity, leading to a small net increase in environmental suitability for malaria transmission.

TI  - Tests for Positive Selection on Genes Encoding Heat Shock Proteins in the Marine Slipper Snail, Crepidula fornicata
SP  - 54
AB  - Sedentary organisms that inhabit the marine intertidal zone must be adapted to withstand forms of environmental stress that are uncommon in other marine environments. Adaptations to these stressors are apparent in the morphologies, behaviors, life histories, and regulation and products of genes of sedentary intertidal organisms (Lent 1969; Garrity 1984; Schmidt et al 2008). However, for those species that have a planktonic larval stage, evolutionary specialization at the molecular level could be constrained by opposing requirements for larvae and adults that are adapted to very different environments. This constraint would have been removed in lineages that lost the ancestral larval stage, and reinstated in lineages that secondarily reacquired a larval stage. A comparative approach using a group in which the planktonic larval stage has been lost and reacquired could be used to test the hypothesis that adaptive evolution of stress-related genes accompanies these life-history transitions. Genes with known roles in physiological stress tolerance include those that encode the family of 70 kilodalton heat shock proteins (hsp70s ) (Feder and Hofmann 1999). Statistical tests for departures from selective neutrality were applied to sequence variation in hsp70 genes of calyptraeid gastropods. The Calpytraeidae include both intertidal and subtidal species, as well as species that have lost or secondarily reacquired the ancestral planktonic larval stage (Collin 2003a; Collin et al. 2007). I focused on two species: Crepidula fornicata and C. atrasolea. Both species are found in low intertidal and subtidal habitats in the western tlantic region. However, whereas the eggs of C. fornicata hatch into planktonic veligers, the eggs of C. atrasolea develop directly into crawling juveniles. I tested for selection with statistics that characterize the distribution of sequence variation within and between species, comparing values for each hsp70 gene fragment with expectations for selectively neutral loci.

TI  - Population-level consequences of phenotypic plasticity in yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris)
SP  - 124
AB  - Individuals vary phenotypically. Phenotypic variation can emerge because of bet-hedging, micro-evolutionary responses, and because of phenotypic plasticity, an important mechanism by which individuals can cope with environmental change. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an individual to respond to environmental variation, can influence demographic parameters (e.g., birth and death rates) that influence population dynamics. I used a population of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) as a study system to explore the effect of individual variation due to phenotypically plastic responses on population dynamics. First, I used linear mixed effects models to examine and quantify the plastic responses in a set of morphological, life-history and social traits in response to climatic and social variation. Results showed that individuals have the ability to respond to environmental variation by expressing different phenotypes, and that individuals differ in the nature of their plastic responses. Second, I developed an Integral Projection Model to evaluate the trait-mediated response to environmental variation. Results indicated that variation in survival and reproduction are the main drivers of fluctuation in the population growth rate, and that winter temperature, but not spring temperature and bare ground date, are important environmental drivers of population fluctuations. Furthermore, although variation in a key morphological trait, body mass, does not explain significant variation in population growth rate, it plays an important role in mediating the individuals’ response to the environment. Finally, I developed an Individual Based Model, to incorporate individual differences in the rate at which animals gained mass seasonally, and evaluated the effect of such individual heterogeneity for population persistence. Results indicated that the proportion of individuals in the population that engaged in compensatory growth influenced population dynamics, and the cost of expressing such compensatory responses had a strong effect on population dynamics. If growth rate plasticity varies among-individuals, the population can afford the cost of plasticity; otherwise, plasticity increases the time to population extinction. These findings emphasize the importance of phenotypic plasticity as a mechanism shaping individual variation in a population, and as an important response of a species’ adaptation to environmental change.

TI  - Age and work experience influence on job and organizational engagement in the retail sector
AB  - The downturn of the economy after 2008 and the increasing number of retiring Baby Boomers has created a shift in the population towards younger workers and values of employees more aligned with this younger age (Bates, 2004; Johnson, 2004). In addition, employees' working beyond the conventional age of 66 has created a workforce that spans four generations (Schullery, 2013). Companies are struggling to find ways to engage employees equally across all four generations (Saks & Gruman, 2011). Studies have shown, partially as a result of these changes in the workplace, that workers are not fully engaged and committed to their companies and are changing job positions and companies at an increasing rate (Johnson, 2004; Mohamed, Taylor, & Hassan, 2006; Saks, 2006; Shaw, 2005). Some have suggested that greater worker engagement in the workplace might mitigate the challenges described above (Mohamed et al., 2006; Saks, 2006). Homans' (1958) seminal study on engagement triggered an increasing realization that one key to creating or increasing retention of workers is employee engagement. Building on Homans' work, Kahn (1990) and Saks (2006) defined engagement as the meeting of employee physical and emotional needs so that turnover is reduced, quality improved and productivity maximized within the workplace as documented by the propensity of employees to commit to themselves and to the employer's vision and strategy. Assessment of engagement factors between 2000 and 2006 regarding retention, quality, and productivity has become increasingly important for companies (Bates, 2004; Johnson, 2004; Kelloway, Day, & Arla 2003; Kelloway et al., 2003; Saks, 2006). Studies on the importance of employee engagement became increasingly important with the decline in the economy in 2007-2008. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

TI  - Adaptation to climate and climate change in Rocky Mountain butterflies: Morphology, physiology, and behavior
SP  - 122
AB  - Understanding the relative contributions of evolution, plasticity and behavior for local adaptation to climate, and for adaptive responses to recent climate change, is a major challenge for global change biologists. My dissertation explores these issues for Colias butterflies along an elevation gradient. Adults use thermoregulatory behaviors to achieve optimal body temperatures. Past studies show local adaptation in fixed morphological differences in ventral hind-wing melanin and thoracic setal length and a degree of developmental plasticity associated with melanin. My dissertation makes four major contributions. First, reciprocal-transplant and common-garden experiments documented differences in thermal sensitivity for flight initiation between high (C. meadii) and lower (C. eriphyle) elevation species. C. meadii initiated flight at lower body temperatures than C. eriphyle. This result was contrary to expectations that behavior will hinder evolution in fixed physiological differences along climatic gradients. Second, laboratory experiments showed that high-elevation adults had higher survival after heat-shock relative to lower-elevation. In contrast, there were no significant differences in upper thermal limits for eggs from different elevations suggesting the lack of movement did not lead to the evolution of fixed physiological differences in this life stage. Third, I used historic collections of a high-elevation C. meadii to quantify changes over the past 60 years. While mean temperatures during the adult flight have increased significantly, both hind-wing melanin and setal length have also increased. I suggest that this due in part to developmental plasticity; cooler pupal temperature was associated with increased melanin. I propose that this is non-adaptive because pupal temperatures are poor predictors of adult temperatures. Fourth, I quantified seasonal changes in wing melanin for two populations of C. eriphyle. Seasonal change in wing melanin was associated with increases in pupal temperature. In contrast to C. meadii, pupal temperatures were a good predictor of adult flight season temperature for C. eriphyle. Collectively, my results suggest that behavior does not reduce the importance of physiology and morphology in local adaptation to climate, and that potential for adaptive plasticity in high-elevation ectotherms may be strongly limited by variability and unpredictability in seasonal climate.

TI  - Indigenous Youth as Critical Agents of Biocultural Survivance - Education and Employment in Response to the Challenges of Global Heating and Climate Disruption
SP  - 92
AB  - These are unprecedented times. Like never before, humans, having separated themselves from the web of life through the skillful use of their opposable thumbs, have invented the means of extinction and have systematized it for the benefit of the few at the expense of all else. Yet humans are also designing fixes and alternatives that will soon overcome the straight line trajectory to ugliness and loss that the current order would lead the rest of humanity through. The works in this dissertation are connected by two themes: (1) those humans who happen to be closely connected to the lands, waters and wildlife, through millennia of adaptation and inventive association, have a great deal to share with the rest, who, through history have become distanced from the lands and waters and wildlife they came from; and (2) as the inheritors of all the insults that the current disrespectful and wasteful system is heaping upon all true sensibilities, young people, who are Indigenous, and who are the critical generation for biocultural survival, have an immense role to play—for their cultures, and for all of the rest. The survivance of autochthonous culture through intergenerational conduct of cultural practice and spirituality is profoundly affected by fundamental physical factors of resilience related to food, water, and energy security, and the intergenerational participation of youth. So this work is not so much an indictment of the system as it is an attempt to reveal at least two ways that the work of these young Indigenous people can be expedited: through the transformation of their education so that more of their time as youths is spent focusing on the wonderful attributes of their cultural associations with the lands, waters, and wildlife; and through the creation of a self-sustaining youth owned and operated enterprise that provides needed services to communities so they can adapt to and mitigate the increasingly variable, unpredictable, and dangerous effects and impacts of global heating and climate disruption.

TI  - Evolutionary recovery and the thermodynamic aftermath of horizontal gene transfer in microviruses
SP  - 191
AB  - Experimental evolution has been used to investigate both general and specific evolutionary processes. More recently, it has also been used to resolve protein-protein interactions. Viruses assemble through a series of protein-protein interactions which must remain more favorable than any competing off-pathway reaction. By constructing chimeric viruses with genes or segments of genes from another species, foreign elements are introduced into this system of assembly. Characterization of the resulting chimeras provides information about which proteins interact, the protein-protein interacting interface, the role of particular domains, and the importance of specific residues. Chimeric viruses often exhibit a reduction in fitness, as the foreign element is unable to interact as efficiently in the system as the native element. Through experimental evolution, mutations accumulate that affect interacting partners in the system, leading to a more optimal assembly pathway. The microviruses are well-characterized single-stranded (ss) DNA bacteriophages. They are divided into three clades, represented by &phis;X174, G4, and α3. Incidences of horizontal gene transfer between microvirus clades are unusually rare and may be due to a complex assembly pathway with multiple stages: a foreign element has the potential to disrupt a multitude of morphogenetic steps. In this study, we exchanged major spike genes between the two microvirus species &phis;X174 and G4, then monitored the evolutionary recovery. Results can be interpreted within this thermodynamic paradigm. Although the G4-&phis;XG chimera could only form plaques at low temperature and exhibited reduced fitness, its evolutionary recovery was relatively straightforward. The other chimera, &phis;X-G4G, could only form plaques when complemented with two wild-type &phis;X174 genes. Isolating a complementation-independent chimera required the passaging of mutants through a series of different environments. The first selection yielded mutations of the largest effects. First, the truncation of a protein involved in DNA synthesis was recovered, resulting in a global decrease in gene expression. Next, a recombination event at the 3’ end of the foreign gene resulted in a modification of the protein’s C-terminus. These mutations were subjected to further analysis to determine why they were so critical at this early stage of experimental evolution. Subsequent passages of the &phis;X-G4G chimera eventually yielded viable strains, with additional mutations affecting stages of late assembly. Overall, results indicate how gene exchange can drastically affect flux through the pathway. When the system is initially perturbed, the process of experimental evolution allows the pathway to return to a normalized state. The mutations isolated during this recovery stage indicates how the flux was initially altered, and how it can be restored.

TI  - The search behavior of sea lamprey during their non-homing reproductive migration in the Great Lakes
SP  - 342
AB  - Non-homing organisms are thought to rely on stable geophysical features (e.g., land-slope), and encounter with distinct attributes of the environment (e.g., landmarks) in a predicable sequence to locate reproductive habitat (e.g., rivers always occur on a coastline). However little is known about how non-homing fishes complete a large-scale migration, as most research has focused on homing fishes that rely on geomagnetic cues to return to a natal spawning site. The invasive sea lamprey offers insight into non-homing migration, as individuals complete a single non-homing migration to rivers following translocation by host fishes in the Great Lakes. In this dissertation, Chapters 2 and 3, are devoted to developing a framework for describing animal behavior from telemetered observations and development of a standardized approach for assessing and filtering VEMCO Positioning System (VPS) data based on an estimate of horizontal position precision (HPE). This methodology was imperative for exploration of the sea lamprey migration with the underwater VPS telemetry technology. In Chapter 3, we described how sea lamprey orient to a coast when in a lake and hypothesized that sea lamprey navigate to the nearest coast by (1) orienting to the local bathymetric gradient and (2) maintain straight movements counter to the local slope to move towards shallow water. Three-dimensional (3-D) paths of migrating female sea lamprey were obtained by an acoustic array with 3 km2 of coverage, centered 3.3 km from the coast in Lake Huron. The findings of this chapter indicate that sea lamprey sampled an area of lake-bottom to assess absolute hydrostatic pressure and to select a heading towards reducing pressure (shallower water). In contrast to natal homing migrations, the sea lamprey appears consistent with non-homing orientation to a general region with a simple set of rules based on local topography. Chapter 4 focused on the sea lamprey migration along a coastline and near a river mouth. Upon reaching a coastline, sea lampreys move parallel to shore. Prior studies indicated the presence of larval odor in river water increased the likelihood that a migrant entered a river. However, it was not known whether larval odor played a role in navigation (guiding the migrant to the river mouth) or mediated habitat selection by labeling the suitability of a river for spawning. In a two-year study using a 2 km2 acoustic array, the 3-D paths of sea lamprey were documented as they approached, entered, or bypassed the Ocqueoc River in northern Michigan, under one of two conditions: (1) low larval odor; and, (2) higher larval odor, created by increased larval abundance plus the addition of the synthetic larval odor components, petromyzonamine disulfate (PADS), petromyzosterol disulfate (PSDS), and petromyzonol sulfate (PZS) to a 1 x 10 -12 M concentration. A coupled hydrodynamic and dye concentration model predicted the hydraulic conditions experienced by each sea lamprey by estimating water conditions (velocity, temperature, etc.) at each fish position and allowed for assignment of whether a position was inside or outside of the Ocqueoc River plume. Encounter with river water appears to trigger localized search, regardless of larval odor content. However, when larval odor was abundant, the migrant was more likely to enter the river. Whether a migrant enters a river, is modulated by the presence of detectable larval odor, manipulation of river selection by invasive sea lamprey for management is viable in rivers with high encounter rates. Finally, Chapter 5 covers the implications for how altering migration routes in the sea lamprey via the application of synthesized pheromones contained in larval odor could be profitable for management.

TI  - Living on the edge: tolerance to environmental stressors and reproductive dynamics of the gastropod Crepidula fornicata across the intertidal-subtidal boundary
SP  - 198
AB  - Species' ranges are generally studied on a latitudinal scale, and species are often limited by their tolerance and responsiveness to physical stressors. Many organisms, though, live in the transitional area between terrestrial and marine environments, the intertidal zone. Most of the species that occupy the intertidal zone are of marine descent and many can also be found deep into the subtidal zone where they live their entire lives covered by seawater. Thus, the intertidal zone represents a range boundary for many marine organisms, beyond which they cannot survive. For these organisms, the intertidal range edge is characterized by a suite of stressors associated with aerial exposure that may limit their upper distribution and can ultimately cause them negative physiological impacts; such stressors include desiccation, high aerial temperature, and reduced feeding time, and they are absent only meters away, in the subtidal zone. Comparing particular aspects (e.g. phenotypic traits, fecundity) of adjacent intertidal and subtidal organisms of a single species can provide insight into which factors control the upper distribution of that species in the intertidal zone, the ability of organisms to adapt to stressful intertidal conditions, and the healthiness of the populations that reside there. I investigated some basic biological aspects (thermal tolerance, desiccation tolerance, feeding physiology) of the sessile suspension-feeding gastropod, Crepidula fornicata at Bissel Cove in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA in order to better understand the factors that limit the upper distribution of this species and also the effects of intertidal stressors on the reproductive capacity of these organisms. I found that high summer temperatures are probably the most important factor limiting the upper distribution of this species, but desiccation stress can be particularly troublesome for very small individuals; reduced available feeding time is probably not a major limiting factor. Intertidal and subtidal C. fornicata at Bissel Cove had similar upper thermal tolerances, desiccation tolerances, and feeding rates. However, they differed both in their behavior when exposed to the air and in their gill morphology: when immersed, intertidal individuals spent less time with their tissues exposed to the air than did subtidal conspecifics, and intertidal individuals also had relatively larger gills. The stresses associated with intertidal life had no immediate effects on their ability to successfully reproduce. In fact, the breeding season was slightly longer for intertidal individuals of C. fornicata and their fecundities higher when compared to those of subtidal conspecifics. Taken together my results suggest that C. fornicata has had a long association with the intertidal zone, and though desiccation and high temperatures are likely keeping them from living high up in the intertidal, the individuals that recruit to the mid/low intertidal are not particularly stressed there as adults. Their high tolerance to environmental stressors and their adaptability may be partially responsible for their extreme success as an invasive species. As global temperatures rise, this species will likely be relegated to the subtidal zone only, but will probably continue to colonize new locations.

TI  - Selective Short Chain Carboxylates Production by Mixed Culture Fermentation
SP  - 225
AB  - The production of short chain carboxylates currently depends on petro-chemical sources. Fossil fuel sources are however depleted fast by growing industry and population. Also, these sources contribute negatively to global warming, climate change and modern human society. Biomass, alternative to fossil fuel, is a sustainable resource and eliminates these negative impacts. Production of organic chemicals from biomass via anaerobic fermentation is not a new technology, e.g. ethanol generation from corn or lactic acid from sugar cane. However, short chain carboxylates are still predominantly produced from oil and gas due to easy accessibility and low oil prices compared to biomass feedstock. Among the biomass resources, organic waste streams are abundant, locally available and have little or no competition with food. Bio-waste, therefore, can be an excellent substitute source for the generation of short chain carboxylates.The current biological processes often convert pure substrates and use single organisms through sterile anaerobic fermentation. This yields high conversion of substrate to a single product in high concentrations and fractions. Substrate cost and sterile operational conditions are two parameters increasing the production cost of bio-based products. In this thesis, the ‘carboxylate platform’ is evaluated as a cost-effective biological technology for the production of short chain carboxylates. The principle of the carboxylate platform is based on the conversion of cheap organic feedstock to a mixture of short chain carboxylates by using non-sterile, mixed culture fermentation.Short chain carboxylates are organic chemicals that can be used in industry directly or as building blocks for other valuable chemicals like alcohols and polymers. Fermentation of biowaste generates abundant short chain carboxylates, acetate, propionate and n-butyrate and a small fraction of valerate, n-caproate and ethanol. The outcome of mixed culture fermentation results in a combination of fermentation products in various amounts, rather than obtaining a maximal total concentration of a single product. It is, thus, important to be able to direct the fermentation process towards a desired major product or combination of products in certain fractions.This thesis describes how mixed culture fermentation processes can be steered towards one specific carboxylate at sufficiently high concentration. Manipulation of environmental conditions or operational parameters and integration of in-situ product recovery technology into the fermentation are considered key parameters to drive the reactions towards a desired end product.In mixed culture fermentation, depending on the substrate type, inocula and headspace composition, and also, process parameters like hydraulic and solid retention time, organic load and pH, carboxylate concentrations and speciation can vary considerably. Thus it is crucial to know how to use these key elements to obtain a desired product or composition of products in the highest concentration(s) possible. Chapter 2 reviews mixed culture fermentations studies dealing with conversion of organic substrates towards carboxylates in batch, fed-batch and continuous reactor configurations. Literature studies report that the use of more concentrated carbohydrate-rich substrates, at longer residence times and at neutral pH ranges stimulates total acid production. The total carboxylate concentration reaches maximum for most of the studies 20 g/L at production rate of 1.5 g/L.h. Exceptionally Fu & Holtzapple (2011) reported a total carboxylate concentration of 40 g/L by eliminating the inhibitory effect of carboxylates on the organisms. They developed a “counter-current” fed-batch operation system to reduce the contact time of carboxylates and organism. Product inhibition was usually reported under too high substrate concentrations at short retention times, or under conditions of feed overloading, and at low pH. When increasing pH to the neutral range, not only total acid concentration, but also acetate and propionate fractions are elevated, though high propionate concentrations and fractions are only reported occasionally. A high n-butyrate fraction > 70% is usually found when pH < 6, at somewhat longer incubation or retention times or high OLRs, under carbon dioxide atmosphere or on high substrates concentrations. Increasing residence times creates a shift from shorter to longer chain fatty acids such as valerate or n-caproate.In this thesis, two major key operational parameters: headspace composition and substrate type were further investigated experimentally in Chapter 3. The aim was to observe to what extent the headspace composition at elevated partial pressures (2 bar) affects the fermentation process, product type and productivity in batch-wise fermentation. Three reactors were adjusted to a final headspace pressure of 2 bar by adding hydrogen, carbon dioxide or a 50:50 (v:v) mixture of these two gases. A control reactor was flushed with nitrogen only at the beginning of the experiment and left it without headspace manipulation. The highest carboxylate concentration was 17 g/L at hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixed pressurized headspace. Here, the acetate fraction reached 85% due to the homoacetogenic activity. However, this condition is not interesting for this study since acetate was formed from hydrogen and carbon dioxide instead of degradation of waste. In the carbon dioxide reactor, the carboxylate concentration was only 3.6 g/L however n-butyrate fraction was 70% at the end of the first week. One of the important targets of this study, the production of one major compound at fractions around 70% from waste streams, was successfully achieved. The carboxylate production in the hydrogen pressurized reactor was 1.5 g/L higher than in the control reactor but product distribution showed equal fractions of acetate and n-butyrate. For the effect of substrate, three different organic waste streams were selected according to their elemental composition and polymer constituents like carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.Carbohydrate waste produced higher carboxylate concentrations compared to protein and lipid wastes. In the protein rich waste, acetate was the main carboxylate and it was produced independently of the headspace. According to literature propionate and i-valerate were the major compounds to be found in protein rich fermentation at neutral pH. In our case the pH was controlled at 5, resulting in mainly acetate production. Lipid rich waste yielded concentrations below 0.5 g/L and was not considered further.In Chapter 4, the study on headspace composition was further investigated at increasing concentration of carbohydrate rich substrate in batch reactor configuration. The concentrations were defined as 8, 13.5 and 23 g COD waste/L. The final target was to define the operational conditions for a continuous process to produce high and stable total carboxylate concentration of a single product with high fraction by mixed culture fermentation. The experiments showed that the most optimal carboxylate production was achieved under the conditions of the highest substrate concentration without any headspace manipulation. Although, the highest carboxylate concentration, 11 g/L, was detected under the hydrogen pressurized headspace, product distribution was not in the direction of a single product. Without headspace control, the total carboxylate level was 9 g/L with 61% n-butyrate fraction. When a continuous reactor was operated at 23 g COD waste/L at 2 days retention time without headspace manipulation, 7 g/L and 71% of stable n-butyrate production over a month of operation was successfully realized.It should be considered that the biological processes can be limited if the final total carboxylate concentration reaches inhibitory levels for mixed culture organisms. In Chapter 5, the process parameters were overviewed for the improvement of carboxylate formation and spectrum with integrated in-situ recovery technology. Here, a novel ‘direct contact' electrodialysis configuration with bipolar membranes was integrated to continuous mixed culture fermentation. The significant achievement of the in-situ integrated fermentation system was that external base addition was completely eliminated; the pH of the reactor was regulated by the bipolar membranes. Preliminary experiments indicated that acetate and propionate productivities were selectively increased among the mixture of carboxylates. The carboxylate productivity only increased 1.5 times, probably because carboxylate levels in the fermenter were lower than expected and the inhibitory effect may thus have been low. The concentration of the product compartment was maximum 3 times the carboxylate level in the reactor. These results were preliminary data of a research on mixed culture set-ups which needs more investigation and optimization.Finally, carboxylate production from organic waste with mixed culture fermentation process was evaluated in Chapter 6. The most important outcome of this research showed that mixed culture fermentation can be steered towards a major short chain carboxylate in fraction of 70% (n-butyrate), by carbon dioxide addition in headspace or high substrate concentrations without headspace manipulation. However, in general total carboxylate concentration doesn’t exceed 20 g/L. In current industrial practice, the concentrations are five times higher. Acetate can be produced at 100 g/L up to 95% by pure cultures. Because products are quite diluted in mixed culture systems, it is required to integrate costly, intensive downstream processing after the fermentation. Mixed culture fermentation should still improve product yields. Finally, mixed culture technologies can be promising if the mixture of carboxylates is used as a precursor for valuable chemical production such as alcohols, polymers or medium chain carboxylates rather than applying complex purifying technologies after the fermentation process.Alternate abstract:De productie van kortketenige carbonzuren gebeurt op dit moment vooral via petrochemische weg. Almaar groeiende wereldbevolking en industrie putten niet enkel de voorraad aan fossiele brandstoffen uit, maar zorgen ook voor opwarming van de aarde, klimaatsveranderingen en een nefaste impact op onze huidige samenleving. Het gebruik van biomassa kan een alternatief voor deze fossiele grondstoffen vormen en op die manier bijdragen tot een duurzame maatschappij. De productie van organische stoffen uit biomassa via anaerobe fermentatie is geen nieuwe technologie, bijvoorbeeld de productie van ethanol uit mais of productie van melkzuur uit suikerriet. Kortketenige carbonzuren daarentegen worden momenteel in hoofdzaak nog uit olie en gas gemaakt, dankzij de vrije beschikbaarheid en de lage kostprijs van fossiele bronnen in vergelijking met biomassa. Organische afvalstromen zijn het meest overvloedig aanwezig als biomassa bron, ze zijn lokaal beschikbaar en concurreren niet met de voedingsketen. Bioafval kan daarom dan ook bij uitstek als vervanging voor fossiele grondstoffen dienen bij de productie van kortketenige carbonzuren. De huidige biologische processen gebruiken erg zuivere substraten en reinculturen in zgn. steriele anaerobe fermentaties. Deze zorgen voor een hoge omzettingsgraad van het substraat naar één enkel product in hoge concentraties. De kosten voor het substraat en de steriele procesomstandigheden leiden tot een hoge productiekost van dergelijke bio-gebaseerde producten. In deze thesis wordt het ‘carboxylaat-platform’ geëvalueerd als kosteneffectieve biologische technologie voor de productie van kortketenige carbonzuren. Het carboxylaatplatform is gebaseerd op de omzetting van organische stromen tot een mengsel van kortketenige vetzuren door middel van een niet-steriele fermentatie met gemengde culturen. Korteketenvetzuren worden in de industrie gebruikt, hetzij rechtstreeks, hetzij als bouwstoffen voor andere, waardevolle chemicaliën zoals alcoholen en polymeren. Fermentatie van bioafval levert vooral, azijnzuur, propionzuur, n-boterzuur en een kleinere fractie valeraat, n-caproaat en ethanol. De gemengde fermentatie –zoals toegepast in dit onderzoek- resulteert steeds in een waaier aan producten, veeleer dan één bepaalde stof. Daarom is het belangrijk om dit type fermentatie te sturen naar één bepaald product of een combinatie van een aantal producten in bepaalde fracties. Deze thesis beschrijft hoe gemengde fermentatieprocessen gestuurd kunnen worden naar één specifiek carbonzuur in een voldoende hoge concentratie. Manipulatie van de procescondities en integratie van in-situ product winning in de fermentatie zijn de sleutel om de fermentatiereacties te sturen naar één bepaald product. In gemengde fermentatie hebben inoculum en samenstelling van de headspace, samen met proces parameters zoals verblijftijd, organische belasting en pH, een belangrijke invloed op het type en de concentratie van de carbonzuren. Het is dan ook van belang te weten hoe deze parameters kunnen gebruikt worden om bepaalde producten te bekomen in zo hoog mogelijke concentraties. Hoofdstuk 2 bespreekt de beschikbare literatuur met betrekking tot gemengde fermentaties waarbij organische substraten worden omgezet in carbonzuren, in batch, fedbatch en continue reactoren. De literatuur beschrijft dat het gebruik van geconcentreerde substraten, rijk aan koolwaterstoffen, lange verblijftijden en neutrale pH de productie van organische zuren stimuleert. De totale carbonzuurconcentratie bedraagt maximaal 20g/l bij een productiesnelheid van 1.5g/L.h. Uitzondering hierop zijn de resultaten van Fu&Holtzapple (2011) die spreken over zuurconcentraties tot 40 g/L wanneer het inhiberende effect van de carbonzuren op de organismen geëlimineerd wordt. Ze ontwikkelden een tegenstroom reactorconcept om de contacttijd van de gevormde zuren met de organismen te beperken. Product inhibitie komt immers meestal voor bij erg hoge substraatconcentratie en korte verblijftijden, bij te hoge organische belasting of bij lage pH. Wanneer gewerkt wordt bij neutrale pH, verhoogt niet alleen de totale zuurconcentratie, maar ook de azijnzuur- en propionzuurfracties, alhoewel hoge propionzuurconcentratie slechts af en toe gemeld worden. Een hoge boterzuurfractie (>70%) wordt meestal ofwel bereikt bij pH<6 en iets langere incubatie- of verblijftijden en een hoge organische belasting, ofwel onder CO2 atmosfeer ofwel bij hoge substraatconcentratie. Verhogen van de verblijftijden levert vooral een verschuiving op van korte naar langere vetzuurketens, zoals valeraat of n-caproaat. In hoofstuk 3 van deze thesis worden twee belangrijke operationele parameters verder onderzocht en beschreven: samenstelling van de headspace en substraattype. Het doel was om na te gaan in welke mate een verhoging van de partiële druk in de headspace (2bar) bij een batchfermentatie het proces, het product type en de productiviteit beïnvloedt. Drie reactoren werden op 2 bar druk gebracht respectievelijk met waterstof, stikstof en een mengsel van gelijke hoeveelheden waterstof en stikstof. Een controlereactor werd gespoeld met stikstof bij het begin van het experiment en nadien ongemoeid gelaten. De hoogste carbonzuurconcentratie werd gemeten bij de reactor met de waterstof en stikstof in de headspace en bedroeg 17 g/L. In deze reactor bedroeg de azijnzuurfractie 85%, tengevolge van homoacetogenese. Het azijnzuur werd dus in dit geval gevormd werd door omzetting van waterstof en koolstofdioxide in plaats van het de organische componenten, aanwezig in het substraat, wat niet gewenst was in het licht van deze studie. In de reactor onder CO2- atmosfeer, was de totale carbonzuurconcentratie slechts 3.6 g/L; hoewel de butyraatfractie 70% bedroeg aan het einde van de eerste week. Bij deze was ook één van de belangrijke doelen van deze studie –het bereiken van carbonzuurfracties rond 70% bij gemengde fermentatie met afvalstromen- bereikt. De carbonzuurproductie in de reactor gevuld met waterstof was 1.5 g/L hoger dan in de controlereactor, maar met gelijke fracties acetaat en nbutyraat. Om het effect van verschillende substraten na te gaan werden drie verschillende afvalstromen geselecteerd, volgens hun concentratie aan koolwaterstoffen, eiwitten en vetten. Afval met een hoog koolwaterstofgehalte leidde tot hogere carbonzuurconcentraties in vergelijking met proteïne- en vetrijke afvalstromen. Bij proteïne-rijke stromen werd vooral azijnzuur gevormd, onafhankelijk van de condities en samenstelling van de headspace. Volgens literatuur zou in dit geval vooral propionaat en i-valeraat gevormd worden bij neutrale pH. In ons geval werd bij pH 5 gewerkt, wat vooral in azijnzuurproductie resulteerde. Vetrijke afvalstromen leverden carbonzuurconcentraties lager dan 0.5 g/L op en werden dan ook verder buiten beschouwing gelaten in het onderzoek. Hoofdstuk 4 beschrijft het onderzoek naar de invloed van de samenstelling van de headspace op de batch fermentatie bij stijgende concentratie van het substraat rijk aan koolwaterstoffen. De substraatconcentraties bedroegen 8, 13.5 en 23 g/L. Het doel was te bepalen welke operationele condities nodig zijn in een continu proces om een hoge, stabiele, concentratie van één bepaald carbonzuur te bereiken. Uit de experimenten bleek dat dit het geval was bij de hoogste substraatconcentratie, zonder toevoeging van gassen in de headspace. Alhoewel de hoogste carbonzuurconcentratie (11 g/L) bereikt werd bij toevoeging van waterstof in de headspace werd enkel een mengsel van verschillende organische zuren gevormd, in plaats van één bepaald zuur. Zonder manipulatie van de headspace bedroeg de zuurconcentratie 9 g/L met 61% n-butyraat. Wanneer een continue reactor gedurende een maand werd bedreven zonder toevoeging van gassen in de headspace, gevoed met 23 g/L substraat en een verblijftijd van 2 dagen, kon een concentratie van 7 g/L en 71% n-butyraat bereikt worden in een stabiele procesvoering. Bij hogere carbonzuurconcentraties kunnen de biologische processen bij gemengde culturen gelimiteerd of geïnhibeerd worden. Hoofdstuk 5 beschrijft de proces parameters bij zgn. ‘in-situ recovery’ van de organische zuren uit het fermentatiemedium met als doel het verhogen van de productiviteit in de reactor. Een nieuwe technologie, ‘direct contact’ elektrodialyse met gebruik van bipolaire membranen werd geïntegreerd in de continue fermentor. Door deze ingreep kon de toevoeging van base in de reactor volledig worden geëlimineerd: de pH werd nu volledig gecontroleerd door productie van base aan het bipolaire membraan. De eerste experimenten toonden dat de azijnzuur- en propionzuurproductie selectief verhoogden ten opzichte van andere carbonzuren. De totale productie van carbonzuren verhoogde slechts met 50%, waarschijnlijk omdat de carbonzuurconcentraties in de fermentor en bijgevolg het inhiberend effect op de organismen lager waren dan verwacht. De zuurconcentratie in het productcompartiment van de elektrodialyse was drie keer hoger dan deze van de reactor. Deze resultaten waren de eerste gegevens in een onderzoek naar koppeling van fermentatie en scheiding in fermentor met gemengde culturen. Verder onderzoek en optimalisatie zijn hier duidelijk aan de orde. In hoofdstuk 6 wordt de productie van organische zuren uit afvalstromen samengevat. De belangrijkste bevinding uit dit onderzoek is dat de gemengde fermentatie gestuurd kan worden naar productie van één enkel vetzuur, n-butyraat, bij toevoeging van koolstofdioxide in de headspace óf bij toepassing van hoge substraatconcentratie. In deze gevallen wordt een nbutyraat fractie bekomen van 70%. De totale zuurconcentratie blijft echter beperkt tot 20 g/L. Bij de huidige industriële toepassingen liggen de concentraties zo’n 5 keer hoger. Via reinculturen kan bijvoorbeeld 100 g/L azijnzuur geproduceerd worden met 95% zuiverheid. Vermits de producten bij gemengde fermentatie steeds verdund aanwezig zijn is een uitgebreide –en bijgevolg dure- nabehandeling nodig. Ook de opbrengst zou nog verhoogd moeten worden om deze processen industrieel relevant te maken. Gemengde fermentatie kan ontwikkelen tot een veel belovende technologie indien het mengsel van carbonzuren rechtstreeks gebruikt kan worden als precursor voor de productie van waardevolle chemicaliën zoals alcoholen, polymeren of middellange keten vetzuren.

TI  - Advances for the Aquaculture of the Australasian Sea Cucumber Australostichopus mollis
SP  - 165
AB  - In this thesis the response of wild juvenile Australasian sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis to changes in food availability and temperature was evaluated in the laboratory and used as a proxy for hatchery and grow-out scenarios. The effect of food availability in terms of organic matter content (1, 4, 12 and 20 percent TOM) was evaluated in terms of feeding behaviour (diurnal variation of ingestion rate and digestion), feeding biology (TOM selection from the food and absorption along the digestive tract) and growth. The effect of temperature (15, 18, 21 and 24 C) was evaluated through changes in their metabolism (oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion), feeding behaviour, growth and macronutrient utilization (lipid, protein, and carbohydrate selection from the food and absorption along the digestive tract), with the determination of an energy budget for each temperature treatment. Finally, the effect of temperature and the presence/absence of seawater during the transport of juvenile sea cucumbers were also evaluated by measuring their subsequent feeding activity and overall well-being (i.e., skin lesions, evisceration and survival) after exposure to the different transport conditions. The juvenile sea cucumbers feed more actively during night than day without changing their digestive activity. They are able to cope with a wide variation of TOM in their diet (from 4 to 20 percent TOM) in order to generate similar growth rates. The juveniles were able to compensate for the lower nutrient content and absorption in the 4 percent TOM treatment by increasing their selective feeding behaviour and ingestion rate. However, this was not observed in the juveniles fed with the 1 percent TOM treatment for which their body weight declined during the course of the experiment. Temperature was also found to be an important factor for the juveniles of this species. Temperature of around 24 C turned out to be lethal for the juveniles, and the sea cucumbers responded negatively to increasing holding temperatures from 15 to 21 C, which resulted in increased metabolism, reduced food intake and energy available for growth. The metabolism data showed that the juveniles rely more on protein as an energy source than lipid and carbohydrates regardless of the temperature. In terms of macronutrient selection and absorption, the juvenile sea cucumbers select and absorb lipid more efficiently than carbohydrate and protein at all experimental temperatures. Although selection and absorption of ingested nutrients are negatively affected by an increase of holding temperature from 15 to 21 C, carbohydrate and protein remained as the dominant dietary macronutrients that are absorbed by the juveniles. Higher temperatures (i.e., above 17 C) also proved to be negative for the successful transportation of juveniles due to an increase in their metabolism. However, lower temperatures (i.e., below 10 C) are also detrimental for the feeding activity, increasing the appearance of skin lesions, evisceration and mortality and therefore also affect transportation success. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate that the juveniles can be transported for short periods of time without seawater if desiccation is avoided. Transport of juveniles for longer periods of time (i.e., more than 8 hours) is possible provided they are kept with seawater and temperature is maintained within a suitable range (i.e., 12 - 15 C). Providing a better understanding of the feeding biology and growth of the juveniles and how they are affected by extrinsic factors, will help not only to improve the holding conditions of juveniles in the hatchery and nursery stage, but also help the selection of suitable aquaculture locations for grow-out, management of stocking densities, feeding regimes and the development of artificial diets.

TI  - Experimental evolution of life-history: testing the evolutionary theories of ageing
AB  - Ageing reduces fitness, but how ageing evolves is still unclear. Evolutionary theory of ageing hinges on the fundamental principal that the force of natural selection declines with age. This principle has yielded two important predictions: 1) the evolution of faster ageing in populations under high rate of extrinsic mortality; and 2) the evolution of faster ageing in a sex that experiences higher rates of extrinsic mortality. However, an emerging new theory argues that when the extrinsic mortality is not random but instead selects on traits showing positive genetic correlation with lifespan, increased mortality should lead to the evolution of increased lifespan. Such condition-dependent mortality is also expected to increase the robustness in the population, resulting in increased deceleration of mortality in late-life. Similarly, high sex-specific mortality can result in increased sex-specific selection on traits that have positive pleiotropic effects on lifespan in the affected sex. This thesis is based on two experimental evolution studies in Caenorhabditis remanei. The first experiment was designed to disentangle the effects of the rate (high or low) and the source (random or condition-dependent) of mortality on the evolution of lifespan and ageing. Reduced lifespan evolved under high rate of random mortality, whereas high condition-dependent mortality, imposed by heat-shock, led to the evolution of increased lifespan (Paper I). However, while female reproduction increased under condition-dependent mortality, male reproduction suffered, suggesting a role for sexual antagonism in maintaining genetic variation for fitness (Paper II). Besides, long lifespan and high fecundity evolved at a cost of slow juvenile growth rate in females (Paper III). Moreover, high condition-dependent mortality led to the evolution of lower rate of intrinsic mortality in late-life (Paper IV). The second experiment showed that evolution of sexual dimorphism in lifespan is driven by the factors that cause sex-specific mortality and cannot be predicted from differences in mortality rate alone. Specifically, high condition-dependent mortality renders males less prone to ageing than females despite higher rates of male mortality (Paper V). The strength of this thesis is the reconfirmation of the earlier findings combined with support for the new theory. Rather than further complicating the matter, the inclusion of the new ideas should help explain some empirical results that are inconsistent with the classic theory, as well as provide a more comprehensive picture of ageing evolution.

TI  - Plasticity, Intraspecific Variability and Local Adaptation to Climatic Extreme Events of Ecotypes/Provenances of Key Plant Species
SP  - 215
AB  - Climate change, and especially an increase of magnitude and frequency of climatic extreme events such as drought periods or heatwaves, will alter growing conditions for plants in the future. Persistent ecosystems, with long-living organisms, such as forest or permanent grassland will be particularly impacted by this development. The velocity of these changes is likely to occur at a pace which species may not be able to keep track with by natural dispersal or genetic adaptation. Agriculture, forestry and ecosystem management must develop counteracting practices to secure the persistence and functioning of these ecosystems and thus their provision of goods and services. Therefore it is important to develop a better understanding how species and ecosystems may respond to future climatic stressors. Impact assessments, e.g. via climatic envelope modelling are prone to misinterpretations of the adaptive capacity of species, as they do not incorporate the intraspecific genetic and phenotypic differences that exist within the populations across the distribution range of a species. Yet, intraspecific variation may exhibit potential tools for the development of climate change adaptation strategies. Here, I focus on key ecosystems in Central Europe. In particular the selective use of plant provenances or ecotypes may help to make ecosystems climate-resilient without a potentially more problematic introduction of exotic species. Especially provenances from warmer, drought-prone regions, with a current climate similar to the projected one for Central Europe recently came into focus as potential substitutes for local provenances, as they might have developed local adaptations to climate conditions at their location of origin. Insights about the response of these provenances to changing averages and extreme event regimes are crucial for a reasonable use of within-species diversity in climate change adaptation. First, the concept of assisted colonization or migration of species or ecotypes and the role it can play as an adaptation strategy in agriculture, forestry or nature conservation is introduced (Manuscript 1). It is suggested that a focus should be laid on keystone species that ensure ecosystem persistence and functioning as they govern the habitat structure and microclimate of a site. The assisted colonization of pre-adapted ecotypes of keystone species from climates similar to future projections for the target site is proposed. Furthermore, provenances of selected grassland and forest key-species were exposed to drought and warming in two experiments in Bayreuth and Landau, and their ecological responses were analysed. Results suggest that local adaptations to climatic stressors exist. However, the magnitude and direction of responses strongly depend on species and climatic variables. For grassland species, e.g. differences in drought sensitivity could be demonstrated in some cases (Manuscript 4). Fagus sylvatica exhibited differences between the provenances in response to drought conditions, as well (Manuscript 3). It seems that marginal provenances, from the dry margins of the distribution range, show less increment reduction due to the drought treatment. Yet, under more favourable conditions of water supply these provenances did not yield the same high increment rates than more central provenances, indicating a trade-off between stability under stress and yield under non-stress conditions. A pine species that is generally considered to be rather drought-resistant, Pinus nigra, which is a potential substitute for climate-threatened conifers on dry sites in Central Europe, did not show any differences in response to drought and warming (Manuscript 2), maybe due to a weak selective pressure as a result of high drought-resistance across the whole distribution range. The impacts of drought on increment became not visible before the second year after the treatment, stressing the need for more long-time experiments in climate impact research. Even in a generally warmer environment, cold extremes in winter or spring are expected still to prevail in the future. Therefore, the provenances of the selected species were tested for their cold-hardiness and late frost resistance (Manuscripts 5-7). Growth of the grassland species and F. sylvatica were negatively impacted by a late frost event and differences in late-frost sensitivity between provenances or ecotypes were identified. The (sub-) mediterranean species P. nigra showed differences between provenances in their winter cold hardiness. Correlations between performance under cold stress and winter conditions or late frost proneness of the places of origin could be established for almost all species. However, preceding climate experience, such as the warming or drought treatment of the plants altered their reaction to cold extremes compared to the control treatment, indicating the complexity of the interactive impacts of climate factors on ecosystem and plant performance. The uncertainty of climate projections and the multitude of changing climatic stressors, though, make the prospect of an easy and rapid success in the search for single “best-adapted” provenances very questionable. In economics the portfolio effect shows that a diversification of investments decreases the risk of a total loss of profits. Hence, in a modelling procedure based on the increment data from the above mentioned experiment it was tested if a “portfolio investment” in several provenances in one stand decreases the risk of yield losses (Manuscript 8). Results indicate that the higher the number of provenances the higher the chance for a “best-performer” to be included in the set. So the likelihood of higher yields, under different climatic conditions increases, yet the risk of low yields stays stable. Generally, it seems that the selective use of plant species and ecotypes in climate change adaptation can be a feasible tool to maintain ecosystem functionality and productivity. However, the uncertain projections, the multitude of climatic stressors and their interplay with other environmental factors and the potential impacts of assisted colonization of ecotypes on the genetic diversity within species and populations require further research.Alternate abstract:Der Klimawandel, und vor allem Veränderungen in Auftretenswahrscheinlichkeit und Intensität von Extremereignissen, wie Dürren oder Hitzewellen, werden die Wuchsbedingungen für Pflanzen künftig stark ändern. Hochstete Ökosysteme, wie extensiv genutztes Grünland oder Wälder mit langlebigen Organismen werden besonders betroffen von diesen Veränderungen. Die Geschwindigkeit mit der sich dieser Wandel vollzieht, macht es für viele Arten schwer bis unmöglich durch Arealverschiebung oder genetische Anpassung Schritt zuhalten. Vor diesem Hintergrund muss die Land- und Forstwirtschaft Gegenmaßnahmen entwickeln, die die Funktion dieser Ökosysteme erhalten und die Erträge und die Bereitstellung von ökosystemaren Dienstleistungen sichern. Das Wissen um die Auswirkungen klimatischer Stressfaktoren auf Arten und Ökosysteme ist daher unerlässlich. Die Einschätzung solcher Auswirkungen, z.B. durch Klimahüllenmodellierung, berücksichtigt die innerartliche genetische Vielfalt und phänotypische Plastizität, die innerhalb und zwischen Populationen existiert, in der Regel nicht, was zu Fehleinschätzungen der Anpassungsfähigkeit führen kann. Diese innerartliche Variation kann jedoch ein wichtiges Werkzeug darstellen, wenn es um die Klimaanpassung von Ökosystemen in Mitteleuropa geht. Dieser Studie konzentriert sich auf Schlüsselökosysteme in Mitteleuropa. Die selektive Nutzung von Herkünften oder Ökotypen wichtiger Schlüsselarten kann eventuell dazu beitragen Ökosysteme resilienter gegenüber negativen Klimaeinflüssen zu machen, ohne dabei die oft problematische Einführung von exotischen Pflanzenarten in Kauf nehmen zu müssen. Dabei geraten besonders Herkünfte aus wärmeren und trockeneren Gegenden, mit Klimabedingungen ähnlich zu den für Mitteleuropa prognostizierten in den Fokus, da diese eher solche Bedingungen angepasst sein könnten. Es ist jedoch wichtig zu wissen, wie verschieden Herkünfte auf sich verändernde Mittelwerte und Klimaextreme reagieren, um dieses Mittel vernünftig einsetzen zu können. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird das Konzept der Assisted Colonization vorgestellt und beschrieben welche Rolle es in Land- und Forstwirtschaft und im Naturschutz spielen könnte (Manuskript 1). Es wird dargelegt. Dass dabei vor allem Schlüsselarten im Fokus stehen sollten, da sie oftmals Habitatstrukturen und Mikroklima und damit auch Bestand und Funktion von Ökosystemen bestimmen. Die gezielte Einfuhr von angepassten Ökotypen aus Regionen in denen heute Klimabedingungen herrschen, wie sie für die Zielregionen prognostiziert werden, wird hierbei zu Diskussion gestellt. Weiterhin wurden Herkünfte ausgewählter Grünland- und Baumarten in einem Topfexperiment künstlicher Dürre und Erwärmung ausgesetzt, um deren Reaktion darauf zu messen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es lokale Anpassungen an klimatische Stressfaktoren gibt, diese jedoch artspezifisch variieren und stark von der jeweiligen Klimavariable abhängen. Unterschiede in der Dürreresistenz zwischen verschiedenen Herkünften mancher Grasarten (Manuskript 4), sowie zwischen Herkünften der Rot-Buche (Manuskript 3) konnten dabei nachgewiesen werden. Vor allem bei der Rot-Buche scheinen Herkünfte vom trockenen Rand des Verbreitungsgebietes weniger stark auf Dürre zu reagieren wie Herkünfte aus dem Zentrum des Verbreitungsgebietes. Jedoch konnten diese „Rand-Herkünfte“ unter günstigen, ausreichend wasserversorgten Bedingungen auch nicht so hohe Ertragsleistungen erzielen. Hier geht Stabilität unter Stressbedingungen anscheinend auf Kosten hoher Erträge unter günstigen Bedingungen. Herkünfte der Schwarz-Kiefer, einer generell dürreangepassten Art, die als möglicher Ersatz für gefährdete Nadelbaumarten auf Trockenstandorten in Mitteleuropa gilt, unterschieden sich nicht in ihrer Reaktion auf Trockenheit und Erwärmung (Mauskript 2), was durch einen schwachen Selektionsdruck aufgrund einer allgemeinen hohen Dürreresistent im gesamten Verbreitungsgebiet erklärt werden könnte. Die Zuwachsleistung reagierte jedoch erst im zweiten Jahr auf das Dürreereignis. Dies unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit von langfristig angelegten Klimaexperimenten um die Auswirkungen von extremen richtig beurteilen zu können. In einem weiteren Schritt, wurden die Herkünfte der genannten Arten auf ihre Frosthärte und Spätfrosttoleranz getestet, da solche Ereignisse auch in unter höheren Durchschnittstemperaturen dennoch möglich sein werden (Manuskripte 5-7). Spätfrostereignisse führten zu einem geringeren Wachstum bei den Grasarten als auch bei der Rot-Buche und Unterschiede zwischen den Herkünften in der Spätfrosttoleranz konnten aufgezeigt werden. Auch die Herkünfte der (sub-)mediterran verbreiteten Schwarz-Kiefer unterschieden sich in ihrer Frosthärte. Die Performance unter Kältestress korrelierte bei fast allen Arten mit Minimumtemperaturen in Winter oder Frühling in den Herkunftsorten der verschiedenen Provenienzen. Interessanterweise beeinflussten die „Klimaerfahrungen“ der Pflanzen, sprich die vorausgehenden Temperatur- und Dürremanipulationen, die Reaktion auf Frost, was die Komplexität des Zusammenspiels von verschiedenen Klimafaktoren und deren Auswirkung auf Arten und Ökosysteme deutlich macht. Die Unsicherheit der Klimaprojektionen und die Vielzahl sich verändernder Klimafaktoren machen die Suche nach einzelnen bestangepassten Herkünften jedoch nicht sehr erfolgversprechend. In den Wirtschaftswissenschaften beschreibt der Portfolio-Effekt die Risikominimierung durch eine Streuung der Investitionen. In dieser Arbeit, wurde in einem Modell, basierend auf den Zuwachsdaten aus oben genannten Experiment, getestet, ob eine „Portfolio-Investition“ in mehrere Herkünfte innerhalb eines Bestandes das Risiko von großen Zuwachsverlusten unter Stressbedingungen minimieren kann (Manuskript 8). Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass mit steigender Anzahl von Herkünften die Chance steigt eine „Super-Herkunft“ im „Portfolio“ zu haben. Das bedeutet, dass die Chance auf hohe Erträge unter verschiedenen Klimabedingungen steigt mit steigender Zahl Herkünfte, das Risiko niedriger Erträge jedoch gleich bleibt. Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass die selektive Nutzung von Herkünften oder Ökotypen durchaus ein geeignetes Mittel zur Klimaanpassung sein kann. Die Unsicherheiten der Klimaprognosen, die Vielzahl klimatischer Stressfaktoren und deren Interaktion mit anderen Umweltfaktoren, sowie die Auswirkung von Assisted Colonization auf die genetische Vielfalt innerhalb von Populationen und Arten, macht jedoch weitere Forschung notwendig.

TI  - Genetic and neuronal systems that are critical for high temperature avoidance in reflexive and learned behaviors
SP  - 85
AB  - In a variable temperature world, there is selective advantage to being able to either tolerate or escape from bad conditions and learn from experience to avoid future bad events. Within species there are multiple strategies to survive and prevent future harmful events, but how organisms allocate genetic resources to tolerance and learning strategies is far from clear. High temperatures can be used to examine multiple genetic bases of tolerance and avoidance of places predictive of aversive high temperature exposure in Drosophila. Natural variations at the foraging (for) locus provide flies with distinct behavioral strategies for survival. Drosophila with natural variants of the for locus are known to behave differently in the presence of food; the heat box was used to observe behavior in an aversive environment. I examined locomotion in rover (forR) and sitter (fors) flies for differences in high temperature induced incapacitation to test the idea that trade-offs in high temperature survival strategies might exist with key polymorphisms at this locus. Serotonin is one of the primary biogenic amines in Drosophila implicated in operant place learning. Although serotonergic cell bodies and innervations patterns have been identified, relationships between cell bodies and the associated neurite projections are still not well established. Unambiguously assigning innervation patterns to specific neuronal cell bodies is the first step to understanding the anatomical organization of serotonergic neurons. Thus I have begun to identify subsystems of serotonergic systems by generating transcription activator and repressor elements. I used the heat box paradigm to investigate both neuronal circuitry and genetic bases for operant conditioning in Drosophila, providing new insight into the fly’s ability to learn and remember to avoid a high temperature-associated place in a simple environment. Using transcription activator and repressor elements, I have identified a subsystem of serotonergic neurons necessary and sufficient for place memory after direct conditioning but not after preexposure to aversive temperatures. This dissertation work has served to identify both a subsystem of serotonergic neurons involved in learned avoidance of high temperature-associated places and tradeoffs in survival strategies employed by Drosophila when presented with a high temperature.

TI  - Polar bear distribution and habitat selection in western Hudson Bay
SP  - 118
AB  - Sea ice in Hudson Bay is melting earlier and freezing later as the climate warms, resulting in declines in the condition, survival, and population size of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Western Hudson Bay population. The objectives of this study are to analyze temporal variation in distribution and quantify patterns of seasonal habitat selection for polar bears on the sea ice in Hudson Bay to determine how they respond to changing sea ice conditions. Between 1990 and 2010, 137 satellite collars were deployed on 125 adult females yielding approximately 95 000 locations. Utilization distributions and a habitat selection model were developed. Distribution shifted seasonally and annually, and habitat selection was most affected by ice concentrations. Individual differences were most apparent during ice freeze-up and break-up. This research helps us understand how changes in sea ice alter polar bear habitat use and selection, important for predicting responses to future changes.

TI  - Reproduction in a changing ocean: the effects of ocean acidification and other environmental stressors on the sea urchin paracentrotus lividus and the polychaete ficopomatus enigmaticus
AB  - Atmospheric CO enrichment is a key factor contributing to global climate 2 change. Major consequences of climate change include increasing sea surface temperature and decreasing seawater pH (ocean acidification) – both of which are predicted to lead to an increase in ocean hypoxic events. Early ontogenetic stages of invertebrates have shown sensitivity to these environmental changes. Previous research has focused on short-term exposure to these environmental factors; however, the long- term and multi-generational effects of ocean acidification on organismal reproduction and development have received little attention. The aim of this thesis is to address this shortcoming for reproduction and early embryonic development of the economically- and ecologically-important sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus (Lamark, 1816) and the reef-forming invasive polychaete, Ficopomatus enigmaticus (Fauvel, 1923). Fertilisation success and early embryogenesis of P. lividus were negatively impacted under conditions of increased pCO, at ambient temperature and ambient 2 +2°C after 12 months exposure. Sperm motility – determined by computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) – showed a significant increase in average swimming speed measured as curvilinear velocity (VCL) at increased pCO levels after 6 months but by 2 12 months VCL values had decreased. There was no overall significant effect of pCO 2 on VCL but there was a significant reduction in fertilisation success under hypoxic conditions. Increasing pCO levels appeared to buffer the effects of hypoxia, however, 2 with significantly lower fertilisation success observed only under hypoxic conditions at ambient pCO. Multi-generational experiments examined the effects of increased pCO on 2 F.enigmaticus. Both percentage sperm motility and sperm VCL were similar between experimental treatments, but there was a significant difference between generations 0 and 2. In contrast, fertilisation success was negatively affected by both pH and generation, with a significant reduction seen with pH at all generations and a significant reduction seen between generation 0 and generation 2. Oocyte diameter was also significantly affected by pH and generation, with a significant increase in egg diameter seen at generation 1 in all pH treatments except pH 7.95, which shows a significant increase and generation 2, which suggests differing levels of maternal investment. This research suggests that in the long term, ocean acidification, temperature and hypoxia may seriously impact the reproduction and development of two important marine invertebrate species. This research highlights the need for further long-term investigation involving multiple stressors to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects arising from changing oceanic chemistry.

TI  - Robustness, Structure and Thermotolerance: Experimental Evolution of the RNA Virus Phi6

AB  - My thesis used experimental evolution of the RNA virus &phis;6 to examine mechanisms of adaptation. I focused on a trade-off in the virus between the evolution of increased thermotolerance and reduced reproduction on its host. Through the use of structural and biochemical approaches, I was able to trace how a change in the genotype caused a change in the phenotype of the virus. I also examined how genetic and environmental robustness are linked in viruses. In my introductory chapter, I examined trade-offs in viruses with a particular focus on trade-offs between reproduction and survival. I highlighted how experimental evolution can reveal trade-offs and their associated mechanisms. I reviewed how various factors such as environmental stressors, proteins governing host range and organization of the virus genome affect reproduction/survival tradeoffs. I provided an explanation for why the 'curse of the pharaoh' (viruses with high virulence and extreme stability) would generally only apply to viruses of eukaryotes and not to bacteriophage. Finally, I discussed how a synthesis of comparative biology, experimental evolution and structural biology will be necessary to answer future questions in how viral trade-offs evolve and the constraints on adaptation. In my second chapter, I experimentally evolved an RNA virus, the bacteriophage &phis;6, to withstand higher temperatures imposed by a heat shock, which caused high mortality. Viruses exposed to the heat shock evolved higher survival at the cost of reduced efficiency of killing their host, Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola. I discovered a single amino acid substitution (V207F) in the lysin protein, P5, which was present in all the evolved thermotolerant populations. I demonstrated that this mutation increased the stability of P5 by filling a hydrophobic pocket, which explained the increased thermotolerance in the virus. However, there was no difference in activity between the mutant and wildtype protein. This suggested that the reproduction/survival trade-off in the virus was not mediated by a stability/activity trade-off in a single protein but rather was due to other factors such as capsid assembly or protein-protein interactions. Additionally, crystallization of P5 identified P5 as a lytic transglycosylase. In my third chapter, I examined how genetic robustness, the maintenance of phenotype despite mutation, affected the rate of adaptation. I took populations of &phis;6, which had previously been characterized as differing in robustness and evolved them through a repeated environmental disturbance: a heat shock. More robust populations evolved faster to withstand the heat shock and achieved relatively greater thermotolerance by the end of the experiment compared to less robust (brittle) populations. Sequencing identified adaptive mutations and showed that a particular mutation was absent in some brittle populations. This chapter showed how increased robustness could lead to increased evolvability as robust populations can more easily access mutations of large benefit. In my fourth chapter, I examined the relationship between genetic robustness and environmental robustness in viruses. Although the link between these two types of robustness has been demonstrated at other levels of biological organization such as proteins, empirical data is lacking in viruses and other organisms. I took viruses which differed in environmental robustness, as measured by their survival to extreme temperature, and performed a mutation accumulation experiment on 95 individual lines. By measuring the change in fitness of these evolved lines, I showed that more environmentally robust viruses were also more genetically robust as they suffered less fitness loss following mutation accumulation. Finally, I presented a model, drawing on my previous structural chapter, showing how environmental robustness and genetic robustness are linked in viruses. In my fifth and final chapter, I performed an extended evolution experiment adapting &phis;6 to repeated heat shocks for 140 days. I found many parallel mutations suggesting that at least four different proteins contribute to the evolution of increased thermotolerance. During the course of the 140-day experiment, three out of eight treatment populations went extinct as the heat shock temperature was increased. I showed how initial mutations constrained future adaptation destining these three populations for extinction. The large number of potentially adaptive mutations discovered by this study will provide a springboard for future work, which will allow a mechanistic description of the fitness landscape of mutations in &phis;6 contributing to thermotolerance.

TI  - Introgression, natural selection, and thermal tolerance in blue mussels (Genus mytilus)
SP  - 223
AB  - My dissertation addressed questions of the origin and maintenance of biodiversity, and the genomic response to environmental change in blue mussels (genus Mytilus). In chapters One and Two I explored the nature of species barriers and the consequence of hybridization. The ecological and genetic factors determining the extent of introgression between species in secondary contact zones remain poorly understood. I investigated the relative importance of natural selection and the demographic expansion of invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis on the magnitude and the direction of introgression with the native M. trossulus in a hybrid zone in central California. I used double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) to genotype 1,751 randomly-selected single nucleotide polymorphisms and accurately distinguish early and advanced generation hybrids for the first time in Mytilus. I found that ecologically based selection plays only a small direct role in maintaining reproductive isolation in the California hybrid zone, and that colonization history is an important control on the movement of genetic elements (i.e. introgression) during hybridization. Despite only low rates of hybridization between invasive Mediterranean blue mussel (M. galloprovincialis) and native blue mussel M. trossulus, introgression is occurring, and the geographic spread of M. galloprovincialis appears to drive the majority of introgression into the invasive species. My work reinforces the idea that demographic processes mediate the role played by natural selection in maintaining species barriers. Chapter Three focused on the genetic consequences of large-scale environmental change. I developed new techniques using mRNA sequencing and ancestral state reconstruction to estimate rates of structurally stabilizing substitutions in blue mussels. I found that warm-adapted Mytilus galloprovincialis have higher rates of stabilizing substitutions than cold-adapted M. trossulus, which suggests that natural selection can efficiently modify structural properties of proteins to fine-tune thermal tolerance based on small changes in temperature of just several °C. As a whole, my dissertation reiterates the importance of demographic processes in controlling the movement of genetic material during hybridization, indicates introgression may contribute to invasive success, and documents subtle natural selection for changes in protein properties of warm adapted M. galloprovincialis.

TI  - The genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in natural populations of Drosophila
SP  - 100
AB  - Environment-dependent phenotypic expression, also known as phenotypic plasticity is exhibited to some degree by all organisms. Natural selection can act on the ability to respond to the environment allowing individuals to maintain fitness across heterogeneous environments. However, phenotypic plasticity can also potentially slow the rate of adaptive evolution within a population or result in maladaptive phenotypes. Despite the widespread occurrence and consequence for adaptive evolution, the genetic architecture and specific molecular variants that underlie phenotypic plasticity remain largely unknown. To evaluate patterns of plasticity and the genes that mediate the plastic response this work utilizes Drosophila melanogaster and its close sister specie Drosophila simulans. Individual lines collected from natural populations of D. melanogaster and D. simulans have previously been shown to exhibit phenotypic plasticity for several traits in response to changes in temperature and nutrition. However, these studies do not address patterns of plasticity across heterogeneous environments. To establish that the strength of the plastic response varies within and among natural populations isofemale lines of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were collected from three locations along the east coast and exposed to various larval rearing environment. The geographic pattern in the strength of the plastic response is only present in some traits and absent in others, which highlights the modular nature of phenotypic plasticity. To identify a gene that is able to modulate plasticity across several life history traits this work takes advantage of a candidate gene approach. A previously identified genetic polymorphism in the couch potato (cpo) gene in D. melanogaster mediates the propensity to diapause is shown in this work to affect the individual's ability to respond plastically across several life history traits. The patterns observed in the investigation of cpo parallel the patterns of plasticity observed in natural populations. Thus, polymorphism in cpo gene may play an important role in the meditation of plasticity in natural populations. These findings provide insight into plasticity within natural populations and the genes that underlie the strength of the plastic response.

TI  - Genetic bases and phenotypic consequences of high-temperature adaptation in Escherichia coli
SP  - 169
AB  - Connecting phenotype to genotype and fitness has been a major challenge when studying adaptation. Experimental evolution is a powerful method to facilitate the study of adaptation as an outcome and as a process. This dissertation used 114 clones of Escherichia coli that were evolved independently for 2000 generations under thermal stress (42.2ºC). The goal of my dissertation was to link phenotypes and fitness with specific mutations and to identify the functional mechanisms leading to thermal adaptation. Chapter 1 focused on a subset of populations that became resistant to an antibiotic, rifampicin, during thermal stress adaptation. Rifampicin resistance was caused by three mutations at codon position 572 of the rpoB gene, which encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP). I used samples from 200 generation intervals to assess the frequency trajectory of rifampicin resistance. I found that resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. Finally, I confirmed that the three mutations conferred high advantage in glucose-limited medium at 42ºC in the ancestral background. Chapter 2 investigated the same rpoB mutations in codon 572 to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying their fitness improvement at high temperature. I measured their growth curves and gene expression (mRNAseq) at 42ºC, and compared them to the growth and gene expression of the ancestor at 37ºC and 42ºC. Two rpoB mutations restored the gene expression back to an ancestral state, while one mutation, exaggerated the expression changes of the ancestor at 42ºC. Lastly, I compared the phenotypic characteristics of one single mutant, I572L, to those of two high-temperature adapted clones with this mutation. I concluded that the I572L9 mutation contributed to most of the expression changes while later mutations did not substantially changed gene expression. Chapter 3 explored the phenotypic consequences of high temperature adaptation in 114 clones. I measured the magnitude of fitness trade-offs across a thermal gradient. I identified two niche dynamics that I associated with two genetic pathways. Overall, my dissertation associates mutations to phenotypes in the context of thermal stress adaptation, and it highlights the difficulties of connecting genotype to phenotype, even if in a "simple" experimental system.

TI  - Rapid evolution and population divergence in response to environmental change in Colias butterlies
SP  - 109
AB  - My dissertation focuses on how environmental change, specifically in temperature and host plants, can drive physiological and morphological differences. I took advantage of historical studies with the Colias system of butterflies to assess adaptation and plasticity in larval performance in response to climatic change and changing host plant abundance. I have found that changing temperatures have affected the adaptation of some larval traits but not others. Specifically, as temperature variability has increased in both California and Colorado populations of Colias, the larval feeding rate has shifted to correspond to the new environmental conditions. Next, I studied how two Colorado populations of Colias eriphyle cope with repeated exposures to sub-lethal high temperatures simulating multi-day heat waves. I found that the higher elevation population suffered less detrimental fitness effects than the lower elevation population in regards to both short term (heat shock gene expression) and long term (overall growth rate) fitness effects. Building on my interest of how temperature and temperature variation affects multiple life stages I studied the effects of temperature during the pupal life stage on survival, growth and the resultant adult wing morphology. Generally, high temperatures decreased pupal time and less melanic adult wings. Finally, I used the two populations of C. eriphyle to quantify thermal performance differences of fitness when larvae consume different host plants at two temperatures. I found that cooler temperatures increased the difference in performance between populations consuming different host plants and that thermal performance differs between populations. My research shows that temperature can affect fitness across many life stages and organisms have responded to these changes in temperature over time by adaptation.

TI  - Mantle-crust Interaction in Granite Petrogenesis in Post-collisional Settings: Insights from the Danubian Variscan Plutons of the Romanian Southern Carpathians
SP  - 201
AB  - The issue of granite petrogenesis plays a key role in our overall understanding of the growth and differentiation of continents, as well as in our ability to unravel the tectonic histories of orogenic belts. Granites are ubiquitous magmatic products found in almost all tectonic settings: oceanic and continental rifts (i.e., plagiogranites – extreme basalt differentiates), active continental margins (e.g,. the granitic batholiths of central and southern Andes), continent-continent collision zones ( e.g., the orogenic batholiths of the Himalayas, Western Anatolia), post-collisional settings (e.g., the Variscan provinces of Europe), complex within-plates settings (e.g., Limmo massif, Afar, Ethiopia). Furthermore, granitoids are characterized by considerable petrological and geochemical heterogeneity, as they can form from a vast array of sources: sediments (e.g., pelites, arkoses, psammites), metamorphic rocks (e.g., (mica)schists, gneisses, etc.), and igneous rocks (e.g. andesites, dacites, tonalites, etc.). Aside from fertile sources (i.e., protoliths), granite petrogenesis is dependent upon two critical parameters: temperature (to promote melting of the protoliths) and water availability - either as freely available aqueous solutions/vapors (e.g., water input in subduction zones); or water released via dehydration melting of hydrous minerals (e.g., micas, amphiboles). The presence of water in protoliths depresses the melting temperature of mineral components and provides the environment for redistribution of chemical components. This bears great importance in our understanding of the evolution of the crust and argues that mantle-crust interactions are responsible for the generation of continental crust even in the latest stages of an orogen.

TI  - Can biochar mitigate nitrogen losses in organic farming systems?
SP  - 130
AB  - Nitrogen (N) management represents a challenge for organic farming systems. In particular, sufficient N mineralization is not always achieved, timing of N release and plant uptake is often not synchronized, and subsequent N transformations of mineralized N may be lost as environmental pollutants (e.g., leached N and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions). Biochar, the charcoal obtained from the thermal decomposition of biomass waste under limited oxygen supply, has the potential to alter soil physicochemical properties that regulate the retention of soil N. This dissertation evaluates biochar as a means to improve N management in organic farming systems by reducing environmental N losses and stabilizing N within the agricultural landscape. The following three experiments investigated these conditions using a multi-scale approach, including an on-farm trial and greenhouse experiments, high-frequency assessment of greenhouse gases (GHGs), 15N pool dilution techniques, and microbial analysis. The first experiment examined the effects of a variety of biochar amendments on plant performance, soil properties and N transformation rates in a mesocosm representing an organic lettuce production system (Lactuca sativa ). N2O fluxes were monitored throughout the growing period as well as functional genes that encode nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) enzymes of bacteria. Findings from this study indicate that some biochars may accelerate N mineralization from organic fertilizer and increase net nitrification. Decreases in N2O fluxes were only observed for a short period, not leading to significant effects in total emissions. The second experiment examined whether biochar amendments reduce N losses from soils and improve plant performance and whether these effects are N level dependent. Fertilizer inputs, N output through harvest, leachate, and N2O emissions were used to assess N utilization and environmental losses of biochar-amended soils. These evaluations were carried out for two growing seasons in a mesocosm representing an organic lettuce production system. Analyses of plant performance indicate that biochar amendments did not provide any increases in plant biomass in soils that received less than commercial fertilization rates (225 kg N ha -1). At commercial fertilization rates, biochar increased N use efficiency (NUE) and decreased N losses via leaching, which lead to a significant decrease in ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass. N2O emissions were altered by biochar amendments only in soils that received 50% of commercial fertilization rates (112 kg N ha-1), which did not alter the ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass. The third experiment provides an on-farm high frequency assessment of GHG emissions from biochar amended-soils in an organic walnut orchard, in addition to an estimate of the GHG savings from the conversion of orchard residue into utility grade energy. Despite observed short-term decreases, biochar alone or in combination with compost did not alter total CO2 and N2O emissions from soils; whereas, the conversion of orchard residue into energy and C sequestration through soil amendment lead to a carbon credit of 100.3 Mg CO2-Ceq per year. In conclusion, biochar did not decrease total N2O emissions from soils, but occasionally reduced N losses via leachate and improved plant utilization of N. A larger long-term environmental benefit of biochar was found to occur when using orchard residue for energy generation and C sequestration in soils.

AB  - The legacy of historical biogeography impacts many organisms and results in a wide range of character variation over a latitudinal gradient. The pitcher-plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii is one such organism that demonstrates a wide range of phenotypic and genotypic variation over the entirety of its range from the Gulf Coast to Canada. A geographic cline established by the presence and recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is manifest in the narrow range of thermal tolerance exhibited by different populations and also in the differing propensity of bloodfeeding by these mosquitoes. These contemporary clines were analyzed by a variety of experimental methods ranging from year-long fitness assays, scanning electron microscopy, and RNA-sequencing to determine the patterns underlying the resulting evolutionary differences among established populations.

TI  - The Development and Function of the Nasopharynx and its Role in the Evolution of Primate Respiratory Abilities
SP  - 434
AB  - The nasopharynx is a centrally located region of the upper respiratory tract (URT) integral to several physiological functions. However, few have focused on this area within the context of human evolution. This study investigated osseous morphology, soft tissue histology, development, and evolutionary change of the nasopharynx. Multimodal analyses were performed: Analysis 1: This study tested hypotheses on the morphological relationships of the osseous nasopharyngeal boundaries with the splanchnocranium and basicranium among dry crania representing humans and non-human primates using 3D geometric morphometrics (3D-GM). Results showed that humans, the most orthognathic group, exhibited the widest nasopharynges. Over human development, the nasopharynx grows vertically taller and anteroposteriorly shorter while the path of the cartilaginous Eustachian tube (CET) grows longer and more vertically oriented. Timing of these growth changes coincide with changes in frequency of otitis media. Analysis 2: The nasopharynx was hypothesized to warm and humidify air only via its bony, non-contractile surfaces. Air conditioning capacity was assessed by presence of submucosal blood vessels, mucous cells, and serous cells on histological slides of nasopharyngeal surfaces. Results indicated that all of these microstructures were present on all nasopharyngeal surfaces, rather than being restricted to non-conctractile bony surfaces. Analysis 3: Ambient climate was hypothesized to influence URT growth. Two groups of adult male Macaca mulatta raised in Oregon (cold climate) and California (warm climate) outdoor colonies were used. CT imaging and 3D-GM were performed. Results revealed no shape differences but the Oregon individuals exhibited larger airway size and smaller body mass than the California individuals. Thus being raised in cold climates appears related to development of larger URT proportions relative to body size. Analysis 4: Nasopharyngeal morphology of fossil hominins, including Neanderthals and mid-Pleistocene Homo (MPH) from Europe and Africa, were reconstructed using 3D coordinate data and analyzed via 3D-GM. Neanderthals exhibited greater CET length than MPH and modern humans while the horizontal CET orientation of Neanderthals resembled the human infant condition. Results strongly suggest that Neanderthals possessed CET morphology and physiology distinct from modern humans, likely impacting susceptibility to middle ear disease and supporting species-level distinction.

TI  - Environmental context matters: studies of variation in developmental life-history traits in insects
SP  - 147
AB  - Life history traits influence the survival and reproduction of organisms. They can vary across organisms based on previous response to selection and based on plastic responses to abiotic and biotic factors. Here, I examine how life history traits of insects vary in response to environmental conditions and in response to association with microbial symbionts. I introduce life-history theory and traits, how traits vary in response to environment, and the biological systems used in this dissertation. I then use a meta-analytic statistical approach to estimate the variation in life-history traits of the species within the Culex pipiens complex. I demonstrate that the temperature of the developmental habitat is a more significant explanatory factor for development rate variation than sub-species identity. The effect of temperature, however, is heterogeneous and the residual variation in development rate is best explained by two factors, density and study methodology. I repeat this approach in another species, Aedes aegypti, where environmental context of temperature alone is sufficient to explain development rate variation. To test the results, I assess the impact of three environmental factors over a wide range of values on development in Ae. aegypti. Using this empirical approach, I demonstrate that temperature, diet, and density interact to explain developmental life-history traits. I also found that the effect of temperature is mediated by the context of diet and density. Finally, I experimentally consider the impact of an obligate microbial symbiont on development and survival in a hemimetabolous stinkbug reared on two alternative plants. I show that host plant context mediates the impact of symbiosis on its stinkbug host's development. These studies illustrate that environmental context matters for life-history trait variation. The phenotypic expression of these traits is contingent on multiple environmental factors both abiotic and biotic.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary responses of tropical ectotherms to climate change
SP  - 138
AB  - Despite decades of research, the ability of scientists to predict the responses of ectothermic organisms to climate change remains remarkably low. Though an increasing number of models incorporate mechanistic relationships between environmental temperature and physiology, they often ignore other important pathways by which climate affects organismal fitness. Here, I explore some of these mechanisms, and the ways in which their inclusion can alter model outcomes for a group that is considered particularly vulnerable: tropical ectotherms. First, I show how models for the responses of populations to climate change must include biologically-relevant measurements of environmental temperature. In the Bay Islands of Honduras, I project warming onto fine-scaled temperature distributions generated from physical models and combine them with thermal performance curves from 5 populations of Anolis lizards. Contrary to the conclusions of previous studies, I show that the these populations may not be extremely vulnerability to warming. Second, I examine the relative effects of environmental temperature, wind speed, and humidity on the abundance of two lizard species from the island of Cayo Menor, Honduras. Though most models only include the effects of mean temperature, I show that temperature variation and wind speed may be more important drivers of lizard activity levels. Third, I conduct a field experiment to test the degree to which rapid climate change drives natural selection on thermal physiology. I transplant a population of Anolis sagrei from preferred habitat to a warmer, more thermally variable site and measure viability selection. Relative to a reference population studied in a less stressful thermal environment, the transplanted population experienced strong, directional selection on thermal performance traits. Finally, I examine the degree to which insular populations of A. sagrei in the Bahamas are locally adapted to their thermal environment in the face of gene flow from geographically disparate populations. Despite extremely high rates of gene flow across the archipelago, I find that the thermal optima of populations are positively correlated with both the mean and maximum environmental temperatures of each island. This suggests that metapopulation structure is unlikely to increase the vulnerability of A. sagrei to climate change.

TI  - The evolutionary genetics and genomics of physiological adaptation in Drosophila
SP  - 163
AB  - To fully understand the process of adaptation, we must connect genetic variation to phenotypes that impact fitness. The outcomes of selection can depend on a number of factors including the population genetic environment experienced by genes that encode phenotypes of interest, the degree of pleiotropy, and whether alleles at different loci interact to impact trait values. Here, I use a variety of approaches to evaluate the evolution of physiological strategies at the genomic, cellular, protein, and whole organismal levels in experimentally evolved and natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. The holometabolous Drosophilid flies inhabit a range of environments with populations distributed from Tasmania in the south to Finland in the north. Flies experience strong selection to adapt to temperature and to environmental toxins found in their necrotic developmental environment (e.g., ethanol). I demonstrate that variable temperatures favor genotypes with a greater capacity to remodel their cell membranes in response to thermal change. Alleles with greater environmental sensitivity appear to underlie this response, which increases components of fitness. While evolutionary models assume genetic independence of developmental and reversible plasticity, I show that cell membrane plasticity covaries positively across life stages. However, within the adult stage membrane responses to warm and to cool thermal shifts are genetically decoupled. I then present evidence that pathway flux better explains survival under ethanol than do the activities of any single enzyme in the ethanol detoxification pathway. Finally, I show that despite the small effective population size, lack of recombination, and elevated mutation rate of the mitochondria, genes encoded in this small genome do not harbor an excess of deleterious polymorphisms relative to their nuclear counterparts. Together the results of my dissertation provide insight into the evolutionary genetics of physiological adaptation in D. melanogaster from nucleotide sequence to cellular, protein, and fitness phenotypes.

TI  - Adaptation and Specialization in the Evolution of Bacterial Metabolism
SP  - 172
AB  - Specialization is a balance of evolutionary adaptation and its accompanying costs. Here we focus on the Lenski Long-Term Evolution Experiment, which has maintained cultures of Escherichia coli in the same, defined seasonal environment for 50,000 generations. This dissertation explores the extent and means by which metabolic specialization occurs over an extended period in the same environment. Chapter 1 provides an overview and introduction of the problem. In Chapter 2 we investigated the acquired dependence on citrate for optimal growth of some of the adapting populations. Earlier work uncovered that one of the adapting populations gained the ability to utilize citrate as a sole carbon source. We showed that in addition to this population, three other lineages evolving in parallel began to rely on citrate as a chelator of iron for optimal growth on glucose. This specialization seemed to have occurred through loss of function, most consistent with the accumulation of mutations in iron transport genes that were obviated by abundant citrate. In Chapter 3 we examined changes in fitness of the evolving populations on carbon sources other than the glucose on which they adapted. We demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results, and surprisingly accompanied by improvements on a variety of substrates. Strains with higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, and these were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature. These findings suggested that specialization does not mainly result as a consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome. In Chapter 4 we tested the ability of Flux Balance Analysis models to predict evolved changes in central metabolism. We measured metabolic fluxes for evolved populations from the Lenski experiment, and compared them along with datasets from two other experiments to flux predictions. We found that improved growth largely derived from increased rate of substrate use. Flux predictions were more accurate for two experiments initiated with relatively sub-optimal ancestors, whereas ancestors near the optimum tended to move away from predictions over experimental evolution.

TI  - Dispersal Potential Impacts Size Clines of Grasshoppers Across an Elevation Gradient
SP  - 53
AB  - Body size is an important life history trait that determines reproductive success of insects through its effects on their physiology, ecology, and behavior. Changes in body size may have both a genetic component when local conditions select for optimal body size and an environmental component when it is influenced by temperature, food availability, and other environmental factors. Along elevational gradients converse Bergmann clines, a decrease in body size with an increase in elevation, are commonly observed within insects when seasonality is present. No cline may also be observed when insects compensate for an abbreviated season by increasing their growth rate at high elevations or when environmental conditions fail to produce an effect. However, a key trait that has not been previously considered to influence the observed size cline of an insect is dispersal potential. Here, I hypothesize that an increase in dispersal potential, which suggests an increase in gene flow, impacts the type of size cline exhibited by grasshoppers across an elevation gradient. The impact of dispersal potential on two key life history traits associated with body size, reproductive potential and reproductive output, is also examined. I use two long winged species, Melanoplus sanguinipes and Camnula pellucida, to represent the high dispersal group and two short winged species, Aeropedellus clavatus, and Melanoplus boulderensis, to represent the low dispersal group. My findings support the hypothesis that dispersal potential influences the body size-elevation relationship and reproductive potential of a grasshopper species across an elevation gradient. However, my findings fail to show dispersal potential impacts reproductive output. This study suggests dispersal potential may influence the evolution of body size of insect species and should be considered in future studies.

TI  - Impact of genome content on the distribution and physiology of marine Cyanobacteria
SP  - 109
AB  - The ocean plays a key role in the global carbon and nutrients cycles and account for 50% of the world's carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere converting it to oxygen. Two central players in the ocean carbon and nutrient cycles are the smallest but predominant marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Together, they are responsible for 25.2% of the ocean's net primary productivity. Their abundance relies heavily on environmental nutrient concentrations, in particular nitrogen and phosphorus, temperature and light availability. Changes in environmental conditions are a threat to global ocean cycles and could potentially alter their activity, distribution and diversity in the oceans. Genomic studies provide detailed information on the many genes that drive biogeochemical patterns and serve as an important step toward understanding the role of marine cyanobacteria in ocean environment. Moreover, we have evidence that biogeography linked with environmental variables can influence the diversity and distribution of marine cyanobacteria. Therefore, the goal of my dissertation has been to understand the impact of genome content on the distribution and physiology of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. I used a combination of laboratory experiments and field metagenomics to link variations in genome content with changes in physiology and distribution. I first examined how variations in growth rate affect the physiology of Synechococcus strains in a chemostat experiment under phosphate limitation. We found that there are physiological differences between strains related to growth at difference phosphate levels and we estimated new Ks,p value and C:N:P ratios for Synechococcus that can be use to better parameterize ocean biogeochemical models. We suggest that differences in genome content could potentially be responsible for physiological differences. Previous studies in natural populations have found differences in physiology between different strains of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus but whole genome content variations have never been investigated in Synechococcus field populations. In order to assess genomic diversity associated with Synechococcus we developed a method for targeted metagenomic sequencing of marine cyanobacteria. We combined cell sorting and metagenomics to improve on current methods and resolve phylogenetically field populations of interest as well as specific genes. We then applied our method to assess the genomic diversity of Synechococcus populations in the Western North Atlantic Ocean. We found that we can distinguish spatial and temporal variations of Synechococcus clades and genome content that are correlated to ambient nutrient concentrations, temperature, and depths. These results suggest that genome content along with environmental variables shape the diversity and distribution of marine cyanobacteria. Thereby, through my dissertation I linked genetic adaptation, physiology and ocean biogeochemical cycles to help understand how changes in ocean environment could affect the distribution and diversity of the most dominant and ecologically important marine cyanobacteria.

TI  - Experimental evolution and intragenomic homologous recombination in Escherichia coli
SP  - 121
AB  - Intragenomic homologous recombination (IHR) is a critical mechanism of DNA repair that can result in genome rearrangements. Like all mutations, genome rearrangements, i.e., large-scale deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations, can be harmful, of neutral effect, or beneficial. To evaluate the role of genome rearrangements in bacterial evolution, I inserted the bacteriophage P1 ref gene into the Escherichia coli lac operon to create a strain with an elevated rate of IHR. I then maintained small populations of E. coli initiated either with the constructed strain (high IHR populations) or with the wildtype (low IHR populations) for 500 generations in a novel environment, characterized by glycerol minimal medium and periodic heat stress. Fitness assays using the generation 500 populations revealed that fitness gains were rapid, but did not differ in magnitude between the low and high IHR treatments. However, the high IHR populations followed adaptive trajectories that were significantly less variable than the low IHR populations. This reduced variability suggests that the evolution of the high IHR populations may have been more deterministic than that of the low IHR populations, due to an increased mutation supply rate. To elucidate the genetic basis of the adaptation to the novel evolution experiment environment, I fully sequenced the genomes of two clones, one low ref- and one ref+, from the endpoint of the evolution experiment. I found that the two clones had acquired non-overlapping sets of point mutations and rearrangement breakpoints, suggesting that they took alternate routes to adaptation. These studies represent the first steps in validating the lac<>ref system for use in studying IHR, and in assessing whether IHR rate has the potential to modulate adaptive evolution in small bacterial populations.

TI  - The Plastic and Evolutionary Responses of Fish to Anthropogenic Stressors
SP  - 200
AB  - Ecosystems are being altered at unprecedented rates with little knowledge of the potential impacts on biodiversity. Two of the most pressing contemporary anthropogenic stressors are pollution and global warming. Species can respond to these stressors via dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, or evolutionary adaptation. Many species, especially aquatic organisms, experience ecological or physical barriers to dispersal and will therefore have to respond via phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary responses. I examined the responses of multiple traits associated with fitness in fish to pollution and increased temperature using a 2 × 2 common garden experimental design. I examined the effects of pollution on behaviour in a natural population of brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus), and increased temperature on population demographics, life history traits, reproductive traits, and the immune response in experimental populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata). The plastic responses to pollution were increased locomotion and decreased aggression and the plastic responses to increased temperature were decreased age at maturity, sperm length, sperm velocity, and sperm path linearity. These results are indicative of stress responses by the fish and could potentially decrease reproductive success and survival. Next, I measured reproductive output in experimental populations of guppies and found that, after many generations in elevated temperature, females produced fewer, smaller broods than control populations. However, I found no effect of temperature on census population size, survivorship, sex ratio, size-at-age, or the immune response, indicating that, despite the decreased reproductive output, guppies appear to cope with the increased temperature. Additionally, genetic diversity in the elevated temperature populations decreased more rapidly than control populations, and was equivalent to one quarter the effective population size relative to the controls. This latter result shows a clear signature of selection. Indeed, I found that sperm length displayed an evolutionary response in an estimated 2-3 generations. And in a natural population of bullheads, after an estimated 33 generations, I found an evolutionary response in locomotion and aggression. However, the reduced genetic diversity could lower the adaptive potential of populations to future stressors. I discuss these results in the context of the scope of organisms to rapidly respond to anthropogenic stressors.

TI  - Exploring Information Generation and Propagation from the Point of Installation on Construction Jobsites: An SNA/ABM Hybrid Approach
SP  - 1
AB  - Construction requires the knowledge and experience of craftsmen. The knowledge and experience is gained through local coordination and local adaption at points of installation, which classifies the work as complex production. Information generated at these points of installation can be valuable in understanding how and why workers make decisions, especially at points of improvisation when they encounter obstacles. However, this information often goes unrecognized at least in explicit form by the workers themselves, and is therefore not documented and not captured. The author's experience and observations on construction jobsites, combined with literature review, show that the information generated from the point of installation has not been extensively studied or modeled in construction. However, other industries characterized as complex production have seen improvements by studying and modeling the information generated and propagated from the point where the knowledge and experience of skilled craftsmen do their work. The research postulate studied herein is that if this information is modeled and understood, the impact it has on jobsites would be known and work performance could improve. The literature shows that observation-based studies of information generation at the worker and crew level have only recently been conducted, and not from the standpoint of information propagation. In addition, the literature led to identification of agent based modeling (ABM) and social network analysis (SNA) as sound approaches for modeling the information generation and propagation from the point of installation. The research method included developing a conceptual information model, evaluating and improving the model based on pilot jobsite observations; data collection and observations used to develop a representative model of the information generation and propagation from points of installation. A unique approach of an SNA-informed ABM was used to simulate the final model, and test the result with select jobsite scenarios. The data collected showed that information is indeed generated and often not captured or reported from the point of installation. Workers encounter obstacles in 89% of their scheduled activities, and information about those obstacles only propagates beyond the crew level 50% of the time. The simulated SNA-informed ABM based on the data collection and conceptual model showed that there are differences in how workers handle obstacles in early vs. later stages of the jobsite, and also on large vs. small jobsites. Workers are more influenced by others in the early stages of a job and on jobsites with fewer workers. In conclusion, by studying the information generation and propagation from the point of installation with empirical data collection, observations, and conceptual model building, a simulation showed how this information could impact work performance. In addition, explorations of the simulated model showed how the information available from the point of installation propagates and influences jobsite outcomes.

TI  - Three Essays on Estimating Causal Treatment Effects
SP  - 1
AB  - This dissertation is composed of three distinct chapters, each of which addresses issues of estimating treatment effects. The first chapter empirically tests the Value-Added (VA) model using school lotteries. The second chapter, co-authored with Michael Wood, considers properties of inverse probability weighting (IPW) in simple treatment effect models with selection bias. The third chapter, co-authored with Guanglei Hong and Heather D. Hill, explores unbiased estimation of treatment effect models with mediators. VA is designed to estimate the treatment effects of schools and teachers on students' academic outcomes. They rely on a conditional independence assumption that is not testable within-sample: students are not sorted to schools based on unobserved components of their test score. There has been an extensive debate in the economic and education policy literature regarding this issue but very few empirical tests, especially for school--as opposed to teacher--VA. This chapter directly tests the assumption using school lotteries, in which students are randomly assigned an offer from a charter school. First, I formally link VA to a model for the Intent to Treat (ITT) effect of winning the lottery. Next, I show how the ITT parameter can be expressed as a linear combination of parameters from VA. I then replace those parameters with estimates from estimating the VA model on the full sample of students and schools in the district, and show that this VA-based estimate of the ITT parameter will be unbiased if the VA school effect estimates are themselves unbiased. My results fail to reject the null hypothesis that estimates from VA are unbiased. I test a number of different VA models used frequently in the literature, and also discuss the implications of my results for teacher VA models. The second chapter explores the performance of IPW as a treatment effect estimator in linear models with selection bias. IPW has been presented as an estimator that has the advantage of being non-parametric. However, its advantages over ordinary least squares (OLS) may turn into a disadvantage in the presence of selection bias, which will frequently occur in observational settings. IPW may inflate selection bias by giving the greatest weight to observations that contribute most to bias. We present our intuition, and then provide a proof that verifies this and other conjectures. Using simulations and real data, we compare the bias of IPW, OLS and other re-weighting estimators that we introduce. We allow for heterogeneity in the treatment effect, and suggest how researchers may be able to differentiate between heterogeneity and misspecification. The third chapter introduces and applies an innovative weighting approach to causal mediation analysis. This method allows for a treatment-by-mediator interaction, unlike other techniques for estimating the effects of mediators. Applied to the setting of a welfare-to-work experiment, our weighting method decomposes the treatment effect into direct and indirect effects, and demonstrates how to estimate these effects using ratio of mediator probability weighting. We also employ simulations to test the robustness of our estimators to misspecification of the propensity score model.

TI  - Language Arts Achievement of Fourth Grade Students with Regard to Gender, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status
SP  - 1
AB  - This study was conducted to see if a difference exists in the language arts proficiency levels of 2,080 fourth grade students with regard to gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status from 2010 through 2012 on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program. Specifically, this study considered the possibility that a difference existed in language arts proficiency levels between males and females. A quantitative study was used to find differences in the language arts proficiency levels from 2010 through 2012 for males and females in the fourth grade in an upper East Tennessee urban school system. A quasi-experimental design was selected because preexisting data were collected on 2,080 fourth grade students enrolled and assessed in 2010, 2011, and 2012 in an upper East Tennessee school system. The language arts proficiency levels from the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) were collected for each of the students in the study. This study found a significant difference in the language arts proficiency levels with regard to gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program from 2010 through 2012 for 2,080 fourth grade students in an upper East Tennessee School district. In general males and females tended to score in the basic and below basic proficiency levels. White males and females generally scored in the proficient and advanced levels while males and females from the other ethnic groups scored in the below basic and basic levels. Students who received free or reduced lunch benefits scored at the below basic and basic levels of proficiency regardless of gender. Students who did not receive the same benefits were generally proficient or advanced on the language arts portion of the TCAP. White students as a group generally scored higher than students from other ethnic groups. Students who received free and reduced lunch benefits generally received lower proficiency scores than their peers who did not receive the same benefits.

TI  - III-V Micropillars on Silicon for Large Scale III-V Photovoltaics and On-Chip Optical Communication
SP  - 144
AB  - The synthesis of III-V nanowires and pillar-structures on silicon is a promising approach for realizing low cost, large scale III-V photovoltaics. However, performances of III-V nanowire solar cells have not yet been as good as their bulk counterparts, as nanostructured light absorbers are fundamentally challenged by enhanced minority carriers surface recombination rates. The resulting nonradiative losses lead to significant reductions in the quantum yield for external spontaneous emission, which, in turn, manifest as penalties in the open-circuit voltage. In this work, calibrated photoluminescence measurements are utilized to construct equivalent voltage/current characteristics relating illumination intensities to Fermi-level splitting ΔF inside InP microillars. Fermi-level splitting is a good indicator of what voltage can be achieved in a given material. Under 1-sun, we show that splitting can be close to ΔF~0.89eV in undoped pillars. Several strategies to increase the external quantum yield are tested. By cleaning pillar surfaces in acidic etchants the splitting can be increased to ΔF~0.96 eV. Pillars with nano-textured surfaces can yield splitting of ΔF~0.92 eV. Finally, by introducing n-dopants, ΔF greater than 1eV can be achieved, which is due to larger a wider bandgap energy in n-doped Wurzite InP, the increaesed brightness of doped materials, as well as the extraordinarily low surface recombination velocity of InP. These results provide further evidence that InP micropillars on silicon could be a promising material for low-cost, large scale solar cells with high efficiency. Furthermore, strategies for mitigating shunt-path formation in pillar devices have been studied; during the growth of pn-junctions care has to be taken that the core-shell growth mode of the micropillars will not result in a pn-junction where both sides of the junction will be in direct contact with the substrate. It was found that regrowth can be used to prevent such shunt paths between the substrate and the shell of the pillars. Under monochromatic illumination equivalent to 1 sun, open-circuit voltages of larger than 0.604 V could be achieved, which is compares well to other state-of the art results for III-V nanowire solar cells. The discrepancy between the achieved open-circuit voltage and the results from the contactless I-V measurements is explained with unoptimized device design. For further improvement it could be necessary to bury the pn-junction inside higher bandgap materials, and to use n-doped InP material as the light absorber. Akin to Moore's law in the IC industry, it is believed that next-generation optical components will become more and more integrated onto chips, and perhaps even become integrated with silicon CMOS-electronics. The core-shell growth mode allows for the synthesis of single-crystalline III-V pillar-structures on silicon substrates, offering a pathway for monolithic, CMOS-compatible on-chip integration of active optical components. The viability of the pillar approach has been previously underlined by demonstration of lasers, light emitting diodes, and avalanche-photo-detectors. In this work, the modes of nanopillar lasers are studied in detail; it was found that modes with high azimuthal quantum numbers can exhibit quality factors of the order of 10 2, which is sufficiently high to achieve lasing at room temperature under pulsed optical pumping. Continuous-wave operation of optically pumped lasers could be demonstrated at 4K temperature as well. The radiation pattern of lasing modes are observed in experiments, and in combination with polarization measurements and Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations all quantum numbers of the modes could be identified. Strategies to enhance the quality factor for modes with low azimuthal quantum numbers are discussed as well. The atomically sharp tips makes nanoneedles attractive for applications requiring electric field enhancements such as Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). The possibility of using the nanoneedle structure for Superfocusing was studied in simulations. In FDTD simulations it was found that the needles could allow for electric intensity enhancements of the order of 10 6, showing that nanoneedles could be a promising structure for delivering optical power to nanoscale dimensions. Due to the Wurtzite crystal structure nanoneedles exhibit selection rules for nonlinear light generation that are different from selection rules of bulk III-V materials, which exhibit the more common Zincblende phase. Polarization measurements were performed to confirm the Wurtzite selection rules in the pillar material. Potential applications for nonlinear light generation using nanoneedles could be in imaging. Another nanophotonic structure attractive for nonlinear optics are high-contrast gratings. In this work, second harmonic generation from AlGaAs near-wavelength high-contrast gratings was studied in polarization-dependent reflection measurements. The grating design was found to be critical in determining the strength and polarization dependence of the second harmonic signal. The second harmonic response was enhanced by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to flat AlGaAs surfaces without gratings. These enhancements are due to the diffractive nature of the gratings, specifically their ability to change the direction of light waves.

TI  - Factors influencing retreat site selection in the Scorpions Vaejovis cashi and V. electrum
SP  - 53
AB  - The Madrean archipelago of the Southwestern United States contains six morphologically distinct species belonging to the genus Vaejovis, informally known as the 'vorhiesi' complex. These scorpions shelter under rocks and other surface debris, but, as for other scorpions, it is unclear whether these species select retreat sites randomly. Furthermore, little is known about the thermal preferences of scorpions, and no research has been done to identify whether gravidity affects their thermal preferences. The species in this study were Vaejovis cashi and V. electrum, and the objectives were to (1) identify physical or thermal characteristics between cover objects occupied by scorpions and those not occupied; (2) determine whether retreat site selection differs between the two study species; and (3) identify whether thermal selection differs between gravid and non-gravid females of the same species. At each mountain range, rocks that were occupied by scorpions were measured and compared to a subset of rocks that were not occupied by scorpions to determine whether retreat site selection occurred randomly. Temperature loggers were placed under a subset of occupied and unoccupied rocks for 48 hours to identify and compare the thermal characteristics of these rocks. Scorpions were then transported back to Tennessee Technological University to be subjected to thermal gradient trials before parturition and after dispersal of young in order to identify whether gravidity influences thermal preference. Both sky island species selected retreat sites non-randomly, choosing rocks that were larger and thicker than the mean for each habitat. These larger rocks had a significantly higher ΔT and thermal variance than smaller rocks, although there was no significant difference in mean temperature among the various rock sizes. Vaejovis electrum selected larger rocks than V. cashi, but differences in retreat size choice were probably due to the Chiricahua site containing a smaller percentage of large rocks than the Pinaleño site. Gravid V. electrum selected a significantly higher mean temperature than gravid V. cashi in the thermal gradient, but non-gravid congeners did not differ significantly from each other. Neither species, however, appeared to be influenced by reproductive condition when paired tests were conducted, although V. cashi approached significance. Additionally, gravid individuals selected hotter temperatures in the thermal gradient than in the field, and it is possible that compromised health or differing amounts of food offered in the laboratory could have raised metabolic demands. The results indicate that these sky island scorpions select larger sized retreat sites due to the thermal stability, although other biotic factors could also be involved. Future studies should focus on identifying the various biotic factors that could influence retreat site selection in scorpions, as well as determining whether reproductive condition affects thermal selection in other arachnids.

TI  - Generational differences within a corporate workplace
SP  - 42
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine generational diversity issues within the corporate workplace in order to develop strategies that can be employed to increase intergenerational understanding, morale and, improve productivity. The theory used to frame this study is the Communication Accommodation Theory. This theory allowed for a better understanding of specific challenges and opportunities that can occur when working in a multigenerational workforce. It is important for corporations to effectively address these differences in generations and take advantage of the values and expectations of each generation to keep a happy and healthy workplace. Data for this study was collected through an online survey questionnaire completed by retail banking employees. Findings suggest generational differences do exist and that the corporate workplace can improve morale and productivity by understanding and incorporating these differences.

TI  - The ecological and evolutionary effects of fire on the genus Pinus and boreal systems
SP  - 109
AB  - Fire has a major impact on many of the world's ecosystems. In addition to being an important part of many landscapes, fire has had a long presence in natural systems. In order to persist amid fire, many plant species have evolved various strategies to deal with fire. Many members of the genus Pinus are associated with fire-prone systems and exhibit a wide range of fire strategies. In Chapter 1, we explored the parallel (or repeated) evolution of fire strategies within the genus Pinus and reconstructed the geographic center of origin within the genus. We congruently examined the reconstruction of the origin of fire strategies and geographic center of origin to discuss potential relationships between evolution of fire strategies and geographic distribution. Our analyses revealed a complex evolutionary history of fire strategies within the genus Pinus. Independent evolution of fire strategies were observed throughout the genus, especially in subgenus Pinus. Our reconstructions of geographic origin suggest that extant pines share a common North American ancestor. Major geologic events (e.g. Western Interior Seaway) had a large impact on the evolutionary trajectory of pines. These results help to elucidate both the biogeography and evolutionary history of this important genus. In fire-prone areas, plant species with adaptations that allow individuals to persist following a fire have an advantage over those species that lack these mechanisms. This observation led Mutch to propose the hypothesis that fire-adapted plants may benefit by increasing the flammability of their litter, reducing competition from non-fire-adapted neighbors. While enhanced flammability has been demonstrated to increase fitness for species that have mechanisms to persist following fire, immature individuals of fire-adapted species generally do not posess these persistence mechanisms. In Chapter 2, we present a hypothesis regarding the relationship between enhanced flammability and age among fire-adapted and non-fire-adapted species. Additionally, we were interested in exploring possible leaf traits that might explain differences across age classes. To test our hypotheses, we conducted an experiment using four North American pines, two considered fire-adapted and two lacking any adaptation to fire. We observed significant differences between fire-adapted and non-fire-adapted species. As predicted, there was a greater difference in flammability traits between mature and immature fire-adapted needles than between mature and immature needles of non-fire-adapted species. This evidence points toward a relationship between age and flammability, especially in those species that exhibit fire-adapted traits, such as thick bark and self-pruning. The effects of fire on the landscape may interact with other ecological processes to greatly affect the composition and structure of the vegetation present, especially in fire-prone areas such as the Alaskan boreal forest. In addition to fire, the presence of discontinuous permafrost on the landscape greatly influences the vegetation, causing the buildup of undecomposed organic material (O.M.). When a fire occurs on the landscape, the O.M. is combusted removing the insulation that protects permafrost from thaw. Previous work has suggested that a threshold of O.M. (between 10-15 cm) exists above which permafrost is sufficiently insulated against warmer temperatures. In Chapter 3, we test for the presence of the hypothesized threshold of O.M. depth on soil temperatures in burned areas. A manipulative experiment was conducted to manually change the depth of O.M. Additionally, an observational study was conducted in which temperature loggers were buried at different depths to record soil temperatures. In both studies differences between maximum daily and minimum daily temperatures were quantified to describe the degree of insulation provided by different depths of O.M. Results from the manipulative experiment suggest that below 14-16 cm there is little fluctuation between maximum and minimum daily temperature, which corresponds roughly to the proposed threshold found in the literature. The presence and identification of this threshold may allow researchers and managers to predict where discontinuous permafrost is more susceptible to thaw following a fire.

TI  - The Genetic Basis of Local Adaptation to Thermal Stress in the Intertidal Copepod Tigriopus californicus
SP  - 45
AB  - Populations of the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus californicus, vary in their tolerance to thermal stress. In this study, the genetic basis of these differences was examined by generating interpopulation hybrids between a northern and southern population; hybrids were then exposed them to multiple generations of heat stress. At each generation, changes in allele frequency of six candidate genes were monitored. Although allelic frequencies did not change in response to thermal stress, there was evidence of intrinsic selection due to Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities against the southern allele in several of these genes. This observation has important implications for understanding genetic incompatibilities between populations, and the trade-offs between thermal tolerance and overall fitness.

TI  - Galápagos climate and flora during the past 26,000 years: The importance of microrefguia
SP  - 200
AB  - The Galápagos Islands have been a premier laboratory for the formulation of the theory of evolution and subsequent research on evolutionary responses to climate change. Desert lowlands in the archipelago contrast with mesic uplands offering a diversity of habitats for specialization. These communities have experienced periods of aridity on centennial and millennial scales over the past 26,000 years. I tested vegetation community responses to millennial-scale droughts during the last glacial maximum (LGM) and the Mid Holocene Dry Event (MHDE), as well as the major centennial droughts of the last 1000 years, the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Little Ice Age (LIA). Data were derived from a highland bog, Paul's Bog, on Santa Cruz and a lowland hypersaline lake on Genovesa. Sediment cores were raised and studied through grayscale and fossil pollen analyses for floristic responses to these droughts. Pollen traps were used to determine if the modern pollen spectra from the major vegetation communities matched lake and bog cores taken from these sites. The last glacial maximum (LGM) was previously interpreted to have been a time of aridity that caused wholesale extinction of the highland flora. Pollen data from Paul's Bog recorded background dry conditions, but persistence of the endemic highland flora throughout the LGM. The theory of highland flora extinction during the LGM was not supported and should be revisited. I hypothesized that garúa fog remained on high windward-facing (≥ 800 m) slopes, generating moist pockets that were climatic microrefugia during LGM aridity and buffered the highland flora from aridity associated with the MHDE. High-resolution pollen and grayscale analysis from Genovesa detected a 3-8 year ENSO signal and variability in ENSO over the past 1100 years. The MCA was a period of drought and reduced ENSO activity that lowered lowland productivity. Productivity in the lowlands was not reduced during LIA aridity and was probably buffered by sustained ENSO and increased El Nino events. The modern pollen trap data were divisible into vegetation communities, but the pollen spectra from the highland sites were not analogs for past pollen spectra from Paul's Bog. Modern pollen inputs were dominated by invasive exotic species that transformed the Galápagos highlands into a non-analog system. Contrastingly, the modern pollen spectra from Genovesa closely resembled the pollen from the lake core over the last 1100 years. The persistence of the highland flora to drought over the last 26,000 years highlighted the transformative effect invasive species have had on the Galapagos. The arid regions of the Galapagos have survived drought and have remained untransformed by plant introductions, while the highlands no longer resemble the community composition from the past century. Comparing floral assemblage changes at Genovesa with previously published pollen data from the highlands of San Cristobal highlighted the divergent response of the highlands and lowlands to droughts and ENSO variability. The highland communities were drought stressed during periods of increased El Niño events (i.e., LIA) but were buffered against drought by strengthened garua when SST was lowered and ENSO reduced (i.e., MCA). Lowland productivity was reduced during droughts, but heightened by El Nino rain events. This observation highlighted the antiphased response of the vegetation communities under models of future climate change that predict warmer SST and increased El Nino events. The results of this study are beneficial to the Gálapagos National Park Service as they make future plans for areas of habitat preservation and protected corridors within the archipelago under future climate change scenarios. LGM microrefugia could present ideal preservation sites and areas of focus for limited habitat-restoration funds.

TI  - Phage life history traits: Regulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evolution of phage resistance within the Drosophila melanogaster host environment
SP  - 130
AB  - Due to the increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria, there has been renewed interest in using bacteriophage to treat bacterial infections (phage therapy). This body of work examined different aspects related to the interaction between bacteria and phage within a host using the system of Drosophila melanogaster infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is then treated with lytic bacteriophage. Using this system four specific areas were addressed: I) How in vitro phage life history traits may be predictive of in vivo therapeutic efficacy, II) How the in vivo phage/bacteria dynamics differ for two different phages throughout the course of infection, III) How modification of phage life history traits alters phage therapeutic ability and IV) The variable costs of phage resistance within P. aeruginosa . The results show that not only can phage therapeutic ability be predicted by phage in vitro fitness, but therapeutic ability can be altered and improved using simple in vitro serial transfer methods. Treatment with different phages shows different dynamics within D. melanogaster as well as bacteria having different levels of phage resistance evolving. Despite phage resistance evolving, we found phage resistance does incur a cost to the bacteria, which results in a decrease in within-host virulence. In conclusion, addressing these questions not only illustrated the use of D. melanogaster as a good model system for phage therapy, but also provided insight into the complexities of the phage/bacteria interaction within a living host. In addition, beginning to understand the variable costs of phage resistance has extended the knowledge of the complexities behind phage therapy.

TI  - Effect of Type of Food and Culture Density on the Rearing of Seriola Dumerili
SP  - 63
AB  - Esta tese teve o intuito de estudar o efeito de três tipos de alimento diferentes em duas densidades diferentes para seleccionar um regime de alimentação ideal para o crescimento, a sobrevivência, os parâmetros plasmáticos, e para a composição lipídica do músculo e fígado dos juvenis de Seriola dumerili (Risso 1810) de maneira a cobrir todas as necessidades nutricionais e optimizar o custo-produção. A esse respeito, um total de 145 juvenis de Seriola dumerili com um peso médio de 117.54 ± 54.98 g, foram distribuídos aleatoriamente em três grupos de 15 peixes / tanque (densidade baixa, LD) e 3 grupos de 25 peixes / tanque (alta densidade, HD) e alimentados com três diferentes tipos de alimentos: ração comercial para Sparidae, Alfa Biomar dieta (SP), ração comercial para S. dumerili (Skretting) (SE) e cavala congelada (MA). O estudo foi conduzido por 86 dias. As variáveis estudadas foram o tipo de regime alimentar e a densidade de produção.A sobrevivência foi distinta e maior nos grupos alimentados com SE, enquanto que a Taxa de Crescimento Específico (SGR) não mostrou estatisticamente nenhuma diferença (P> 0,05) entre os grupos. Os grupos alimentados com a dieta MA tiveram os maiores valores de Ingestão Diária de Alimento (DFI), durante o estudo (9,59 ± 3,56 g / peixe em HD e 8,46 ± 5,00 g / peixe em LD), que embora com uma maior Taxa de Conversão de Alimento (FCR) (9,59% em LD e 8,46% em HD), aparentemente não conseguiram transformar eficientemente a ingestão em biomassa, demonstrado pelo respectivos valores de B% de 0,18% em LD e - 0,35% em HD, sendo menor do que os grupos alimentados com SE a LD (0,41%).No presente estudo, a composição bioquímica do S.dumerili foi semelhante à relatada em trabalhos anteriores. Quanto maior o teor de humidade, menor o teor de lípidos. Apesar de a dieta à base de MA ter um maior conteúdo de gordura em bruto (38,11%) que todas as outras dietas, os grupos alimentados com dieta MA, em ambas as densidades, apresentaram um menor valor total de lípido.O Total de Lípidos Polares (TPL) e o Total de Lípidos Neutros (TNL) não mostraram quaisquer diferenças significativas (P <0.05) entre dietas em ambos os tecidos (P>0.05). Entre as classes de TNL, apesar de DAG, CHO e FFA terem sido significativamente diferentes (P <0.05), TAG foi a classe de lípido mais abundante, e onde nenhuma diferença significativa (P>0.05) entre os diferentes grupos foi encontrada.Relativamente à composição de ácidos gordos, nomeadamente ao 18:1n-9, os grupos alimentados com MA foram os únicos significativamente diferentes (P<0.05), e obtiveram os mais baixos valores (P<0.05), mesmo tendo em consideração que na natureza a dieta do S. dumerili é composta principalmente por vários peixes ósseos ricos em 18:1n-9. Pode-se deduzir que, ou houve uma degradação da qualidade do MA, enquanto armazenado para a respectiva alimentação dos grupos, que afectou directamente a qualidade e quantidade de 18:1n-9 acumulado nos seus tecidos.Alternate abstract:This thesis intended to study the effect of three different types of food and two different densities, on growth, survival, plasmatic parameters and lipid composition of muscle and liver of Seriola dumerili (Risso 1810) juveniles, in order to select an optimal feeding regime for growth, covering the nutritional requirements, and optimizing the commercial cost-effectiveness of the production. Regarding this, a total of 145 juvenile of Seriola dumerili with and average weight of 117.54 ± 54.98 g, were randomly distributed in 3 groups of 15 fish / tank (low stocking density LD) and 3 groups of 25 fish / tank (high stocking density HD) and fed with three different types of food: commercial pellets for Sparidae, the Alpha Biomar diet (SP), commercial pellets for S. dumerili (Skretting) (SE) and frozen Mackerel (MA). The study was conducted for 86 days. The study variables were the feeding regime and stocking density.The survival rates were higher in the groups fed with SE, while the Specific Growth Rate (SGR) showed no statistical differences (P>0.05) between groups. The groups fed with MA diet had the higher amounts of Daily Food Ingested (DFI), (9.59±3.56 g/fish at HD and 8.46±5.00 g/fish at LD) during the study, although with a higher Food Conversion Rate (FCR), (9.59 % at LD and 8.46 % at HD), not efficiently turn that ingestion in biomass, as for example the value of B% at groups fed with MA at LD (0.18 %) and at HD (-0.35%) show, being lower than the groups fed with SE at LD (0.41%).The biochemical composition of the fish in the present study was similar to the one reported in previous works, explaining that the more moisture content in the tissue, the less lipid it has in it.The Total Polar Lipids (TPL) and Total Neutral Lipids (TNL) did not show any significant differences (P<0.05) between different diets in both tissues (p>0.05). Among the total neutral lipids (TNL), despite DAG, CHO and FFA were significantly different (P<0.05), TAG was the most abundant lipid class, which is generally the major lipid class in the diet of marine fish, and there was no significant differences (P<0.05) between the different groups.Regarding fatty acid composition, namely 18:1n-9, the groups fed with MA were the only significantly different (P<0.05), and the lowest amounts in this study (P<0.05), even taking in consideration that, in the wild, the S. dumerili diet is composed mainly by several finfish rich in 18:1n-9. We can deduce that or there was a degradation of the quality of the MA while stored to be fed to the groups, which affected directly the quality and quantity of the 18:1n-9.The fact that 18:2n-6 had its lower amounts in groups fed with MA, and the higher amounts in groups fed with SE (P<0.05),

TI  - Population genetics of the common frog (Rana temporaria) in relation to climate
SP  - 184
AB  - Ecological responses to a changing climate have been well documented in a broad range of species, predominantly in terms of range movements and phenological changes. When faced with a changing environment, species survival will depend on the ability to: 1) evade changes in climate, via dispersal; 2) evolve, via natural selection; and/or 3) plastically change their phenotype, without underlying genetic changes. The potential for an organism to evade, evolve or plastically respond to a changing environment can be predicted by inferring relationships with current climatic conditions. Altitudinal gradients have been proposed as being particularly suitable for environmental change studies due to the rapid variation in climate even over short geographical distances. Species that inhabit altitudinal gradients experience a range of climatic conditions across their range and are thus subject to varying selection pressures. Changes in temperature are predicted to particularly influence ectotherms due to the direct effect on physiological processes. The common frog (Rana temporaria) occurs from zero to over a thousand metres along altitudinal gradients in Scotland, offering the opportunity to assess the influence of temperature on organism responses. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess population-level relationships with climate, in order to make predictions regarding susceptibility to a changing climate, focussing on R. temporaria in Scotland. In Chapter 2, I inferred colonisation patterns within Europe following the last glacial maximum by combining new and previously compiled mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequences. I found that the mitochondrial DNA sequences from my Scottish samples were identical to, or clustered with, the common haplotype previously identified from Western Europe. This clade showed very low mitochondrial genetic variation, consistent with a leptokurtic model of range expansion, where low numbers of long-distance dispersers cause multiple founder events. Second, I assessed fine-scale genetic variation in relation to current temperature gradients using microsatellites. No population structure was found within or between altitudinal gradients at any scale (3-50km; average FST= 0.02), despite a mean annual temperature difference of 4.5°C between low- and high-altitude sites. Levels of genetic diversity and heterozygosity were considerable but did not vary by site, altitude or temperature. In Chapter 3, common temperature treatments were used to assess phenotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity variation in relation to altitude in terms of larval fitness traits. Local adaptation to altitude was assessed using QST-FST analyses and adaptive phenotypic divergence was then related to environmental parameters using Mantel tests, to look for drivers of selection. I found that R. temporaria showed evidence of local adaptation in all larval fitness traits measured. However, only variation in larval period and growth rate was consistent with adaptation to altitude. Moreover, this was only evident in the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Adaptive divergence in traits that were locally adapted to altitude was correlated with spring temperature, suggesting that temperature acts as a strong environmental selection pressure influencing local adaptation even in the face of high gene flow. In Chapter 4, the physiological and behavioural responses that facilitate survival in high-altitude environments were evaluated, in terms of routine metabolic rate and freeze tolerance in tadpoles, and breeding temperature in adults. I found that routine metabolic rate was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites but only from the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (at least 900m). Glucose accumulation during freezing was not significantly different based on altitude. However, individuals from low-altitude survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitude, across all mountains. Breeding did not occur below 5˚C at any site and there was no significant difference in breeding temperature between high- and low-altitude sites, leading to high-altitude individuals spawning 30 days later than those at low-altitude. My results suggest that tadpoles are adapted physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced routine metabolic rate, but only at the highest breeding sites. Finally, in Chapter 5, I assessed the spatial variation in species presence and composition of parasitic water moulds in the genus Saprolegnia found on R. temporaria eggs. Thirteen samples isolated from four sites were identified as members of the Saprolegniaceae. Four putative species of Saprolegnia were isolated overall, multiple Saprolegnia water moulds were isolated from within sites, and species composition varied between sites. Acidity was significantly lower at sites where 4 Saprolegniaceae were present, but genetic distance between samples was not correlated with environmental or geographic distance. These findings question the previous focus on S. ferax as the primary agent of Saprolegnia infection in amphibians and suggest that future studies of virulence need to consider the synergistic effect of multiple Saprolegnia species. In conclusion, R. temporaria show the potential for evasion, evolution and plastic responses to a changing climate and my results suggest that the outlook is positive for survival of the common frog in Scotland.

TI  - Catalytic behaviour of nickel-based catalysts operating on simulated biogas: optimisation through oxygen addition, temperature variation and catalyst modification
AB  - The use of catalytic systems operating on waste products such as biogas offers a potentially attractive alternative for renewable and sustainable energy generation. To investigate the potential viability of such catalytic systems for operation on biogas, a detailed study of nickel-based catalysts for the reforming of simulated biogas (methane:carbon dioxide = 2) to synthesis gas has been undertaken. The influence of oxygen addition in varied concentrations to the simulated biogas mixture has been investigated with regards to catalyst activity, selectivity and stability. This influence has been studied over an extended temperature range from room temperature to 1000 °C. Additionally, the effect of H2S within the simulated biogas mixture on the catalyst activity, selectivity and stability has been studied. Also, the influence of ceria-doping of the nickel catalyst on catalytic behaviour has been investigated. Temperature programmed and conventional catalytic reaction measurements have been used to analyse the catalytic behaviour and long term stability of the catalyst system over a full range of reaction temperatures. Carbon deposits from the simulated biogas reforming were analysed using post-reaction temperature programmed oxidation to assess the extent and nature of carbon deposition. The addition of oxygen significantly increases catalyst activity and shows a variation in product selectivity with temperature. Increased catalyst stability through reduced carbon deposition and increased sulfur tolerance is also observed with oxygen addition. Doping of the nickel catalyst with ceria enhances the influence of oxygen, apart from at high oxygen levels where total oxidation of methane is prevalent. Catalyst regeneration from sulfur poisoning has also been shown through oxygen addition to the simulated biogas mixture and ceria-doping of the nickel catalyst. Fuel cell studies have shown the successful operation of solid oxide fuel cells on simulated biogas and the substantial improvements in electrical performance through addition of oxygen and increased temperature.

TI  - Decapod crustacean larval developmental plasticity and the evolution of lecithotrophy and abbreviated development
SP  - 1
AB  - Within the marine environment, the diverse development modes among marine invertebrate taxa follow a macro-ecological pattern across latitude. Generally, across the latitudinal gradient from the tropics to the poles, larval development becomes increasingly independent of external food resources. Low latitude species are fecund and produce relatively poorly provisioned eggs, which develop into swimming and feeding larvae. This mode of development becomes increasingly scarce with increasing latitude, whilst development from large eggs (produced in low numbers) into larvae, which are non-feeding, becomes increasingly prevalent. From the tropics to the poles, there is an increasing mismatch between the longer periods required for larval development (resulting from increasing cold) and the shorter periods of food availability (resulting from increasing seasonality). This macro-ecological trend in development modes results from the convergent evolution of diverse taxa, which have adapted to high latitude environments in much the same way: through producing larvae which develop independently of external food resources. Developmental plasticity during the larval phase is a mechanism by which larvae are able to cope better with unfavourable conditions or variations in their environment. Critically, the interaction between per offspring investment (POI; the quantity and quality of resources allocated to offspring) and developmental plasticity, and the role of this interaction in the evolution of larval development modes, is little considered or studied. Experiments comprising this thesis assess the potential role of this interaction in the evolution of abbreviated and lecithotrophic development within decapod crustaceans, and the establishing of the macro-ecological trend in development outlined above. Experiments used the palaemonine shrimp, Palaemonetes varians, which inhabits temperate, salt marsh, and peripheral brackish water, as a study species. Palaemonine Abstract ii shrimp originated from a tropical marine clade and extant species are found in marine, brackish, and fresh water environments. The evolutionary transition from marine to fresh water has involved life history adaptations in development mode within this group. As species occupy differing habitats along this environmental gradient, this group has been used to study evolutionary adaptations along the environmental gradient from marine to fresh water. Sampling of a wild population of P. varians from Lymington salt marsh (Hampshire, UK) revealed the highly variable environment that this species inhabits. POI within this population varied inter- and intra-annually, though these variations could not be correlated with variations in environmental temperatures. Larvae hatch with significant yolk reserves and can be considered facultative lecithotrophic in the first and second larval instar, and planktotrophic from the third larval instar. Larval development was successful at temperatures between 15 and 30 °C and temperature-mediated developmental plasticity was observed; at higher temperatures, larvae increasingly developed through fewer larval instars. Development through fewer larval instars resulted in more rapid development, but development to a lesser juvenile dry weight at settlement. Consequently, this developmental plasticity may have ecological implications. Developmental plasticity was also influenced by the energy content of larvae at hatching (as proxy for POI). Larvae with greater energy content developed through fewer larval instars at all temperatures, indicating that higher POI buffers larvae against poor conditions during development. Greater energy content also enabled larvae to tolerate starvation for longer and to develop to more advanced larval stages in the absence of food. Developmental plasticity within decapod crustaceans enables larvae to tolerate unfavourable conditions during development. Interestingly, it maximises the potential fitness benefits provided by POI by enabling larvae to settle as juveniles earlier, though at a smaller size. The interaction between POI and developmental plasticity forms a ‘pre-adaptation’ for the evolution of abbreviated development. The results presented in this thesis indicate that, indeed, the evolutionary transition to abbreviated development and lecithotrophy is based on selection for increasing POI. The abbreviation of development associated with increasing POI arises through developmental plasticity in larval instar number.

TI  - Effects of thermal stress on the brown planthopper nilaparvata lugens (stal)
SP  - 1
AB  - This study investigated the effects of heat stress on the survival, mobility, acclimation ability, development, reproduction and feeding behaviour of the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens. The critical information derived from the heat tolerance studies indicate that some first instar nymphs become immobilized by heat stress at around 30°C and among the more heat tolerant adult stage, no insects were capable of coordinated movement at 38°C. There was no recovery after entry into heat coma, at temperatures around 38°C for nymphs and 42-43°C for adults. At 41.8° and 42.5oC respectively, approximately 50% of nymphs and adults are killed. In a comparison of the acclimation responses between nymphs and adults reared at 23°C and acclimated at either 15 or 30°C, the data indicate that increases in cold tolerance were greater than heat tolerance, and that acclimation over a generation compared with a single life stage increases tolerance across the thermal spectrum. The temperatures that kill around 50% of nymphs and adults also exert negative effects on development and longevity. The same exposures also lower fecundity and extend egg development time through a combination of mating groups, in which the greatest effects occur when both males and females have experienced sub-lethal heat stress. Likewise, exposure to their ULT50 reduced feeding activity in both life stages of N. lugens. The amount of honeydew excreted by females and males in the treated nymph and adult groups were 3-4x and 2-3x lower than in the equivalent control groups. Overall, sub-lethal heat stress extended egg development time, inhibited nymphal development, lowered fecundity and reduced feeding activity.

TI  - The effects of climate change on stream invertebrates in their role as biological indicators and responders to disturbance
SP  - 180
AB  - This dissertation analyzes four regionally distributed state biomonitoring data sets to inform on 1) how biological indicators respond to the effects of climate change, 2) what climate-specific indicators may be available to detect effects, 3) how well current sampling detects climate-driven changes, and 4) how program designs can continue to detect impairment. In addition, responses were examined of stream invertebrates to a particular extreme event, wildfire, which is expected to increase in the future with climate change. In general, we found that temperature trait groups (cold- and warm-water preference taxa), as well as several taxonomically-defined invertebrate metrics and indicator groups, show responses consistent with expectation to long-term increases in temperature, although the climate responsiveness of these trait groups varied among states and ecoregions. Temperature sensitivity of taxa and their sensitivity to organic pollution were moderately but significantly correlated. Therefore, metrics selected for condition assessments because taxa are sensitive to disturbance or to conventional pollutants also were sensitive to changes in temperature. We explored the feasibility of modifying metrics by partitioning components based on temperature sensitivity to reduce the likelihood that responses to climate change would confound the interpretation of responses to impairment from other causes and to facilitate tracking of climate-change-related taxon losses and replacements. Difficulties arise in categorizing unique indicators of global changes, because of similarities in some of the temperature and hydrologic effects resulting from climate change, land use changes, and water removal. Nevertheless, the utilization of climate-sensitive traits to modify traditional biomonitoring metrics is promising in the context of using a weight-of-evidence approach for interpreting bioassessment results. Observed invertebrate responses to climate change also impair the condition of reference stations. Combined with our projection that encroachment of developed land uses over time will negatively impact up to a third or more of currently established reference sites by the end of the century, these responses suggest the importance of accounting for reference condition drift through implementation of an objective scale for condition characterization, as well as the need for reference station protection. These results can be used to identify methods that assist with detecting climate-related effects and highlight steps that can be taken to ensure that programs continue to meet resource protection goals. However, we also must recognize that many aspects of global changes are not tractable at the local to regional scales at which bioassessment is applied in support of water quality management, suggesting the need for a shift in the scale of approach from a narrow focus in the process of water resource quality protection and restoration to one that encompasses broader adaption strategies to address and manage global change impacts. Overall, we found the response of stream benthic invertebrates to a major wildfire were not devastating, with minimal responses found in total abundance or taxa richness. However, numerous taxa responded to post-fire flow and water quality disturbances either positively, negatively, negatively with recovery, or neutrally, with responses well captured by selected habit and feeding type traits. Post-fire benthic responses reflected three categories, vulnerability, resistance, and resilience, with different groups of organisms and different trait characteristics comprising each. Vulnerability was observed to both direct physical disturbance, mediated by the flow pulses that followed the fire; and to trophic impacts, themselves a response to loss of food resources due to those same flow pulses and associated water quality effects. Resistance to the post-fire physical disturbance of the stream environment was exhibited by a subset of invertebrates with habit traits that conferred the ability to withstand dislodgement and displacement that would otherwise be expected from the post-fire flow pulses. Resilience, or ability to recover in the short term following cessation of the most prominent post-fire flow events, was conferred mainly by opportunistic life-history traits. This suite of responses suggest the mechanisms through which benthic communities may be altered in the long-term, through suppression of some vulnerable taxa, partial if not temporary (short-term) suppression of some trophic resources, and possibly incomplete recovery (relative to pre-fire conditions) based on the reproductive life-history characteristics of component taxa.

TI  - Adaptive responses to aquatic pollution: Dispersal, physiological acclimation, genetic adaptation in the brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus)
SP  - 194
AB  - Organisms are likely to display adaptive responses to their local environment, it may be local adaptation or physiological acclimation, and both improve performance (increase fitness) in stressful habitats. In this dissertation, I explore adaptive responses to pollution stress in the brown bullhead ( Ameiurus nebulosus) from the Detroit River, as a model for integration of evolutionary and ecotoxicologial analyses. I develop a systematic hierarchical scheme to investigate the role of adaptive processes in response to stressful environments. My literature-based review suggests initial investigation of dispersal as confounding adaptive response to degraded local environment. If there is low dispersal I suggest variation in gene transcription as a biomarker for accurate and repeatable measures of the response to pollution stress, as gene transcription is a very early response to contaminant stress. Following my proposed approach, I examined dispersal and molecular adaptive responses in brown bullhead and developed tools for the analyses: population genetic markers, a custom microarray and transcriptome libraries. The population genetic study demonstrates high population structure FST = 0.095 indicating limited long-term gene flow but contemporary dispersal associated with high contaminant levels (37% dispersals within each region). My initial transcriptome characterisation was done with next generation sequencing (NGS) on challenged and control individuals from two sites (degraded and clean). The NGS transcriptome characterisation was resulted in 3.4 million assembled reads and identified 5515 transcribed genes across clean and polluted background populations. Many gene transcription patterns were as expected as part of an adaptive response; however, some expected transcription induction was not observed. Thus I used a 128 gene custom ecotoxicology response microarray to quantify dose and temporal response of selected genes in brown bullhead exposed to B[a]P. This identified 5 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated gene responses: up-regulation included a variety of response profiles, while down-regulation was simple gene repression. All forms of adaptive responses in contaminant indicator species have the potential to confound our interpretation of toxicity in natural and lab environments. This may have important management and legislative implications. Of equal interest, my thesis research highlights some behavioural and molecular mechanisms for adaptive responses in Detroit River brown bullhead.

TI  - Dna damage, repair & replication using E. coli model systems
SP  - 154
AB  - DNA encodes the genetic material that makes life possible but it is semi labile and prone to damage. In part, what makes DNA such a reliable genetic storage material is that organisms have developed extensive methods in order to repair damaged DNA and to preserve its integrity. Paradoxically though, genetic instability is essential for survival and one of the major causes of genetic instability is DNA damage sustained through endogenous and exogenous means. Without genetic instability, speciation, evolution, adaptation, and some aspects of aging would not occur. Unfortunately genetic instability does have negative aspects as well such as genetic diseases, cancer, and death. Therefore the interplay between DNA damage and repair is truly a double-edged sword. E. coli is a valuable model organism for studying DNA damage, repair and replication due to its fast generation time and genetic malleability. Chapters 2-4 of my dissertation widely differ in their scope and aims but all the chapters take advantage of different E. coli genetic and complementation systems in order to answer various questions about DNA damage, DNA repair proteins, or DNA replication. One particular form of DNA damage used extensively by chemotherapeutic agents is known as reactive DNA methylation. Reactive DNA methylation is defined, in its simplest form, as the non-enzymatic addition of methyl groups (-CH3) to various positions on DNA nucleotides (2). Reactive DNA methylation lesions can either be innocuous, cytotoxic, or mutagenic depending on exactly where on the nucleobase the lesion occurs. O6-MeG (methyl-guanine) lesions are particularly cytotoxic to humans and the only protein in the entire human body that directly repairs these lesions is called O6 Methyl Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) (3). In Chapter 2 of my thesis I take advantage of an E. coli genetic system that is deficient in its ability to repair O 6-MeG lesions and determine the repair abilities of all ten non-synonymous MGMT mutants detected in the human population. The results display the O 6-MeG repair profile of all ten non-synonymous MGMT mutants as well as give new insight into the structure of the MGMT protein. During the first step of a DNA repair process known as Base Excision Repair (BER) DNA repair enzymes known as glycosylases recognize and remove damaged nucleotides. Base excision repair is not a perfect repair process because at high concentrations glycosylases have been known to remove undamaged bases and, in addition, the resulting abasic site can become problematic if not processed quickly by other enzymes (4). Glycosylases can be divided into two categories: those that are constitutively expressed and those that are inducible. In Chapter 3 of my thesis I utilize an E. coli strain that is devoid of reactive methylation specific glycosylases to understand why organisms have evolved both constitutively expressed and inducible glycosylases. The results show that the activity levels towards substrates in constitutively expressed glycosylases are limited so as not to have a negative effect on the fitness of the organism. DNA polymerase I (Pol I) is one of two replicative polymerases in E. coli. ColE1 plasmids are used extensively in molecular biology. During ColE1 plasmid replication Pol I initiates leading strand synthesis and also processes Okazaki fragments, Pol III replicates the rest of the plasmid. In Chapter 4 of my thesis I utilize an E. coli strain with a temperature sensitive endogenous Pol I complemented with an error-prone Pol I in order to determine, with high resolution, where on ColE1 plasmids Pol I is replicating (1). The results show exactly where the switch between Pol I and Pol III occurs as well as the sites of Okazaki processing on the lagging strand. In addition the results show that a small fraction of plasmids are replicated exclusively by Pol I and that Pol I plays a far greater role in replication termination than previously thought. These latter results support earlier reports showing a functional redundancy between Pol I and Pol III and bring up interesting questions regarding the role of Pol I during chromosomal replication.

TI  - Born to Run? Integrating Individual Behavior, Physiology, and Life Histories in Partially Migratory Steelhead and Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
SP  - 162
AB  - Steelhead and rainbow trout are common names for marine-migratory (anadromous) and freshwater-resident forms of Oncorhynchus mykiss, a partially migratory salmonid fish. Anadromous and resident forms are sympatric and can produce offspring with a life history different from their own (i.e., steelhead parents can produce rainbow trout offspring and vice versa). The expression of these alternative life histories is a plastic response to individual patterns of energy acquisition, assimilation, and allocation during juvenile life stages. Individual performance during early stream life is of particular interest because of potential carry-over effects on subsequent growth and developmental trajectories. In a series of experiments in laboratory streams, I determined the influence of individual variation in energy metabolism on behavior, growth, and life-history expression in O. mykiss. Individual variation in energy metabolism was a strong predictor of feeding territory acquisition by juvenile fish during the transition from dependence on maternal provisioning of egg yolk reserves to independent feeding. Feeding territory acquisition was positively associated with standard metabolic rate (SMR) under conditions of an abundant and predictable food supply. When the density of intraspecific competitors was manipulated, the association between SMR and territory acquisition was strongest at intermediate stocking densities, moderate at the highest stocking densities, and weakest at the lowest stocking densities. However, reducing the spatial predictability of food resources within streams reversed the influence of SMR on competitive outcomes. These experiments determined that variation in ecological conditions during early life stages imposes different selection regimes on juvenile O. mykiss and results in physiological divergence among cohorts. Subsequent rearing experiments determined that behavioral dominance influences rates of anadromy and freshwater maturation, most likely through the association between SMR and territory acquisition. In addition to the effects of behavioral dominance, I observed a significant influence of sex, rearing temperature, and individual growth trajectories on the expression of anadromy and freshwater maturation. Partially migratory populations of O. mykiss maintain an exceptionally diverse portfolio of life-history strategies. Results from this work lend insight into a suite of behavioral and physiological processes influencing individual life histories.

TI  - Transcriptional variation among populations of salmon: The genetic architecture of local adaptation
SP  - 144
AB  - Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) life history provides an excellent opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms of selective divergence. I analyzed gene transcription in Chinook salmon that were created in a replicated North Carolina II breeding design to estimate quantitative genetic parameters that contributed to among-population variation in gene expression. Following Fischer’s fundamental theorem, transcriptional variation of many genes was due to additive effects. However, a surprising number of genes exhibited non-additive genetic and maternal effects on transcription, and these effects may explain the high potential for rapid population-level evolution in salmon. Indeed, populations differed substantially in gene transcription. Pervasive non-additive gene expression raises concerns for conservation strategies that result in intraspecific hybridization. I document extensive amounts of reciprocal hybrid disagreement in gene transcription, indicative of breakdown of gene expression regulation complexes that are likely co-adapted. Anomalous hybrid gene transcription warrants caution for conservation strategies that employ mixing natural stocks.

TI  - Evolutionary and functional analysis of the Drosphila bag of marbles gene
SP  - 153
AB  - Reproduction is fundamentally important for organismal fitness. While it is critical that each step in reproduction proceed correctly, many of the genes that regulate these processes are adaptively evolving in response to both internal and external selective pressures. We have previously shown that the bag of marbles (bam) and benign gonial cell neoplasm (bgcn) genes are evolving under rapid, adaptive evolution in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. These genes act at the earliest stages of reproduction, germline stem cell (GSC) regulation. In the first study, I expand population genetic analyses to genes that play a role in GSC regulation and/or genetically interact with bam. I find that multiple GSC regulatory genes show evidence of rapid, adaptive evolution in D. melanogaster and/or D. simulans. These genes play very different roles in the regulation of GSCs, and their diverse functions and expression patterns suggest that multiple selective pressures are acting to drive the evolution of GSC regulatory genes. In a second study, I focused on bam to determine the functional consequences of bam’s sequence divergence. I developed a transgenesis assay to determine the ability of a bam orthologs from D. melanogaster and D. simulans to rescue the male and female sterility of a D. melanogaster bam mutation. I found that while D. simulans can rescue D. melanogaster bam male sterility, it fails to fully rescue female sterility suggesting that the selective pressure driving the evolution of bam is present in the female germline. In the final study, I investigated the hypothesis that the bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia pipientis, is driving the adaptive evolution of bam. I found that Wolbachia and bam genetically interact by showing that Wolbachia can rescue the fertility defects of a bam hypomorph. I found that D. melanogaster-specific Wolbachia is unable to accumulate as well in the presence of a D. simulans bam ortholog which is consistent with a model that Wolbachia is co-evolving with bam and supports the hypothesis that Wolbachia is driving the adaptive evolution of bam.

TI  - The Use of Ionic Liquid for the Pretreatment of Energy Cane Bagasse
SP  - 98
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass appears to be a prospective renewable resource that can be used for the generation of biofuels and bioproducts. The major concern in lignocellulose conversion is overcoming biomass recalcitrance through pretreatment while still maintaining a green, energy efficient and cost-effective process. Energy cane is a promising energy crop with high fiber content, cold tolerance, and less fertilizer and water input requirements as compared to conventional sugarcane. Ionic liquids (ILs) are promising solvents for the pretreatment of lignocellulose as they are thermally stable, environmentally friendly, recyclable, and have low volatility. This study assessed the use of ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][OAc]) as a solvent during the pretreatment of energy cane bagasse (ECB) and its effect on the chemical composition, surface morphology, cellulose crystallinity, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass.IL-treated ECB resulted in significant lignin removal (32.1%) with slight glucan and xylan losses (8.8% and 14.0%, respectively), and exhibited much higher cellulose and hemicellulose enzymatic digestibilities (87.0%, 64.3%) than untreated (5.5%, 2.8%) or water-treated (4.0%, 2.1%) ECB, respectively. The enhanced digestibilities of IL-treated biomass can be attributed to delignification and reduction of cellulose crystallinity as confirmed by FTIR and XRD analysis. When pretreating ECB with recycled IL, enzymatic digestibility decreased as the number of pretreatment recycles increased. Decreasing the pretreatment temperature from 120 °C to 100 °C and extending the residence time from 30 min to 2 h brought significant improvement to the pretreatment efficiency of recycled [EMIM][OAc] on ECB. However, response surface methodology model indicated that a higher glucose yield of IL-treated biomass could be obtained at higher pretreatment temperatures with shorter residence times. The optimal processing conditions were pretreatment of ECB at 131.9 °C for 28.1 min at 8.4% solids loading resulting in a final glucose yield of 35.96 g glucose per 100 g of native biomass.The results presented in this thesis demonstrated that [EMIM][OAc] can be used as a potential solvent for the pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass such as ECB. Furthermore, the sugar yields obtained post pretreatment have great potential as building blocks in the production of renewable fuels and chemicals.

TI  - Biosynthesis of Human Membrane-Bound Catechol-O-methyltransferase: Optimization Using Plackett-Burman and Central Composite Design
SP  - 76
AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT, EC 2.1.1.6) is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of catechol substrates (catecholamines, catecholestrogens). Physiologically, it is responsible for the elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols, making it a protein with great clinical relevance as therapeutic target in serious disorders, like schizophrenia and Parkinson´s disease. To fulfill pharmaceuticals requirements, new strategies of optimization and large-scale production of COMT enzyme are crucial. Statistical optimization approaches have demonstrated their enormous value in laboratory and industrial scale, namely in biotechnological production processes, in which an incremental enhancement can be a perpetual improvement.In this work, we aimed the optimization of recombinant human membrane-bound COMT (hMBCOMT) enzymatic activity yields following a statistical optimization as a solving approach. Plackett-Burman design was used as a first optimization step to identify which factors have a significant effect in hMBCOMT productivity and activity levels, and Response Surface Methodology (RSM), by a Central Composite Design (CCD), to optimize the process.We applied Brevibacillus choshinensis cells for the biosynthesis of hMBCOMT and a semi-defined medium for cell growth. This medium was subjected to a first screening using the Plackett–Burman design to evaluate the influence of the culture parameters (chemicals and physicals) in hMBCOMT enzymatic activity levels. Enzymatic activity were measured in a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a coulochemical detector. Among the eleven variables tested, polypeptone, ammonium sulfate, glucose and temperature were selected owing to their significant effect on human MBCOMT enzymatic activity. The biological human MBCOMT activity obtained with the semi-defined medium in Plackett-Burman design were very promising, while were higher than the obtained with 2SYNm medium, a traditional growth medium for Brevibacillus cells of this work. Typically, we obtained values of 93nmol/h for hMBCOMT total enzymatic activity and 30 nmol/h/mg of specific activity with protein in its native form, without the use of any kind of detergents on protein solubilization step. Based on the results of Plackett–Burman design, a CCD was adopted to define optimal components concentration and temperature in order to maximize our response. The CCD model presented a multiple correlation coefficient value of 0.635 and a significant lack of fit, showing the lack aptness of the model to the process optimization and the failure to attain the optimal concentration of each variable.Alternate abstract:Catecol-O-metiltransferase (COMT, CE 2.1.1.6) é uma enzima metiltransferase dependente de S-adenosil-L-metionina (SAM) que catalisa a metilação de substratos catecóis (catecolaminas, catecolestrogénios). Fisiologicamente, é responsável pela eliminação de catecóis biologicamente activos ou tóxicos, tornando-a uma proteína de elevado interesse clínico e utilizada como alvo terapêutico em doenças graves, como a esquizofrenia e a doença de Parkinson. Para suprir as necessidades farmacêuticas, novas estratégias de otimização e produção em larga escala desta enzima são fundamentais. Abordagens de otimização estatística têm demonstrado o seu enorme valor à escala laboratorial e industrial, nomeadamente nos processos de produção biotecnológicos, em que um pequeno detalhe melhorado pode significar um grande passo para o sucesso.Neste trabalho, objetivou-se a otimização do nível de atividade enzimática da proteína recombinante COMT, na sua forma membranar, através do recurso a modelos de otimização estatística como uma abordagem resolutiva. Numa primeira fase de otimização e de seleção dos fatores mais significativos para a atividade enzimática da proteína em estudo foi utilizada a técnica de desenho experimental Plackett-Burman. Após esta seleção foi aplicada a Metodologia de Superfície de Resposta (RSM), através de desenho composto central (DCC), para otimização da concentração dos fatores que revelaram ser mais significativos e, consequentemente, do processo.Foi utilizado o sistema de expressão Brevibacillus choshinensis para a biossíntese da proteína membranar COMT e um meio semi-definido para o seu crescimento. Este meio foi submetido a uma primeira triagem através do desenho experimental Plackett-Burman, avaliando-se desta forma a influência dos parâmetros de cultura (produtos químicos e físicos) nos níveis de actividade enzimática da COMT membranar. Os níveis de actividade enzimática foram medidos num sistema de cromatografia líquida de alta eficiência acoplado a um detector amperométrico. Entre as onze variáveis testadas, a polipeptona, sulfato de amónio, glucose e temperatura foram as variáveis selecionadas dado o seu significativo efeito na actividade enzimática da COMT membranar. Os níveis de atividade enzimática obtidos nesta primeira triagem revelaram-se bastante promissores, sendo mais elevados do que os obtidos com o meio 2SYNm, meio de crescimento mais comum para as células usadas neste trabalho. Foram obtidos valores de 93nmol/h para a actividade enzimática total e cerca 30 nmol/h/mg de actividade enzimática específica com a proteína na sua forma nativa, sem o uso de qualquer tipo de detergentes no processo de solubilização. Com base nos resultados do desenho Plackett Burman foi aplicado o desenho Composto Central para a otimização dos quatro fatores em causa a fim de maximizar a nossa resposta. Este apresentou um valor do coeficiente de correlação múltipla de 0,635 e uma falta de ajuste significativa, demonstrando a falta de adequação do modelo para a otimização do processo.

TI  - Adapt, Move or Perish: The Interaction of Genetics and Demography in Fragmented Populations Under Climate Change
SP  - 133
AB  - Habitat loss and degradation, and human-induced climate change are two of the main current threats to biodiversity. While the impacts of these pressures separately on species survival are being investigated extensively, we have only just begun to unravel the combined impact of these two pressures on species. The combination of range shifts and local adaptation has been suggested to increase species survival under climate change. Habitat fragmentation may increase the rate of local adaptation due to reduced genetic variation as a result of declined population sizes, but also enhances the impact of stochastic processes such as founder effects. A quantification of each of these processes and their combined outcome is therefore necessary to assess the chances of species survival and fitness under different conditions. In this thesis I have used a spatially explicit, individual-based eco-evolutionary model to investigate the interaction of founder events and local adaptation throughout a range of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus medius) in fragmented habitat under climate change. This is a species with an average performance regarding dispersal distance and population growth rate. In Chapter 2 I show that consecutive founder effects occur at all projected levels of temperature increase, in time causing range-wide loss of neutral genetic diversity. In Chapter 3 I demonstrate that increased habitat area prolongs the conservation of neutral genetic variation under range shift but does not prevent the depletion of the genetic variation in the populations that are newly established. Founder events thus have important consequences for the level and distribution of neutral genetic variation in species of average dispersal capacity. In Chapter 4 I show that the founder effect is also a major component of the evolutionary process during a range shift of a species that features genetic differences between central and marginal populations in fragmented habitat. This eventually leads to maladaptation in the range centre and to a decrease of the species’ survival probability. In Chapter 5 I demonstrate that founder effects greatly enhance local adaptation towards increased dispersal in new populations at the expanding range margin. When the selection pressure in these populations changes at a later stage, the local depletion of functional genetic variation caused by the founder event results in delayed adaptation and thus decreased survival probability of the metapopulation. This finding indicates that it is of great importance to assess the relative contribution of founder effects in evolutionary processes in populations established beyond the original range limit under range shift, especially in fragmented habitat. While founder effects have been clearly associated with the patterns in neutral genetic diversity observed after range expansions, studies showing trait evolution under range shifts have thus far not investigated the potential role of founder effects. I advocate the further development of realistic, species-specific eco-evolutionary models to increase both understanding and predictive power of the interaction of demographic and genetic responses of species to combined pressures of habitat fragmentation and climate change. I further recommend that empirical studies combine the investigation of changes in adaptive traits with the assessment of signatures of founder effects, which can be uncovered using neutral markers, both in the same individuals. If local adaptation shows to be enhanced by founder effects, the long-term adverse effects of reduced genetic diversity should be quantified and taken into consideration.

TI  - Theoretical and Experimental Investigations of Metallic Membranes for CO2 Capture
SP  - 129
AB  - Approximately 85% of the global energy demand for electricity generation is supplied from fossil fuel resources, mainly from coal-fired power plants, which accounts for approximately 40% of the total CO2 emissions. Due to the environmental impact and recent proposed EPA regulations on CO2 emissions, it becomes clear that carbon capture technologies must be advanced for carbon capture and storage (or utilization) to be an economically viable strategy for mitigating CO2. Carbon capture may be applied through two different approaches, i.e., precombustion or postcombustion depending on whether a given fossil fuel resource is gasified or combusted, respectively. This dissertation is dedicated to focus on existing precombustion and novel postcombustion membrane technologies. In the studies presented within this dissertation, a high concentration of H2 in synthesis gas for precombustion capture of CO2 and a high concentration of N2 in the flue gas for the postcombustion capture of CO2 are the main driving forces for the use of the metallic membrane technology described within this work. The main scope of this dissertation is showing the value of integration of atomic-scale modeling with experimental testing in improving the material properties of traditional metallic membranes, subsequently leading to the design of new membranes and addressing the challenges that arise from material selection and process scale-up during technology deployment.Palladium-based metallic membranes have been the primary focus in the membrane community as a potential precombustion CO2 capture technology from gasification systems because of their high hydrogen permeability, surface catalytic activity and thermal stability at high temperatures. However, palladium is not only an expensive material to apply at large scale, but it loses its activity and mechanical integrity from sulfur poisoning due to the H2S content of the synthesis gas produced from the coal gasification process. Alloying palladium may be an option for overcoming sulfur poisoning. In this study, the effect of alloying palladium with copper or niobium on the H2 and H2S interactions with the metal membrane surface has been investigated using plane-wave density functional theory-based electronic structure calculations using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package. The overall d-band centers calculated for H2 adsorption at the fcc-fcc site for the pure and alloyed-Pd surfaces indicate that the H2 adsorption strength trend is palladium > copper > niobium. In addition, the H2S binding trend is found to be copper < palladium < niobium, with the copper-alloyed surfaces exhibiting the weakest binding and niobium-alloyed surfaces the strongest binding. The second part of this dissertation is focused on the design and testing of a new N2-selective membrane technology using metallic membranes for the postcombustion CO2 capture application. This technology benefits from the high concentration of N2 present in the flue gas stream (73 wt.%) to separate N2 and concentrate CO2 in the retentate stream of the membrane for CO2 capture as it provides atomic nitrogen on the permeate side of the membrane during separation. These properties along with H2 provided as a sweep gas ammonia synthesis as a byproduct of the separation process may be possible.Within this study, N2 in particular, has been investigated to determine the mechanism of subsequent atomic diffusion into the bulk crystal structure of vanadium and its alloys using density functional theory. It was determined that the octahedral site is the most favorable binding site for N within bulk vanadium, with a binding energy of -2.132 eV. Nitrogen binding in vanadium is nearly twenty orders of magnitude stronger compared to the well-known H binding case (-0.076 eV). These strong N binding energies indicate that N may have difficulty diffusing through the metal. Alloying vanadium with ruthenium may aid in tuning the N binding energy so that it approaches that of H; alloying vanadium with 6.25 at.% ruthenium yields a weaker N binding energy of -0.889 eV. It is anticipated that increasing the content of ruthenium in the alloy will lead to a further reduction in the stability of N within the bulk crystal lattice. Experimental efforts have involved the design and construction of a gas permeation test system and execution of pure gas permeation tests to determine the N2 transport mechanism through the membrane foils comprised of vanadium at temperatures ranging from 600 to 900 °C. The overall experimental findings emphasize the possibility of a solution-diffusion transport mechanism of N2 through vanadium at 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C. Characterization of the foils before and after the permeation tests using XRD, XPS and SEM techniques indicate nitride formation on the surface and in the bulk of the vanadium, thereby providing further evidence that N2 transport through the vanadium membranes takes place via a solution-diffusion mechanism. In total, characterization and flux measurements were compared alongside electronic structure predictions from density functional theory and demonstrate the viability of using Group V metals and their alloys for N2-selective membrane applications.

TI  - Development of bioassay approaches to evaluate the impacts of pollution on New Zealand estuaries using the marine copepod Quinquelaophonte sp
SP  - 233
AB  - Worldwide, estuaries are under increasing pressure from numerous contaminants. There is a need to develop reliable bioassay methodologies to assess the effects of these stressors on estuary health. This thesis aimed to develop and validate toxicity tests in a New Zealand marine harpacticoid copepod species for use in monitoring and evaluating the effects of estuarine pollution. A survey and toxicological assessment of a range of native copepod species resulted in the selection of Quinquelaophonte sp. as the ideal bioassay species. This selection was based on a broad regional distribution, ease of culture and high reproductive rate in the laboratory, sexual dimorphism, and sensitivity to contaminants. To validate the bioassay, spiked sediments were used to expose Quinquelaophonte sp. to three reference compounds representing important categories of estuarine chemical stressors: zinc (a metal), atrazine (a pesticide), and phenanthrene (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon). A method for spiking sediments that Quinquelaophonte sp. inhabit was developed to ensure even contaminant distribution in sediments. Two sediment bioassays using lethal and sublethal endpoints were validated, one acute (96 h) and one chronic (14 d). These assays incorporated both lethal and sublethal endpoints, which included reproductive output and mobility. Acute-to-chronic ratios were calculated for use in environmental risk assessment and to provide insight into the mode of action of the reference contaminants. The chronic sediment bioassay was used to assess sediment quality in three estuaries across New Zealand: Napier, Christchurch and Invercargill. This validated the bioassay for use with naturally-contaminated field sediments with varying mixtures of pollutants and sediment types (coarse sandy to fine silty organic rich sediments). Quinquelaophonte sp. was also tested to assess whether it can be used to characterise multi-generation impacts. After four generations of exposure to zinc, there were changes in acute sensitivity, indicating this species possesses mechanisms for acclimating or adapting to toxic stressors. Sediment bioassays in Quinquelaophonte sp. were successfully developed and validated, offering significant promise as a tool for monitoring effects of pollution in New Zealand estuaries.

TI  - Ecological interactions in populations facing environmental stress
SP  - 156
AB  - O zooplâncton, particularmente os cladóceros, são organismos de água doce importantes na regulação da produção primária dos ecossistemas de água doce. No entanto, também podem adaptar-se a condições salobras. Tendo em conta as previsões no âmbito das alterações climáticas, a intrusão salina pode ocorrer a par com a subida de temperatura. As populações de água doce podem ficar vulneráveis aos efeitos interativos da salinidade e da temperatura, de acordo com os seus limites de tolerância e capacidade de adaptação ao stress ambiental. Assim, a presente tese analisou as interações resultantes das alterações destes agentes de stress em populações de cladóceros de água doce. Primeiro, comparou-se a halotolerância de diferentes genótipos de Simocephalus vetulus provenientes de populações de água doce e de água salobra de modo a avaliar a existência de uma componente genética de resistência à salinidade. A sensibilidade aguda dos genótipos variou na mesma gama de concentrações; todavia, todos os genótipos da população salobra, exceto um, foram mais tolerantes do que os de água doce, em termos de tempo à imobilização. Contudo, não foi possível estabelecer uma relação entre a performance reprodutiva em condições salobras e o contexto ambiental de origem destes genótipos. Mais, estes ensaios mostraram que as populações de água doce têm potencial para tolerar incrementos de salinidade. Como tal, pode-se concluir que a seleção a que os genótipos estão sujeitos no seu local de origem foi mais fraca do que o esperado. Segundo, investigou-se a capacidade de aclimatação de Daphnia galeata à salinidade e temperatura, de modo a avaliar a halotolerância de Daphnia a duas temperaturas num cenário de aclimatação multigeracional. O objetivo foi compreender se a pré-adaptação ao stress ambiental (20ºC e 25ºC versus 0 g/L e 1 g/L de NaCl) influenciou posteriormente as respostas a estes agentes de stress. Verificou-se uma tendência para um aumento de sensibilidade ao NaCl, a temperaturas mais elevadas. No entanto, este efeito foi anulado após nove gerações, mas apenas quando os organismos foram aclimatados aos dois agentes de stress em simultâneo (salinidade e temperatura elevada). Terceiro, demonstrou-se experimentalmente que a salinidade interferiu com a competição interespecífica, alterando a composição das comunidades zooplanctónicas. Este conjunto de evidências permitiu-nos refletir nos múltiplos impactos de agentes de stress, particularmente os relacionados com as previsões de alterações climáticas. Em paralelo aos estudos de natureza experimental, e numa perspetiva de Educação para o Desenvolvimento Sustentável (EDS), importa também promover o desenvolvimento de competências necessárias à compreensão de mudanças ambientais globais (e.g., o impacto da salinidade e da temperatura) para implementar estratégias de mitigação e adaptação. Neste contexto, foi realizada uma atividade com estudantes do ensino secundário, que se tornou uma boa oportunidade para a sua aprendizagem e aquisição de competências de interpretação de dados experimentais, assim como de sensibilização para as questões ambientais.Alternate abstract:Zooplankton, namely cladocerans, are important regulators of primary production in freshwater ecosystems. However, these filter-feeders can also be found in brackish waters and can therefore adapt to this stressful condition. Bearing in mind climate change predictions, saline intrusion can occur in coastal freshwater systems, accompanied by increasing temperatures. Freshwater populations can thus become vulnerable to the interactive effect of salinity and temperature, framed within their tolerance limits and adaptation ability to environmental stress. Taking this into consideration, the present thesis aimed at addressing the complex interactions resulting from the challenge of these environmental stressors on freshwater cladoceran populations. First, the halotolerance of different Simocephalus vetulus genotypes from two freshwater and one brackish population (salinity 2.3) was explored. The goal was to determine whether there was a genetic component of salinity resistance. Clone acute sensitivity was comparable among populations. However, all brackish clones, except one, were more halotolerant than freshwater genotypes, in terms of survival time. Life history assays, carried out with extreme genotypes (from previous experiment) revealed no relationship between fitness and the original environmental context of genotypes. Also, these experiments showed that freshwater populations do have the potential to tolerate salinity increases. As such, we can conclude that the local selective pressure caused by salinity was weaker than expected. Second, the acclimation ability of Daphnia galeata to salinity and temperature was investigated in this study, by evaluating Daphnia’s sensitivity to salinity, at two different temperatures, along a multigenerational acclimation scenario. The objective was to understand whether pre-adaptation to environmental stress (20ºC and 25ºC versus 0 g/L and 1 g/L of added NaCl) influenced the response to the latter exposure to these stressors. A tendency towards the increase of sensitivity to NaCl was observed, at higher temperature. However, this temperature-dependent effect was nullified after nine generations, but only when animals had been acclimated to both stressors (salinity and higher temperature). Third, we experimentally demonstrated that salinity interfered with inter-specific competition, altering the community composition of zooplankton communities. This body of evidence allowed us to reflect on the impacts of multiple stressors, particularly those related to climate change predictions. In parallel with experimental studies, within the framework of Education for Sustainable Development, it is also important to promote the development of the necessary competences towards the comprehension of global environmental change (e.g. the impact of salinity and temperature), in order to implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Hence, an activity with secondary school students was conducted, providing a good opportunity towards learning and competence acquisition in the interpretation of experimental data, as well as increasing awareness towards environmental issues.

TI  - High pressure studies in solid state chemistry and biology
AB  - The new family of multiferroic perovskites SeMO3 (M= Ni, Mn, Cu) are obtained under high-P,T synthesis conditions from mixtures of the oxides (NiO, MnO, SeO2 etc.) or the corresponding metal hydroxides at pressures between 2-7 GPa and at temperatures up to 1000°C. However, those syntheses can result in retention of the starting oxides in the reaction products, leading to difficulties in analysis of the magnetic properties. We have developed a precursor route based on the reaction of Na2SeO3 with anhydrous MCl2 compounds, leading to the formation of the crystalline perovskite material with formation of only diamagnetic NaCl as a reaction product. This reaction procedure also allows us to lower the reaction temperature. We studied the synthesis both in the laboratory using multi-anvil and piston cylinder techniques, and also using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction using the Paris-Edinburgh press at ESRF ID27, to follow the synthesis reactions and optimise the reaction conditions. Our results indicate initial formation of Se-bearing perovskites such as SeCuO3, in a low-P, T range kinetically stabilised during the early stages of the reaction, followed by further reactions to yield well-crystallised materials at higher-P, T conditions. We also used similar techniques to study possible formation of SeMS3 perovskites indicated to be stable from DFT calculations. Here we could not find any evidence for formation of the perovskite structures, but instead we observed synthesis of pyrite-type materials Bacteria show the greatest adaptability, which enables them to occupy extreme habitats on the planet. It is important to complete a proper evaluation of the biosphere of our planet and to achieve this we must understand the mechanisms and limits for bacterial survival. This work will help us constrain models for the origin of life and is readily transferable to many astrobiological studies. It is now extremely relevant to study the effect of high P on the development and evolution of organisms to understand their survivability mechanisms. We are experimenting with the adaptability of E.coli to pressures greater than 1 GPa. Until recently it was thought that no organisms could survive at P> 120 MPa (Zeng et al 2009). However, a recent study indicated that E.coli and S. onodeinsis remained viable to 1.4-1.7 GPa (Sharma et al 2002), but the results have been questioned (Yayanos 2002). However, our collaborative directed evolution study of E. coli has now confirmed that microbes can adapt and survive at least up to 2 GPa (Vanlint et al 2011).

TI  - Evolution of reproduction and stress tolerance in brachionid rotifers
AB  - Stress can be a driving force for new evolutionary changes leading to local adaptation, or may be responded to with pre-existing, ancestral tolerance mechanisms. Using brachionid rotifers (microzooplankton) as a study system, I demonstrate roles of both conserved physiological mechanisms (heat shock protein induction) and rapid evolution of traits in response to ecologically relevant stressors such as temperature and hydroperiod. Rapid evolution of higher levels of sex and dormancy in cultures mimicking temporary waters represents an eco-evolutionary dynamic, with trait evolution feeding back into effects on ecology (i.e., reduced population growth). I also reveal that prolonged culture in a benign laboratory environment leads to evolution of increased lifespan and fecundity, perhaps due to reduction of extrinsic mortality factors. Potential mechanisms (e.g., hormonal signals) are suggested that may control evolvability of facets of the stress response. Due to prior studies suggesting a role of progesterone signaling in rotifer sex and dormancy, the membrane associated progesterone receptor is assayed as a candidate gene that could show positive selection indicating rapid divergence. Despite some sequence variation that may contribute to functional differences among species, results indicate this hormone receptor is under purifying selection. Detailed analyses of multiple stress responses and their evolution as performed here will be imperative to understanding current patterns of local adaptation and trait-environment correlations. Such research also is key to predicting persistence of species upon introduction to novel habitats and exposure to new stressors (e.g., warming due to climate change). Perhaps one of the most intriguing results of this dissertation is the rapid, adaptive change in levels of sex and dormancy in a metazoan through new mutations or re-arrangements of the genetic material. This suggests species may be able to rapidly evolve tolerance of new stressors, even if standing genetic variation does not currently encompass the suite of alleles necessary for survival.

TI  - Graduation Hazards and Surviving College: A Descriptive Study of the Longitudinal Nature of Low-Income, First Generation, and Minority Student Enrollment and Graduation
SP  - 1
AB  - There are ambitious institutional and national goals that aspire to improve the six year graduation rate for undergraduate students. An important element of increasing the overall rate lies in decreasing the educational attainment gaps for low-income, first generation, and other historically underserved students. Comprehensive theoretical approaches to student success show that campuses have the opportunity to influence these achievement gaps with intentional and integrated programming and policy; however, the first step of initiating campus changes is to understand how the longitudinal nature of enrollment varies for demographically different students. This study utilizes a competing risk event history analysis on six cohorts of Colorado State University (CSU) fall-start freshmen over eight academic years in order to describe their dropout and graduation trajectories across a variety of demographic and academic preparation variables. Results indicate that all students have the highest hazard of graduation at year five and the greatest dropout hazard at year one; however, the shapes of these hazards are different based on a student's demographic characteristics. Students with high risk characteristics have much lower graduation hazards after year five and much higher dropout hazards after year one when compared to their low risk peers. Thus, findings from this analysis indicate that high risk students at CSU need to be directed on educational paths that keep them on track to graduate in five years and that these students may also need continued retention support during their second and third years.

TI  - The Role of Life History and the Environment in Population Dynamics of Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)
SP  - 138
AB  - Processes linking the environment and life histories are central to our understanding of population dynamics. This thesis combines life history theory and environmental variation to explain recruitment dynamics among populations in Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). I first explore relationships between spawning stream characteristics and spawning densities and show that streams with more cover have higher spawning densities. Next, I use a 21-year time series for three of these populations to explore hypotheses about how maternal life history traits and migration conditions, experienced during upstream migrations to their spawning grounds, influence reproductive investment. Maternal body size is strongly linked to total reproductive investment and both egg mass and fecundity; however, migration difficulty only influences egg mass and not fecundity. Using the same dataset, I show that egg mass and incubation temperatures influence juvenile fitness-related traits including length, mass and emergence timing. The main finding from these analyses, that warmer incubation temperatures result in lighter juveniles that emerge earlier, led to hypotheses about how incubation temperature might select for egg size among populations. I tested these hypotheses by comparing 16 populations and confirmed the prediction that in streams with warmer water, fish would produce heavier eggs. I then asked if these same maternal traits and environmental conditions would relate to adult recruitment dynamics. Populations spawning in streams with deeper water had higher maximum population growth rates and less variable recruitment. In addition, populations in streams with larger gravel exhibited stronger density-dependence. Finally, I develop a novel framework for evaluating how habitat data, combined with the cost of collecting such information, can be used in developing cost-effective surveys. I demonstrate this general framework with a simple example using the relationships between stream characteristics and sockeye densities, considering the costs and effectiveness of stream variables. Overall, this demonstration of the joint role of maternal traits and environmental conditions in recruitment dynamics supports the potential use of such variables as indicators of population dynamics in the absence of long-term demographic data. Furthermore, it supports the development of cost-effective surveys, which is important as human impacts on populations increase, and as monitoring resources decline.

TI  - Biological Conversion of Glycerol to Ethanol by Enterobacter aerogenes
SP  - 200
AB  - In a search to turn the economically and environmentally non-valuable "waste" streams of biodiesel production into a profitable byproduct, a mutant strain of Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048 was developed by six-tube subculturing technique. This technique is based on the principle of adaptive evolution, and involved subculturing the bacterium in a tryptic soy broth without dextrose (TSB) containing specific glycerol and ethanol concentration for six consecutive times. Then, the six consecutive subculturing was repeated in a fresh TSB of higher glycerol and ethanol concentrations. A new mutant strain, E. aerogenes S012, which could withstand a combination of 200 g/l glycerol and 30 g/l ethanol concentrations, was developed. The wild and mutant strains were used for the fermentation of pure (P-) and recovered (R-) glycerol. Taguchi and full factorial methods of design of experiments were used to screen and optimize the important process factors that influence the microbial production of ethanol. A statistically sound regression model was used to establish the mathematical relationship between the process variables and ethanol production. Temperature of 38°C, agitation speed of 200 rpm, pH of 6.3-6.6, and microaerobic condition were the optimum process conditions. Different pretreatment methods to recover glycerol from the crude glycerol and the subsequent fermentation method showed that direct acidification using 85% H3PO4 was the best. The R-glycerol contained 51% pure glycerol and 21% methanol. The wild strain, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, produced only 12 g/l and 12.8 g/l ethanol from 20 g/l P- and R-glycerol respectively, and could not utilize higher glycerol concentrations. The mutant, E. aerogenes S012, produced ethanol amount and yield of 43 g/l and 1.12 mol/mol-glycerol from P-glycerol, respectively within 96 h. It also produced ethanol amount and yield of 26.8 g/l and 1.07 mol/mol-glycerol, respectively, from R-glycerol within the same duration. In a fermentation to estimate hydrogen production using a respirometer, the hydrogen yield and volumetric rate of 1.06 mol/mol-glycerol and 217 ml/l/h, respectively were obtained from 6% P-glycerol in 72 h by E. aerogenes S012. The result was higher from R-glycerol, which produced hydrogen yield and productivity of 1.83 mol/mol-glycerol and 326 ml/l/h, respectively.

TI  - Sex determination and differentiation in the common snapping turtle – A reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination
SP  - 225
AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was first discovered in an African lizard over 40 years ago. TSD has since been shown to be exhibited by many vertebrates including some fish and amphibians, numerous lizards, turtles, and all crocodilians studied to date. Although numerous questions surround TSD, a major question focuses on understanding the genetic, physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying this process. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying TSD are not well known and the gene(s) that transduces a signal for ovary or testis development is not known in any species. Furthermore, it is well established that sex steroid hormones, androgens and estrogens, are important for sex determination and differentiation in TSD species. Yet, the role of androgens in these processes is not well understood. This dissertation addresses these questions in two parts. First, to identify unique, thermo-sensitive, genes involved in TSD and secondly, determine the role of androgens in sex determination and differentiation in the common snapping turtle, a reptile with TSD. I used differential-display PCR to clone a candidate gene involved in TSD, the cold-inducible RNA binding protein (Cirbp). The temporal and spatial patterns of Cirbp mRNA and protein expression during and after sex determination were determined using quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry. I used next-generation Illumina sequencing to identify small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to test for associations between Cirbp genotype, mRNA expression, and sex ratios. To determine the role of androgens in sex determination and differentiation, snapping turtle embryos were treated with the androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the anti-androgen, flutamide, or a vehicle (ethanol) control. Whole mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effect of the treatments on sex differentiation of the male reproductive tracts. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure expression patterns of ovary-specific genes, testis-specific genes and steroidogenic genes in gonads from embryos treated with vehicle, DHT, or flutamide. I found Cirbp was induced at a high female-producing temperature, but not at a low female-producing temperature. Cirbp is associated with TSD and expression of alternative Cirbp alleles is capable of transducing temperature differently for establishing a signal that directs ovaries versus testes development. I observed allelic specific expression and differences in allele frequencies between turtle embryos from northern and southern Minnesota, suggesting genetic adaptation to local thermal regime. I also found significant genetic associations between Cirbp genotype, Cirbp expression and sexual phenotype in a study that produced mixed sex ratios. Androgens were capable of inducing ovarian development even at an all-male producing temperature, presumably by inducing aromatase expression and increasing endogenous estrogen production. I also observed among clutch variation in androgen responsiveness to produce females, suggesting there is a genetic basis for the response. My findings provide the strongest evidence to date for a unique gene involved in TSD. Additional studies are required to define the functional role of Cirbp in sex determination. Androgens appear critical for ovarian development, but ongoing research is needed to understand androgen signaling and the genetic variation underlying this process.

TI  - The evolution of stress response and complex life history traits in natural populations of garter snakes
SP  - 227
AB  - How an individual responds to environmental stress (temperature changes, toxins) affects how that individual behaves, its ability to reproduce, and its lifespan. We have limited understanding of how stress response is integrated across single genes, proteins, and metabolites; to whole genomes and transcriptomes; and ultimately its effect on whole organism lifetime fitness. Expanding our understanding of the stress response across generations, and placing it in an evolutionary context, is an even more daunting challenge. Yet without an in-depth understanding of the plasticity and evolution of stress responses, we cannot predict how environmental changes will affect species' ability to respond and survive in our dramatically changing world. The complex molecular network that underlies physiological stress response is comprised of nodes (proteins, metabolites, mRNAs, etc.) whose connections span cells, tissues, and organs. Variable nodes are points in the network upon which natural selection may act. The aim of my dissertation research was to identify variable nodes that will reveal how the molecular stress network may evolve among populations in different habitats, and how the evolution of these stress networks might impact life-history evolution. To address this, I utilize closely related natural populations of garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) that occur in discrete habitats that have enhanced their divergence along the pace-of-life continuum; the slow-living phenotype has slower growth, smaller reproductive effort per bout, and extended median lifespan relative to the fast-living phenotype. We take a multifaceted molecular approach – cellular physiology, transcriptomics, and genomics – to test whether lab-born juveniles of these divergent phenotypes vary concomitantly at candidate nodes of the stress response network under unstressed and induced-stress conditions. As molecular resources for this species was lacking, I used next-generation sequencing techniques to generate a large-scale multi-organ transcriptome that provided genetic resources necessary for the rest of this research. I found, in response to heat stress, some measures increased in both life-history phenotypes: plasma corticosterone; gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs); expression of environmental sensing pathways; and gene expression of mitochondrial rRNAs; and State III mitochondrial respiration. These results supported predicted relationships among these traits. As well, the phenotypes diverged at multiple nodes in both unstressed conditions and in their response to stress. Under unstressed conditions the slow-living phenotype had higher expression of the mitochondrial genome, higher State IV mitochondrial respiration, higher circulating levels of reactive oxygen species, lower liver gene expression of a key antioxidant, and higher erythrocyte DNA damage relative to the fast-living phenotype. In response to heat stress the fast-lived phenotype increased its expression of the mitochondrial genome, increased its circulating levels of reactive oxygen species and its DNA damage relative to the slow-living phenotype. Additionally, mitochondrial haplotypes - defined by nonsynonymous changes - were unique to each phenotype suggesting diversifying selection between the phenotypes. These results support the hypothesis that these evolutionarily divergent life-history phenotypes have also diverged in their molecular stress response networks. In addition I identified specific nodes involved in oxidative stress and mitochondrial function at which selection appears to be acting in these divergent life-history phenotypes. More broadly, these results lend further support to the prediction of tightly integrated molecular interactions between stress networks and life-history traits. Finally, this research furthers our understanding of how changing environmental stresses may drive the evolution of molecular networks.

TI  - Thermal Determinants of Nest Site Selection in Loggerhead Sea Turtles, Caretta caretta, at Casey Key, Florida
SP  - 154
AB  - Many environmental cues are thought to influence nest site selection by loggerhead sea turtles, Caretta caretta, and much debate exists over the possible influence of sand temperature. This study had two primary objectives: (1) to measure thermal differences across transects of a major nesting beach of Casey Key (28.7 N, 82.3 W), Florida and (2) to evaluate thermal pattern variation that influenced nesting patterns of adult female loggerhead sea turtles. A secondary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of infrared thermometers to collect sand surface temperatures in the field. Temperature data were collected from 145 nest events and 8 false crawls in the 2008 and 2009 nesting seasons. Infrared thermometers and thermocouple probes were used to obtain surface temperatures from the water, waterline, beach sand, body pit attempts, nest chamber attempts, eggs, and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female, within the crawl track created by the female and at one meter adjacent to the crawl track (from undisturbed sand). Weather influences at the time of nesting were recorded, including the presence or absence of rain, wind, or clouds. Beach slope was measured using an angle locator. Temperature data from the infrared thermometer and the thermocouple probe were highly correlated, indicating that an infrared thermometer is an effective measurement tool on a nesting beach. In 2008, there was a significant difference between temperatures collected within the crawl tracks of false crawl events and nest events, indicating a potential for females to use thermal cues in choosing whether to false crawl or nest. In both nesting seasons, the sand temperature in the body pit and the surface of the gular skin of the nesting female were nearly identical, suggesting females may locate a suitable nest site using their skin temperature. Data collected at other loggerhead rookeries in the United States and Australia yielded similar results, however, variability in the use of temperature may arise seasonally, and according to different nesting environments. Rain, wind and cloud cover significantly thermally altered several locations on Casey Key, but it remains unclear if these weather events significant affect turtle nesting behavior. Additionally, crawl distance and beach slope were significantly, positively correlated. Gravid females most likely use multiple environmental cues to select a nest site. Assimilating information from multiple sources allows for the highest degree of adaptability, and future studies should consider implications for climate change and beach renourishment projects.

TI  - Getting to the root of the matter: Grizzly bears and alpine sweetvetch in west-central Alberta, Canada
SP  - 116
AB  - Wildlife habitat selection is influenced by gender, offspring-dependency, resource availability, and spatiotemporal variation in resource nutrition. In consideration of these factors, this thesis examines alpine sweetvetch (Hedysarum alpinum) root and its relationship to grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in west-central Alberta, Canada. I observed sexually segregated, offspring-dependent functional responses in selection for sweetvetch habitat that was further affected by inter-annual patterns in spring climate (i.e., Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Selection patterns suggested that habitat segregation was due to differences in nutritional requirements between sexes and offspring predation risk. Nutritional analyses of roots indicated that temporal patterns in protein content were influenced by spatial variations in temperature and soil. This spatiotemporal heterogeneity benefits grizzly bears by prolonging the availability of nutritious roots, and may explain why sweetvetch habitats in the mountains were relied upon throughout the spring and how bears could rely on a root digging (habitat) strategy.

TI  - Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) thermal adaptive potential: Physiological implications for climate change
SP  - 110
AB  - In regard to global warming, coldwater salmonids are becoming more vulnerable as changing thermal conditions threaten the future sustainability of these species. Thermal stress and habitat loss from increasing water temperatures are expected to impact population viability, particularly for inland populations with limited adaptive resources. Although the long-term persistence of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), an archetypal coldwater salmonid, will depend on their ability to cope with and adapt to changing thermal conditions, very little is known about the scope and variation of thermal tolerances within and among brook trout populations and evolutionary lineages. Demonstrating that brook trout from different ancestral thermal environments vary significantly in their ability to tolerate increasing water temperatures, I found that upper thermal tolerance differs among populations and among acclimation treatments. The northernmost brook trout strain (Lake Nipigon) had the lowest thermal tolerance, while the strain with the most southern ancestry (Hill's Lake) had the greatest thermal tolerance. Standard metabolic rate and critical swimming performance varied similarly across acclimation temperatures, peaking at the upper range of a brook trout's preferred temperature range, then decreasing as temperatures reached pejus points. As well, I investigated a potential physiological mechanism underlying intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance via heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsc70). Heat shock proteins were correlated to thermal tolerance; Hsp70 in cardiac and white muscle tissues were linked, while hepatic tissue showed no correlation. I also attempted to establish whether the heat shock response has equable inter-population coping capacity for protein carbonylation incurred through heat shock. Carbonylation of proteins in white muscle and hepatic tissues was suppressed or repaired, suggesting that heat shock proteins were able to adequately cope with increased oxidative damage due to thermal stress. Taken together, these results suggest that populations of brook trout will vary in their ability to cope with a changing climate.

TI  - Inbreeding depression and segregation distortion in Chinook salmon: Conservation implications of genetic load
SP  - 87
AB  - Strong evidence that shows inbreeding in many plants and animals can lead to detrimental effects at the level of the organism as well as the population. Inbreeding and its effects have been the focus of much attention in terms of conservation and captive rearing and breeding programs for many endangered species. Inbreeding depression (ID) is the fitness loss associated with individuals and populations that have experienced inbreeding. Surprisingly, ID studies within salmonids are not extensive. Here, I used inbred offspring of self-fertilized hermaphrodite parents to study the effects of ID in Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at an extreme level of inbreeding. High levels of ID were found after a single generation of self-crossing, resulting in substantial fitness losses. The potential to purge genetic load from a population was shown to take place and the major genetic mechanism driving ID was due to expression of deleterious recessive alleles.

TI  - Preventing predation: Evolution and adaptive plasticity in morphological defense of an invasive species
SP  - 207
AB  - Invasive species are one of the leading threats to global biodiversity, but until recently, little attention has been paid to how evolution contributes to invasive species effects despite important applications to conservation and our general understanding of evolution in the wild. Invasive species often experience strong selection upon introduction, which may result in adaptive evolution that could facilitate their successful integration into food webs and their effects on native species. Recent species invasions in North America offer a strong opportunity to address fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology as well as advance our understanding of invasive species effects. Bythotrephes longimanus (the spiny water flea) is a predatory zooplankton with a conspicuous tail spine that invaded the Great Lakes region during the 1980s and may be having large negative effects on fisheries. Previous field studies show the morphology and life history of Bythotrephes strongly vary spatially and temporally, but the cause is not known. Evolution by natural selection and phenotypic plasticity are potential sources of Bythotrephes trait variation, but heretofore, these sources of variation have not been investigated. My dissertation research investigated ecological and evolutionary factors that influence morphological and life history variation in Bythotrephes . Using Bythotrephes collected from Lake Michigan, I found moderate-to-high genetic variation in distal spine and body length and maternal effects in both traits. Further, experiments revealed that spine length, body size, and clutch size respond plastically to temperature but not to fish predator cues, with higher temperature inducing mothers to have smaller clutches of larger offspring (longer absolute distal spine and body length) that were better defended against predation. Although Bythotrephes use temperature as the proximate cue of plasticity, it is likely that the trait changes represent adaptations to varying fish predation risk which correlates with water temperature. I also found temporally and spatially variable selection on distal spine length consistent with seasonal changes in gape-limitation of fish predators and spatial heterogeneity of fish, respectively. Yet, despite net selection for increased distal spine length, I observed little evidence of an evolutionary response to selection based on comparisons of historic and contemporary wild-captured individuals and retrieved spines from sediment cores. In a companion study of Canadian Shield lakes, I identified gape-limited fish predators as agents of selection on Bythotrephes distal spine length. Specifically, I found selection for increased distal spine length in lakes dominated by a gape-limited fish predator and no significant selection in lakes dominated by a non-gape-limited fish predator. A large difference (20%) in average distal spine length between lakes of each predator type was consistent with the direction of selection, suggesting potential local adaptation of distal spine length to gape-limited fish predation. The results of my dissertation indicate Bythotrephes respond to fish predation through multiple mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary responses to selection. These responses to predation likely promote Bythotrephes success as an invasive species, and may also underlie negative effects on important Great Lakes fisheries through food web interactions. More generally, the results of my dissertation suggest the effects of invasive species may occur not just through their ecological interactions, but also through evolutionary and phenotypically plastic trait modifications. As invasive species continue to affect biodiversity worldwide, understanding the mechanisms behind invasive species effects is critical.

TI  - Effects of climate change on reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination and potential adaptation via maternal nest-site choice
SP  - 188
AB  - Reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination may be particularly threatened by climate change, as increasing temperatures could lead to skewed sex ratios. A potential compensatory mechanism is nest-site choice, with females selecting nest sites to match incubation conditions to climatic conditions. I studied nest-site choice in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to determine the extent to which behavioral plasticity in nest-site choice can compensate for the effects of climate change. In a common-garden experiment, gravid females from five populations across the species' range were collected and nest-site choice was compared among populations to evaluate variation in nesting phenology, shade cover over the nest, nest depth, incubation regime, and offspring sex ratio. Populations differed in nesting phenology and nest depth, but not in shade cover over nests; thus, when exposed to novel climatic conditions, females from transplanted populations chose nest-sites with similar shade cover to those of local females, thereby producing similar offspring sex ratios. The performance of hatchlings produced in this experiment declined with decreasing mean temperature of the mother's site of origin, and nests with greater variation in daily temperature range produced hatchlings that performed faster and more readily than nests with less variable incubation temperatures. Therefore, selection of shadier nest-sites may be a mechanism by which female turtles could compensate for climatic warming, and the increase in temperature fluctuations predicted by climate change models may result in the production of faster hatchling turtles with enhanced righting ability. In an experiment manipulating nest depth, I found that nest depth affected the magnitude of daily temperature fluctuation, but neither mean nest temperature nor sex ratio were affected by depth. The adjustment in nest depth that would be required to affect sex ratio in this species is biologically unfeasible, and therefore female adjustment of nest depth is unlikely to compensate for climate change. Finally, I compared used vs. available nesting habitat between a southern and central population of painted turtles. Compared to the central population, turtles from southern population were more limited in the available range of accessible shade cover under which to nest. As shade cover is an easily-manipulated feature, land managers can adjust the range of shade cover available to nesting turtles in order to preserve populations in the face of climate change. Overall, this research is fundamental to understanding processes in evolutionary ecology in general, and to contemporary climate change biology specifically.

TI  - Applied conservation research of the wēkiu bug in Hawai`i: Life table analysis, population genetics, and phylogenetics create a holistic view of a rare and unique species
SP  - 236
AB  - The wekiu bug (Nysius wekiuicola Ashlock and Gagné 1983) is a flightless carnivore endemic to the dormant Mauna Kea volcano, on the Big Island of Hawaii. Wekiu bugs only occur between 3,350m (11,500ft) and the summit at 4,205m (13,796ft) in an environment described as high alpine desert. Remarkably, the main nutrient input to the summit comes from aeolian deposition of arthropods blown in from lower elevations. The wekiu bug's habitat is subject to dramatic temperature extremes, with daily fluctuations in their microhabitat caused by solar daytime heating and rapid evening cooling. The wekiu bug was, until fall 2011, a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Detailed ecological data of the wekiu bug are necessary for informed management decisions. I briefly present an overview of insect conservation research and the field's current status in Hawaii as a primer to the research conducted for this dissertation. I investigated unknown aspects of the wekiu bug's life history using life table experiments and degree day modeling, showing how the wekiu bug can develop in its harsh natural environment. They have a low reproductive output in captivity, develop most quickly at 30-32°C, exhibit an intrinsic rate of increase (r) of 0.045 in field simulations, and require 622 degree days for one generation. This developmental requirement is only achieved for a maximum of 8.5 hours of solar heating on Mauna Kea. This lab-based study helped explain field observations and trapping patterns. Also, using population genetic analyses of mtDNA haplotype diversity, I describe the potential impacts of habitat disturbance and ecosystem alteration in two distinct populations. Finally, I investigated the evolution of the wekiu bug within the Nysius lineage using DNA sequence from 29 Nysius species. Its closest relatives are seed feeding Nysius, on Maui and Hawaii islands, and there is considerable taxonomic revision needed in the genus. In the appendices of this dissertation, I present a pictorial key of the Hawaiian Nysius for identifying the Nysius in Hawaii, and I provide a summary of the technical reports of wekiu bug monitoring from 2005–2011, with maps for resource managers' use.

TI  - Aphid responses to drought: a combined physiological and transcriptomic approach
SP  - 1
AB  - Drought is arguably one the greatest future challenges for agriculture. The response of phloem feeders, such as aphids, to increased drought expected under climate change is still relatively undefined. The effect on aphid feeding of drought stress in plants can be viewed as potentially positive and negative. It is currently accepted that under drought conditions, host plant sieve elements will become more concentrated; hence increases in available amino acid concentrations will potentially benefit aphids. However, the increased need for aphid osmoregulation under drought, to deal with the osmotically challenging diet, may be detrimental to aphid performance. Using the electrical penetration graph technique (EPG), the probing behaviour of two clones of Myzus persicae (O Clone and B Clone), Brevicoryne brassicae, Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae on the host plants Brassica nigra and Lolium perenne (respectively), were analysed under a defined drought regime. Drought treatment had a significant effect on the behaviours of all aphid species and clones, except S. avenae. In B. brassicae and B clones of M. persicae, xylem feeding was significantly increased on droughted host plants. Furthermore, both clones of M. persicae and R. padi spent significantly less time ingesting sieve element sap, and more time not probing or in plant pathway activities whilst on droughted host plants. These results suggest that drought stress may cause a reduced palatability of host plants. In addition, fecundity measurements showed that drought resulted in a reduction in aphid reproductive performance in M. persciae (O and B clone), B. brassicae, R. padi and S. avenae. However, fecundity was only significantly reduced in the M. persicae (O clone only), B. brassicae and R. padi. To understand the aphid response to droughted B. nigra at the genetic level, the gene expression of M. persicae exposed to different drought regimes was analysed using microarrays. Gene expression analysis showed up regulation of the osmoregulation associated enzyme, sucrase, as well as the up regulation of other enzymes such as amylases, cytochrome P450s, Heat Shock Proteins, and an aquaporin when exposed to droughted hosts. Furthermore, it was found that the level of drought had a noticeable effect on gene expression in M. persicae, showing aphids have a very adaptable response to drought stress. The combined physiological and transcriptomic approach of this study gives a complementary whole organism assessment of aphid responses to drought. This study has helped to confirm xylem feeding and sugar polymerisation as important mechanisms of aphid osmoregulation, as well as providing support for the hypothesis of water cycling within the body of the aphid. This study has highlighted that aphids respond heterogeneously to water stress, and although it has been possible to identify some general trends, this study has emphasised that the adaptability of aphids to stress is species and even ecotype specific.

TI  - The evolution and genetics of thermal traits in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 137
AB  - Temperature is a critical environmental parameter and thermal variation has significant effects on local adaptation and species distributions in nature. This is especially true for organisms that are isothermal with their environment. Variation in temperature imposes stress and directly influences physiology, behavior, and fitness. Thus, to thrive across a range of thermal environments populations must contain sufficient genetic variation, the capacity to respond plastically, or some combination of both genetic and plastic responses. In this work I first quantified patterns of phenotypic and genetic variation in nature and then dissected the genetic basis of variation in thermal traits. In the first aim I used natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected from a latitudinal transect in Argentina to investigate variation in heat stress resistance and cold plasticity within and among populations. I found heat stress resistance was highly variable within populations, but was strongly associated with the monthly maximum average temperature of each site. For cold plasticity I was able to demonstrate significant variation in plasticity within and among populations, however the among population variation was best explained by the altitude of each site. I hypothesized that this was caused by a difference in temperature fluctuations at high altitude sites relative to low altitude sites. To evaluate this hypothesis I paired our study with existing laboratory data that demonstrated significant fitness differences between high and low plasticity (and altitude) sites when these populations were reared in variable thermal environments. Thus, cold plasticity is an adaptive response to environmental variation. The final project focused on understanding the genetic basis of thermal variation. I fine-mapped a single co-localized heat and cold tolerance QTL via deficiency and mutant complementation mapping to identify four novel thermal candidate genes. There was no overlap of the deficiencies or genes associated with cold or heat stress resistance. Sequence analysis of each gene identified the polymorphisms that differentiate the lines. To test for independent associations between these polymorphisms and variation in nature the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel was used to confirm associations between allelic variation and cold tolerance in nature.

TI  - The influence of oceanographic processes on recruitment and gene flow in the temperate rockfish Sebastes melanops
SP  - 159
AB  - Many marine species are typified by a pelagic stage during which tiny larvae develop in the open ocean, where they are subject to high mortality and transport via ocean currents. For organisms with this life history, the study of their population dynamics is challenging because individuals are not directly traceable. Challenges to the study of population dynamics include the determination of source and sink populations, of connectivity among populations, of the mechanisms that drive the abundance and relatedness of recruits, and of how life-history characteristics mitigate or exacerbate the uncertainty of the ocean environment. My dissertation addressed these challenges in the Pacific black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, using a combination of standardized field sampling, population genetics, and mathematical modeling. Like other members of the rockfish genus, black rockfish are long-lived fishes that suffered severe declines in the 1980's due to overfishing. I collected adults from Oregon to British Columbia, and genotyped them at 8 microsatellite markers. I used isolation by distance theory to estimate the width of the dispersal kernel, as well as compared coalescent-migration matrices with Bayes factors. My results illustrated that over several generations, gene flow in the population occurred from south-to-north (a bearing in agreement with the direction of currents during the pelagic phase) and the mean dispersal distance (< 50 km) was smaller than might be expected based on an extensive pelagic phase of 60–80 days. This analysis was extended to examine the source populations for rockfish recruits that were collected between 2005 and 2009 from Barkley Sound (British Columbia), and my results suggested that substantial local recruitment occurred during downwelling regimes that favored the retention of larvae. However, the number of source populations for larvae was not correlated with the genetic diversity of recruits. I used cross-correlations to examine the relationships between oceanographic conditions, the abundance of recruits, and the genetic diversity of those recruits. I found that although there was a strong positive relationship between upwelling and the abundance of recruits, the effective number of breeders that contributed to each cohort was positively correlated with temperature. Finally, I utilized computer simulations to examine the conflicting predictions for multiple paternity for the effective size of a population (Ne). For long-lived species like rockfish, there were small differences in Ne between populations with multiple paternity and a monandrous mating systems, indicating that multiple paternity had little effect on the genetic patterns observed in this study. The results of my research can be applied to the conservation and management of this species across the US-Canada border, and may be useful in predicting how this species will respond to climate change.

TI  - Characterization of Disinfectant and Phage Resistance Determinants of Listeria monocytogenes
SP  - 282
AB  - Environmental contamination of food plays a key role in transmission of Listeria monocytogenes. Adaptations such as ability to grow under refrigeration, biofilm formation, disinfectant resistance, and resistance to phage are crucial to the survival of L. monocytogenes in the environment. Here we have investigated some of the adaptations that may contribute towards environmental persistence of this pathogen. These include disinfectant (quaternary ammonium compounds, QAC) resistance, temperature-dependent resistance to phage among epidemic clone II strains, triphenylmethane dye reduction and resistance to heavy metals such as cadmium. Using in silico analysis, we have analyzed the prevalence of cadAC efflux systems associated with cadmium resistance among different Listeria genomes. Of the three distinct cadAC types known to date in L. monocytogenes, two (cadA1C1 and cadA2C2) were harbored by plasmids and were encountered in diverse strains of L. monocytogenes and (in the case of cadA2C2) non-pathogenic Listeria spp. Large plasmids from two different epidemic-associated strains of L. monocytogenes harbored cadA2C2 together with a drug efflux system (bcrABC), and both determinants were associated with a putative IS1216 transposon. Plasmid-cured derivatives of these strains were susceptible both to cadmium and to BC. Genetic analyses revealed that cadA2C2 was sufficient for restoring resistance to cadmium to a plasmid-cured derivative of L. monocytogenes H7550. Furthermore, bcrABC was sufficient for restoring resistance to high levels of QAC to the plasmid-cured strain. The transcription of bcrABC was temperature-dependent, with higher transcript levels at 37°C than at 25°C or below. The bcrABC system was encountered among L. monocytogenes strains of different serotypes, origin (environmental or clinical) and genotypes and was detected more frequently in strains harboring the cadmium resistance cassette cadA2C2 (alone or together with cadA1C1) than in those harboring cadA1C1 alone. bcrABC was found in several different genetic arrangements, mostly on plasmids, but we also identified L. monocytogenes strains in which bcrABC appeared to have translocated into the chromosome. Transcriptional analysis revealed that transcription of cadA2C2 and bcrABC was independent, and induced upon exposure to the respective compounds (cadmium and BC, respectively). On the other hand, bcrABC was co-transcribed with the downstream gene tmr, encoding a putative triphenylmethane reductase. We showed that tmr mediated decolorization (reduction) of toxic dyes such as crystal violet (CV) and that CV could also induce bcrABC. Analysis of a panel of strains of diverse serotypes revealed that those harboring tmr tended to also harbor bcrABC and cadA2C2 (alone or together with cadA1C1), suggesting the presence of a co-selected multi-resistance unit that includes cadA2C2, bcrABC, and tmr. In previous studies, a gene (ORF 2753) was found to be responsible for the ability of L. monocytogenes epidemic clone II (ECII) to be resistant to phage when propagated at temperatures <25°C. Here we have shown that ORF2753 corresponded to a putative restriction endonuclease that was a component of a type II restriction-modification (RM) system (LmoH1) that is specific for GTATCC (N6/5). This RM system is present on a chromosomal genomic region unique to ECII strains. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the putative restriction endonuclease was expressed significantly more at ≤25°C than at 37°C, potentially accounting for the temperature-dependent phage resistance of ECII strains, while ORF2754 (putative methyltransferase) was expressed at all tested temperatures; this was in agreement with the resistance of the DNA from cells grown at either 25°C or 37°C to BfuI, specific for GTATCC (N6/5). Given that genetic basis for distinct adaptive attributes were elucidated in an outbreak strain (H7550), it would be of further interest to investigate the contribution of these determinants towards virulence of this pathogen. Such details would provide new avenues to control the incidence of listeriosis.

TI  - Evolution of Thermal Tolerance and Mating Systems in Two Intertidal Crustaceans
SP  - 87
AB  - Intertidal invertebrates provide a wealth of opportunities for testing hypotheses in evolution and ecology, as the group encompasses a broad variety of body plans, life histories, and ecologies. In this dissertation I address two themes in two different intertidal crustaceans: the evolution of thermal tolerance, and the evolution of animal mating systems. In the first two chapters, I present the results of a series of selection experiments, measuring thermal tolerance and the capacity to evolve increased tolerance in the tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus. A rich history of intertidal ecology on the west coast of North America demonstrates that temperature and desiccation stress play important roles setting species' distributions. In addition, thermal tolerance limits are likely to mediate species' responses to climate change. In the third chapter, I present the first use (to my knowledge) of molecular data to assign paternity in a barnacle (Tetraclita rubescens ), and use these data to describe the species' mating system. The extent to which acclimation and genetic adaptation might buffer natural populations against climate change is largely unknown. Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. I test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 17° of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in high-latitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted. Limits to adaptation often arise from negative pleiotropic effects of alleles under selection. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, I measure six fitness-related traits in selected and unselected lines: male size, female size, fecundity, interbrood interval, minimum generation time and starvation resistance. However, there is no evidence for a cost of increased tolerance. Although five out of six of these populations show a response to selection, selected lines actually show an overall increase in male and female body size, fecundity and starvation resistance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varies significantly by population for three traits, providing evidence that the genetic basis for the response to selection differs among populations. Plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer isolated populations of T. californicus against further increases in temperature. However, my results suggest that genetic variation for thermal tolerance within populations is not limited by a linear tradeoff between tolerance and other aspects of fitness. It may instead by limited by forces such as drift, or negative epistatic interactions among thermal tolerance alleles from different populations. In the third chapter, I use molecular markers to assign paternity to broods of the intertidal barnacle Tetraclita rubescens. I use these data to describe this species' mating system, and factors affecting paternity success. A paired logistic regression shows no effect of body size or male investment on paternity success, while the effect of proximity is highly significant. Tetraclita is capable of siring broods over distances of 11.2 cm, but broods show low rates of multiple paternity, with 75% of broods having only one father, even at high densities. Siring success is evenly distributed among individuals, with a distribution of successes/barnacle at high densities that is not significantly different from the null expectation of equal probability of success among all individuals, and a distribution that was more even than the null expectation at low densities. High rates of single-paternity broods suggest that this species does not compete via sperm displacement and this may explain the lack of any relationship between male investment and paternity success. Furthermore a lack of any skew in the distribution of paternity successes suggests a lack of strong sexual selection on male traits in this species, a fact that is likely driven by the small size of mating groups available to a sessile copulator.

TI  - Effects of genistein on the modulation of stress and immune response in fish
SP  - 102
AB  - Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of genistein as a nutraceutical in modulating stress and the immune response in fish, maintained in aquaculture conditions. Two widely aquacultured fish species, tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus) and steelhead salmon (Oncorhynchus mykiss), representing warm water and cool water environments, respectively, were selected for these experiments. Fish were obtained from certified hatcheries and were acclimated in their respective environments, warm water (24±2°C; 76±4°F) and cool water (17±2°C; 62±4°F), for two weeks prior to the beginning of the experiments. Within each environment, fish were divided into two groups and maintained in two different conditions- controlled and stressed (by crowding; density > 40 g/l). Within each condition, fish were further divided into two treatments and fed either regular commercial feed or genistein supplemented commercial feed (@400 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Fish were sampled at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 and were assessed for physiological (length, weight, condition factor, blood glucose, packed cell volume, plasma protein, spleen somatic index, and heat shock proteins) and immunological parameters (spleen cell proliferation and macrophage respiratory burst activity). In general, fish held in control groups had relatively better growth, physiological state and immune response than stressed fish. Within the controlled or stressed conditions, fish that received genistein supplemented feed did not show any statistically significant improvement (P>0.05) in any of the physiological or immunological parameters. However, some parameters (spleen somatic index and spleen cell proliferation) in the warm water fish (tilapia) did show a pattern of higher activity in the supplemented group. It is possible that fish, being poikilothermic, were not able to digest and/or absorb genistein due to their slow metabolic rate. Also genistein may only act on pathways that are specific for cancer and virus infection rather than general physiological system and immune response. Further research is necessary before making any definite conclusions, on the benefit of genistein in aquaculture.

TI  - Gene Flow and Adaptation in Lonicera Japonica
SP  - 110
AB  - Little is known about the genetic and adaptive dynamics of biological invasions. Here I use Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica ), a horticultural vine invading North America, to assess population genetic processes and adaptive change in an invasion. Lonicera japonica plants from 17 populations in the core of the invaded range (100-150 years old) and 14 populations in the range margin (65 years old or younger) were compared to determine genetic structure at multiple scales, whether divergent evolution has occurred during invasion, and the potential for populations from these sources to invade novel areas. There was little genetic structure in L. japonica's invaded range. Genetic variation was distributed over short spatial scales, with most variation accounted for within populations and within patches in populations, but not between core and margin regions. Four genetic groups were identified, suggesting multiple introductions, and admixture is ongoing, with 17% of samples of mixed origin. Genetic diversity did not affect patch-level reproduction, but increasing local conspecific cover resulted in more fruit production, indicating the presence of Allee effects. These findings show that human dispersal of invaders can lead to high levels of local genetic variation, which may increase population growth rates and spread in this self-incompatible species. Adaptive evolution was found within L. japonica's invaded range. After three years growth in core and margin gardens, margin plants had 36% greater biomass and 30% greater survival than core plants, regardless of planting location or genetic group. Margin plants also were larger and had 54% greater survival after two years in gardens beyond the range edge. Size influenced survival, suggesting that margin plants had higher survival because they grew more rapidly. Across latitudes, winter mortality increased with increasing latitude, and core plants had 39% higher winter mortality than margin plants. Increased performance of margin plants indicates that range expansion has selected for plants with greater ability to establish and this reinforces selection by short growing seasons for rapid growth rates at the margin. In total, evolution in margin populations suggests that adaptations promoting colonization can drive invasions and increase the likelihood of further spread, especially as global temperatures increase.

TI  - Projecting the influence of climate change and daily temperature range on insect phenology and risk period of vector borne diseases
SP  - 238
AB  - Understanding how climate change would influence the life history and population dynamics of insects is a key component needed to evaluate the impact of climate change on ecological and epidemiological systems, since insects are relatively sensitive to their surrounding environment, especially ambient temperature. Previous research has demonstrated that rising mean temperatures can influence voltinism, geographic distribution, and vectoring capacity. However, the distributional change among life stages for specific climate scenarios, and the importance of the daily temperature range (DTR), or daily temperature fluctuations, has not been emphasized. In this thesis we employed an agroecosystem and an epidemiological system and quantitatively study how changes in daily temperature range, as well as in mean temperature, would shift pest/vector insect phenology. In the first chapter (chapter II) following the introduction chapter (chapter I), I developed an individual based Monte Carlo simulation method to project grape berry moth (Paralobesia viteana) life history (e.g. number of generations per year, mean and distribution of emergence time for each generation) under two different climate change scenarios, A1fi and B1, which represent upper and lower global warming conditions, respectively. The results showed that under A1fi condition the number of generations per year would increase nonlinearly after an initial lag of approximately 35 years (from 2009), and by the end of this century we might expect almost one more generations per year on average and a 5th generation would be more common. I then further investigated how changes in the daily temperature range would influence degree day accumulation and consequently P. viteana phenology in chapter III. I discovered that mean temperature alone could not sufficiently and accurately compute degree day accumulation, and various daily temperature range conditions substantially influences degree day accumulation. Large changes in daily temperature fluctuations around current climatic conditions were sufficient to allow the voltinism of P. viteana to approach that simulated to occur in at the end of this century. The simulations based on different daily temperature ranges and mean temperature conditions revealed that, even when mean temperature decreased, larger daily temperature ranges could compensate the effect of decreasing mean temperature, resulting in a similar number of generations per year. These results confirmed that daily temperature range should be an important factor in modeling insect phenology and population dynamics. In chapter IV I considered to an epidemiological system and investigated if degree day models could predict West Nile virus (WNV) incidence dates in Pennsylvania. The original degree days model did not consider a temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation period or longevity changes in vector mosquitoes ( Culex spp.), and did not capture virus transmission period well in four locations (Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport) in Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2008. By treating decreasing the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) at the beginning of the season, and incorporating adult mosquito longevity a variable as well, model performance was increased significantly. I also demonstrated that mosquito species composition should be an important factor for predicting WNV transmission period. The calibrated models performed well to predict WNV emergence period in Pennsylvania, with a success rate of more than 70% compared to less than 30% in the uncalibrated model. In the successive research in chapter V I demonstrated that mean temperature alone did not provide enough information to compute degree day accumulation and predict disease transmission period well. I quantified WNV transmission period by comprehensively exploring combinations of changing daily temperature range and mean temperature in four locations: Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport in Pennsylvania. I investigated vector mosquito life history change according to these different climate change conditions. The results again showed that even when the mean temperatures remained the same, a large daily temperature variation results in more degree day accumulation and consequently a longer transmission period. Increasing mean temperature with increasing or decreasing the daily temperature range would yield earlier first incidences and later last incidences. I also demonstrated that increasing daily temperature range would impact disease transmission more dramatically in relatively cooler areas (Williamsport, Harrisburg, and Pittsburgh) than relatively warm areas (Philadelphia). These results showed how daily temperature range alters WNV epidemics quantitatively and confirmed that I need to consider daily temperature range in our research in addition to mean temperature.

TI  - Ecological adaptations and transcriptome evolution of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae
SP  - 209
AB  - Anopheles gambiae has adapted to flourish in spatially diverse ecological conditions, from the humid rainforests to arid Sahel savannas. Within a region, An. gambiae is capable of surviving considerable temporal fluctuations in rainfall and temperature. This extraordinary adaptive flexibility of An. gambiae is largely attributed to complex chromosomal inversion polymorphisms. In addition, An. gambiae is subject to an ongoing incipient speciation process that also appears strongly associated with adaptive phenotypic traits. A long-standing goal is to identify genomic regions/genes/pathways involved in both evolutionary processes. With the intent of exploring the genetic basis of adaptive phenotypes associated with both the nascent speciation process and chromosomal inversion polymorphisms, we focus on transcriptome evolution because there is increasing empirical support that gene regulation contributes to adaptive/species differences; and the lack of discrete phenotypic differences between M and S precludes using powerful quantitative techniques that require such a priori information (e.g., QTL mapping). Transcription profiles can unravel phenotypes not readily visible via these approaches, thereby providing novel insights into the divergence. Chapter 2 reports on the 2La chromosomal inversion, which is strongly linked to degree of aridity in Africa. Gene expression profiles were generated at three time points following acute heat exposure. In Chapter 3, global oligonucleotide arrays were employed to search for transcriptome variation at key developmental stages most likely associated with the speciation. Chapter 4 extended the virgin female time point to include six additional time points and corresponding mated females across a two hour window encompassing dusk. Ten candidate genes linked to olfaction were targeted. Because premating behavioral isolation involves the interaction between trait and preference in different sexes, corresponding reproductively active virgin male global expression was profiled in chapter 5. Chapter 6 explores the relationship between molecular form transcriptome variation and degree of swarm segregation in nuptial males and females from Mali and Burkina Faso. Chapter 7 focuses on the ecological segregation between M and S. Specifically, the divergence in larval breeding habitats in southern Cameroon, where M occupies polluted urbanized habitats. Transplantation experiments explored the genetic basis of M form larval tolerance to the environmental stressors in their habitats.

TI  - Melt Generation in Lithologically Heterogeneous Mantle Sources: Theory, Models and Applications to the North Atlantic Large Igneous Province
SP  - 429
AB  - The volumes and compositions of basalts generated by adiabatic decompression melting of the Earth’s mantle depend on mantle potential temperature (TP), upwelling rate and the fertility of the mantle source. Identifying the relative importance of these factors for basaltic melt generation in different tectonomagmatic environments requires the application of forward models accounting for melt generation in compositionally and lithologically heterogeneous, upwelling mantle sources. This dissertation addresses this fundamental problem and is organized into two parts. Part I includes the development of a new forward model that incorporates the effects of TP, lithologic heterogeneity and mantle flow on melting in different tectonic environments (Chapter 1), and specifically examines the origins of high productivity magmatism in the North Atlantic large igneous province (NAIP) (Chapter 2). In Chapter 1, I develop the forward polybaric melting model that simulates melting of a source composed of peridotite and pyroxenite by utilizing thermodynamic expressions for polybaric melt productivities for each source constrained by parameterizations of experiment data. Potential temperature, upwelling rate and source composition are linked by thermodynamic relations and fluid dynamics. A sensitivity analysis is undertaken to evaluate uncertainties in model input parameters (coefficient of thermal expansion, isobaric specific heat capacity, heats of fusion for peridotite and pyroxenite, and source density) on computed igneous crustal thickness and modeled trace element and radiogenic isotopic compositions of mantle melts. I apply the model to divergent (Iceland) and intraplate (Hawaii) settings. In Chapter 2, I examine in greater detail the factors responsible for mantle melting in the North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP) and conclude that, while the mantle source was (is) heterogeneous containing less than 8% pyroxenite, mantle temperatures 85 – 240ºC in excess of ambient mantle are required. These excess potential temperatures contribute to active upwelling, providing the principal mechanisms responsible for the high melt productivity in the region. Part II focuses on the petrogenesis of the Central East Greenland (CEG) flood basalts, which provide the most complete record of volcanism in the NAIP. Part II includes three chapters (Chapters 3 – 5). Chapter 3 presents new Sr, Nd, Hf and Pb isotope data for CEG plateau lavas and evaluates the effects of secondary alteration on lava compositions. This analysis forms the basis of assessing whether elements are disturbed by alteration and therefore untrustworthy in subsequent considerations of crustal contamination and mantle melting. Chapter 4 examines the role of crustal contamination in space and time within the CEG flood basalt province. Considerations of chemical and isotopic relationships among lavas and regional basement rocks permits identification and quantification of the extent of contamination of magmas by Archean granulite gneiss, Archean amphibolite gneiss, and basement modified by the Caledonian orogeny. These observations are considered in a regional context and related to the magmatic plumbing systems during continental rifting. Chapter 5 establishes the number, petrologic character and petrogenetic origins of the mantle sources sampled by CEG flood volcanism, as well as the conditions governing melt generation beneath the region. The range of uncontaminated lava compositions are shown to be derived from a mantle source containing subduction – modified Archean cratonic lithosphere and Proterozoic – Early Paleozoic mafic crust presumed to be remnants of Iapetus subduction. Forward melting modeling involving this heterogeneous source requires excess TP of up to 240 °C to explain the geochemistry of CEG basalts. Development of such high potential temperatures may be linked to arrival of the ancestral Iceland plume beneath the Pangean supercontinent in early Paleogene time, although parental melts for the CEG basalts appear to have their origin in the Pangean upper mantle.

TI  - Genetic architecture of phenotypic and transcriptional variation in salmon
SP  - 157
AB  - Understanding the genetic determinants of phenotypic variation is crucial for a predictive evolutionary theory. Although Fisher's fundamental theorem provides a simple quantitative framework for evolutionary processes, the underlying assumptions regarding the heritability and variability of traits and population structure can diverge from real systems drastically. Therefore, the genetic architecture of traits associated with fitness should be explored to verify the theory's relevance to evolutionary changes and its universality, but this isn't practiced much in natural systems. Pacific salmon provide an excellent model system to examine genetic architecture and variance structure in and among populations. Here, I analyzed trait inheritance in salmon, and characterized the underlying adaptive significance under different ecological scenarios. Using transcriptional traits, I examined the relationship between plasticity and genetic differentiation shaping salmon populations. I employed common garden rearing and factorial mating designs to evaluate the genetic architecture of traits under physiological stress (i.e. saltwater, temperature and immune) to explore phenotypic variance under different environments. In Chapter 2, I showed osmoregulation gene transcription diverged after anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were introduced to a landlocked lake, and non-additive inheritance of traits was common among diverging populations. In Chapter 3, the variation in innate immune response gene transcription was shown to be mediated by non-additive effects in farmed Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and the effect was elevated after the immune stimulation with Vibrio vaccine. In Chapter 4, significant maternal components in traits closely related to fitness confounded the differences observed among populations. Finally, in Chapter 5, I characterized the among-population variance structure associated with individual response to immune stimulation using a multigene microarray approach. Overall, my research suggests that transcription and phenotypic plasticity is different among salmon populations, can rapidly evolve, and that non-additive genetic effects in transcriptional and phenotypic variation is common in salmon. In general these results are important to question applicability of fundamental theorem for salmon populations, hence conservational strategies based on evolutionary concerns. Furthermore, it presents a framework of population differentiation in salmon based on modifications to physiological response. These two combined would help us to unravel how salmon populations are structured in space and time.

TI  - Molecular evolution and thermal adaptation
SP  - 129
AB  - In this thesis, we address problems in molecular evolution, thermal adaptation, and the kinetics of adaptation of bacteria and viruses to elevated environmental temperatures. We use a nearly neutral fitness model where the replication speed of an organism is proportional to the copy number of folded proteins. Our model reproduces the distribution of stabilities of natural proteins in excellent agreement with experiment. We find that species with high mutation rates tend to have less stable proteins compared to species with low mutation rate. We found that a broad distribution of protein stabilities observed in the model and in experiment is the key determinant of thermal response for viruses and bacteria. Our results explain most of the earlier experimental observations: striking asymmetry of thermal response curves, the absence of evolutionary trade-off which was expected but not found in experiments, correlation between denaturation temperature for several protein families and the Optimal Growth Temperature (OGT) of their carrier organisms, and proximity of bacterial or viral OGTs to their evolutionary temperatures. Our theory quantitatively and with high accuracy described thermal response curves for 35 bacterial species. The model also addresses the key to adaptation is in weak-link genes (WLG), which encode least thermodynamically stable essential proteins in the proteome. We observe, as in experiment, a two-stage adaptation process. The first stage is a Luria-Delbruck type of selection, whereby rare WLG alleles, whose proteins are more stable than WLG proteins of the majority of the population (either due to standing genetic variation or due to an early acquired mutation), rapidly rise to fixation. The second stage constitutes subsequent slow accumulation of mutations in an adapted population. As adaptation progresses, selection regime changes from positive to neutral: Selection coefficient of beneficial mutations scales as a negative power of number of generations. Diversity plays an important role in thermal adaptation: While monoclonal strains adapt via acquisition and rapid fixation of new early mutations, wild population adapt via standing genetic variations, and they are more robust against thermal shocks due to greater diversity within the initial population.

TI  - Genetic, individual, and group facilitation of disease resistance in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and two species of paper wasps (Polistes dominulus and P. Fuscatus)
SP  - 171
AB  - Social insects are remarkable for their extreme form of group living. This includes a reproductive division of labor, overlap of generations, and cooperative care for the brood. The global success of social insects suggests that the benefits of eusociality outweigh its costs. In this dissertation, I investigated how three species of social insects resist disease at multiple levels of biological organization. My co-authors and I first present a comprehensive review of what is known about how social insects resist disease, scaling up from genes to proteins and cells, to individual behavior to groups and populations. Next, I provide the first critical test of the 'haploid susceptibility hypothesis' using naturally occurring genetic misfits in Polistes dominulus populations. This hypothesis assumes that males are likely to have fewer disease resistance alleles than females in haplodiploid species, and that this disparity has shaped the evolution of social behavior. My co-authors and I show that this hypothesis is not a significant contributor to the evolution of social behavior in P. dominulus. Instead, I note strong ecological influences on immune function, including temporal-, sex-, and caste-related factors. Time of emergence and behavioral role are the best predictors of immune function in Polistes. I then scale up from individual genetics in paper wasps to group genetics in honey bee hives. Interestingly, phenoloxidase activity and encapsulation response are not influenced by colony-level genetic diversity. Therefore, the mechanistic explanation linking genetic diversity to prior observations of increased disease resistance in genetically diverse colonies remains elusive. A main theme throughout this work is the use of empirical methods to quantify invertebrate immune function. I report results from a set of experiments, performed with my co-authors, demonstrating the applicability of a novel method for assaying the invertebrate encapsulation response. This method uses a nylon monofilament coated with pathogen-associated membrane patterns (PAMPs). These implants, termed "PAMPlants", now allow researchers to investigate questions relating to how invertebrates mount an immune response against different classes of microbes. Following this, I then report results from experiments documenting how cellular and humoral immune function develops with honey bee ontogeny. I draw conclusions within the context of behavioral differences between life stages, and also differences in pathogen pressure across these stages. The final data chapter investigates a possible immune mechanism for the noted success of the P. dominulus invasion into North America from Europe and Northern Africa. My co-author and I compared multiple measures of immune function between P. dominulus and its sympatric, native congener P. fuscatus. Surprisingly, P. dominulus had lower immune function than P. fuscatus. I interpret these results within the context of the enemy-release hypothesis as a putative explanation for the success of this non-native population. My results present a comprehensive report of immune function in three species of social insects, and provide important insights into past, present, and future methods for testing immune function in these truly remarkable beasts.

TI  - Intra-specific variation across a small temperature difference in the spider Rabidosa rabida (Araneae: Lycosidae) from the mountians in Arkansas
SP  - 120
AB  - Temperature affects all levels of biological organization and ultimately affects multiple aspects of ecological performance and fitness. Generalist arthropod predators are ectothermic and are strongly affected by temperature in ways that are not fully understood. Descriptions of thermal ecology of important generalist arthropod predators are, therefore, essential pieces of information for studying ecology in changing thermal environments. Rabidosa rabida is a wolf spider that inhabits much of the eastern United States and plays an important role as a generalist predator of large herbivorous arthropods. This study makes the first description of the thermal ecology of R. rabida. A description of intra-specific variation in this spider and applications of this data to habitat selection for this generalist arthropod predator are also made. Descriptions of thermal preference, critical thermal maxima, and locomotor performance were made for spiders collected at four locations in the mountains of Arkansas which differed by less than three degrees. Comparisons of thermal ecology and other ecologically significant thermal performance measures, such as predation and immunity, were made between these populations to determine if intra-specific variation could be described and if small temperature differences would result in measureable differences in thermal response. Estimates of heritability were also made for size, sprint speed, and immunity measures to determine if variation found could be attributed to genetic factors or if environmental factors such as temperature could explain any variation observed. Carapace length differed between spiders from different mountains with spiders from Mt. Magazine having a greater CL. Body mass also differed between sexes and between spiders from different elevations with females and spiders from low elevation showing the greater body mass. Rabidosa rabida was found to have an acute thermal preference of 32.0 ± 0.011°C. Thermal preference differed between spiders from different mountains. The critical thermal maximum was estimated to be 43.52 ± 0.105°C. Thermal limits did not differ between mountain or elevation groups. Sprint speed was significantly affected by temperature and differed between spiders from different elevations with spiders from higher elevations showing a greater mean sprint speed. Comparisons with characteristics of insects using various thermal strategies showed that R. rabida is a thermal conformer and thermal generalist with moderate thermal sensitivity. Thermal sensitivity, which did not significantly differ between 5° intervals, was greatest at the thermal extremes and between 25° and 30°C for all but male spiders. Measures of prey capture showed an apparent increase in prey capture as temperature increased but the ability for statistical interpretation was limited. Immunity showed limited variation between spiders and no significant differences between spiders from different elevations or mountains. Heritability estimates for size, sprint speed, and immunity measures were low and not significantly different from zero. This first description of the thermal ecology and thermal performance in this large non web building spider gives insights into the thermal habitat selection of this animal. This spider showed a thermal preference suggesting that it can detect temperature differences and actively chooses to occupy one temperature over another. Thermal performance tests show that as temperature increases performance also increases. Survival may be negatively influenced by warmer temperatures especially during early instars and molting. The thermal sensitivity of this spider showed an apparent increase in the temperatures between 25° and 30°C which would suggest that if all other factors were the same then this spider should choose to inhabit temperatures in the low thirties similar to its thermal preference. In the field these spiders are found actively hunting in the low vegetation at night when temperatures are dropping from the 30°'s into the 20°'s and in an area where wind would have negative effects on body temperature and hydration. This suggests that other factors such as inter-specific interactions influence habitat choice in this spider.

TI  - Quantitative trait evolution in a changing environment in a seed beetle
AB  - During the last decades the climate has been changing more rapidly than in the preceding periods. This is for instance characterized by an increase in temperature. Interestingly, such changes in the environment are not necessarily constant over time as they often show high levels of fluctuation. Organisms are exposed to these changes and respond to them and a recent theoretical model predicts that fluctuations in the environment are important for populations’ response to climate change. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how populations respond to a changing environment, including fluctuations. My thesis is based on the previously mentioned theoretical model and I used a suite of laboratory experiments on the seed beetle Callsosobruchus maculatus, to test the model predictions in a quantitative genetic framework. First, I assessed the genetic architecture of several life history and morphological traits in order to verify that there is sufficient additive genetic variation for the population to respond to changes in the environment. Second, I tested the detailed model predictions explicitly, by investigating whether different types of environmental fluctuations matter for a population’s response. Third, I investigated changes in quantitative genetic variation after i) a rapid shift in temperature and ii) long term selection under increasing temperature including fluctuations. Fourth, I concentrated on sex differences in response to temperature, and finally, I assessed the relative importance of genetic and nongenetic inheritance for traits that differ in their plastic response to a change in the environment. I found that environmental fluctuations are highly important for a population’s response to environmental change. I could detect changes in a set of quantitative genetic parameters, suggesting that a population’s potential to respond to selection, environmental sensitivity and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity are affected by the selective past. I also found that sexes differ in additive genetic variation and plasticity and that parental effects may play an important role in the evolutionary process. Therefore, future studies would benefit greatly from considering details of the selective past and especially environmental fluctuations during attempts to predict how populations respond to a changing environment, particularly with regards to climate change.

TI  - Research of a predictive model of thickness of ring formation in oxidized pellet rotary kiln
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorWith the rapid development of steel industry in China, the demand of oxidized pellets grows rapidly. But the traditional pellet process - shaft furnace has the shortage of small yield productivity and poor adaptability of raw materials, which cannot meet the growing demand of blast furnace charge. Meanwhile, roasting machine belt needs high temperature resistant alloy steel, which means the process is unable widely to promote temporarily in China. Therefore, to develop the grate-kiln process with mature technology, high production and strong adaptability of raw materials, appears especially important. But the process has a problem of ring formation which brings great trouble to improve the production and quality of pellets. So it has very important practical significance to build a predictive model of ring formation to predict the ring forming behavior in oxidized pellet kiln, and to know the real-time influence of the site operation parameters on ring formation. It has important meaning to guide the instant operation on ring formation. A heat transfer model of rotary kiln was built in this paper which based on the cylinder of the heat conduction differential equation after analyzing the heat transfer process inside the oxidized pellets kiln. And the boundary conditions were established. The thermal physical properties of ring materials were researched for the first time, and the result showed that the thermal conductivity of ring object decreases with the increasing temperature. It provided reference for the subsequent mathematical simulation of oxidized pellet kiln. Based on the correspondence between the kiln outer wall temperature and ring formation, and combined with kiln shell heat transfer model, a model of thickness of ring formation in rotary kiln was built based on certain assumptions. The model was verified correct by comparing the simulation results with site testing results. Simulation software MATLAB was used to program the thickness model of ring formation. The simulation results showed the temperature distribution along the axis of inner wall, and the thickness distribution of ring formation in different position of the rotary kiln. The calculated results of model were showed by graphical display based on the powerful graphics capabilities of MATLAB. Also a GUI of the model was designed which allowed site operators to analyze the producing process conveniently by using the simulation results of the model. The growth rate of ring was analyzed and calculated by historical temperature data. And the rate was used to predict the growth situation of ring. The MATLAB simulation results showed that the ring formation had a linear growth, which was used to predict the growth time of ring. Comparing with historical data, the predictive results were verified correct, so that it provided basis for ring forming prediction, and achieved early warning as to achieve stable operation of site

AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorEnergy is an essential material basis for human survival and development. Over the entire history of mankind, each and every significant step in the progress of human civilization has been accompanied by energy innovations and substitutions. The development and utilization of energy has enormously boosted the development of the world economy and human society. China has set the goal of building a resource-conserving, environment-friendly society, and is endeavoring to coordinate energy development with environmental protection. It endeavors to make the two promote each other for sustainable development. Into the 21st century, China's PV market began to develop relatively fast driven by the government, and a lot of national plans have been implemented, such as the "Power Supply Project for Un-electrified Counties in Tibet", "China Brightness Program", "Brightness Program in Ali District, Tibet", "Township Electrification Program" and "non-electric power construction in the region", and etc. During the period from 9th "Five-Year Plan" to "11th "Five-Year Plan", several demonstration projects have been carried out, such as urban grid-connected photovoltaic power generation and large-scale desert plant grid integration. Light and heat resources in Wuwei is rich in solar radiation intensity, long sunshine hours, annual sunshine hours in 2570-3030.With the use of regional advantages, Wuwei get the big development in the solar in recent years. In December 2008, Wuwei and Da Tang jointly take the construction of the 11th"Five-Year Plan" National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program), which named MW-class desert grid a 0.5-megawatt photovoltaic power plant has been built to the grid. At present, Hua Dian, CECEP, Gansu Power Investment Group each began a 10-megawatt photovoltaic power generation project. License tenders in Liangzhou about 20 MW is under construction. Planning by 2015, solar photovoltaic power generation capacity will reach 1000 MW. The incentive policies of China's PV market mostly are subsidy policy. The initial PV market in China is the independent PV power in the area without electricity, built fully by the state investment; but because of the high cost of PV power generation and the lack of long-term incentive policies for the market, then the PV market is at a standstill, and even the "Renewable Energy Law" implemented since 2006 also failed to promote the formation of the Chinese PV market. In 2009, China began to implement the "solar BIPV demonstration projects" and "Golden sun demonstration projects," providing subsidies for the PV power generation system, officially launched the Chinese PV market. With the rapid development of solar energy industry, Wuwei uses its advantages in all aspects of solar energy, which will usher in new prosperity and

TI  - Establishment and main biological characterization of gynogenetic grass carp population
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe grass carp is one of an important fish cultured in china. However, farmed grass carp are readily susceptible to various kinds of diseases that cause high percentages of morbidity and mortality, leading to greatly reduced yields. Gynogenesis is considered to be an efficient way to rapidly establish pure line. Gynogenesis, in combination with selective breeding, has been suggested as a shortcut to produce clonal fish lines with desired characteristics, such as higher growth rates and disease resistance.The establishment of pure all-female groups of meiotic gynogenetic (meiG) and mitotic gynogenetic (mitG) grass carp should be a valuable contribution to both fish genetics and grass carp breeding. Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) eggs were first activated by UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (♀) × common carp (♂) and then duplicated by temperature shock (cold shock or heat shock). Different shock initiation time resulted in two types of diploid gynogenetic grass carp: meiG and mitG. The fertilization rate,hatching rate and survival rate of both gynogenetic fish was highly improved after optimizing gynogenetic technique. Over a five year period, a total of 17,170 meiG and 1,080 mitG fry were produced and 6,862 meiG and 372 mitG grass carp survived. Now two groups of gynogenetic fish in large scale had been successfully established. The main biological characteristics of gynogenetic grass carp were studied, and their growth, development process of their gonad were seriously observed for several years. The major results are as follows: 1. UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (♀) × common carp (♂) was first used for inducing gynogenesis in grass carp and showed high efficiency. The protocols for eggs duplication were optimized and high survival rate of both meitG and mitG were obtained. Over a five year period, both meiG and mitG group were successfully established in large scale. 2. The observation of early embryo development confirmed that haploid embryos with haploid symptoms were inviable, while diploid gynogenetic grass carp embryos possess of natural embryo development stages and morphological characteristics as normal diploids. Incubating time was influenced by hatching temperature. On the other hand, water dissolved oxygen affecting the hatching rate and survival rate of gynogenetic fish directly. 3. Gynogenetic grass carp had identical morphological characteristics as common grass carp. The size and morphological traits of red blood cells also similar in gynogenetic fish and common grass carp, which indicating that the gynogenetic fish were diploids same as common grass carp. It was confirmed by further chromosome examination of embryos and young gynogenetic fish. 4. Microsatellite DNA analysis indicated that the genome of gynogenetic fish were not contaminated by paternal genome, the genetic purity of mitG grass carp was higher than that of meiG grass carp, and both of which were significantly increased over that of common grass carp after one generation of gynogenesis. A special SCAR marker was successfully transferred from RAPD marker, which could be used for identify gynogenetic grass carp from common carp. 5. The growth rate polarized distinctively in gynogenetic grass carp group after 5 years track. Gonads observation showed that both meiG and mitG grass carp groups were 100% female and 88% of these showed normal ovary development. Thus, the sex determination mechanism in female grass carp was homogamety. The all-female gynogenesis larvae of grass carp were fed with food containing 17α-methyltes tosterone for 4 months. The histological observation results indicating that the inducing of sex-revesal may success. 6. A Foxl2 cDNA was cloned from meiG ovary by RT-PCR and subsequent RACE. Alignment of known Foxl2 sequences from vertebrates confirmed the conservation of the Foxl2. RT-PCR revealed that Foxl2 is expressed in the grass carp brain (B), pituitary (P), gill, and gonads (G), reflecting the involvement of Foxl2 in B-P-G axis. Large-scale scan in gynogenetic fish and common grass carp showed that the Foxl2 only express in ovary while not express in testis, which revealed en evident sexual dimorphic expression pattern in the gonads. This traits could be used for identify the sex of grass carp from molecular level. 7. The complete mitochondrial genomes of gynogenetic grass carp was successfully sequenced and analyzed. The results indicated that gynogenetic grass carp obeys the maternal inheritance rule, and the inheritance structure of their mitochondrial DNA is identical to that of common grass

TI  - On study of the mechantronic dynamic model in constant current saw and the mechanism of arc stability
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSubmerged arc welding (SAW) is a popular welding method used in many industrial fields because it has the property of high productivity. The technique of multi-electrode welding, or multi-wire welding, is commonly used in submerged welding processing. Multi-electrode welding can also be classified into two groups, single-power-supplied (SPS) multi-electrode welding and multi-power-supplied (MPS) multi-electrode welding. In SPS multi electrode welding system, the heat supplied from one single power, the total heat input being limited in a definite value, wires are used for heat distribution in welding processing. In MPS multi-electrode system, two or more welding arcs burning in one molten pool, the heat input is several times of single power supply. It greatly incases the welding productive because the amount of melting metal in a unit time is increased. In this paper, we refer to this kind of welding scheme as multi-electrode welding. In recent years, a new type of electronic controlled welding power supplies, switch-mode welding power is emerged and used in industrial field. The output character of this power can be well controlled ether in constant voltage (CV) mode or in constant current mode (CC). The dynamic model and the stability of welding arc under this power supply in submerged arc welding are studied in this paper. Generally, a submerged welding system consists of three parts, a power supply for heat input, a bogie for welding speed control, and a control unit for welding arc adjusting. In the welding processing, wire is burned in the arc, and is sent into the arc by the wire feeder at same time. A smooth welding seam could be obtained only if a balance were reached between the speed of wire burning and the speed of wire sending. In the period of arc initiation, a transient is existed from the time of arc igniting to the time of arc stable. Taking welding arc voltage as major a parameter, cooperated with power supply and wire feeder, an electron-mechanical dynamic model of submerged arc welding in constant current condition is established. Under this model, the balance relationship between wire burning and wire sending is depicted. A compound time constant, which is derived from control circuit, wire feeder, and welding arc, is obtained. It is the theoretical foundation for the further designing of numerical controller. The stability of the system is analyzed in S domain through Lap lace's transformation. Due to the defference of electronic poles in defferent power supplies and the electron-magnetic interference (EMI) in multi-electrode system, the isolation schemes among powers and the coordination method among arcs become the major problems which need to be solved in multi-electrode welding. According to the character and request above, optical isolation technique is used for the transmission of signals or instructions among equipments besides the traditional relay- and transformer-isolation schemes. The ability of anti-EMI of the system is increased. And it also enhances the adaptability and reduces the bulk of the system. Furthermore, the trend today goes towards numerical equipments in mechanical field. A task/job/procedure program structure for several devices working coordinately is reported in the paper. Under this structure, the method of numerical synchronization for several devices becomes easy and clear. Based on the theory, a module structured multi-electrode welding coordinate control circuit, which is placed on a 20cm*30cm printed circuit board (PCB), is designed. Two DC-DC converters, which derived from Buck converter but power ground and gate drive signals ground are common earthed, are designed on it. One is designed for the bogie speed control, and another is for the balance of welding arc and wire feeder control. The principle of a pulse width modulation (PWM) generator and its adjusting method based on integrated circuit SG3525 is reported. The method of the parameters selection of operation amplifier, estimate and design of time constant, are reported as well. Some of the specific questions, such as the method of series connection of several sub-systems, soft start, over current protection, and the prevention of wire inserting into the molten pool during wind up are discussed. According to the experimental results, the welding speeds reached to 1.4-2.0(m/min.) in double-wire welding, and to 2.5-2.8(m/min.) in three-wire welding. The results tally with the theoretical analysis, as well as the reported results in some related

TI  - Growth release determination and interpretation of korean pine in heilongjiang province, china
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorMixed broadleaf - Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forests are a major ecosystem of the Xiaoxing'an Mountains of northeast China. It is critical to better understand the disturbance regimes and growth dynamics of the main conifer species in these forests, especially in the context of global climate change. The objective of this study was to investigate timing of tree recruitment and forest gap formation using growth releases recorded in tree-ring series of Korean pine, and their responses to annual variation in temperature and precipitation. We sampled trees from three randomly selected stands in the experimental areas of three geographical positions different National Nature Reserve, which are respectively sitting in the most northern, central and southern border of the Heilongjiang Province. All Korean pine trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm in each plot were mapped and increment cores collected from each. All cores were dendrochronologically crossdated with a locally developed chronology and ring widths measured to the nearest 0.001 mm. After measuring, growth release events on each series were determined using the boundary line release criteria, which formulated according to the relationship between percent growth change and prior growth. The results showed that: due to the influence of the prior growth, percent growth change curves of each series were much stronger consistent than tree-ring widths curves. The peaks or valleys of the tree-ring widths curves were differ as peaks or valleys of the corresponding values of the percent growth change curves. In Heihe, almost all Korean pine series had more than one growth release event, with 2.75 average growth releases per tree, and 87.5% of the Korean pine series had at least one major release. The release events happened mainly in the year of the 1930-1960 and 1970-1990, which were coincided with the tree-ring widths changes. The main release periods of Mudanjiang were 1915-1940, 1960-1970 and 1990-2003, with 2.07 average growth releases per tree, and 82.8% of the Korean pine series had at least one major release. Samples collected from Yichun, no matter the total peak number, the peak number which reached the release boundaries or the release event numbers (last 5 or more than 5 years) are all slightly more than the number of the first two sampling points. Displayed in 297 total peaks, with 117 reached the release boundaries standard and 90 formed the release events (33 major releases and 57 moderate). 1910-1950 is the most significant release events period of the Yichun Korean pine, appeared 13 major releases and 23 moderate releases in total 25 samples. In addition, a more significant release period is 1840-1880, totally appeared 22 release events. 1960-1970 and 1980-1990 relatively less release events (7 and 9), but still occupied considerable proportions in the total release events number. Spatial distribution patterns of Korean pine trees indicated that forest gap opening due to a variety of mortality factors is likely the main reason for some tree growth releases in Heihe and Yichun, but not Mudangjiang. A comparison analysis between the percent tree growth and climate changes showed that the local temperature and precipitation could be another important factor causing growth releases for the three points, especially for growth releases that occurred synchronously between

TI  - Cold-adapted bacterium and winter wheat combined remediation of oil-polluted soil
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe traditional methods to treat oil polluted soils are expensive, and easily cause a large secondary pollution, while the existing single phytoremediation and microbial remediation both exist certain limitations, thus, as an environmental friendly method, it has important theoretical and practical significance on the use of plant - microbial combined remediation of oil contaminated soils. In order to explore the feasibility of the combined remediation of petroleum contaminated soil, this study focused on the combined remediation of petroleum contaminated soil by degrading bacterial and the winter wheat through indoor experiments and a field simulation trial, and to explore the optimum conditions of the combined remediation, the greenhouse pots experiments were conducted. Through indoor experiments, the effect of petroleum contaminated soil on growth of the winter wheat, degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon by the winter wheat and the degrading bacterial, and changes of catalase activity with time were studied. The results showed that, the winter wheat promoted the degradation of petroleum by the microorganisms. After combined remediation, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) disappeared from the rhizosphere soil faster than the non-rhizophere soil. The catalase activity increased after the combined remediation and there was positive relation between the catalase activity and the TPH removal. The combined remediation of oil-polluted soil by cold-adapted bacterial and winter wheat was studied in a field simulation trial, and the variation of the soil microbes, catalase activity, dehydrogenase activity were studied here. The results showed that, 73.29% and 55.26% of spiked petroleum hydrocarbons disappeared from the rhizosphere soil and non-rhizophere soil respectively. Since the over wintering stage, the degradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil is increasing, decreased in the ripe stage. And there were positive correlations among catalase activity,dehydrogenase activety,microbial counts and the degration efficiency of petroleum hydrocarbons. Studies have shown that the combined remediation technique of the oil polluted soil by winter wheat and cold-adapted baterial was effective and could be applied at room temperature and low temperature in situ remediation. Through greenhouse pots experiments, an orthogonal test method was employed here to study the optimum degration conditions of fixed degrading bacterial and the winter wheat. This orthogonal experiment selected four influencing factors: oil content, amount of bacteria, soil water content and fertilizer. The results showed that in different stages, the optimum degration conditions were different. Oil content and the amount of bacterial were the two biggest factors that influenced the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The impact of fertilizers on the degradation rate increased with time, and water content on the degradation rate decreased with

TI  - The research of new hg/ as vapor generation technique and its application in the atomic spectrometry
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorA review on the theory and application of vapor generation/electrochemical hydride generation(VG/ECHG) sampling technique used in Atomic Spectrum(AS) was introduced in detail in this article. Determination of metal elements in environmental samples with Atomic Spectrum has been a very excellent analytical method. However, many analytical workers pay more attention to sample on-line, miniature apparatus and environment-friendly in actual works. In the article the experimental apparatus were set up ; the design theory was discussed ; the effect of detecting conditions were studied; the sample pretreatment techniques were investigated and analytical methods were developed. In the chapter one, the various vapor sampling techniques that applied to AS including cold vapor generation(CVG), hydride generation(HG) and volatilization generation were introduced firstly. Then, the atomic mechanism of chemical hydride generation(CHG)/ECHG, possible interferences and eliminations, the design of electrolysis cell, the choice of electrode material and electrolyte, etc. were discussed. Finally, the improvement and application of CHG/ECHG technique in AS were described. In the chapter two, a novel miniature CVG-AFS system was developed using amorphous Teflon AF-2400 tube as the gas-liquid separator and detection cell for the determination of Hg in tobacco, based on the Teflon AF-2400 tube's excellent gas transport behavior and high UV transparence. At the same time, the mechanization of design and gas permeation were discussed in detail. Under the optimal conditions, the detection limit was 0.02 μg/L, and relative standard deviation ( RSD ) was 3.3% for eleven consecutive measurements of 0.50 μg/L Hg standard solution. The novel system showed the advantages of micro-scale, low sample consumption and high sensitivity. The method had been successfully used in the determination of Hg in tobacco sample with recoveries of 97% 102%. In the chapter three, solid polymer electrolyte hydride generation technology (SPE-HG) for metal elements determination was first applied in AS analysis. A new SPE-HG cell, mainly composed of three components was laboratory manufactured and employed for detecting As in tobacco samples by coupling to AFS. A corrosion- resisting Ti mesh modified by Ir was chosen as anode material which could lengthen the cell's using life; high porous graphite felt with high hydrogen overvoltage was used as cathode, which enhanced the productivity of AsH3; Nafion®117 membrane as the ion exchange membrane and close contaction between electrodes with membrane reduced the power efficiency. Water as an alternative anolyte was first used in the SPE-HG cell. The entire arrangement was fastened with four clamps of C type at four different directions. So the new system has advangtages of low-cost, long-life, easy-assembly and environment friendly. It was successful to detect As in tobacco by coupling the new cell to Atomic Fluorescence Spectrum with high

TI  - Ecology and life history of a deepwater notothenid, dissostichus eleginoides smitt 1989, around the falkland islands, sw atlantic ocean
AB  - The aim of this research was to gain a better understanding of the ecology and life history of the deepwater notothenid, Dissostichus eleginoides, on the Patagonian Shelf. Archival tagging revealed strong site fidelity of adult toothfish with the majority of fish remaining within 50km of release. Furthermore depth data revealed three behavioural patterns showing feeding, seasonal and spawning activities. The trophic ecology of five notothenioids was studied, examining resource utilisation and niche separation on the Falkland’s shelf. Spatial, ontogenic and seasonal variations in the parasite fauna for juvenile D. eleginoides are described and potential species for use as biological tags to study toothfish population structure are suggested. Validated age readings gave maximum estimated ages of 35 (L = 214.3cm) and 26 years (L = 126.3cm) for females and males respectively and reasons for this sexual dimorphism are discussed. Comparisons of otolith transition zones and growth rates from different regions shows toothfish have adapted their life history traits dependant on their environmental and hydrological surroundings, with populations in warmer areas growing quicker than those in cooler waters. Reproduction in toothfish is discontinuous and group synchronous and final spawning was found to occur in batches. Toothfish predominantly spawn only in one region around the Falklands, on the Burdwood Bank, mainly during July/August. Evidence of skipped spawning was identified indicating that not all fish spawn annually and this aspect is discussed in terms of body condition, periodic strong recruitment and the lack of large scale migrations of adult toothfish. Toothfish around the Falklands have a higher fecundity compared to other regions, a potential adaption to living north of the polar front. This new information on age, growth, reproduction and movements of toothfish, combined with its role in the Patagonian shelf and slope ecosystems, is vital for accurate stock assessment and hence sustainable fisheries management.

TI  - Integrated assessment of sustainable biogas technology options
SP  - 1
AB  - In the last 5 years the number of biogas plants in Germany has increased by about 90% (2,300 plants) at an average capacity of 500KWel.  In 2009, biogas plants, with installed capacity of approximately 1,900 MWel supplied about 110 TWh (>1.6% electricity of demand). Biogas utilisation also accounted for reductions of about 5.54 and 1.01-1.34 million tonnes of CO2 associated with electricity and heat generation, respectively.  The quoted figures correspond to utilisation of just 10% of the inherent potential. Biogas is arguably a more versatile renewable energy source (cf. wind and solar energy), due to its determinate energy value and ease of storage.  It can be used directly for heat and electricity generation, and as substitute for natural gas and other fossil fuel applications, while utilisation of the digestate as fertiliser can reduce mineral fertilizer inputs to further mitigate GHG emissions.  The aim of this study was to carry out An Integrated Assessment of Sustainable Biogas Technology Options, from feedstock supply logistics to energy utility (electricity and heat), and the utilization/disposal of the spent digestate.  The specific objectives were: (i) To assess the prospects for expanded utilization of biogas in Germany; (ii) To evaluate the energy efficiency of various biogas production and utilization pathways; and (iii) To determine the environmental impacts of biogas deployment by Life Cycle Assessment of multiple production and utilization pathways.  The associated analyses were conducted for defined case scenarios for single feedstock digestion and multiple feedstock co-digestion in small-scale (<500 kWel) and large-scale (≥500kWel) biogas plants, coupled with selected biogas utilization pathways, and digestate management strategies.

TI  - Heterogeneous gold, palladium and copper based catalysts for liquid phase oxidation of methane
SP  - 1
AB  - The direct liquid phase oxidation of methane at relatively mild reaction conditions over Au based supported catalysts is discussed. The hydrogen peroxide was used as oxidant and it was introduced either as a co-reactant or by generating in-situ using H2 and O2 gases. Au-Pd supported nanoparticles was shown to capable in oxidising methane giving high selectivity to methanol especially in the reaction carried out with hydrogen peroxide generated using in-situ approach. The activity and selectivity of the catalysts were found to be dependent on the reaction conditions employed. Factors such as oxidant concentration, temperature, reaction time, methane pressure, catalyst mass had significant effects on the catalyst activity and selectivity. A synergistic effect of Au and Pd was observed in these studies. The Au-Pd catalyst with the presence of PdO (Pd2+) on the surface having bigger particle size was preferred than smaller particles with the presence of palladium in metallic state. Modification of the catalyst has been carried out by depositing copper on Au-Pd supported on TiO2 and in this way the oxygenate productivity and methanol selectivity was improved. It was suggested in this study that copper would be responsible for enhancing the formation of methyl hydroperoxide species. Moreover, copper was assumed to block the non-selective sites for hydrogen peroxide decomposition and hydrogenation by disrupting the surface structure of Au-Pd alloy. At the same time, the active sites (Au-Pd alloy) responsible for selective formation of methanol were maintained. In conclusion, a combination of catalyst evaluation and characterisation data gave structure activity relationships for the series of catalysts tested especially on methane oxidation reactions.

TI  - Multidisciplinary appraisal of the effectiveness of customary marine tenure for coral reef finfish fisheries management in nggela (solomon islands)
SP  - 1
AB  - The failure of centralised fisheries management systems to prevent the overexploitation of coral reef resources has led many scholars and conservation practitioners to promote the use of customary marine tenure (CMT) as an alternative devolved means of fisheries management. The effectiveness of CMT for fisheries management is debated; some scholars argue that CMT is embedded within particular historical, socio-economic and political contexts and that unless it evolves to changing circumstances, its effectiveness for fisheries management will wane under external influences and changing exploitation patterns. Each CMT regime is unique; hence its response to changing circumstances may vary. A better understanding of the circumstances under which a CMT regime is likely to succeed is important if it is to be effectively used for fisheries management. This research is posited on the DPSIR (Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) model and employs multidisciplinary methods to investigate the effectiveness of CMT for reef finfish fisheries management. The aims of this thesis are: (1) To investigate the role of markets and subsistence as driving factors for fishing; (2) To investigate fisher spatial allocation of fishing, methods and target taxa (as proxies for pressure and impact); (3) contribute to the biological knowledge of a prominent vulnerable species (Plectropomus leopardus) by investigating aspects of its demography and reproduction (as a proxy for state); and (4) Investigate relationships between the Nggela CMT governance system and modern governance system (as a proxy for response), to improve understanding of how this knowledge may be applied to enhance small-scale fisheries management. The role of markets and subsistence as driving (D) factors for fishing was investigated using the sustainable livelihoods approach (SLA). Ninety three (43 from the western zone and 50 from the eastern zone) household surveys were conducted in 10 (5 from the eastern zone and 5 from the western zone) randomly selected villages in Nggela to determine the contribution of different livelihood activities to fisher livelihoods. The reason for comparing the eastern and western zone was to determine the role of available natural land capital as one contributing factor (besides markets) to fishing drivers. Quantitative data generated from the household surveys were analysed using the statistical package SPSS. Additional key informant interviews to generate qualitative data to support the quantitative data were also conducted. Spatial allocation of fishing and target taxa was investigated using household surveys (the same household survey mentioned above but with questions to address the issue of spatial allocation and fishing methods used), participative fishing with fishers to confirm spatial allocation of fishing and fishing methods employed and recording of landings data to determine the types of fish taxa targeted. One of the initial aims of studies on P. leopardus was to compare the age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus between CMT areas and offshore sub-tidal areas, the hypothesis being that if CMT was effective agebased demographic parameters would reveal the non vulnerability of P. leopardus in CMT areas. Such a comparison was not possible as only 4 specimens were obtained from inshore CMT areas compared to 116 specimens from offshore sub-tidal reefs. To determine the age-based demographic parameters of Plectropomus leopardus, fish total lengths (mm) and otoliths of fish were collected in the field, this was followed by otolith annuli counts of ages (tagged to a particular fish of certain total length) at the laboratory. A von Bertalanffy growth curve was then fitted to the fish total length data and to the age data to determine asymptotic length, Brody growth coefficient and theoretical age at length zero. Total mortality rate was determined by generating catch curves where the frequency of fish in each age class was regressed against age. Longevity was determined by calculating the mean age of 10% of the oldest individuals. Demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were also compared to those of Australian locations to determine variations in age-based demography. Data analysis of P. leopardus data was done using the statistical software R and Microsoft Excel 2003. Reproductive aspects of P. leopardus were determined from the fish gonads collected from the field. Fish gonads were used to determine different sexual reproductive stages. Data on the different sexual reproductive stages was used to determine sexual maturity and sex change. The relationship between CMT governance and modern governance and how they may be combined for an effective reef finfish fisheries management was investigated using literature research, key informant interviews and dynamite fisher interviews. Investigations of livelihoods show that Nggela fishers were engaged in more than one livelihood activity for their livelihoods. Subsistence gardening was the most important livelihood activity. While finfish was important for subsistence purposes, accessible markets and the role of middlemen in the villages made it especially important for income generation. A comparison of the role of fishing between eastern and western zone showed that available natural land capital was also an important driver for fishing; fishing was higher in the western zone where there was a narrow natural land capital. Fisher perceptions indicate a declining trend in fisheries resource abundances within CMT areas; such decline has resulted in changes in the spatial allocation of fishing with a shift in fishing to offshore sub tidal reefs. Although some spatial closures were observed, fishing within the CMT areas is flexible. Three MPA’s currently existed in West Nggela and fishing prohibitions within the areas were observed mainly because people thought that the MPA’s were underscored by the government. Line fishing from dugout canoes remains the main method of fishing. Median trophic level of fish catch was between 2 - 3.84 while median standard length of catch was between 19 - 24 cm. Age-based demographic studies show that the Brody growth coefficient of Nggela P. leopardus was 0.13 yr-1, longevity was 12.9 years, maximum age was 15 years and mortality rate was 0.22% yr-1. Female sexual maturity of Nggela P. leopardus began at 2 years of age with 50% sexual maturity achieved at 3.22 years. Sexual transition from female to male began at 3 - 10 years of age with 50% sex change achieved at 11 years. Mature female to male ratio was 3:1. The age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were similar to those in Swain and Lizard Island in Australia. For Swain reef, growth coefficient was 0.17 yr-1, longevity was 10.1 years, maximum age was 14 years and mortality rate was 0.39% yr-1. For Lizard Island, growth coefficient was 0.26 yr-1, longevity was 7.2 years, maximum age was 10 years and mortality rate was 0.59% yr-1. Age-based demographic parameters of P. leopardus in Nggela were different to locations in Western Australia – Scott and Abrolhos reefs. For Scott reef, growth coefficient was 0.42 yr-1, longevity was 6.4 years, mortality rate was 0.30% yr-1 while the maximum age was 8 years. For Abrohlos reef growth coefficient was 0.08 yr-1, longevity was 13 years, mortality rate was 0.24% yr-1 and maximum age was 18 years. Sea temperature may be one contributing factor to regional variations in age-based demographic parameters. The current CMT governance system has undergone changes which has rendered it ineffective as a coercive force for reef finfish fisheries management. While CMT is recognised by the modern governance system through National legislations, necessary ordinances at the provincial level are absent which prevent the effective use of CMT for fisheries management. For CMT to be effective it requires empowerment at the provincial government level.

TI  - Demand side management strategies to regulate electricity in oman
SP  - 1
AB  - Demand Side Management (DSM) is the planning and implementation of strategies intended to encourage electricity consumers to reduce energy demand, improve energy efficiency, shift time of usage and promote the use of renewable energy based distributed generation system. It is a close socio- economic link between the utility and consumer for mutually benefiting to both. The research undertaken rivets on the potential use of DSM strategies to regulate electrical energy demand and mitigate carbon emissions in Oman. The main objective of this research is to examine the DSM based activities and policy options which could achieve significant reduction in electricity demand at the distribution network connected to the residential sector. It is revealed that temperature is the major environmental factor while use of air- conditioner units and practice of subsidised tariffs are epic centres of lavish electricity consumption at residential sector in Oman. This study applies a scenario based approach to identify viable energy efficiency and load reduction methods. The technical analysis comprises of bottom-up approach considering operational, behavioural and environmental factors to simulate the hourly load profile. Household load patterns are developed to identify and implement a range of DSM technological activities. An analytical model is set up to control the household load with minimal compromise of end-user satisfaction. Obtained results show that application of DSM strategies could contribute the substantial reduction in peak load and total energy demand. Studies carried out on renewable energy based hybrid power system manifest the viability and cost effectiveness of distributed generation to mitigate carbon emissions and peak load demand. The results of technical analysis are used to explicate the essential policy priorities underpinning the sustainable development of energy sector and mitigate the environmental issues. This comprehensive study provides the base to recommend the incentive based DSM programmes, smart metering, legal frame work for energy efficiency standards and labelling, investment subsidies to encourage renewable energy and legislation for distributed generation. The research has explored the benefits of DSM programmes along with barriers and challenges to implement the appropriate policies.

TI  - Analyses of adaptive evolution and recombination rate variation in Drosophila
SP  - 176
AB  - The neutral theory of molecular evolution provides a framework to understand the molecular basis of evolutionary change. The fundamental principle of the neutral theory is that the majority of mutations observed within populations as well as between species is neutral. More importantly, the theoretical framework that the neutral theory provides not only includes mutation and random genetic drift but also two other important parameters in evolution: selection and recombination. Molecular evolutionary analyses allow us to estimate the magnitude and consequences of these parameters in natural populations. The work presented in this thesis investigates two aspects affecting evolutionary change: adaptation and recombination. In the second and third chapter, adaptive changes associated with a new habitat are investigated in Drosophila santomea, a species which belongs to the melanogaster subgroup and which is endemic to the volcanic island of São Tomé. In its present habitat, D. santomea inhabits a colder, darker and more humid environment compared with its sister species, Drosophila yakuba, which is distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Comparisons of genome wide changes in expression between these species indicate that a group of genes involved in detection of external stimuli could be providing selective advantages to D. santomea in its new environment. In the second chapter, the coding sequences of these genes were obtained in D. santomea and analyzed to assess signatures of selection at the level of amino acid sequence. The analysis reveals that along with changes in the gene expression, protein coding sequences are evolving at a faster rate in D. santomea when compared with D. yakuba, likely providing evidence for an adaptive advantage to D. santomea when colonizing its new environment. The third chapter describes the study of the effect of cold temperature on the fitness of both species. The results indicate that D. santomea tolerates cold temperature better than D. yakuba, with different stages of the life cycle showing more pronounced effects. The observed reduction in fitness at low temperatures strongly supports the hypothesis that temperature is a key factor delimiting the distribution of these two species in their current habitats. Recombination is an important evolutionary parameter that influences the amount of variation present within a species and the potential to adapt to biotic/abiotic changes. As such, it is a key parameter in population genetics models of selection. To date, however, no study has been able to measure the variation in recombination with high resolution (ideally at the level of single genes) while also capturing variation in recombination rates within a species. Further, there is a need to understand how the two outcomes of meiotic recombination (cross-over and gene conversion) are distributed across genomes. The fourth chapter describes the direct measurement of ultra-high-resolution variation in recombination rate throughout the D. melanogaster genome by massively genotyping the products of 5860 female meiosis. These maps reveal that cross-over rates are sharply reduced near telomeres and centromeres, with no cross-over activity in the small fourth chromosome. Importantly, we detect genomic regions with almost undetectable cross-over events embedded in large regions with high cross-over rates. Gene conversion rates are more uniformly distributed across the genome than cross-over rates and detectable even in regions with no evidence of cross-over activity. Finally, the study of intraspecific variation on cross-over rates reveals many regions with significant excess of variation thus uncovering the presence of modifiers of recombination segregating with D. melanogaster. The results from this analysis underscore the need to incorporate both intraspecific variation in cross-over rates as well as gene conversion rates into a new generation of population genetics models.

TI  - Genetic Basis of Phenotypic Plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 210
AB  - The ability to produce distinct phenotypes under different environmental conditions is referred to as phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity is advantageous in that it allows organisms to adapt rapidly to environmental changes. However, excessive plasticity caused by dramatic environmental perturbations in otherwise robust traits can lead to undesirable changes in development and behaviors, and increase susceptibility to diseases, which leads to reduction in population fitness. Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity will greatly advance our understanding of adaptive evolution as well as the nature of constraints on adaptation. In this dissertation I focus on environmental effects on regulation of transcript abundance in Drosophila melanogaster, as the transcriptome directly reflects genome regulation and is organized as dynamic regulatory networks that are influenced by and interact with the environment. I also associate environmental variation at the transcript level with environmental variation of different fitness traits, in order to understand the environmental impact of genetic regulation on organismal fitness. Chemosensation is an essential modality for evaluating the environment, is implicated in guiding social interactions, and also affects longevity. The chemosensory system of Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best studied sensory systems. Chemosensation is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor genes. I constructed customized cDNA microarrays representing all classical Or-type odorant receptors, gustatory receptors and odorant binding protein genes of Drosophila. I investigated their expression patterns under different developmental stages, physiological status and social conditions, using a laboratory inbred line. I found that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered cytologically in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Furthermore, exposure of flies only to odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes. These transcripts are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. Finally, clustering analysis revealed small covariant modules of chemoreceptor transcripts suggesting fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to environmental and physiological conditions. To expand the scope of my study on a genome-wide scale I constructed a synthetic outbred population using 40 inbred lines derived from a natural population with sequenced genomes and published transcriptome data and exposed this population to 20 different rearing conditions. I found that over 15% of the transcriptome is highly responsive to environmental changes while the majority of transcripts show robust expression that are consistent across conditions. Among the environmentally sensitive transcripts, 1249 are highly significant in the ANOVA for treatment. These transcripts are associated with response to heat shock, xenobiotic and energy metabolism, immune defense, proteolysis, transcription, and also include non-coding RNAs and computationally predicted transcripts of unknown function. They responded differentially to different environments and could be grouped in 103 highly correlated covariant modules. Environmentally sensitive transcripts associated with different organismal traits have distinct regulatory patterns, and are different from those associated with the same traits across the 40 genotypes under a standard rearing environment. I identified an additional 970 environmentally sensitive transcripts that were not detected by ANOVA due to high within-treatment variation. These transcripts have little genetic variation, show extensive sexual dimorphism, and gene ontology analysis shows that they are enriched for reproduction and post-mating behaviors. Comparisons of sequence conservation across 12 Drosophila species shows that environmentally sensitive genes are more rapidly evolving than those with robust expression under different environments.

TI  - Investigations of carbon-hydrogen activation and the conversion of methanol to triptane
SP  - 341
AB  - Broadly speaking, this thesis represents research towards understanding the mechanisms and important species related to small molecule conversion, namely methane to methanol and methanol to higher hydrocarbons. The first section is on understanding the catalytic formation of methanol from methane, with specific interest in using gold (Au). While this transformation is known to occur catalytically, very little is understood about how it happens. To study this reaction, well-defined Au-complexes were synthesized and reactions relevant to the possible catalytic cycles were examined. In doing so, the first simple Au(III)-monoalkyl complex was generated and characterized: (Idipp)AuI 2Me, where Idipp = 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene). Kinetics experiments demonstrated that the complex reductively eliminates methyl iodide, which is relevant to the functionalization step in CH activation. At low concentrations of iodide, the reductive elimination happens faster, from an unobserved 3-coordinate intermediate. However, at high iodide concentrations, the pathway is still consistent with reductive elimination, but from a 5-coordinate intermediate. This is in contrast to the related platinum-system, as well as to density functional theory calculations done on the Au-system. The second section studies the C-H activation step alone by close examination of the microscopic reverse: protonation of a metal-alkyl. It had previously been noted that the observed kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were unusually high for the protonolysis of a few Pd complexes and one Pt complex. It was hypothesized that these high KIEs and involvement of quantum mechanical tunneling may indicate a change in the mechanism of the protonolysis reaction, from protonation at the metal center and reductive coupling to direct protonation of the M-Me bond. The experiments described here were designed to explicitly test this theory and demonstrated that no correlation can be made between mechanism and tunneling. The third section is focused on the study of the conversion of methanol to highly branched alkanes that make good fuel additives, namely 2,2,3-trimethylbutane (triptane), amidst other alkanes, olefins, and aromatics. Catalyzed by ZnI 2 or InI3 at high temperatures, the reaction is hydrogen deficient: aromatics are formed as unsaturated by-products necessary for alkane generation. While the product distributions are somewhat different for the two different catalysts, the general mechanism is the same. While typical InI3 reactions generate more alkanes, more aromatics, and fewer olefins than ZnI2 reactions, longer reaction times and higher temperatures make the ZnI2 reaction look like the InI3 profile. Furthermore, InI3 can activate alkanes; it was found that InI 3 can "upgrade" other alkanes with methanol. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of 2,3-dimethylbutane and methanol can be converted into triptane with good selectivity and little aromatic formation; ZnI2 can carry out similar chemistry at higher temperatures. Quantification of the iodine-containing products in each reaction mixture was attempted because of its relevance to the system's industrial viability and found that these concentrations were significantly higher than would be acceptable in an industrial setting.

TI  - Using remote sensing to create indicators of ecosystem variability for a semi-arid savanna watershed in the Kavango-Zambezi region of Southern Africa
SP  - 187
AB  - This dissertation addresses changes in land and resource availability occurring as a result of climate, water variability and changes in fire regimes in a semi-arid savanna region in Southern Africa. The research combines geospatial analyses of climatological and hydrologic data and various remotely-sensed datasets to create measures of ecosystem variability and adaptability to natural and anthropogenic changes in sensitive ecosystems. The study area is the Chobe River Basin (CRB), a watershed shared between Botswana and Namibia situated at the heart of one of the world.s largest transfrontier conservation areas, where different land-use management strategies and economic policies affect both the ecosystem and the livelihoods support system differentially. The southern African savanna is a highly variable environment and people have adapted to its harshness through the generations. However, in light of past and ongoing environmental changes, their ability to adapt may become threatened. By mapping and then analyzing the spatial and temporal variability of two important factors, namely flooding and fires, in conjunction with indices of vegetation health and productivity, the findings of this research can ultimately contribute to enhancing our understanding of local adaptation mechanisms to future environmental change. This is the first reconstruction of the spatial and temporal patterns of inundation for the last 25 years in the CRB, a transboundary basin with an unusual hydrologic regime and an important water resource for both human and wildlife populations. In the context of increasing temperatures, decreasing precipitation trends and increasing frequencies and intensities of El Niño episodes in southern Africa (Boko et al., 2007), I also investigated changes in fire incidences and marked shifts in fire seasonality both within and outside of protected areas of central Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA TFCA). These changes are likely to have a series of strong impacts on other components of fire regimes in semi-arid ecosystems that will, in turn, affect their ecology, structure, and function. This dissertation contributes to the field of land use and land change science by proposing a novel spatial coincidence analysis framework for analyzing how the interand intra-annual extents of inundation and fire are correlated with both annual patterns of vegetation productivity and multi-date changes in vegetation productivity.

TI  - First-principles studies of complex hydrides for lithium-ion battery and hydrogen storage applications
SP  - 159
AB  - We employ density functional theory in a computational study of two energy storage systems. In the first, we explore the thermodynamic viability of light metal hydrides as a high capacity Li-ion battery negative electrode. Given a set of solid-state and gas-phase reactants, we have determined the phase diagram in the Li-Mg-B-N-H system in the grand canonical ensemble as a function of lithium electrochemical potential. We present computational results for several new conversion reactions with predicted capacities between 2400 and 4000 mAhg-1 that are thermodynamically favorable and that do not involve gas evolution. We provide experimental evidence for the reaction pathway on delithiation for the compound Li4BN3H10 and compare with our theoretical prediction. The maximum volume increase for these materials on lithium insertion is significantly smaller than that for Si, whose 400% expansion hinders its cyclability. In the second study, we attempt to gain understanding of recent experimental results of lithium borohydride nanoconfined in highly ordered nanoporous carbon. The carbon environment is modeled as a single sheet of graphene, and adsorption energies are calculated for nanoparticles of the constituent phases of LiBH 4 desorption processes (LiBH4, LiH, lithium and boron). We find good agreement with previous studies of a single lithium atom adsorbed onto graphene. We predict that infiltrated LiBH4 will decompose such that boron is trapped in carbon vacancies, and that the resulting boron doping is required to achieve negative wetting energies for the remaining LiBH4. Desorption enthalpies are found to increase with shrinking cluster sizes, suggesting that the observed lowering of desorption temperatures is a kinetic effect although interactions with the carbon surface itself are predicted to have an overall effect of decreasing the desorption enthalpy .

TI  - Landscape genetics, hybridization and rapid evolution in the biological control agent, Longitarsus jacobaeae
SP  - 104
AB  - An Italian biotype of the ragwort flea beetle, Longitarsus jacobaeae Waterhouse (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), originating from a Mediterranean climate has been the most effective biological control agent against the invasive tansy ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris) in Pacific coastal areas of the U.S. The spread of tansy ragwort into new environments, including high-elevation areas in northern Idaho and northeastern Montana, has prompted the re-introduction of a cold-adapted biotype of the flea beetle from Switzerland. While the biotypes are morphologically identical they differ in the phenologies, presumably as adaptation to different climatic conditions in their native range. Establishment patterns of the two beetle biotypes across the Pacific Northwest were investigated using molecular tools. The Italian biotype was found in a wide range of environments including those at higher elevations, characterized by continental, winter-cold climates. Hybrid individuals between Italian and Swiss beetles were also detected at a study site in Montana. Reciprocal transplant and common garden field and laboratory experiments were used to test whether Italian beetles at a high-elevation location on Mt. Hood, Oregon, underwent rapid evolution in response to the significantly reduced growing season at that location. The results indicate that the beetles at Mt. Hood genetically adapted to the cooler conditions in less than 30 years, with shifts in life history and morphological traits that conform to predictions based on models, empirical studies and the phenology of the known cold-adapted Swiss beetles. Finally, to assess the potential impact of hybridization on biological control of tansy ragwort, phenological and fitness characteristics of F1 and F2 reciprocal hybrids between Italian and Swiss L. jacobaeae were measured in the laboratory. Most measured traits showed intermediate values for the two hybrid lineages with some maternal effects. Most importantly, both hybrid lineages had a higher fitness than the Italian parent, or in one hybrid lineage both parents.

TI  - Role of Eukaryotic Sel-1 like Repeat Containing Genes in Helicobacter pylori Evolution and Pathogenesis
SP  - 121
AB  - Background. Helicobacter pylori ( Hp) establishes life-long gastric infection in billions of humans, and is often responsible for diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. Cumulative actions of genetic drift and natural selection over several millennia sculpted the present Hp population structure, which is characterized by extreme genetic diversity and striking geographic clustering of genotypes. Natural selection is more commonly imprinted in DNA sequences of Hp proteins that interact with host components; however, in most instances biological relevance of selection during Hp infection remains unknown. Here, I attempted to elucidate the consequence of natural selection in two different contexts: (1) on the preservation of duplicated genes in Hp genome; and (2) lineage-specific adaptive evolution in Hp virulence protein HepC. Principle findings. I characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of paralogs, hcpC and hcpG, which belong to the Hp Sel1-like gene family. hcpG genomic analyses identified three distinct states in natural Hp populations, whereby hcpG was either deleted, pseudogenized or encoded highly polymorphic alleles. In contrast, full-length hcpC alleles were conserved in all genomes. Although positive selection was detected in the phylogenies of hcpG and hcpC indicating that both genes had evolved under pressure to diversify, the intensity of selection was much stronger on hcpG than hcpC. The contribution of hcpC to Hp fitness, in the AGS cell culture infection model, was significantly greater than hcpG; however, both genes together demonstrated an additive effect on Hp fitness during infection (24 hrs p.i.: SΔhcpC = 0.264 vs. SΔhcpG = 0.074, P<0.01; SΔhcpC or S ΔhcpG vs. SΔhcpC::DhcpG = 0.431, P<0.01, where S=coefficient of median fitness reduction). Furthermore, HcpC was necessary and sufficient for optimal surface expression of Heat-Shock Protein B (HspB), a major contributor to Hp virulence, specifically during infection, and functionally compensated for the lack of HcpG. In contrast, HcpG was only required for optimal HspB expression during early infection, and was unable to compensate for the lack of HcpC during later phases. Thus, a stable, genetically redundant, epistatic and overlapping yet non-reciprocal functional relationship emerged between hcpC and hcpG: natural selection favored retention of the ancestral hcpC function and sub-functionalization by fixation of loss-of-function mutations in hcpG following its origin in the Hp genome. Earlier studies from my lab showed that the HepC protein, which also belongs to Hp Sel1-like gene family, interacted specifically with human cytoskeletal protein Ezrin, and that lineage-specific positive selection changed HepC-Ezrin interaction affinity. How might alterations in HepC-Ezrin interaction affect progression of Hp infection? As a first step I established that HepC was indeed biologically relevant and contributed significantly to Hp fitness during infection (P=0.05). Furthermore, PCR-array analyses suggested that identical molecules of the human cytoskeletal pathway were differentially up or down-regulated by genetically diverse Hp isolates during infection, and that HepC likely inhibited key components of the human cytoskeletal machinery during infection. Thus HepC (possibly via its interaction with Ezrin) likely contributes a key regulatory role that might determine the pace and trajectory of Hp infection. Conclusion. Collectively, my thesis proposes a novel mechanism through which natural selection favors the emergence of a stable state of genetic redundancy among duplicated genes, hcpC an hcpG that contribute significantly to Hp infection. This work also establishes a framework within which to further clarify the role of lineage-specific selection in fine-tuning Hp-host interactions.

TI  - Electricity Restructuring and Economic Education
SP  - 1
AB  - My dissertation research concentrates on the causes, motivations, and results of electricity restructuring, and research on the effectiveness of economic teaching and retention. The first chapter looks at motivations for electricity restructuring in the United States in terms of the Interest Group and Public Interest setting. The second chapter investigates results of electricity restructuring in terms of generating efficiency. The final chapter discusses whether exposing undergraduate students to economics outside of a typical classroom setting increases their retention of classroom taught models. For the first chapter of my dissertation we investigate motivations for electricity restructuring in the United States. Beginning in 1992, with the passage of the Energy Policy Act, measures to promote competition were undertaken in the electricity industry. From 1996 to 2002, 18 states followed suit, with restructuring programs targeted at improving efficiency through the use of increased wholesale trading, abolishment of 'cost of service' regulation, measures to open electricity production to non-utility entities, and the unbundling of transmission and distribution. Theory suggests that the initiatives promoted by these states would expose electricity generation to competitive forces that should increase both productive and dynamic efficiency, thus leading to lower comparative energy prices. The purpose of this chapter is to examine whether deregulation was brought about due to the Public Interest theory (that regulatory changes are undertaken to benefit society) or the Interest Group theory (that groups that hope to gain from deregulation lobby for regulatory changes). I focus on the period from 1995-2006 to investigate this question. All 50 states and the District of Columbia are included. The observational unit is the state year. Hazard models are employed to investigate the question. Results indicate no evidence for the public interest theory, and strong evidence of the interest group theory. I find that a stronger presence of industrial customers in terms of MWh purchased by the average customer implying a greater probability of restructuring. A stronger political influence of residential customers also is associated with a greater chance of restructuring; controlling for other variables and residential price, an increase in median income of $1000 (and thus more ability to lobby) increases the probability restructuring of by between eleven and 28 percent. In the second chapter we investigate the effects of market restructuring initiatives that introduced competition into the United States electricity industry on the thermal efficiency of electricity generation. An empirical model is estimated on annual data for over 950 plants from 1996 to 2006. Model estimates show that restructuring increased the efficiency of investor-owned plants by about 13 percent and that these gains stem from organizational and technological changes within the plant. Instrumental variable approaches indicate that estimates may be lower bounds of efficiency gains. Although not directly targeted by restructuring initiatives, I also find similar efficiency effects for municipality-owned plants. This result suggests that the benefits from restructuring have spilled over to public electricity generation. In addition particular attention was paid to the definition of a restructured electricity market, with alternative measure of restructuring employed as robustness checks. Lastly this improvement in efficiency translates into a substantial reduction in carbon emissions equivalent to taking approximately ten million cars off the road in 2006. For the final chapter of my dissertation we look at the effect of having students read and respond to articles regarding economic events on the learning of economic theory in both Intermediate Microeconomics and Intermediate Macroeconomics. We find that having students apply theoretical material to real world situations has spillover effects into the learning of theoretical material itself. By assigning articles and measuring performance on midterm exams in four Intermediate Theory courses during the 2007-08 academic year, results indicate that each additional article a student completed resulted in an improvement of approximately one percentage point on a given midterm exam. This effect grew to three percentage points per article completed on the middle of three midterms where we could ensure that both "finish everything early" students and "procrastinate as long as possible" students were represented.

TI  - The effect of mate choice on offspring phenotype and performance in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
SP  - 92
AB  - Captive breeding is essential for salmon aquaculture and stock enhancement programs, but captive breeding may lead to genetic bottlenecks, inbreeding, and domestication selection. To evaluate the potential for incorporating mate choice into commercial and conservation salmon breeding programs, I measured the effects of mate choice on offspring phenotype. Semi-natural spawning channels were used to compare mate-choice and randomly mated (hatchery) fish for performance and morphological traits. Channel-spawned fish were out-performed by their hatchery counterparts in survival and body size; both genetic and environmental effects contributed to these differences. However, channel-spawned fish had significantly more additive genetic variance for performance traits. Gene transcription of hatchery-bred and channel-spawned fish were compared using microarray analysis after a temperature stress. Few genes showed differential expression; however, overall transcriptional variance was lower in the channel-spawned fish. Mate choice should be included in rearing programs to increase the viability and adaptive potential of captive fish.

TI  - Adaptation at the Range Edge and the Causes of Range Limits in Mimulus laciniatus: The Roles of Gene Flow and Selection
SP  - 141
AB  - Species range limits are paradoxically viewed as either diversifying areas, where niche evolution occurs due to adaptations in novel environments, or as fragile and depauperate sinks, where adaptation is stymied by maladaptive gene flow from central populations. Many studies have described individual components of these scenarios that lend support to both viewpoints. This study seeks to simultaneously examine major hypothesized components (gene flow, selection, and the ecological gradient) for understanding population differentiation at range limits and the effects of gene flow on these dynamics. The first study was is a review of the literature on the evolution and ecology of species range limits. Species range limits involve many aspects of evolution and ecology, from species distribution and abundance to the evolution of niches. Theory suggests myriad processes by which range limits arise, including competitive exclusion, Allee effects, and gene swamping; however, most models remain empirically untested. Range limits are correlated with a number of abiotic and biotic factors, but further experimentation is needed to understand underlying mechanisms. Range edges are characterized by increased genetic isolation, genetic differentiation, and variability in individual and population performance, but evidence for decreased abundance and fitness is lacking. Evolution of range limits is understudied in natural systems; in particular, the role of gene flow in shaping range limits is unknown. Biological invasions and rapid distribution shifts caused by climate change represent large-scale experiments on the underlying dynamics of range limits. A better fusion of experimentation and theory will advance our understanding of the causes of range limits. The second study was a test of the role of gene flow on adaptation using experimental breeding in the annual plant, Mimulus laciniatus, at its warm range edge. M. laciniatus inhabits open, rocky seeps between 760 – 3,270 m and is endemic to the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. Replicate populations, including replicate edge populations, were sampled along three elevation-based transects across the species range. Plants from all populations were grown in growth chambers for one generation to reduce among-family maternal effects. Gene flow was experimentally simulated by producing crosses within and between warm-limit populations as well as crosses between warmlimit and central range populations. Offspring from these crosses were sown into a common garden at the warm-edge species range limit where lifetime reproductive success was measured. Gene flow, regardless of range location, increased emergence at the range limit, but increased lifetime fitness occurred only when pollen originated from another warm-limit population. We found benefits of gene flow among populations, especially beneficial gene flow between populations occupying the same range limit. Our results emphasize the overlooked importance of gene flow among populations occurring near the same range limit and highlight the potential for prescriptive gene flow as a conservation option for populations at risk from climate change. In the third study, field surveys and genetic markers were used to test established predictions that edges are more isolated and differentiated (“isolated limits hypothesis”) and to place these findings in the context of theory on constraints to adaptation at range limits. In general, there was no pattern of change in population size, but plant density was greater towards margins. No consistent changes in microsatellite diversity was found between the range center and its limits, but there was a reduction in allelic richness in the most peripheral populations, perhaps signaling a step pattern caused by isolation or abrupt environmental changes at range limits. Mean genetic divergence did not increase significantly towards limits, whereas inbreeding increased gradually across the entire species range, from low to high elevation limits. There was little evidence for reduced gene flow at edges as estimated from graph theory analysis. Gene flow appears to be greater among populations inhabiting similar elevations. Vicariance, potentially driven through environmentally mediated selection, was evident across the elevation gradient, even within the same watershed. Depending on the analysis employed (i.e. using continuous or categorical measures of peripherality), one can find support for or against the isolated limits hypothesis. Adaptive constraints at range limits in this system may be due to limited genetic variation at both edges, but are not likely to be due to directional, swamping gene flow from central populations. The results presented in this dissertation confirm theoretical expectations that gene flow plays a key role in determining the performance of individuals at range limits. Moreover, we have supplied new evidence, from experiments and molecular genetic analyses, that the role of gene flow can switch depending on the environmental sources and destinations of migration. Adaptation across a strong environmental gradient is potentially maintained by preventing maladaptive gene flow through isolation between elevations. Conversely, gene flow among populations inhabiting similar environments at the range margin can provide adaptive genetic variation.

TI  - Genetic and phenotypic variation in resource acquisition and allocation: Testing a fundamental model for life-history evolution
SP  - 198
AB  - One of the major goals of research in evolutionary biology is explaining the biological diversity of organismal life histories. One major explanation of this diversity is that limited resources acquired by an organism must be allocated to various life processes, leading to trade-offs between these processes. In this dissertation, I use a model system—the trade-off between flight capability and reproduction in wing dimorphic insects—to investigate variation in the acquisition of resources and its subsequent allocation to competing processes. I showed that the pattern of allocation varies in response to temperature in the water strider, Aquarius remigis and that this response has the potential to evolve. In addition, I used a quantitative genetic simulation model to show that the optimal allocation strategy depends on the predictability of resource levels across time. Specifically, this model predicts completely different responses of allocation to resource level variation in environments with low versus high predictability of resource levels across time. Combining physiological assays with a quantitative genetic breeding experiment, I measured genetic and phenotypic variation in acquisition and allocation in and across several different resource environments in the wing dimorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus. I found a significant genetic variance for both acquisition and allocation, but I also found that independent evolution in different resource environments is constrained. I show that when allocation is measured independently of acquisition, there is evidence for the trade-off even when it may be obscured by variance in acquisition when measured only as the correlation between functions. Using this data set, I also tested the assumptions and predictions of a theoretical model (the Y model) that predicts patterns of variation in trade-offs. An assumption of the Y model, that acquisition and allocation will be independent of one another, was not supported. However, despite this result, I found strong support for the predictions of the Y model in this system, demonstrating the Y model is robust to violations of the assumption of independence. This study is the first to use estimates of acquisition and allocation to directly test the Y model.

TI  - Exogenous correlates of migration, spawning, egg deposition and egg mortality in the lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)
SP  - 176
AB  - Understanding patterns of migration, the timing of reproduction, breeding site selection and the sources and magnitude of early life mortality provides a unique perspective into exogenous regimes that influence patterns in recruitment as well as those leading to the evolution of important and adaptive life history traits. Unfortunately, such knowledge of how migratory patterns and reproductive behaviors, the consistency of reproductive events and the time/location of reproduction relates to exogenous variables is largely lacking for many species, especially long-lived iteroparous vertebrates. Further, associations between habitat variables and patterns in the occurrence of early life stages, quantitative estimates of mortality, and the sources of loss are relatively unknown. In order to address these uncertainties, I used tagging data from a long-term lake sturgeon monitoring program (2000-2008) established in the Black River, MI as well as experimental manipulations and laboratory studies to: (1) quantify relationships between migration patterns and spawning behaviors with exogenous variables, (2) estimate the consistency (i.e., repeatability) for individual spawning events across years, (3) assess whether stream covariates were predictive of spawning site selection, egg deposition and survival during incubation in natural settings and (4) quantify the magnitude, sources and the abiotic and biotic conditions (e.g., substrate size, predator density and size) that influence egg mortality. Migratory activity (i.e., the daily number of adults entering the river) and spawning activity (i.e., the daily number of adults collected at upstream spawning locations) were found to be significantly associated with exogenous variables including daily photoperiod, water temperature, river discharge and the lunar cycle. However, the relative importance of variables interacted in different ways at different sequences in migration continuum (i.e., river entry, upstream movement, entry to spawning locations). Individual male and female lake sturgeon were also found to be highly repeatable in their choices of spawning time and spawning location (i.e., upstream vs. downstream preference). Egg deposition in natural stream settings was spatially explicit (i.e., patchy) and patterns were non-randomly and significantly associated with stream covariates including substrate size and water velocity across all sampled locations. Although egg mortality was consistent between sites over three days (70% mortality rate), environmental covariates, particularly substrate size, were predictive of mortality rates. Finally, egg mortality was high (91%) and quite variable (75-97%) across treatment groups in experimental settings and the relative magnitude of mortality sources varied significantly across simulated conditions, further suggesting strong relationships with the ecological features eggs experience naturally during incubation and survival. Developmental mortality (i.e., mortality due to abnormal egg development) was the major source of loss (84%) followed by predation (16%). However, egg mortality due to predation was shown to be high in laboratory experiments (80% after 24 hrs) with approximately 17-104 eggs consumed on average per predator. The highest levels of mortality were observed in treatments with high predator density and little habitat complexity. Information provided has been largely unknown and will be valuable in the ongoing restoration efforts for this unique and imperiled migratory fish.

TI  - Species interactions in a warming climate: Examining the direct and indirect effects of climate change on New England grassland food webs
SP  - 112
AB  - Global climate is predicted to change significantly during the next century. Effects of climate change are already evident as shifts in the geographic distribution of species and altered species phenology and life-history. However, predicting the particular fate of species in food webs is difficult because the net effects of climate change result from multiple interacting species responding to multiple changes within their environment. My research contributes to our understanding of climate change effects on species through a series of experiments that revealed the mechanisms by which climate warming alters food web interactions in a grassland community comprised of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores and spider predators. Pisaurina mira spiders are indirect keystone predators that, when present, cause grasshoppers to shift from a grass-based diet to an herb-based diet. Consequently, P. mira has a positive indirect effect on grass biomass and a negative indirect effect on herb biomass. Synthesis of data spanning 15 years revealed that the magnitude of the top-down effect increased with warning. This happened because warming had no affect on grasshopper location but caused P. mira to seek thermal refuge lower in the plant canopy. Thus, by decreasing the degree of overlap between predator and prey, warming decreased predation risk and allowed grasshoppers to increase daily feeding time on herbs. A second spider predator, Phidippus rimator, cohabits these grassland communities by occupying positions lower in the plant canopy, spatially segregated from P. mira. Experimental warming forced these two spider predators to interact within the lower plant canopy, resulting in intraguild predation by P. mira and the local extinction of P. rimator. The effects of climate change on food webs may be reduced if species respond to warming via phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary responses. I tested this prediction by examining P. mira spiders along a 4.8°C temperature gradient and found that spiders from warm study sites had higher tolerance to warming, which allowed them to remain high in the plant canopy and precluded warming from increasing top-down effects. Thus, this dissertation not only identified a mechanism by which warming can alter species interactions, but also demonstrated that species responses to chronic climate change may mitigate some of the effects of warming on food webs.

TI  - Examining genetic diversity, outbreeding depression, and local adaptation in a native fish reintroduction program
SP  - 128
AB  - Reintroductions are a common approach for preserving intraspecific biodiversity in fragmented landscapes; however, reintroduced populations are often smaller and more geographically isolated than native populations. Reintroductions may therefore exacerbate the reduction in genetic variability initially caused by population fragmentation due to the small effective population size of the reintroduced populations. Mixing genetically divergent sources is assumed to alleviate this issue by increasing genetic diversity, but the effects on genetic diversity are often not monitored and there are potential negative tradeoffs for mixing genetically distinct sources. I examined the consequences of mixed-source reintroductions on the ancestral composition, genetic variation and fitness of a small stream fish, the slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), from three source populations at nine reintroduction sites in southeast Minnesota. I used microsatellite markers to evaluate allelic richness and heterozygosity in the reintroduced populations relative to computer simulated expectations. I then inferred the fitness of each crosstype in the reintroduced populations by comparing their overall persistence, growth rates, and relative body conditions. Finally, I modeled the response of fitness related variables in the reintroduced populations to variation in habitat using a combination of regression and ordination methods. Ancestry analysis revealed that one of the three sources had more ancestors than the other two sources at most reintroduction sites. Sculpins in reintroduced populations exhibited higher levels of heterozygosity and allelic richness than the sources, but only slightly higher than the most genetically diverse source population. Simulations of maximum genetic variation indicated only a modest expected increase over the most diverse source. Growth rate, body size, and relative body condition suggest significantly reduced fitness in second generation hybrids. I detected evidence of local adaptation in the source populations based on greater predicted fitness for each source in its respective habitat. This local adaptation is strongly associated with a gradient in winter water temperatures. My study indicates that using more than one source for reintroductions may not substantially enhance genetic diversity. Furthermore, using multiple sources risks disruption of important adaptations and may cause outbreeding depression. Future reintroductions may be improved by evaluating the potential for local adaptation in ongoing reintroduction programs.

TI  - Identifying barriers to successful establishment of post-fire seeding in the Great Basin
SP  - 126
AB  - The shift of Great Basin ecosystems from diverse shrub-grass communities to near monocultures of annual grasses has altered ecosystems, caused more frequent and intense fires, and led to an increased demand for plant material that can restore altered landscapes back to complex, diverse systems. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in Nevada currently spends millions of dollars through the Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation (ES&R) program each year to re-seed land affected by fire. Seeds used for revegetation face many barriers that often prevent their successful establishment in this semi-arid environment including precipitation and temperature limitation, competition with invasive species, and soil type. Field surveys were done to monitor revegetation patterns between years and across aspects at five fire sites in Elko County, NV. A novel common garden experiment was conducted to determine what plants traits increase establishment success in invaded, post-fire field sites. We collected seeds from drill seeded populations of Elymus elymoides ssp. californicus (Toe Jam Creek bottlebrush squirreltail) at two fire locations in Elko County, NV. Seeds were planted in a common garden environment, where we compared the phenology, size, and reproduction of surviving plants to those of the original restoration material. In our field survey study, we found that vegetation structure within a site changed significantly in the short distance separating flat, north and south facing aspects; Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) was more likely to establish on south aspects, residual grasses were more likely to remain on north aspects, and seeded perennial grasses were more likely to establish on flat areas. Over time, the density of B. tectorum and non-seeded perennial grasses and forbs increased, whereas the density of seeded perennial grasses and forbs decreased. We found that for both seeded and residual perennial grass, plant density in 2007 was a good predictor of the plant density in 2009. The density of B. tectorum in 2007 also predicted the density of B. tectorum in 2009, but not as strongly as perennial species. In our common garden experiment, plants grown from the original restoration material were larger, produced larger and more seeds, and produced seeds later in the season, while plants grown from material that successfully established at the restoration sites were smaller, produced smaller and fewer seeds, and produced them earlier. Differences in seed size were observed at the family level and persisted in the common garden environment through the next generation, indicating that seed size is likely a genetic, rather than maternal environment, effect. These results were consistent across two different field sites. Natural selection, rather than genetic drift, is the most likely explanation for trait shifts observed in established seed material, and these results indicate that smaller plants may be better adapted for establishment in arid environments. Our results suggest that altering current monitoring and seed production techniques may increase restoration success in the Great Basin. Modifying management objectives, seed mixes, and seeding efforts for slope-aspect and pre-fire site conditions may result in more cost effective and successful restoration. Restoration practices may also be improved if plant developers select for traits that perform well at restoration sites, rather than in controlled, production environments.

TI  - Climate Change: The Synergistic Impacts of Elevated pCO2 and Temperature on the Early Development of Oysters
SP  - 277
AB  - Throughout the Earth's history climate change has led to a proliferation and disappearance of species thus playing a major role in shaping the structure of marine ecosystems. Over the next century, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels will cause a rise in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) in the surface ocean leading to a reduction in surface ocean pH from 8.1 to 7.7 units and a reduction in the concentration of surface ocean carbonate ions (in a process known as 'ocean acidification') vital in the construction of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) shells and skeletons. At the same time, this rise in atmospheric CO2 levels will lead to an increase in sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). Of growing concern are the potentially serious implications that ocean acidification and rising SSTs may have on marine organisms and ecosystems and the potential risk to marine aquaculture internationally. Recent studies, which have mimicked ocean acidification, have reported adverse consequences of elevated pCO2, including reduced calcification and growth, and increased rates of abnormality and mortality in larvae and adults of a range of marine organisms. Yet, we know comparatively little of the synergistic consequences of elevated pCO2 and temperature nor the potential for species to acclimate through genetic adaptation, at the population and ecosystem level. This lack of knowledge limits our ability to create models that accurately predict the consequences of future climate change. Among the organisms most likely to be affected in an acidifying and warming ocean are marine calcifying organisms which construct shells and skeletons of CaCO3. Studies on these organisms, to date, have focused predominately on adults, with comparatively few considering the sensitive early life history stages. This study compared the synergistic effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature on the early life history stages of two ecologically and economically important oysters: the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata and the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Gametes, embryos, larvae and spat were exposed to four pCO2 (375, 600, 750, 1000 ppm) and four temperature (18, 22, 26, 30 °C) levels in acute exposure experiments. At elevated pCO2 and suboptimal temperatures there was a reduction in the fertilisation success of gametes, a reduction in the development of embryos and size of larvae and spat and an increase in abnormal morphology of larvae. These effects varied between species with S. glomerata having greater sensitivity than C. gigas. Combined, elevations in pCO2 of 750-1000 ppm and a temperature of 30 °C resulted in 100% mortality of D-veliger larvae of S. glomerata. In contrast, the same pCO2 and temperature combination resulted in only 26% mortality of D-veliger larvae of C. gigas. A comparison between two commonly used methods for manipulating the seawater carbonate system (HCl?acidification and CO2?acidification) showed that there was no significant difference in the responses of S. glomerata and C. gigas to the two methods. This indicates that both HCl acidification and CO2 acidification are adequate methods for determining the effects of elevated pCO2 for these species.

TI  - Stduy of the preparation of magnesium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate whiskers from boron slurry
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorBoron slurry is one of main waste in boron industry. With the development of boron industry and the growing demand of borax and boric acid in china, the dumping of boron slurry also increases with years, which not only engrosses a great deal of the soil, but also produces severe contamination to environment. Boron slurry is a rich source of magnesium. Usually, the content of MgO in boron slurry exceeds 30%. The massive dumping of boron also makes a large waste of the magnesium resource. So looking for suitable method for recycling and utilizing magnesium in boron slurry can not only solve environment pollution problems but also make good use of magnesium resource and gain tremendous economic benefit. In this thesis, the recovery and utilization of magnesium in boron slurry was researched, and a new method of leaching magnesium from boron slurry was developed, which had a large handling capacity, simple process and lower cost. Then magnesium sulfate products such as fertilizer grade magnesium sulfate, technical-grade magnesium sulfate and magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate (MHSH) whiskers were prepared. The concrete research contents are as follows. (1).New process of leaching magnesium from boron slurry was researched. The process conditions of leaching magnesium by heap leaching method and pond leaching method had been researched. The result shown that pond leaching method excelled the heap leaching method, which had higher leaching rate of magnesium from boron slurry and milder reaction rate. The optimal conditions of leaching Magnesium were concluded as follow: the concentration of sulfuric acid is about 14%, the amount of sulfuric acid is 110% of the theoretical value; leaching time is about 5 days. (2).Magnesium sulfate products such as fertilizer grade magnesium sulfate and technical-grade magnesium sulfate were prepared. The leaching solution made from boron slurry contained some impurities such as iron, manganese, aluminium and so on. The magnesium sulfate obtained without purification contained 15.24% of MgO and 32.72% of SO3, which had met the demand of magnesium sulfate fertilizer. Using ammonium peroxydisulfate and light-magnesia as purifying auxiliaries, magnesium sulfate obtained after purification excelled the first-grade product of technical-grade magnesium sulfate, what's more, the content of iron and manganese impurities were both under 5 ppm, which had met the requirement of Analytical reagent standard. (3).The chemical reaction system and process conditions of MHSH whiskers were researched. Using the self-made high purity magnesium sulfate as raw mterial, MHSH whiskers were synthesized via a hydrothermal method at. The influential factors of magnesium hydroxide sulfate hydrate crystal growth, such as alkali source, reactants concentration, reactants proportion, hydrothermal temperature, reaction time, and so on, had been researched. And the best reaction system of MHSH whiskers preparation-magnesium sulfate and light-magnesia, was selected through experiments. The optimal conditions were: the concentration of magnesium sulfate in the slurry is 0.60mol/L, the reactants proportion is n(MgSO4): n(MgO)=2: 1, the hydrothermal temperature is 180℃, and the reaction time is 6h.

TI  - Identification and fermentation of antagonistic bacterium against ralstonia solanacearum
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe prevention and control of tomato bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a world-wide difficult problem. The objective of this experiment was to screen and identify antagonistic bacteria from tomato rhizospheric soil against R.solanacearum (mainly pathogenic strains SST-Y and G2M1.70), optimize fermentation conditions of antagonistic strains, and illuminate characteristics of antagonistic substances produced by antagonistic strains, and testify the effects of them against R.solanacearum by pot experiment. In this study, antagonistic bacteria against R.solanacearum were screened by the plate culture method. Tomato rhizopheric soil was randomly taken from the depth of 0cm to 20 cm, mixed and plated with gradient dilution. 284 strains were isolated, and 33 strains have the effects against Ralstonia solanacearum. After further screening by dotting and agar block method, 4 strains, YB1, YB6, YB22 and YB70, were selected. The strain YB6 suppressed the growth of R.solanacearum with the inhibition zone above 17mm. Only the strain YB6 had stable antagonistic effects after continuous 10 generations, and was selected as the objective of the following experiments. The strain was identified as Arthrobacter by traditional identification, members of which widely inhabit in soil, and are scarcely reported as antagonistic bacteria. The composition of culture media and fermentation conditions of YB6 were optimized with orthogonal test. The optimal combination of fermentation were as follows: the carbon source with sucrose at a concentration of 1.5%, the nitrogen sources with peptone and (NH4)2SO4 at concentrations of 1.0%,0.3%, respectively, the initial pH at 9.0, the inoculum concentration 3%, and shaker revolution 100 r/min, incubation temperature 30 Under the optimal conditions, the inhibition zone of the strain against SST-Y and G2M1.70 increased by 76.72%, 81.14%, respectively. In the stability test, the strain showed low stability to tested chemical agents, and super acid, super base, and above 1.5 mg/mL concentration of protease inactivated the strain. The strain was sensitive to heat, 60 over the loss of antimicrobial activity, but showed stability to UV 5 h and light 35000 L. The bacterium liquid and the fermentation filtrate of the strain YB6 were stored at 4 and room temperature, respectively. It was found that the inhibition activity of both the bacteria liquid and the fermentation filtrate was higher when stored at room temperature than at 4 , and the inhibition activity of the bacterium liquid was higher than that of the fermentation filtrate. In the production experiment of solid inoculum, the adsporption effect of organic carrier(Organic fertilizer, Corn flour, Peanut meal, peatmoss, Rice stems powder, Rice bran ) was better than that of inorganic carrier(Activated carbon, vermiculite ), and maize flour as the carrier of the strain showed highest adsorption activity, survival rate and inhibition activity. The pot experiment showed that the inhibition activity was highest by the dipping inoculum method in the period of transplanting, and the biocontrol rate reached 65.0%. The antimicrobial range test revealed that the strain showed inhibition activity against all of the eight tested pathogenic strains(Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn, Ustilago scitaminea Syd., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Botrytis cinerea Pers., Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense, Xanthomonas compeatris pv. Oryzicola, Magnaportheoryzea), especially to the sugarcane smut and the wheat scab, indicating that the strain is valuable in the development of biocontrol

TI  - Studies on the surface ultrastructure and their growth development of necrophagous fly species
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorForensic entomology is the interdiscipline that uses insects and other arthropods in estimating when, where, and why the death happened. The succession of arthropods, morphological changes, and the development stages of the necroghagous flies were often useful to determine the time of death. The infering of the place of death are based mainly on insect geographic range and suitable place. The insect species on cropse could give scientific evidence to the removing of cropse. Qualitative determination of toxic substances and drugs could add information to the analysis of both the cause of death and place of cadaver deposited, and could also be used to investigate the effects of such substances on insect development for the forensic post-mortem interval (PMI) estimates through necroghagous insect development analysis. The results are as follows: In order to accurately determine the death time, the community composition and succession of necroghagous flies and the development stages of the necroghagous flies were investigated in Guangzhou. Important necrophagous fly specie Boettcherisca peregrine, Synthesiomyia nudiseta, Hemipyrellia ligurriens, Achoetandrus rufifacies were selected as experimental material. The development of Boettcherisca peregrine, Synthesiomyia nudiseta, Hemipyrellia ligurriens, Achoetandrus rufifacies under different temperature condition also studied. This article related to the aspects of ultrastructural morphology of four necrophagous fly species and their developmental duration. The paper describes the immature stages of four flies found to in dead animals body in Guangzhou. Eggs, all larval instars, and pupa were studied and their significant morphological features are described and photoed. The immature stage morphology is observated, and key morphology were extracted from all larval instars and puparia. The taxonomic of the morphological features and biological significance to larvae are discussed. The properties such as the surface texture of eggs, the incubative micropyle, the median area, and the hatching pleats could be used to distinguish different kinds of eggs of necroghagous flies. The anterior spiracle, posterior spiracles, mouthhook and prothorax anterior spines band could be used to distinguish different larva of the necroghagous flies more accurately. The connection between the development time of the necroghagous flies and the daily indicator of the body length, body width, and body weight were obtained through culturing four kinds of necroghagous flies in constant temperature. The results indicate that body length and width of the larva are in accord with the cubic curvilinear equation: Y=b0+b1T+b2T2+b3T3, 'Y' represents body length, width or weight, 'T' represents the development time. The pertinence of the fitted curve is remarkable(R2>0.9,p<0.05) and the curve could be used by the legal medical experts to infer the time interval after

TI  - Mechanisms of malathion resistance in sitobion avenae
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) has affect on wheat yield and quality, wheat aphid is one of the most important pests on wheat, almost distributed in the major wheat producing area of the world, the wheat aphid not only suck the juice, but also is major media which spread the virus and disease of wheat. It has strong fecundity and short life cycle, so the wheat aphid has high frequency in population. Currently pesticides was used to control the wheat aphid, because of chemicals was used in large areas for a long time and its unique biological characteristics, the resistance of wheat aphid has been widely reported as a major pest control problem. Malathion was used on grain aphid (Sitobion avenae)for resistance selection in the laboratory, meanwhile the anti-elimination was used on sensitivity, two strain were obtained after resistance selection of 40 generation and susceptible strain selection of 3 generation, also do research on the cross-resistance spectrum of resistant strains was also determined. Esterase specific activity and kinetic constants of malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were tested with α-NA as the substrate, Glutathione transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were also tested. The synergy of PBO, TPP, DEM and DEF to malathion-resistant and susceptible strains was studied. The mechanism of resistance on Malathion in grain aphid was ascertained through biochemical properties and synergist experiments. Malathion-resistant strain was selected using population selection method in laboratory, the resistance ration was increased to 32.66-fold in the malathion-resistant strain compared to a laboratory malathion-susceptible strain. The susceptibility of malathion-susceptible grain aphid were elevated 2.77-fold by single-selected. Resistance development trend show that the resistance rapidly was improved in a period under insecticide pressure in long-term resistance within a certain period of time. The cross-resistance spectrum of malathion to five insecticides show that malathion-resistant strain produce high cross-resistance to omethoate, then followed by deltamethrin, cypermethrin, methomyl and imidacloprid. The relationship between enzyme concentration, reaction time, temperature and CarE activity showed that, in a certain range of concentration, there is a basic linear relationship between enzyme concentration increases and increase the activity, there is a linear relationship between reaction time and enzyme activity in the beginning 20min; when the temperature is below 30℃, there is a relationship between temperature and enzyme activity. So the optimal reaction condition is: enzyme concentration is 30ml, reaction time is 20min, reaction temperature is 30℃. A comparative study of carboxylesterase(CarE)activity and kinetics constants, the glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) specific activity between malathion-resistant and susceptible strains were accomplished. Carboxylesterase(CarE) activity of malathion-resistant strains were significantly higher than the susceptible strain(P <0.05), while malathion-resistant strains of glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) specific activity were also significantly higher than the susceptible strain (P <0.05), the result of biochemical experiment show that malathion-resistance of grain aphid were related to carboxylesterase (CarE), and may be related to glutathione S-transferase (GSTs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). By synergy study of PBO, TPP, DEM and DEF on resistant and susceptible strains of malathion, we found that TPP had the strongest synergies on malathion to resistant and susceptible strains. The efficiency ratio were 11.77 and 1.65; followed by DEM, and the efficiency ratio were 5.12 and 1.30; TPP and DEM on the susceptible strain of S. avenae synergies were weaker than the resistant strains, which Mingmai avenae sensitive to the sensitive strains. DEF and PBO to both malathion resistant strain was sensitive to the synergies are small. Synergist experiments proved once carboxylesterase in wheat aphid resistance to malathion in the work produced, but also that other non-specific esterase also play a

TI  - Impact of climate change on wind energy generation in the UK
SP  - 1
AB  - The release of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels for energy is thought to be one of the main contributors to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. This increase is reported to be causing irreversible changes to the earth’s climate, giving rise to temperature increases and other consequent alterations in weather patterns. Amid growing concern about climate change and its impact on the world, targets have been set through agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and via European Union and government legislation to force countries to work towards decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing the contribution that renewable sources make to energy production is a major part of most countries’ strategies to meet these targets. The UK has arguably the greatest potential for wind power generation in Europe and the government is seeking to build upon this strength by exploiting the resource further. The liberalised electricity market infers a requirement for private investment in order to develop the wind portfolio and this in turn requires financial and economic feasibility. Given the changes in weather patterns that are projected to occur over the course of the coming century, the possibility that this could change the UK’s wind resource, and hence the financial viability of wind power developments, must be addressed. Other aspects of how changes in the wind resource could impact on the operation of the fragmented electricity system ought also to be considered in this context. This thesis attempts to understand how the current generation of climate models project surface wind climate to change, and seeks to make the model information relevant at a site level by using statistical and physical modelling techniques. The projected changes indicated by the models are small, and it has been assessed that potential impacts on the electricity system, from project feasibility to the potential for inclusion of wind in the generation mix, will be limited.

TI  - The thermal evolution of subduction zone lithosphere: evidence from the chemical development of mt ruapehu and surrounding vents, new zealand
SP  - 1
AB  - Mt. Ruapehu is an andesite volcano located at the southwest termination of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) in the North Island of New Zealand where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Australian Plate. Volcanism has migrated south with time as rifting from the Kermadec arc has propagated into the North Island lithosphere making Ruapehu the most recent addition to the TVZ. A detailed study of volcanic rocks and crustal xenoliths collected from Mt. Ruapehu and nearby satellite vents was conducted to establish how differentiation processes in arc magmas change with time in response to tectonic movements in the arc lithosphere. The thickness and composition of the arc crust in the southern TVZ directly controls the differentiation histories of magmas from Mt. Ruapehu and satellite vents. The crustal column beneath Ruapehu is composed of two main lithologies; a localised 5-10 km thick lower crustal meta-igneous granulite overlain by 20-25 km of meta-sediment. While fractional crystallisation is an important process in modifying the major and trace element concentrations, crustal assimilation plays a major role in modifying the isotopic composition of magmas from the southern TVZ. New trace element and isotope data for lavas and crustal xenoliths confirm a distinct change in assimilants between the oldest (Te Herenga - TH) and younger formations (Post Te Herenga - PTH) at Ruapehu. TH lavas are a product of lower crustal differentiation involving assimilation of meta-igneous granulite. PTH lavas display evidence for interaction with the same meta-igneous granulite followed by contamination with meta-sedimentary crust. This change in assimilant coincides with increased rates of extension at the southern tip of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ). We propose that the change in melt-crust interaction reflected in major geochemical changes from TH to PTH lavas is a response to adjustments in differentiation depth. Peripheral satellite vents near Ruapehu have produced some of the most primitive lavas in the southern TVZ with compositions resembling high-Mg andesite. This contrasts with the central-northern TVZ where the most primitive lavas are high-alumina basalt. The spatial distribution of these two magma series has developed as a result of the evolution of TVZ lithosphere. High-Mg andesites appear to be generated from depleted mantle during the very earliest stages of arc development when the lithosphere is thicker causing fractionation at relatively deep levels. High-alumina basalts however, represent a more mature phase of arc development and are derived from relatively fertile mantle following lithospheric thinning causing fractionation at relatively shallow levels. Finally, new osmium isotope data from meta-igneous xenoliths indicate the lower crust beneath Ruapehu is not formed of altered Jurassic oceanic crust. The relatively unradiogenic 187Os/188Os ratios of the xenoliths instead suggest they represent localised underplated material, which has only developed beneath the graben axis where the magma flux is greatest.

TI  - Effect of growth trajectories on adult performance and lifespan in three-spined sticklebacks
SP  - 1
AB  - Changes in environmental conditions in early life can cause changes in the tempo and pattern of growth and development in animals. Natural selection favours processes that enable animals to make decisions that maximise Darwinian fitness. These decisions are influenced by trade-offs between current and future benefits. An episode of poor conditions (i.e. reduced nutrition, low temperature and changes in photoperiod) is generally linked to a slowing of growth. If adequate conditions are restored after this episode, growth rate is accelerated and normal adult size can be reached; in other words, ‘compensatory’ growth occurs. Compensatory growth has benefits in enabling a return to the typical size-at-age growth trajectory. Although this ability to alter growth rate provides a degree of adaptability, there is now increasing evidence that resource allocation to rapid growth carries various long-term costs. While there is experimental evidence that poor environmental conditions in early life can induce subsequent compensatory growth, little is known about the long-term effects of compensatory growth on locomotor and reproductive performance, and on lifespan. In this thesis, I investigated how different growth trajectories affected subsequent performance (i.e. locomotory capability, reproduction and lifespan), and how any such effects were influenced by the perceived time until the key life history event of reproduction. Using juvenile three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I showed that temperature manipulations early in life in three temperature treatments (low, intermediate and high, independent of food supply) or food restriction (with a constant temperature) affected skeletal growth trajectory not only during the manipulation itself, but also during a subsequent compensatory phase. To investigate the effects of time of year, all experimental groups of temperature and food manipulations were replicated at different seasonal periods (= Winter or Spring); to manipulate apparent time of year while holding initial size and maturity constant, a photoperiod manipulation was also undertaken at both seasonal times (ambient or delayed photoperiod). While there was compensatory growth (i.e. accelerated growth) in the food manipulation, temperature manipulations induced both positive compensatory growth (i.e. growth acceleration following exposure to low temperature) and also ‘negative’ compensatory growth (decelerated growth following exposure to high temperature). The outcome of these changes was that fish in all treatment groups reached the same average size by sexual maturity, despite having different growth patterns. However, early growth trajectories influenced both pre-breeding swimming endurance and its decline over the course of the breeding season, such that swimming ability was negatively correlated with compensatory growth whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth reduced swimming ability less (Chapter 2). Reproductive investment (males: sexual ornaments and ability to build nests; females: first clutch size and mean egg size) was negatively affected by compensatory growth; positive effects of ‘negative’ compensatory growth on reproduction were found (Chapter 3). Interestingly, the effects of growth rate on subsequent swimming and reproductive performance were greater when the perceived, or actual, time until the breeding season was shorter (Chapter 2 and 3). These results implied that increased metabolic rates and cellular damage (e.g. oxidative stress) induced by compensatory growth negatively affected subsequent performance, while decelerated growth reduced the damage levels and so later performance was less affected. Under food manipulation, there were similar patterns: compensatory growth (i.e. accelerated growth) negatively affected locomotor and reproductive performance and the time until the breeding season altered the effects on performance (Chapter 4). To further examine trade-offs between growth rate and fitness parameters such as future reproductive investment and rates of senescence, I developed four theoretical models of increasing complexity with different growth-damage scenarios, ranging from assuming that the animal maximises growth regardless of any costs, through assuming a relationship between growth rate and mortality risk, to assuming growth leads to damage accumulation and that the animal is able to apportion resources between somatic growth, gonadal growth and investment in repair of damage. The models predicted that growth trajectories strongly influenced future reproductive investment irrespective of body size at the time of breeding, presumably due to the effects of damage accumulation in the run up to the breeding season; the predictions of the most complex model were closest to the experimental data on egg production (Chapter 5). Lifespan was different among treatment groups and also influenced by early growth trajectories. Compensatory growth negatively affected lifespan whereas ‘negative’ compensatory growth extended lifespan. Lifespan in female sticklebacks was positively related to egg production. Male sticklebacks lived for a shorter time when they showed less growth between their first and second breeding seasons, and a greater change in the duration of having a red throat between the first and second breeding season (an indicator of reproductive senescence). The costs of compensation were strongest when the perceived time until breeding was shortest (Chapter 6). Consequently, this thesis shows that environment conditions in early life have substantial effects on subsequent performances and lifespan. Moreover, results in this thesis strongly support the time-stress hypothesis, that is the time available until the onset of a key life history event, in this case reproduction, influences outcomes.

TI  - Genetic and dietary determinants of allostatic load and chronic disease in the Boston Puerto Rican health study
SP  - 185
AB  - Background. Puerto Ricans living in the US have a high prevalence of multiple chronic conditions including diabetes, hypertension and obesity. As nearly four million Puerto Ricans live in the US, responding to the health issues of this ethnic group is imperative. Allostatic load (AL) is being explored as a possible mechanism for the health disparities observed in minority groups. AL refers to the cumulative dysregulation of physiological parameters in response to stressors, and has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality risk. Individual genetic variations and behavioral responses, such as diet, may also alter the way a person responds physiologically to stress. Variations in minor allele frequencies (MAF) and in population differentiation (FST) in populations contribute to group differences in some common complex diseases, and can indicate local adaptation to environmental pressures. Genetic variability in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may partly explain the response to diet in the manifestation of AL and disease. Genetic and AL research in Puerto Ricans are limited. Objective. To determine the genetic and dietary factors that contribute to AL and chronic disease in Puerto Ricans by: (1) computing MAF and FST for 101 SNPs in 30 genes of lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammation response, in comparison with non-Hispanic whites (NHW), (2) determining the association between SNPs in selected gene loci, alone, and in interaction with dietary fat intake, with physiological parameters of AL, and (3) estimating the associations of AL with chronic disease in Puerto Ricans. Methods. Analysis was conducted with data from questionnaires and biological samples collected from participants of the Boston-Puerto Rican Heath Study (n=1360, ages 45 to 75 y). MAF and FST measures were calculated to prioritize selection of SNPs for association analysis. SNPs in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster were analyzed, alone, and in interaction with total dietary fat, for association with 10 parameters of AL. Logistic regressions were run to determine association of AL categories with chronic diseases. Results. Puerto Ricans had significantly different MAF distribution in 46% of SNPs than similarly aged NHW. They had lower frequency of protective alleles and greater prevalence of risk alleles for disease-associated SNPs. Puerto Ricans showed exceptional FST values in SNPs from chromosome 11, and in intronic, non-synonymous and promoter SNPs. Twelve SNPs analyzed in the APOA1/C3/A4/A5 cluster were not associated with AL parameters, but interactions with dietary fat intake were observed. Puerto Ricans carrying the common allele of APOA1-75, APOA4 N147S or APOA5 S19W had lower waist circumference and blood pressure only when consuming less than 31% of total fat from energy. At this intake level, elevated plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol was observed for subjects with APOA5 -1131T>C common allele. Increasing categories of AL were significantly associated with abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes and self-reported CVD and arthritis, but not with self-reported cancer. Conclusions. Puerto Rican older adults living in Boston present high prevalence of several chronic conditions. Their unique genetic profile, in interaction with total dietary fat intake, modulates physiological parameters of AL in a way that may partly explain health disparities in this group. Puerto Ricans experience AL that is associated with increased odds of some chronic conditions. The results of this dissertation suggest prospective implications in public health and research, such as an approach for selection of candidate genes for association studies, a novel AL definition, and targeted dietary interventions for Puerto Ricans.

The frog Eleutherodactylus coqui was introduced to Hawaii, from Puerto Rico, in the late 1980s and has lost genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. The extent to which founder effects have influenced phenotypic variation in the introduced range is unknown. In this study I compared phenotypic variation in life-history traits, advertisement calls, and stripe patterns among introduced and native populations of the frog Eleutherodactylus coqui. I also conducted laboratory experiments to determine the influence of genetics and temperature on trait variation. Body size in wild populations was positively correlated with elevation in both ranges, but the slope of elevation on body size was greater in Puerto Rico than in Hawaii. Advertisement call frequencies and rates were negatively correlated with elevation but duration was positively correlated with elevation. Frequencies were correlated with body size, but rate, duration, and intensity were not. Color patterns are more variable in Puerto Rico than Hawaii and appear to be maintained by balancing selection in Puerto Rico. Lab results indicate that body size is negatively correlated with temperature, which may explain Bergmann's rule in the field, but patterns of intrinsic growth rate may explain differences in the effect of elevation between Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Body size appears to explain most of the variation in call frequencies, whereas temperature explained most of the variation in rate and duration. Color patterns appear to be determined by a single locus with five alleles. Founder effects appear to explain the difference between Hawaii and Puerto Rico in color pattern variation and in clinal variation in body size and call frequencies. The loss of genetic variation in these traits is likely to have evolutionary consequences for this species in Hawaii.

TI  - Modeling the evolution of insect phenology with particular reference to mountain pine beetle
SP  - 166
AB  - Climate change is likely to disrupt the timing of developmental events (phenology) in insect populations in which development time is largely determined by temperature. Shifting phenology puts insects at risk of being exposed to seasonal weather extremes during sensitive life stages and losing synchrony with biotic resources. Additionally, warming may result in loss of developmental synchronization within a population, making it difficult to find mates or mount mass attacks against well-defended resources at low population densities. It is unknown whether genetic evolution of development time can occur rapidly enough to moderate these effects. The work presented here is largely motivated by the need to understand how mountain pine beetle (MPB) populations will respond to climate change. MPB is an important forest pest from both an economic and ecological perspective, because MPB outbreaks often result in massive timber loss. Recent MPB range expansion and increased outbreak frequency have been linked to warming temperatures. We present a novel approach to modeling the evolution of phenology by allowing the parameters of a phenology model to evolve in response to selection on emergence time and density. We also develop a temperature-dependent phenology model for MPB that accounts for multiple types of developmental variation: variation that persists throughout a life stage, random variation, and variation due to the MPB oviposition mechanism. This model is parameterized using MPB development time data from constant temperature laboratory experiments. We use Laplace's method to approximate steady distributions of the evolution model under stable temperatures. Here the mean phenotype allows for parents and offspring to be oviposited at exactly the same time of year in consecutive generations. These results are verified numerically for both MPB and a two-stage model insect. The evolution model is also applied to investigate the evolution of phenology for MPB and the two-stage model insect under warming temperatures. The model predicts that local populations can only adapt to climate change if development time can adapt so that individuals can complete exactly one generation per year and if the rate of temperature change is moderate.

TI  - Geographic variation in species demography and community structure in temperate rocky reefs
SP  - 115
AB  - Geographic variation in coastal marine upwelling creates a complex seascape of environmental conditions that underlie biogeographic patterns of demographic rates, species distributions, and the structure of marine assemblages. Quantitative descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in assemblages can identify potential processes that regulate structure and dynamics of species at different scales. Understanding the spatial patterns of species demography and structure of assemblages across the seascape also informs more applied endeavors such as fisheries management, conservation of species diversity and species response to global change. This dissertation addresses patterns of community structure and demographic variation of populations in temperate kelp forest ecosystems and explores mechanisms that may generate these patterns. In Chapter 1, I present one of the first comprehensive studies of kelp forest community structure across variable upwelling conditions. Variation in the strength and frequency of upwelling can influence coastal marine assemblages through bottom-up effects of temperature, nutrients, and larval delivery. However, high variability in community structure may exist at local scales due to species interactions, habitat structure, and other local-scale processes. I ask whether benthic species vary across regional scales (10s-100s km), reflecting variation in upwelling, or at local-scales (1-10s km), signaling possible effects of local processes. From replicate detailed surveys of kelp forest flora and fauna, I explicitly test the assumption that subtidal benthic communities exhibit variation in the abundance of dominant benthic functional groups associated with regional-scale variation in upwelling. I demonstrate that upwelling processes regulate biomass of functional groups in kelp forest assemblages, but that local-scale patterns are important for some species, highlighting the need to look at both aggregate and compositional aspects of natural assemblages. In Chapters 2 and 3, I compare life history traits (i.e. growth, fecundity, and survival) among populations of Megastraea undosa, a benthic turbinid snail, across different upwelling regimes. Geographic variation in life history traits underlies patterns of population persistence, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and predicted response to global change and resource management; but, geographic variation in life history traits has received little attention, particularly in marine conservation and management. Variation in coastal upwelling dynamics leads to differences in both temperature and food availability, two factors that can affect energy available for individual maintenance, reproduction and growth. However, temperature and food availability are negatively correlated in coastal marine systems dominated by upwelling and may lead to reduced energy available for multiple life history traits. In Chapter 2, I examine whether geographic variation in upwelling leads to trade-offs between growth and reproduction in Megastraea undosa, and whether geographic differences in trade-offs lead to differences in average individual fitness between populations. Using mark-recapture and histology techniques, I demonstrate that geographic variation in trade-offs between growth and reproduction exists and is related to variation in upwelling. In cold, nutrient-rich waters, higher growth rates lead to lower reproductive allocation, while in regions of less persistent upwelling, the opposite occurs. However, these two different life history strategies lead to similar lifetime cumulative reproductive output between regions. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple life history traits rather than single traits when examining geographic variation in population dynamics. Furthermore, I show that applying similar fisheries regulations across populations with varying demography may result in local depletion of populations. In Chapter 3, I examine whether a relationship between seawater temperature and individual growth of M. undosa exists, and if this relationship varies with regional variation in upwelling conditions. I reconstruct time series of water temperature and growth of M. undosa using isotopes and growth marks in calcium carbonate opercula. Results indicate that M. undosa growth is correlated with water temperature, but the direction of the correlation depends on upwelling region. The mechanisms causing spatial variation in these relationships are likely the direct effects of temperature on metabolism coupled with the indirect responses of the dominant macroalgae to upwelling intensity and energy allocation to other vital rates.

TI  - Experimental population dynamics of Amyloodinium ocellatum in the spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, and the red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus
SP  - 84
AB  - Amyloodinium ocellatum is a parasitic dinoflagellate that infects warm water marine bony fishes and causes high mortalities in aquaculture settings. It has three life history stages: the feeding trophont, the reproductive tomont, and the infective dinospore. This dissertation describes the characteristics of A. ocellatum infections in juvenile spotted seatrout, Cynoscion nebulosus, and red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, studies the survival and fecundities of the stages in the life cycle of the parasite and presents a population model for A. ocellatum. At 25°C and 33 ppt, the peak of trophont detachment occurred on day 2 post-infection in spotted seatrout and day 3 in red snapper. Trophont mean length at detachment was significantly larger in red snapper than in spotted seatrout (80 versus 72 µm, respectively), which translates to an increased mean dinospore production in red snapper (99 dinospores tomont−1 versus 82 in spotted seatrout). There was no difference either in the dinospore infection rate (0.36 and 0.34 dinospores d−1 for spotted seatrout and red snapper, respectively) or in the dinospore lethal dose (237,243 and 141,010 dinospores fish−1 for spotted seatrout and red snapper, respectively) between host species, but the mean trophont lethal load was higher in spotted seatrout (178,067 trophonts fish −1) than in red snapper (123,160 trophonts fish−1 ) suggesting that the red snapper is less tolerant of A. ocellatum infections than spotted seatrout. The mean number of offspring per generation per individual for A. ocellatum (R0) was 49.15 dinospores tomont−1 with a generation time of 6.3 d. These rates were estimated using the mean tomont size for infections in spotted seatrout. Analysis of the population model revealed that changes in the mean number of dinospores tomont −1 had the largest effect on A. ocellatum population growth, followed by the dinospore infection rate, the tomont sporulation rate and the dinospore mortality rate. A higher A. ocellatum population growth rate was observed in infections in red snapper than in spotted seatrout. These studies elucidate the dynamics of the life cycle of A. ocellatum and demonstrate the critical life cycle control points at which management strategies can be focused.

TI  - A brittle damage model in thermoelastodynamics
SP  - 154
AB  - The response of brittle materials subjected to dynamic thermomechanical loading is investigated. In particular, simulations are used to determine the role of material property dependence on the microstructure of a brittle material, and to determine the viability of modeling thermal phenomena associated with brittle failure within the framework of continuum damage mechanics (CDM). A system of equations is derived via the theory of internal state variables that fully couples the elastic, thermal, and microstructure evolution of a thermoelastic material with isotropic damage. Dynamic effects in the equations of motion and the intrinsically local nature of the constitutive equations are carefully studied. A new implementation of the finite element method is proposed for finding approximate solutions to the derived model. The damage variable is treated as a field, as opposed to the common method of considering values of the damage at the quadrature points. In this way, the damage is treated in the general framework of finite element methods. A key element of the proposed numerical formulation is the use of a piecewise constant approximate solution space for the damage variable. This is physically motivated; not only is the damage variable local, it is most often the result of homogenization over a representative volume element, and therefore evolves in a piecewise constant manner according to the mesh. Adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to keep the size of higher dimensional problems reasonable, and also to properly resolve the morphology of the damage field. Brittle behavior is captured by defining a minimum mesh size and allowing the damage variable to grow rapidly, as is physically the case in fracture. Failure induced thermal heating is observed in the simulations. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first presentation of such a result in the context of CDM for brittle materials. The specific heat and its dependence on the damage variable/microstructure were found to play an extremely important role in this heating. Therefore, further study (both theoretical and experimental) of the effects of failure mechanisms on the specific heat appear to be particularly important to better understand the failure of brittle materials subjected to thermomechanical loading. Specific issues in the modeling of an intrinsically discontinuous phenomena like fracture within a continuous theory are discussed.

TI  - Foraging, feeding, energetics, and environment: Interactions between physiology and ecology of Gila monsters
SP  - 123
AB  - The ecology of Gila monsters is largely related to the endurance of unpredictable resource availability, and to the tolerance of predictably harsh environmental conditions. Gila monsters use a novel suite of behavioral, physiological and morphological adaptations to overcome the vagaries of their desert habitat, and as a result, they survive by interacting with their environment in unique ways that would seem impossible for other species. This dissertation investigates the physiological and ecological consequences of the unique ways in which Gila monsters interact with their environment. Each chapter analyzes different aspects of how individuals acquire, process, store, and use essential food and water resources, while simultaneously managing the constraints and opportunities provided by the environment. Chapter one is a laboratory study that investigates the thermal preferences of Gila monsters, the effects of feeding on body temperature selection, and the ability of individuals to physiologically control heat exchange. These investigations set the stage for the ecological importance of body temperature regulation, and also provide a baseline by which to appropriately measure behavioral thermoregulation. Chapter two explores the importance of temperature regulation by Gila monsters in the field. The physical limitations imposed by the thermal environment are used as a framework to analyze trade-offs between foraging activity and thermoregulation. In order to forage, lizards must nearly always tolerate thermal conditions that are outside of their preferred range, but in doing so, they sacrifice their ability to thermoregulate and risk reduced performance. Chapter three examines the influences of body temperature regulation and activity on the use of energy and water. The magnitude of energy use is measured directly, and specific components of energy partitioning are modeled mathematically to yield seasonal and annual energy budgets for Gila monsters in southern Nevada. These analyses are then extended to a larger geographic scale, and the effects of both environmental variation (temperature) and individual variation (body mass) are used to simulate differences in resting energy use between four ecologically distinct populations of Gila monsters. Each of these chapters takes an eco-physiological approach to investigating the interactions between Gila monsters and their environment. While in some ways Gila monsters may seem maladapted to desert life, I show how they use specific behavioral and physiological strategies to overcome environmental limitations.

TI  - Development and applications of second-order turbulence closures for mixing in overflows
SP  - 170
AB  - Mixing between overflows and ambient water masses is a crucial problem of deep-water formation in the down-welling branch of the meridional overturning circulation of the ocean. In this dissertation work, performance of second-order turbulence closures in reproducing mixing of overflows is investigated within both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models. First, a 2D non-hydrostatic model is developed to simulate the Red Sea overflow in the northern channel. The model results are compared to the Red Sea Outflow Experiment. It is found that the experiments without sub-grid scale models cannot reproduce the basic structure of the overflow. The k-&egr; model yields unrealistically thick bottom layer (BL) and interfacial layer (IL). A new technique so-called very large eddy simulation (VLES) which allows the use of k-&egr; model in non-hydrostatic models is also employed. It is found that VLES results the most realistic reproduction of the observations. Furthermore, the non-hydrostatic model is improved by introducing laterally average terms, so the model can simulate the constrictions not only in the z-direction but also in the y-direction. Observational data from the Bosphorus Strait is employed to test the spatially average 2D non-hydrostatic model (SAM) in a realistic application. The simulations from SAM with a simple Smagorinsky type closure appear to be excessively diffusive and noisy. We show that SAM can benefit significantly from VLES turbulence closures. Second, the performance of different second-order turbulence closures is extensively tested in a hydrostatic model. Four different two-equation turbulence closures (k-&egr;, k-ω, Mellor-Yamada 2.5 (MY2.5) and a modified version of k-&egr;) and K-Profile Parameterization (KPP) are selected for the comparison of 3D numerical simulations of the Red Sea overflow. All two-equation turbulence models are able to capture the vertical structure of the Red Sea overflow consisting of the BL and IL. MY2.5 with Galperin stability functions produce the largest salinity deviations from the observations along two sections across the overflow and the modified k-&egr; exhibits the smallest deviations. The rest of the closures fall in between, showing deviations similar to one another. Four different closures (k-&egr;, k-ω, MY2.5KC and KPP) are also employed to simulate the Mediterranean outflow. The numerical results are compared with observational data obtained in the 1988 Gulf of Cadiz Expedition. The simulations with two-equation closures reproduce the observed properties of the overflow quite well, especially the evolution of temperature and salinity profiles. The vertically integrated turbulent salt flux displays that the overflow goes under significant mixing outside the west edge of the Strait of Gibraltar. The volume transport and water properties of the outflow are modified significantly in the first 50 km after the overflow exits the strait. The k-&egr; and k-ω cases show the best agreement with the observations. Finally, the interaction between the Red Sea overflow and Gulf of Aden (GOA) eddies has been investigated. It is found that the overflow is mainly transported by the undercurrent at the west side of the gulf. The transport of the overflow is episodic depending on the strength and location of GOA eddies. The most crucial finding is that the Red Sea overflow leaves the Gulf of Aden in patches rather than one steady current. Multiple GOA eddies induce lateral stirring, thus diapycnal mixing of the Red Sea outflow.

TI  - The sensitivity and adaptability of the grape and wine industry in the Maule Region of Chile to climate change
SP  - 217
AB  - This paper examines the sensitivity and adaptability of the Chilean grape and wine industry to climate change in the context of other stresses via a case study in the Maule Region. The research was conducted using a vulnerability approach, which is based on the empirical documentation of exposures and adaptive capacity. Key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and a focus group were used as the primary data sources. The climatic exposures to which growers and producers are exposed include wet springs, spring frosts, wet falls, high growing season temperatures, and drought. These exposures were placed in the context of other conditions, including market price, currency fluctuations, national and international rules and regulations, and labour availability. The Maule Region has not developed extensive suites of adaptation strategies because the grower- and producer-identified exposures have not yet threatened their operations' viability. Future climate change may be beneficial and accommodate the cultivation of new varieties. However, many of the climatic exposures are projected to be exacerbated into the future, and the adaptive strategies currently used may not be effective into the future. The national government, a lack of education and market uncertainty hinder the industry's ability to manage exposures.

TI  - Establishment and productivity of irrigated switchgrass across ecozones in California
SP  - 48
AB  - Bioethanol has been produced from maize grains in the US. Several negative aspects of maize based bioethanol have been reported, such as low ethanol productivity and net energy production (Pimentel 1996, 2001; Pimentel and Patzek 2005) and high greenhouse gas emissions (Adler et al. 2007). However, technology is being developed to produce ethanol from cellulose, proposed to offer energy and environmental and economic advantages over current biofuel sources (Schmer et al. 2008). Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from urban and agricultural wastes, such as rice and wheat straw, wood chips from tree pruning and dedicated energy crops. High biomass yielding crops, like switchgrass (Panicum virgatum ), are candidates to be used solely as cellulosic energy crops. Switchgrass has been promoted as a biofuel crop because of its high yield potential, relatively low fertilizer requirement, soil conservation attributes and compatibility with conventional farming practices (McLaughlin 1992). Switchgrass is a C4 warm-season perennial grass native to the North American Prairies. It has been grown in the US as a forage crop, for grazing and for ground cover. Only recently it has received attention as a promising cellulosic biofuel crop. Most research on switchgrass has been conducted in the Midwest and Southern US under rain-fed conditions and little is known about the adaptability and productivity of switchgrass in California. Basic information, such as establishment methods, weed control options and optimal fertilization under irrigated condition remains lacking. In addition, California is composed of different ecozones, ranging from high elevation intermountain regions, to Mediterranean climates and true deserts, where switchgrass adaptability and yield response to nitrogen will differ.

TI  - Development of biomimetic systems for biofuel cell applications
SP  - 198
AB  - Biomimics have been developed and characterized in order to further the understanding and the technology of bioelectrocatalysis. Glycerol, which is a natural product and also a byproduct of biodiesel production, has had limited success as a fuel as a result of its poor catalytic oxidation on traditional precious metals. However, since glycerol is a natural compound that has a natural metabolic pathway in living organisms, it remains a possibility to be efficiently oxidized to carbon dioxide by using biological catalysts. To do this a non-natural metabolic pathway was developed that uses a three enzyme cascade that had low substrate specificity and good direct electron transfer to carbon electrode materials. This allows glycerol and other similar compounds to be completely oxidized without the complexity of a natural pathway which would require many more steps. Another method of accomplishing complete oxidation is using the organelle responsible for cellular energy generation, the mitochondria. Since the mitochondria already contain all of the necessary enzymes, cofactors, and pathways for complete oxidation of pyruvate and fatty acids, it is an ideal package for energy conversion. Mitochondrial bioanodes were developed and characterized for energy conversion of pyruvate and fatty acids in a biofuel cell system. In this study, the immobilized mitochondria were shown to be intact and viable by traditional viability assays, and the electron transport mechanism to the carbon electrode was probed. In an effort to develop a totally synthetic, but biologically inspired catalyst for oxygen reduction, phthalocyanine doped carbon nanotubes were synthesized and characterized. This included development of a low temperature solvothermal synthesis of multiwalled carbon nanotubes by the reduction of carbon tetrachloride with iron metal powder in supercritical hexane. Then, using the same synthesis, perchlorinated phthalocyanine was added to the reaction so that the phthalocyanine is incorporated into the growing graphitic sheets of carbon. This yielded carbon nanotubes that contained catalytic sites where a chelated metal atom demonstrated similar catalysis as seen in biological catalysts, such as cytochrome c, but was designed for optimal operation in a fuel cell instead of a cellular environment.

TI  - Evolutionary ecology of symbionts within free-living and host environments in the sepiolid squid-Vibrio symbiosis
SP  - 208
AB  - Most microorganisms experience variable environments which at least occasionally involve periods of harsh and extreme conditions that impose stress and hinder optimal performance of microbial physiology, metabolism, survival, and fitness. Microorganisms have evolved sophisticated, elaborate, and complex stress responses to regulate and mitigate the negative effects of stress in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. The different stress responses (e.g., heat shock and starvation) involve crosstalk to each other and are cross-connected in manifold ways to determinants of symbiosis, defined here to include mutualisms, parasitisms, host-pathogen relationships, and commensalisms. How stress impacts microbial diversity, ecology, and evolution is not entirely clear and is an interesting question. The sepiolid squid-Vibrio mutualism is an ideal model system to explore this problem. The aim of this dissertation was to investigate how environmental variation, abiotic factors, exposure to novel hosts, and stressors influence the evolutionary ecology of the symbiont Vibrio fischeri and what the potential consequences are to its free-living and host-associated phases, along with the accompanying overall effect on the symbiosis itself. Growth curve studies showed temperature, salinity, and nutrient availability can synergistically interact and affect symbiont reproduction, abundance, competition, and allelopathy prior to their encounter with host squid. Furthermore, these results suggested the distribution patterns of the hosts could be a contributor in shaping how V. fischeri biomass production responds to abiotic factors and stress during the planktonic lifestyle. Subsequent co-infection studies with dissimilar strains in squid showed how proportions of different symbiont types can modify the outcome of host colonization, including the countervailing of competitive dominance. Microbial experimental evolution indicated that V. fischeri is capable of rapid adaptation to environmentally stressful and novel host environments. Both of these perspectives are related, since host immunity imparts its own particular set of advosarial stresses. Temporal population genetic studies of V. fischeri isolated from animals provided a macroscale evolutionary viewpoint into the coevolution of the symbionts with their host squid. Genomic resequencing of experimentally evolved V. fischeri in E. tasmanica identified genes potentially responsible for the adaptation to this host. Phenotypic characterization indicated evidence of convergent evolution between derived lines through E. tasmanica and "ET" wild isolates procured from field-caught specimens of this same squid host species.

AB  - The following statements summarise the key findings described in this thesis.Â  (1) A global sample of 22 T. castaneum populations revealed considerable inter-strain variance in a number of morphometric traits and nuclear genes (AFLP).Â  (2) Molecular phylogeography suggests that, almost certainly due to human activity, flour beetles quickly colonised the globe.Â  (3) Against RENSCHâ��s rule, sexual size dimorphism across T. castaneum strains was positively correlated with body size.Â  (4) The fitness of inter-strain crosses in most cases did not differ from intra-strain crosses, but when they did the crosses showed outbreeding depression.Â  (5) Reproductive success showed a gradual and significant decline with increasing genetic distance between mates.Â  (6) Artificial selection across 20 generations with contrasting levels of sexual selection/conflict altered female, but not male reproductive traits, and there was evidence for both â��good genesâ�� and sexual conflict.Â  (7) I found no strong support for accelerated evolution of reproductive isolation under elevated sexual selection/conflict.Â  (8) Eight generations of inbreeding resulted in decreased reproductive success, sperm competitive ability, egg size and increased intra-male variance in sperm length.Â  (9) Inbred beetles of both sexes were able to restore their fitness by mating monogamously with non-inbred main stock individuals.Â  (10) Polyandry was an effective way for inbred females to avoid inbreeding depression.Â  (11) Larval density negatively influenced spermathecal size and complexity.Â  (12) Against BERGMANNâ��s rule, sperm were longer in males that developed at higher temperatures.

TI  - Seasonal effects of treated sewage effluents upon the reproduction and development of european freshwater molluscs
AB  - The most widespread evidence of environmental endocrine disruption in aquatic wildlife is from the feminising effects of oestrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds. However, very little is known of the effects of these chemicals (and others) upon freshwater molluscs found in our river and lakes. This thesis aimed at evaluating the effects of treated sewage effluent upon the reproductive and developmental cycle of a range of commonly found European freshwater gastropod molluscs. Initial mesocosm experiments were undertaken to test a range of mollusc species for their the suitability to the experimental system, and to test adult snails for their reproductive and developmental responses during spring to summer time. With suitable species chosen, P.corneus, a pulmonate species (sequential hermaphrodite), and V. Viviparus a prosobranch species (dioeious; separate sexes), full reproductive output was assessed over summertime and into autumn, along with developmental responses amongst the F1 generation of snails. My results suggest that the affects of effluent upon the reproductive and developmental cycle of P. corneus are strongly mitigated by both day length and water temperature (day length is most important with V. viviparus); results are sensitive to seasonal effects. However, at the peak of reproduction mid summer, P. corneus produced significantly more egg masses in effluent (100% effluent particularly), and more than one parameter of reproduction was affected. Egg masses were significantly smaller in effluent and contained significantly fewer eggs per mass. Further, there were indications that total reproductive output was increased (100% effluent significantly) in effluent compared to the river water control. In the prosobranch species V. viviparus results were less convincing, however, in 100% effluent a second reproductive peak occurred that was not seen in river water. Further, in both species there was a failure of certain reproductive parameters to observe the normal seasonal decline towards winter. In P. corneus there was a failure to stop producing egg masses in effluent, in V. viviparus the second reproductive peak in effluent could also threaten their survival with winter approaching. Developmental effects in the F1 generation were the subject of preliminary investigations, however, F1 V. viviparus demonstrated a higher than normal incidence of intersex (male and female developmental features) in effluent, and P. corneus appeared to have disturbed reproductive function (disturbance of both male and female reproductive function in the ovotestis). Therefore, both of these species of molluscs demonstrated that they are sensitive to the effects of effluent in mesocosm studies. However, we need to understand much more about their responses to effluent; in particular whether these effects could have repercussions for wild mollusc populations, and whether these effects could occur over more than one generation of snail threatening the survival of wild populations of molluscs.

TI  - Genetic Structure of Drosophila Populations Adapted to Contrasting Microclimatic Gradients: Evidence from "Evolution Canyon" and Laboratory Experiments
SP  - 202
AB  - The central question of evolutionary biology, the problem of speciation, was formulated more than 100 years ago. The basic scenario for the appearance of new species is allopatric speciation, developed by Dobzhansky`s and Mayr`s evolutionary concepts. This model requires geographic isolation (stop of gene flow between differentiating groups) for the speciation process. For nearly 50 years allopatry has been considered one of obligatory conditions for speciation, as well as ecological selection and genetic drift. Still, we should not forget that the opposite model - sympatric speciation, proposed first by Darwin, has not been carefully tested during the last 100 years. According to this model, the differentiation process can begin with possible gene flow between differentiating groups. Divergence processes can occur gradually as a response to natural selection. One of the indicators of speciation is reproductive isolation. Ever-increasing evidence indicates that the geographic separation of gene pools is not obligatory for evolving reproductive isolation. There are cases when ecological selection, sexual isolation, and habitat choice can lead to speciation without any geographical separation. Populations may diverge not because they are separated geographically from each other, but because they choose different niches. J.M. Thoday in 1959 showed that positive assortative mating in Drosophila can arise after only 12 generations of disruptive selection without isolation. However, several dozens of laboratories tried to reproduce these results and failed to do so. Numerous experiments of Rice (1984, 1987) (usually, but not always, with isolation) demonstrated that assortative mating can arise due to selection in contrasting environments. One of the most famous examples of incipient sympatric speciation is the fly Rhagoletis pomonella (Feder et al., 1997; Ollson et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2007; Michel et al., 2007). It is quite difficult to study the process of sympatric speciation. If one studies a reproductively isolated species with a common ancestor that live in sympatry, the problem is that it cannot be clearly known if the studied differentiation took place when the species were sympatric or allopatric. Alternatively, one studies diverging sympatric populations. But it is difficult to guarantee that these populations will evolve into a new species. The optimal evidence of sympatric speciation would be a range of examples from very early up to final stages of evolving isolation in sympatry.Substantial genetic divergence was discovered between populations of Drosophila melanogaster inhabiting opposite slopes of "Evolution Canyon" (EC1) at Lower Nahal Oren, Mt. Carmel, coordinates 32°43'N, 34°58'E (Nevo 1995, 1997, 2001, 2006, 2008); the slopes display notable physical (solar illumination, UV irradiation, temperature, humidity) and biotic contrasts at a microscale (Pavlicek et al., 2003). The main underlying factor for such sharp ecological differences in the adjacent opposite slopes at this microsite is the difference in solar radiation. Extensive studies of D. melanogaster from EC1 involved habitat choice, mate choice, thermal and drought tolerances, adaptive candidate genes, and mobile elements (Nevo et al., 1998a; Korol et al., 2000, 2006a; Iliadi et al., 2001; Michalak et al., 2001; Lupu et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2005; Zamorzaeva et al., 2005; Rashkovetsky et al., 2006). Flies from the opposite slopes, reared under standard laboratory conditions, differed in survival and longevity. Considerable interslope differences were found in flies exposed to elevated temperatures, drought, and starvation stresses.Alternate abstract:הבעיה המרכזית בביולוגיה אבולוציונית היא בעית ההתמיינות (speciation .

TI  - Genetic variation and local adaptation in peripheral populations of toads
AB  - Northern fringe populations generally have low amounts of genetic variation and inhabit habitats where specific adaptations are needed. On the Swedish west coast, the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) inhabits skerry islands. I have examined: I) adaptation to two environmental stressors in this habitat; II) the genetic population structure within the skerry habitat; III) the effects of neutral genetic variation, selection and genetic drift on trait divergence within the skerry habitat; and IV) the effects of genetic variation on fitness under three thermal conditions of varying stressfulness. V) I have also studied the impact of putative local adaptations on the Scandinavian green toad (Bufo viridis) conservation programme. The results suggest that the skerry natterjack toads are locally adapted to the desiccation risk in their habitat. However, despite inhabiting a more saline habitat, they had a lower salinity tolerance when compared to their conspecifics in the more general habitat. The lowered salinity tolerance is most likely explained by the presence of negative genetic correlations between salinity tolerance and desiccation avoidance and suggests that the occurrence of multiple environmental stressors may constrain adaptation. Within the skerry habitat, the toads exhibited a strong population structure with populations differing in their levels of genetic variation. Moreover, within the skerry habitat, the results suggest uniform selection pressures. However, correlations between trait values and neutral genetic variation suggest that inbreeding depression may affect trait values and thus potentially constrain adaptation. In the natterjack toad, fitness costs associated with lack of genetic variation were only present under benign conditions and not under more natural conditions. This suggests that environmental stress masks inbreeding depression in these traits under natural conditions. In the study regarding the Scandinavian green toads, I found that one population inhabiting a saline habitat had a higher salinity tolerance than other populations in less saline habitats. This suggests the presence of local adaptation, which should be acknowledged in the green toad conservation programme. Several of the northern fringe populations of toads fulfill the criteria of being Evolutionary Significant Units and their conservation thus should be prioritized.

TI  - Synthesis of cds quantum dots and their cytotoxicity study
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorQuantum dots (Quantumdots, QDs) are nano-materials of quasi-zero- dimension, with three-dimension size below 100nm. They are atoms or clusters composed of the minimal number of atoms or molecules. Due to the unique optical properties, QDs are being widely used in biomedical imaging as novel fluorescent markers. As the prevalence of these materials in society is increasing, the question of their long-term effects on human health and environment is becoming critical.Therefore, on the basis of the practical application of quantum dots and human health, to analysis the mechanisms of biological damage of quantum dots and and effectively prevent the emergence of harmful factors, has great practical significance. Although many studies have reported that modifying QD surface with shells or ligands can effectively inhibit its toxicity in vivo and in vitro, these protective coatings may degrade under certain conditions, toxicity of "naked" QDs after their coatings are degraded is still under investigation. As a result of various types of quantum dots, we selected bare Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) QDs as the model of decayed surface-modified QDs, whith are representative and have not been adequately studied currently. In this study, we proposed an emulsion liquid membrane (ELM) system to synthesize CdS QDs, which acted as a model of decayed surface-modified QDs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were carried out to characterized QDs particles. Synthesis of QDs with EML system is simple and convenient with low toxicity of raw materials and does not need high pressure or high temperature, monomer size can be controlled and relatively stable at room temperature. CdS QDs were of cubic structure synthesised by ELM system with uniform monomer particle size about 6 ~ 8nm. However, since QDs can be a great surface area and are not surface modified, they often aggregated into secondary particles, with a number of connected surface and a larger size. Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CHL) and human fetal liver cells (L-02) which were commonly used in the toxicology experiment were selected of as cell models, and were exposed to CdS QDs with different concentrations. 24h after exposure, changes in cell morphology and cell viability were observed, SOD expression of cells were determined through immunohistochemical detection. To study the role of QDs cytotoxic mechanisms, cadmium ion concentration inside and outside cells, cell oxidative damage (cells MDA, SOD, GSH content), ROS content, intracellular and extracellular Cd2+ concentration and membrane damage (LDH content), etc., were determined to detect the degree of cell damage. Results of cytotoxicity test showed that after exposure to CdS QDs, shrinkage deformation of CHL and L-02 cells occurred, and as the dose increased, cell survival rates gradually decreased. Compared to CHL, L-02 cells were more sensitive to the stimulation of CdS QDs as the CdS QDs median lethal concentration (LC50) to CHL was about 50~100μg/mL, while the LC50 to L-02 is 10~20μg/mL; SOD expression was observed both in control and infected groups in CHL and L-02, but QDs had a certain impact to protein expression; MDA content increased synchronous with QDs concentrations, while the SOD and GSH content declined compared to the control groups which showed a certain degree of dose - response relationship; cellular ROS content increased with the exposure dose, suggesting that the mechanism of CdS QDs cytotoxicity may be the oxidative damage; Intracellular and extracellular Cd2+ concentration of CHL and L-02 and showed a gradual upward trend, compared with CHL, Cd2+ was more easily to pass through L-02 cell membrane.after 18h exposure to QDs, LDH content of cells significantly increases, indicating that CdS QDs has a certain role in the injury on the cell membrane. The results have certain relevance as we selected two types of cells as biological samples to detect QDs cytotoxicity. Results from the experiments showed that CdS QDs had a more serious injury on L-02 cells. Biological toxicity of CdS QDs may not only via mechanisms involving both Cd2+ and oxidative damage, but also the role of lipid peroxidation and destruction of the bilayer lipid membrane integrity so that triggered an increase in the cell membrane

TI  - Studies on crystal structures and functions of metal-organic coordination polymers constructed from novel thiophene-based ligands
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorMetal-organic coordination polymers (MOCP) have attracted considerable attentions not only because of their various interesting architectures, but also of their wide potential applications in material science, such as photoluminescence, magnetism, gas adsorption, catalysis, templating metal nanoparticles and so on. However, the research on metal-organic coordination polymers constructed from thiophene-based organic ligands is rather limited and needs more efforts and concentrations. Therefore, we design and synthesize a series of novel thiophene-based dicarboxylate linkers. And 22 metal-organic coordination polymers were rational designed and synthesized. Further study of their crystal structures and physical properties revealed that there was clear influence between the above two aspects. This dissertation includes the following three parts: (1) the brief introduction about the crystal structures and their physical properties; (2) metal-organic coordination polymers built from H2DBTA; and (3) metal-organic coordination polymers constructed of H2DTTA. 1. Metal-organic coordination polymers built from H2DBTA (a) Through the solvothermal reaction of H2DBTA and Mn(ClO4)2, a 3D porous MOCP (1) was obtained, in which the dinuclear Mn2-SBU performed unusual magnetism in the temperature range of 220 K to 240 K. Correspondingly, the crystal data of the MOCP under different temperatures suggested that the compound exhibited unusual crystal structural variation as well, which possibly could be ascribed to negative thermal expansion. The results supported that there were important relationship between the structure and magnetic behavior in metal-organic coordination polymers. (b) The rational design and syntheses of nine Zn-DBTA MOCPs (2-10) were carried out after the careful analysis of the structural characteristics and common coordination fashions of secondary N-donor linkers. These MOCPs showed various structural types, such as 1D chains, 2D layers and 3D frameworks. Furthermore, the DBTA ligand functionalized as a flexible dicarboxlate linker with various coordination modes. The good photoluminescences and comparatively long radiative lifetimes help them become a family of promising fluorescent materials. (c) Four metal-DBTA coordination polymers (11-14) constructed of Cd2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ centers expanded the crystal structure types and metal types. The DBTA ligand performed two additional coordination modes which again supported its wonderful coordination flexibility. 2. Metal-organic coordination polymers constructed of H2DTTA (a) The 2D two-fold interpenetration MOCP (15) made of DTTA and Ni2+ was taken as a good artificial template to support silver nanoparticles. The resulted Ag(0)/15 showed good catalytic activity and recycle ability in the catalysis of the A3 reaction of aldehyde, secondary amine with alkyne. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibited good selectivity towards linear aliphatic aldehydes rather than aromatic and branch aliphatic aldehydes, which possibly owing to the fitness between the shapes and sizes of the reaction substrates to the supported environments in/on the MOCP 15. (b) We have successfully prepared three related Mn2+ MOCPs (16-18) through solvothermal reactions of the same reagents, H2DTTA and Mn(ClO4)2, just by adjusting the reaction solvents and co-ligands. The comparative study of their crystal structures and photoluminescence reveals that solvents and co-ligands in each preparation of the MOCP have significant influence on the crystal packing mode and intramolecular electron distributions, which provides a promising method to regulate the physical properties of MOCPs by controlling the preparation process. Furthermore, the strong emission, near-visible or visible excitation wavelengths and comparatively long radiative lifetimes of their photoluminescence make the three MOCPs promising candidates for fluorescent materials. (c) Four Lanthanoid-DTTA coordination polymers (19-22) with large 1D nanotubes showed good photoluminescence and catalytic activity in the reaction of aldehyde with alcohol. There was good selectivity towards the sizes and shapes of the aldehyde substrates as

TI  - Study on the immobilization of aminoacylase by polyamidoamine (pamam) dendrimer
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorDendrimer is a new type of functional macromolecule compound whose specialties are to design the molecular size, shape and functional group at the molecular level. The introduction of PAMAM can improve the surface efficiency. Enzyme immobilization offers advantages over free enzymes in stability, continuous processes, reusability of catalysts, ease of enzyme survival in the reaction mixture and adaptability to various environment designs. Effective immobilized technology and ideal supports were necessary for the enzyme immobilization. In this paper, Divergent synthesis was used as the synthesis process of the PAMAM surface modified silica. The silica used is of 50μm in diameter. After Silanization by 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), 3.0G PAMAM was grown from the amino groups by repetition of two steps under certain conditions: Michael addition of methyl acrylate (MA) to amino groups on the surface and amidation of the resulting terminal ester groups with ethylenediamine (EDA). The molecular structures and properties of the product have been characterized by terminal group analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), fluorescence microscope (FM) and elemental analysis (EA). The result demonstrated that the structures and properties of the synthesized dendrimers was in line with the theoretical structures and properties. Glutaraldehyde was used to crosslink PAMAM modified silica with aminoacylase, using 1% glutaraldehyde to crosslink PAMAM modified silica and aminoacylase in 25℃ for 4h. The performances of the immobilized enzyme were evaluated by the separation of N-acetyl-DL-methionine. The properties of immobilized enzyme were also studied. Various characteristics of immobilized aminoacylase, such as pH, concentration of Co2+, concentration of substrate, are considered. The optimized conditions of immobilized aminoacylase were found to be pH 7.5 and 30℃ respectively. The thermal stability and storage stability were also valuated. The results indicated that the immobilized enzyme had higher thermal and storage stability than the free enzyme. Half-life of the immobilized enzyme was 34d. Immobilized aminoacylase was used to evaluate the performances of the immobilized enzyme by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE). The results showed that the immobilized enzyme had good efficiency, reproducibility and

TI  - Studies on relatives and biological characters of seven strains of dunaliella
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSeven strains of Dunaliella sp. preserved in Microalgae Culture Collection Center, were selected as the subject of study. To study and explore these microalgae resources, the effects of salinity, temperature and light intensity on 7 strains of Dunaliella sp. were studied and morphological and molecular classification were also used in the investigation of taxonomic position and genetic relationship. The anti-salt metabolism was preliminarily analyzed. The results showed: 1. Seven strains had similar adaptability to the temperature and light intensity; the optimal growth condition was under 25℃,6000lx. However, there were significant differences in their salinity tolerance. The optimal salinity ranged from 50 to 150, and A57 were the best one. A85 got the best multiplication capacity under the optimal culture condition. 2. The ribosome 5.8S rDNA and ITS sequences of these Dunaliella sp. were sequenced, and compared with the 7 Dunaliella sequences from Genbank. UPMGA phylogenetic tree revealed that all the seven Dunaliella strains clustered in the same clad with Dunaliella viridis. Considering the appraisal results of cytomorphology and physiology, the studied Dunaliella strains might belong to D. viridis. Within the 7 studied strains, A85 and A57 and A83 were clustered to a clad, while A121 and A124 were clustered to another clad, which was further supported by RAPD analysis using 12 random primers. 3. intracellular glycerol content of A57 grown in hypersaline medium indicated that the adjustment of glycerol content finished in 6 hours after hyperosmotic shock. After three weeks, some functional proteins were induced significantly, protein 75KD,70KD,15KD, whose amounts enhanced nearly two times; protein26KD,36KD,40KD,almost doubled, while expression of protein 54KD, 108KD were strongly restrained. 4. Applied FDA-PI double staining method with FCM to detect the cell viability and morphological changes of A57 after hyperosmotic shock, the results indicated that the cellular contents decreased quickly at the initial stage, while cell volume increased. The nonviable cell percent rised evidently in 6 hour, and remained stable until 24 hours after the

It's reported that Wolbachia induced parthenogenesis in Trichogramma. Trichogramma are very important parasitoid wasps. They have significant effects in biological control. In this study, distribution of Wolbachia in five common Trichogramma species contained twelve strains in China was investigated. The results showed that Wolbachia distributed in all the populations except Trichogramma japonicum. Eva, Kue and Pip groups of Wolbachia distributed in both strain GDYMT.o and HLJYMT.d, and the triple infection rates were 100%. In other Trichogramma populations, there are only group Kue and Pip Wolbachia, and the double infection rates are 100% too. All the Trichogramma in this study are sexual (arrhenotokous). In order to study the effect of Wolbachia on these Trichogramma, we did heating and antibiotic treatments. After rearing under 31C or fed with 0.5% and 1% antibiotics for several generations, the Wolbachia were not deleted successfully for three repeatments. Though the wasps were very weak, even some of them were died, the Wolbachia were still not cureable. The Wolbachia infection type and infection rate were not changed. In order to get non Wolbachia host, we fed C.cephalonica with antibiotics too. But the Wolbachia infected in C.cephalonica were not cured either though the C.cephalonica were too weak to lay eggs or even some of them died. We conclude that Wolbachia is fixed in Trichogramma and C.cephalonica. In order to study the horizontal transfer of Wolbachia between different hosts, we investigated the distribution of Wolbachia among T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts collected in Dongbeiwang Agronomy farm in Beijing based on the PCR of 16S rDNA and wsp genes of Wolbachia. Two species which were both belong to Geometridae were only infected with Wolbachia of supergroup A, six species were only infected with Wolbachia of supergroup B, T. ostriniae and other eight lepidopteran species were infected with both A and B Wolbachia, with all the individuals infected. The similarity of wsp sequences of Wolbachia found in T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts was very high and some of the sequences were identical. This indicated that Wolbachia may transfer among T.ostriniae and its lepidopteran hosts. We tested the infection of Wolbachia in Trichogramma individuals successfully and systematically reported the infection rate of Wolbachia in major Trichogramma species in China for the first time. And a pilot study about the effects of Wolbachia on major Trichogramma species in China and horizontal transfer of Wolbachia has been done in this study. This is a stable base and a good beginning for the study of the effect and the mechanism of Wolbachia on major Trichogramma species in

TI  - Studies on the rearing technique and host selection behaviors of spathius agrili yang
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorSpathius agrili Yang (Hymenoptera:Braconidae) is an important ectoparasitic wasp of the Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) larvae. This parasitoid has the potential to use as an excellent biological control agent for suppressing populations of its host. In order to utilize this natural enemy , the mass rearing techniques, Effects of temperature on development and reproduction of S. agrili, Sphenoptera sp. was used as a host for rearing of S. agrili and the inundative release experiments were conducted in field were mainly studied. This article studied the responses of S. agrili to volatiles by chemical ecology and behavior ecology to find the role of phytochemicals in host-finding of S. agrili. The main results are summarized as follows. The study on the growth,development and reproduction of S. agrili at 6 differernt temperatures (22℃, 24℃, 26℃, 28℃, 30℃, 32℃).The results showed that the developmental rate of egg , pupa and the whole generation of Spathius agrili yang increased with the rise of temperature from 22℃ to 32℃,but the developmental rate of larva was highest at 26℃.The developmental threshold temperature required for egg, larva, pupa and whole generation was 14.34℃,16.89℃,14.16℃ and 13.84℃, while the effective accumulated temperature was 24.59,61.16,166.27 and 276.80 degree_day, respectively. Temperature had different level effects on parasitic rate, the rate of successful parasitism, egg number, number of generations and sex ratio of S. agrili .The results showed that the temperature from 26℃ to 28℃ was suitable for the development and reproduction of S. agrili . This experiment designed five inoculating ways to mass rearing with stem-way, timber-way and wraped paper-way successfully reproducing the wasp. The parasitic rate was the largest when employing timber-way, reaching up to 87.50% and the average egg number was 6.14. The advantage of this way was less work; the parasitic rate was much lower in wraped paper-way which could not meet the requirement for reproducing parasitoids. After comparing these ways, the operation of stem-way was more simple and less labourious which was fit for mass rearing but the parasitic rate was relatively lower , in comparision with timber-way, and needed more improvement. Screening substitute hosts was a key factor in the process of mass rearing. This experiment has selected some larvaes of wood borers from parasitoid's natural surroundings and the larvae of Bupresidae to mass rearing. The rescult shows that Sphenoptera sp. could be successfully parasitized by S. agrili. To explore the possibility for S. agrili manage the A. planipennis, the field release was conducted. The parasitic rate was 15.38% before releasing parasitoid in the field. The parasitic rate was 53.85% next April which witnessed a remarkable increase in parasitic rate while the parasitic rate maintained above 46.15%, showing a huge effect. The female's behaviour was investigated by Y-tube olfactometer. The results indicated different volatile had such attraction to wasp that the leaves attracted by host > healthy leaves = the bark attracted by host > healthy bark > host larvae > frass, and the parasitoid showed preferences to the leaves attracted by host(p0.05), this indicated that the choice for hosts' residents of S. agrili mainly depended on the information given out by the leaves attracted by host. This information might come from plants' volatiles induced by pests and have something to with the cooperative effect between host plants and pest injury. EAG was used to test the S. agrili's antenna EAG response to four kinds source of volatiles and the results showed the relative value of EAG response to four kinds source was as follows: the leaves attracted by host > frass > the bark attracted by host > host larvae. The rescults also showed the significant EAG responses difference between the leaves attracted by host and blank, while between leaves attracted by host and host larvae (P<0.05). These results in this experiment were coherent with the results of Y-tube olfactometer. Antennae and their sensilla of S. agrili were observed using scanning electron microscopy. Both sexes of antenae were threadlike. Five types of sensilla were found on the antennae of female. They are sensilla trichodea, sensilla chaetica, sensilla placodea, sensilla basiconca and sensilla campaniformia, respectively. But only there types of sensilla were found on the antennae of male. The difference between sexes mainly related to the unique behaviour of females and males, so it could be presumed that sensilla basiconca and sensilla campaniformia play a greatly important role in host

TI  - Research on drought monitoring models of soil moisture with modis data
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorThe frequent occurrence of drought has seriously affected the human society and the sustainable development of economic. It also threatens the human survival natural environment. China is a drought-prone country, and drought has brought endless disaster since ancient times. So it is significative to get timely and accurate drought monitoring information for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives.This paper analyses the current status and development trends and discusses the advantages and shortages of the existing methods. On this basis, this paper emphasizes how to combine the remote sensing index and the traditional meteorological index to constitute drought monitoring integrated model, which will be applied to regional-scale drought monitoring with Hebei province as the experimental zone.Land surface temperature and normalized different vegetation index derived from MODIS are used to establish Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI) and Vegetation Supply Water Index (VSWI). The two indexes are applied as optional remote sensing indexes of the soil moisture drought monitoring. The most suitable remote sensing index is chosen based on which one is more sensitive to soil moisture according to specific time and region. The Percentage of Precipitation Difference and Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) are calculated from precipitation data. Through the experimental comparison and the error analysis, SPI is selected as the meteorological index of drought monitoring model. The commonly spatial interpolation approaches of punctate data for rainfall are studied, and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) is chosen according to comparison and analysis as the most suitable method, which is used to accomplish spatial interpolation of SPI. So SPI is translated into grid format to facilitate the combination with remote sensing index.Drought monitoring integrated model is established for every ten days of September in Hebei province as the experimental zone. It is worth noticing that models for every ten days are changed. The suitable remote sensing index is selected according to the responding MODIS data. The weights of remote sensing index and precipitation index are dynamically generated and measured by using the relativity to relative soil moisture(RSM). Images of relative soil moisture are derived from statistical model between drought monitoring integrated model and RSM. Graphs of drought level distribution in ten days are achieved based on the drought level standard of relative soil moisture. So it is realized to dynamically monitor drought of soil moisture.Accuracy evaluation of drought monitoring integrated model is applied in two aspects. First, predicted relative soil moisture (PRSM) is computed through statistical model, then scatter diagrams are drawn of RSM and PRSM. The results show that the scattered points is in the vicinity of a straight line's both sides, so integrated models are good and linear distribution. Second, RSM and the corresponding PRSM are compared and the comparison results are applied to error analysis. Taking one with another, the model inversion errors are quite small,which shows that the accuracy of regression model is

TI  - Environmental variation and life-history evolution: experiments on Caenorhabditis remanei
SP  - 1
AB  - The purpose of my project is to examine by what means, population history can influence the responsiveness of populations to environmental change. In order to approach this question I used a model species (Caenorhabditis remanei) and selection experiments in the laboratory.  It is recognised that heterogeneous environments select for plasticity. Thus, in order to manipulate the plasticity levels, I maintained populations for 50 generations in two different environments: constant temperature and predictably fluctuating temperature. Life-history components were quantified at three times during the course of the experiment (generation 1, 20 and 50). If plasticity is adaptive, it could be under strong selection in the fluctuating environment. After the selection experiment, comparisons between populations evolved in these different environments allowed me to quantify how two different evolutionary pressures shaped strains’ life history, and how this response depended on likely levels of genetic diversity (i.e. between the pure strains and the hybrid). In both environments, I found changes in the reproductive schedules. Although I did not detect significant changes in the lifetime fecundity after the selection experiment, females showed an increase in their early fecundity. This shift in reproductive parameters shows adaptation as a consequence of the environmental pressures. These results are in agreement with the theory of life-history evolution. In theory, a plastic genotype has a wider ecological breath compared with one with reduced or no plasticity. After 50 generations in each environment, populations were assayed at three temperatures to assess whether population history can influence the responsiveness of populations (e.g. tolerance to temperature). Higher levels of plasticity (i.e. tolerance) were expected in populations maintained in a fluctuating environment compared to the more stable environment. I found that worms from a fluctuating environment showed an increase in their tolerance to stressful conditions, while worms cultured in a constant environment showed no change. Thus, I successfully selected for populations with high and low levels of plasticity. Adaptive plasticity is expected to increase individual’s fitness across a range of environments because it expresses the “matching” phenotype according to environmental cues. However, a plastic genotype with the machinery to match the environment could be at disadvantage compared to a less plastic genotype when the environment is not changing. This disadvantage is expected to be linked to the reallocation of resources in the maintenance of genetic and cellular machinery that enables it to detect changes in the environment and in the production of the matching phenotype. Thus, to test this hypothesis, I translocated populations between the two environments. After the translocation, plastic worms moved back into the constant environment reproduced very poorly compared to worms before the selection took place and compared to the less plastic worms (reared in a constant environment). This strongly supports the idea that plastic strategies can turn an individual into “The Jack of all trades, but Master of none”.

TI  - Environmental and genetic determinants of host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics
SP  - 1
AB  - By using Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and its associated bacteriophage SBW25ø2 as a model I have attempted to investigate the role that environmental productivity has on host-parasite coevolution. The main issues are 1- The effect that environmental productivity has on the rate of coevolution. 2-The effect that environmental heterogeneity has on local adaptation and the evolution of infectivity and resistance ranges. 3-Whether pre-adaptation to abiotic conditions affect the outcome of coevolutionary interactions. 4-The effect that migration between rapidly coevolving communities (hot spots) and slow coevolving communities (cold spots) has on rate of coevolution, to determine whether hot spots can drive cold spots and vice versa 5- I looked at the within population coevolutionary dynamics of 2 populations, in order to determine the roles of individual clones on the fate of population dynamics 6- The effect that environmental productivity ahs on the evolution of specificity of bacteria/phage interactions. I found that 1- Increased environmental productivity accelerates coevolution, and that this is caused, in part, by increased cost of resistance in the least productive environments. 2- We observed increased resistance and infectivity ranges coevolving in the most productive environments. 3- We showed that bacterial pre-adaptation to the biotic environment made the effect of enviornemntal productivity on rate of coevolution non-significant. 4- Our results show that hot spots can drive cold spots, but not vice versa. 5- We observe very different dynamics between the two populations. There is evidence of multi-locus GFG persistent coevolution. 6- Dynamics between both treatments differed substantially. Productivity affects the extent to which selection is directional relative to fluctuating.

TI  - Macroeconomic analysis of global warming :intergenerational view and theoretical models
AB  - This dissertation conducts a theoretical analysis on emission-reduction decisions dealing with global warming and their effects on economy-environment system. This analysis is entirely based on two models, the Discrete- time Model and the Continuous-time Model. Reflecting considerations of intergenerational relationship, the two models are classified to the widely accepted 'representative agent model', which originated from Ramsey (1928) and has been recently developed to explore relations between economic growth and environmental protections with new thoughts of sustainable development and intergenerational equity. Although it is basically from view of macroeconomics, the author proves that, this type of models can be equivalently transformed to an overlapping-generation model, which has better interpretations of microeconomics. The models also follow the structures and functions of frequently used Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of global warming. Beyond this, the author boldly proceeds abstracts and simplifications to balance mathematical tractability and practical reasonability. Other features such as utility measuring of temperature also distinguish the models. Using mathematical methods of dynamic optimization, the author deduces the basic models and the sensitivity of some important factors, and discusses other important issues by model extensions. Some computing simulations of the discrete time model are also carried out. The main conclusions are below: 1. Earlier emission-reduction is necessitated when considering the intergenerational equity, because it can make more offspring enjoy more comfortable temperatures. This conclusion is also the outcome of involving utility of temperature in our models. 2. In the case of finite time horizon, the nearer to present generations, the more reductions are needed. For infinite time, the author proved the existence of a steady state, on which each generation must proceed the same level of reductions. The time path of abatement costs leading to the steady state is partly determined by the utility valuation of temperatures. 2. If growth of population or potential emissions is unlimited, abatement costs will be raised forever, that is, one generation after another. However, effects of technical progress and uncertainty exert ambiguous influences, which can either increase or decrease abatement costs.Alternate abstract:于通行的代表性代理人模型一类。它的原型是Ramsey(1928)提出的；在近期的研究中被赋本文对全球变暖的减排对策加强经济－环境影响进行了理论分析。全部的分析基于两个模型?D?D离散时间模型和连续时间模型。模型是在考虑代际关系的背景下提出来的，属予了代际公平和可持续发展的新涵义，用于研究经济增长与环境保护的关系。模型虽然是基于宏观视角的，但作者证明了，在适当的假定下，这一代表性代理人模型可以等价于代际交叠模型，从而具有较好的微观基础。模型还和全球变暖问题研究上广泛运用的综合评价模型 (IAMs)在结构和功能上保持一致，不同的是，作者做了大胆的简化和抽象，既保证模型的解析可推导性，又不失其对实践的指导意义。同时，模型的某些方面，如引入气温的效用，也是过去的模型所不具备的。 作者运用动态最优化的数学方法，在对基本模型进行推导的基础上，讨论了部分参数变化的影响，并通过模型扩展分析了一些重要的影响因素。对离散时间模型还进行了实际估算。通过研究，作者得到的主要结论归纳为： 1． 考虑代际公平的最优减排对策要求我们尽早进行减排，这样可以使更多的后代享受适宜的气温。这也是气温上升的效用损失直接引入模型的结果。 2． 对于计划期有限的减排对策，则离当代越近的各代需要进行越多的减排；而对于计划期无限的减排对策，作者证明了存在一种稳定的状态，各代人之间要进行同样多的减排，至于达到稳态的减排时间路径是上升还是下降的，取决于人们对气温变化的效用评价。 3． 人口增长和潜在排放上升如果是无止境的，那么减排成本必须是逐代提高的。技术进步和不确定性等影响则不能肯定，可能会导致减排成本的上升或下降。

TI  - Characterization of the Multidomain Nsp2 Replicase Protein of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
SP  - 173
AB  - This dissertation focused on understanding the biology of the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the etiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). PRRSV nsp2 is a multidomain protein, containing a putative N-terminal cysteine protease PL2 domain, a 500-700aa middle region of unknown function, a transmembrane domain and a C-terminal tail with uncertainty. In this dissertation, we report the following. (i) PRRSV nsp2 is undergoing rapid evolution in field strains exemplified by viral isolates MN184A and B. (ii) We showed that PRRSV nsp2 hypervariable regions aa12-35 and aa324-813 were not essential for viral replication in MARC-145 cells by using a reverse genetics system based on strain VR-2332. In contrast, deletion of the cysteine protease PL2 core domain, the PL2 downstream flanking sequence (aa181-323), the predicted transmembrane domain and the C-terminal domain were lethal to the virus. (iii) We provided evidence that the nsp2 protein encodes an active PL2 protease and mediates nsp2/3 processing in CHO cells with a substrate preference for the dipeptide G1196|G1197. The PL2 protease possessed both trans- and cis-cleavage activities, which could be distinguished by point mutations. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that mutations that caused a specific loss of trans function of the PL2 protease, but not cis activity, were detrimental to the virus. In addition, we showed that the conserved aspartic acid residues (e.g., Asp89) played an important role in the PL2 trans-cleavage activity. (iv) We investigated the proteolytic processing of nsp2 in MARC-145 cells using recombinant PRRSV expressing foreign epitope-tagged nsp2 protein. We showed the presence of the nsp2 protein as different isoforms in PRRSV-infected cells, which appeared to share the same N terminus but differed in their respective C-termini. The nsp2 species emerged almost simultaneously in the early stage of PRRSV infection, were stable and had low turnover rates. Deletion mutagenesis suggested that the smaller nsp2 species (e.g. nsp2d, e and f) were not essential for viral replication in cell culture. Lastly, a cellular protein, heat shock 70kDa protein 5 (HSPA5), was identified as a coimmunoprecipitate of nsp2.

TI  - A cold and harsh environment: Demography and spatial ecology of a northern population of wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta)
SP  - 176
AB  - Natural history studies of geographically distinct populations are important for informing and implementing management strategies for species at risk. Wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) are a species of Special Concern (COSEWIC) in Canada and are considered Vulnerable internationally (IUCN). Their species at risk status is attributed to their habitat specificity and thus patchy distribution across the northeastern portion of North America. The purpose of this study was to assess population health, spatial ecology, and habitat requirements of an unstudied wood turtle population in the Sudbury District of Ontario at the species' northern limit while testing for variation in life history strategies (e.g. body size) across the species' latitudinal range. A mark-recapture and radiotelemetry study was conducted from 1 May 2005 to 19 October 2006 to describe home range size, movement patterns, and habitat, temperature, and hibernacula selection. A total of 900 ha of habitat were classified and a 1.5 km of river was quantified for selection studies. I hypothesized that wood turtles at their northern limit would have larger body and home range sizes and would travel greater distances during a shorter annual activity cycle compared to southern conspecifics as a result of a less productive environment in the north. I also hypothesized that optimal hibernacula characteristics (e.g. dissolved oxygen, protection from predators and freezing temperatures) may be limiting, therefore fidelity to hibernacula or communal overwintering may be common. I found that the wood turtle population in the Sudbury District was large (56 ± 15 turtles) and healthy, with equal sex-ratios, high juvenile capture rates (35%), and that recruitment had occurred over each of the last 11 years. Moreover, latitudinal differences in body size were apparent with larger body sizes in the northern and southern portions of the species' range but relatively small body sizes in the middle of the range and home range sizes increased with latitude. Wood turtles in the Sudbury District had the largest home ranges among populations reported in the literature (59.4 ha (100% MCP)). Wood turtles selected riverine habitats throughout the annual activity cycle; however, early in spring, selection was for ephemeral pools and upland deciduous habitat that may provide a rich food resource and good basking opportunities. Wood turtles basked from 1 May to mid-June but became thermal conformers for the rest of the annual activity cycle; however, females became thermal conformers with air and males became thermal conformers with water. During winter, wood turtles selected environments that were high in dissolved oxygen (∼ 90%), had temperatures that approached 0°C, and had short ice durations compared to other water bodies used by other turtle species at the study site. Moreover, fidelity was not shown across years; therefore, hibernacula are likely not a limiting factor for the species' distribution in the north. These data are important for the creation and implementation of management strategies for the local population of wood turtles but can also be used to assess conservation needs across the species' range. I provide management recommendations for this population in each chapter and as a conclusion to the thesis.

TI  - Population genetics and life history evolution in the sea anemone family Edwardsiidae
SP  - 255
AB  - Genetic diversity enables populations to rapidly adapt to changing environments, and it contains the seeds of future evolutionary change. The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, is an informative species for studying the factors (life history, gene flow, selection) that impact genetic diversity in coastal estuaries and assessing how this diversity may provide raw material for local adaptation. N. vectensis is found in salt marsh habitats along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America and southeast England. Population genetic structure from 24 populations throughout N. vectensis' range was surveyed with a combination of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), microsatellites and sequence-based markers. The data reveal: (1) a striking degree of genetic structure between populations, (2) multiple instances of anthropogenic introduction from the Atlantic coast of the United States to the Pacific coast and to England, and (3) substantial variability among locations in the contribution of asexual reproduction. A three-year study of Sippewissett, MA revealed the distribution and genetic structure of subpopulations is considerable within a single estuary and changed among years; in addition recently colonized pools can harbor extensive genetic diversity. Leveraging >17,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), we developed a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 555 were high-confidence SNPs including 78 non-synonymous SNPs. Surprisingly, N. vectensis contained nonsynonomous polymorphisms in the highly conserved domains in two homeodomain-containing genes (tlx and rx) and a deiodinase gene. We detected significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in natural populations, suggesting that these polymorphisms could be under selection. Coincident with extensive genetic structure, laboratory studies revealed significant differences in phenotypic diversity among clonal lines collected from eight locations throughout N. vectensis' range—mostly along the steep thermal cline along the Atlantic coast of North America. Animals from more southerly latitudes exhibited higher growth rates above 29°C, while the growth rates of northern and southern populations were indistinguishable at 13°C suggesting local adaptation to warmer thermal environments. To put the intraspecific evolution of N. vectensis in its phylogenetic context, pilot studies were conducted on the life history, ecology, and genetic diversity of the closely related species Edwardsiella lineata that has evolved a novel parasitic life history.

TI  - Evolutionary change in human-altered habitats: Morphological shifts, differential selection, and environmental drivers of phenotypic plasticity in the lizard Anolis sagrei
SP  - 79
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine how anthropogenic change has impacted patterns of intraspecific morphological variation in the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, and the evolutionary processes underlying those patterns. Chapter 1 investigates whether anthropogenic habitat alteration has generated morphological divergence between natural and human-disturbed habitats across several islands in the Bahamas. Morphological analyses revealed that lizards inhabiting disturbed habitats were significantly larger in several morphological characters than those inhabiting natural habitats. The observed morphological divergence was found to exist despite high levels of gene flow between habitat types, highlighting the importance of ecology in driving this divergence. Chapter 2 examines whether human-induced changes in habitat structure have altered the strength and form of natural selection on hindlimb length. Mark-recapture data revealed that anthropogenic habitat alteration may promote diversification by creating divergent, highly localized selection regimes. Human-driven changes in habitat structure impacted both the strength and form of natural selection on hindlimb length in these lizards. In addition, fine-scale genetic differentiation was found to exist between populations inhabiting natural and disturbed habitats, creating the potential for long-term evolutionary consequences of divergent selection regimes. Together with Chapter 1, these results highlight the significant impact that human activities may have on the evolution of populations that persist in human-altered habitats. Chapter 3 investigates how environmental variation influences intraspecific morphological variation through phenotypic plasticity. Growth data from males and females reared in a laboratory under different food and thermal regimes demonstrated that environmental variation had sex-specific effects on growth and adult morphology. Males exhibited much higher variation in growth and adult body size in response to food-temperature treatments than females, indicating sex-specific plasticity in body size. This sex-specific response produced significant variation in sexual size dimorphism. The influence of environmental variation on sexual size dimorphism may have important evolutionary implications for Anolis lizards. Habitat-specific sexual size dimorphism among ecomorphs is thought to have ix arisen from differences in selection pressures related to habitat structure. Here I add an important element by demonstrating that variation in sexual dimorphism, at least at the intraspecific level, can arise from a plastic response to environmental variation.

TI  - Neutronic analysis stochastic distribution of fuel particles in Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactors
SP  - 146
AB  - The Very High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (VHTR) is a promising candidate for Generation IV designs due to its inherent safety, efficiency, and its proliferation-resistant and waste minimizing fuel cycle. A number of these advantages stem from its unique fuel design, consisting of a stochastic mixture of tiny (0.78mm diameter) microspheres with multiple coatings. However, the microsphere fuel regions represent point absorbers for resonance energy neutrons, resulting in the "double heterogeneity" for particle fuel. Special care must be taken to analyze this fuel in order to predict the spatial and spectral dependence of the neutron population in a steady-state reactor configuration. The challenges are considerable and resist brute force computation: there are over 1010 microspheres in a typical reactor configuration, with no hope of identifying individual microspheres in this stochastic mixture. Moreover, when individual microspheres "deplete" (e.g., burn the fissile isotope U-235 or transmute the fertile isotope U-238 (eventually) to Pu-239), the stochastic time-dependent nature of the depletion compounds the difficulty posed by the stochastic spatial mixture of the fuel, resulting in a prohibitive computational challenge. The goal of this research is to develop a methodology to analyze particle fuel randomly distributed in the reactor, accounting for the kernel absorptions as well as the stochastic depletion of the fuel mixture. This Ph.D. dissertation will address these challenges by developing a methodology for analyzing particle fuel that will be accurate enough to properly model stochastic particle fuel in both static and time-dependent configurations and yet be efficient enough to be used for routine analyses. This effort includes creation of a new physical model, development of a simulation algorithm, and application to real reactor configurations.

TI  - Hotel - Beirut: Architecture in the conflict city
SP  - 133
AB  - The post-conflict city is both a tragedy and opportunity; an environment of suffering, yet a fertile landscape for reconstruction. An architect's typical relation to an armed conflict environment is as an agent of reconstruction once fighting stops. But what of a city where conflict is continuous and interminable? How does an architect intervene in a conflict city? My thesis proposes an architectural intervention that recognizes an urban condition where hot and cold conflict are states of a fluctuating environmental condition. As the conditions change, spaces might adapt and architectural elements react, whether by physical operations, shifts in program, or accommodation of different users and occupations. Much of the conflict logic that is embedded throughout is inspired by strategies and spatial reappropriations that civilians employ to cope with a never ending conflict condition. Designing for the conflict condition does not suggest perpetuating its continuance. Rather, propositions which recognize varying degrees of hostilities within the urban fabric allow for the generation of unique spatial configurations, both formal and programmatic, with potential for diverse social and cultural use when conflict is cold, or what the idealist would consider times of relative peace.

TI  - A study on the starvation and recovery response of the ammonia oxidizing bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea
SP  - 211
AB  - The chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria, which utilize ammonia (NH3) as their sole energy source, are noted for their survival during NH3 starvation. The starvation response of ammonia oxidizing bacteria is characterized by high viability, high stability of macromolecular cellular components, low maintenance energy requirements, and the maintenance of an active electron transport chain. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria maintain a state of readiness that allows them to immediately begin oxidizing ammonia, even after long-term starvation. This work has evaluated the recovery from starvation physiology of Nitrosomonas europaea in comparison to actively growing and starved cells. It was hypothesized that energy generation would be prioritized over energy consumption during the initial phase of recovery since the first reaction in the ammonia oxidation pathway is energy dependent. Through genome wide transcriptome analysis and more focused studies on the regulation of ammonia oxidation, CO2 fixation, and stress response, it was found that starved cells exhibited a massive downregulation of transcription. In addition, translation in starved cells is likely inactive due to a starvation induced ribosome modification at a site that controls trans location of the ribosome. The stress response that is typically induced in starved heterotrophic bacteria appeared to be absent in starved cells of N. europaea. Upon recovery from starvation, stress response genes were upregulated and are hypothesized to be part of a post-starvation cellular repair system. Examination of a strain of N. europaea that lacks the global stress response regulator, RpoH, demonstrated a significant role of stress response in an efficient exit from starvation. The data also show that stress responsive σ E promoters control expression of the duplicate operon copies of amoC (encoding an ammonia monooxygenase subunit) and a divergent monocistronic copy of amoC (amoC3). Further analysis demonstrated that the divergent AmoC3 copy is involved in maintaining ammonia oxidation activity at elevated temperatures and is possibly involved in mediating the recovery of ammonia oxidation activity following starvation under high oxygen tension or at low cell densities. Overall, the studies described here have significantly advanced our understanding of both ammonia oxidation and the starvation and recovery response of ammonia oxidizing bacteria.

TI  - Slaves to the Eyring Equation? Temperature Dependence of Life-History Characters in Developing Ectotherms
SP  - 179
AB  - This thesis investigates to what extent the thermodynamics of biological rates constrains the thermal adaptation of developing ectotherms. The biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield model is applied to explain the temperature dependence of body size in ectotherms, to predict the temperature tolerance limits in developing ectotherms and to predict patterns of thermal adaptation within and among species. If the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is applied to model the temperature dependence of growth and differentiation rate separately, then the temperature dependence of size at maturity follows from the interaction between these processes. Recent studies have shown that this approach provides an explanatory framework for all ectotherms, which obey the Temperature-size Rule, the observation that ectotherms at high temperatures grow and develop faster to a smaller size at maturity compared to low temperatures, but also to the exceptions of this rule. The Sharpe-Schoolfield equation basically consist of two parts: the numerator, which is formed by the Eyring equation, models the exponential increase of reaction rates with temperature based on reaction kinetics, and the denominator, which describes the reversible temperature-induced inactivation of enzymes. If the denominator is applied to a genetic control system of the cell cycle, it can be shown that the temperature tolerance limits are accurately predicted in range of insect species. It is argued that reversible temperature-induced inactivation of regulatory components of the cell cycle mimics the dosage change during the cell cycle. The Eyring equation is also successfully applied to cross-species comparisons of thermal adaptation in a large group of related frogs and toads. The recently developed model of Universal Temperature Dependence is critically discussed and it is argued that the predictions are partly based on incorrect assumptions and biased use of literature data. Furthermore, the supposed invariant biophysical parameters may vary in response to thermal adaptation. When ectotherms adapt to lower temperatures (horizontal shift) a correlated response occurs of a wider thermal range (specialist-generalist shift), a smaller slope (sensitivity shift) and lower activity (vertical shift). This correlated response is mainly determined by the Eyring equation. The enzyme activity-stability tradeoff is the most important thermodynamic constraint and limits the viable development of most ectotherms to a relative small thermal tolerance range of approximately 20°C. It is argued that this correlated response does not limit evolution within thermal environments, but instead may be one of the drivers of evolution and consequently biodiversity. The overall conclusion is that the biophysical Sharpe-Schoolfield equation is an excellent model to study thermal adaptation in ectotherms.

TI  - The research on biological characteristics and pearl performance of hyriopsis schlegelii
AB  - Translation from original language as provided by authorHyriopsis schlegelii which was original distributed in Japan is the famous freshwater clam, it is various species of the genus Hyriopsis cumingii which was original distributed in China. It was introduced into China by Nancheng Reservoir Exploitation Company in Fuzhou in 1997. In this research, we focus on the biological characteristics, propagation and artificial breeding techniques and pearl performance characteristics. In order to provide some theoretical and practice instructions of freshwater pearl cultivation in our country, to work out the problem of unitary species of pearl clam, to promote a healthy and sustainable development of freshwater pearl cultivation. First, the biological characters were investigated. The external and internal morphology of H. schlegelii are almost as same as H.cumingii wit regional variations. The countable and measurable properties data indicated that shell width of H. schlegeli is as1.23 times as H.cumingii. Paraffin section and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) observations showed the crystalline style of H. schlegeli is longer and larger diameter than H.cumingii, the mantle depth of H. schlegeli is as1.78 times as H.cumingii, and the nacre shell is 2.08 times. The basic unit of structure of nacre is aragonite tablet, which become more and more thickly as the growth of H.Cumingii. The average growth speed of H. schlegeli is faster than H.cumingii, which were the same sizes, culture density and cultured in the same water. Second, the propagation and artificial breeding techniques of H. schlegeli was carried out. The results demonstrated that 3 years old H. schlegeli are partial maturation and 4 years old clam are the best ones, they also keep this capability till 6 winter ages. The season of propagation is from May to July, can ovulate many times, and the ovum matured at different times, one matured female clam can ovulate 4~5 times per year. The results showed that the glochidia of H. schlegeli were hooked. The optimum temperature range of the embryonic development was 24~36℃, the hatching time of the embryonic development more shorter when the temperature is higher than 30℃, the accumulated temperature of the embryonic development was 247.2℃. In the host fish, the number of glochidia was varied in the part of body, number of branchias was most, and diposefins was least, the average number of parasitic is 1985 per fish. The average fecundity of selective F3 generation was 13.9 thousands per one, and the survival rate of larvae was 82.6%. The survival rate of preparation clam for nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing were 86% and 82.3%, and the compliance rates for operating were 78% and 95%. Third, pearl performance was carried out on H. schlegeli and H.cumingii, including nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing. The results indicated H. schlegeli has significantly high advantage in pearl performance than H.cumingii. The survival rate of operative mussel of H.schlegeli was higher than H.cumingii both of nucleated pearl producing and all-nacre pearl producing. The thickness of pearl layer and the quality of pearl in nucleated pearl, the yield of all-nacre pearl were also better than H.cumingii, especially in three kinds of best all-nacre pearl, which the diameter are 8mm, 9mm and more than 10mm. At the same time, the pearl performance of F3 generation was better than F2 generation, it indicated the advantage of selective improved variety. The results indicated that H. schlegeli has best morphology for culturing pearl, the propagation and artificial breeding techniques were matured, the pearl performance was better H.cumingii.

TI  - Simulation of the NPP in the eight districts of Beijing city based on remote sensing in Beijing
AB  - Vegetation has a very important impact on the global energy cycle and biochemical cycle. Leaf Area Index (LAI), Net Primary Product(NPP) are two important paraments of vegetation of deriving biophysical and biochemical paraments, and simulating carbon cycle. This study aims to simulating NPP and LAI of Beijing using TM image. LAI, defined as the half the total surface area of leaf per-unit ground area, is a key structure parameter of vegetation canopy, and accurate LAI is critical for understanding biological and physical process associated with vegetation. NPP is defined as the net amount of new carbon absorbed by plants per-unit of area and time. NPP can show the growth status of vegetation, so provide the compositive information for the management of regeneration resources. Furthermore, NPP, as an important component of carbon cycle in biosphere, is also very important in the research of global change. The BEPS model was used for simulation. At the same time the experimental data was used to modify the BEPS model. The research steps are as following: 1. The Beijing vegetation samples in different ages, different density, and different species were selected in the experiment. The LAI and NPP were calculated from measured LAI, diamantes and height of the trees. 2. TM image of Beijing was processed including corrections of radiance and geometry. Then, it was classified by decision tree classification method. SR and NDVI vegetation index calculated from image was used to derive LAI. Thereby the biomass of vegetation was also derived. 3. Because of the requirement of BEPS model, the temporal LAI image data with the same resolution is gotten from 9 different times TM. 4. NPP in the study area was simulated by prepared data such as LAI, annual land cover type, daily meteorological data (radiation, precipitation, temperature and humidity), available soil water holding capacity (AWC) and biomass.Alternate abstract:植被对全球能量循环及物质的生物化学循环具有重要的影响。叶面积指数、生物量和净第一性生产力等是表征植被特征的重要参数。反演生物物理学参数，模拟生态系统循环是评价生态环境变化的重要手段。 本文旨在利用TM遥感影像反演北京市城八区植被的叶面积指数（LAI）、净第一性生产力（NPP）。叶面积指数定义为单位地表面积上总叶表面积的一半，它作为一个重要的冠层结构参数，对于理解与植被相关的生物物理过程是非常重要的。因此叶面积指数的获取具有非常重要的意义；净第一性生产力是指绿色植被在单位时间、单位面积上由光合作用所产生的有机物质总量中扣除自养呼吸后剩余的部分。净第一性生产力一方面它可以反映植物的生长状况，为可再生资源管理提供高质量的综合信息；另一方面它是生物圈碳循环的重要分量，在全球气候变化研究中占有重要的地位。为了模拟LAI和NPP，本文利用碳水耦合的遥感过程模型BEPS（Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator），结合实地测量的叶面积指数以及以往的经验，对BEPS模型进行修正，最终得出北京城八区植被的LAI、NPP分布情况。本文主要有以下几个研究步骤： 1. 根据研究需要，进行研究区实验设计并实施实验内容，主要有：研究区内选取不同年龄段、不同疏密程度、不同种类的人工植被，进行树木LAI、胸径、树高等数据的采集，从而计算样地实测的LAI； 2. 对于研究区对应的TM遥感影像进行辐射纠正、几何纠正等图像预处理。对图像进行分类，细化研究区的植被覆盖类型。计算相应的植被指数，利用植被指数反演生物量和LAI； 3. 由于BEPS模型需要有研究区全年的LAI数据，利用TM不同时相的9景数据分别进行LAI的反演，得到全年的时间序列的LAI； 4. 运用以上几步准备好的相应研究区的逐日最高最低气温、日总辐射、相对湿度、降水量、土壤持水量、时间序列的LAI、土地覆盖类型以及生物量数据，利用BEPS模型，模拟出了北京市城八区植被的净第一性生产力，并利用实测数据进行了验证。

TI  - The genetic dissection of differential growth in Plasmodium falciparum and its relationship to chloroquine drug selection
SP  - 160
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum malaria is responsible for severe morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Anti-malarials used to treat malaria, such as chloroquine (CQ), exhibit increased failure and have an effect on the parasite genome potentially resulting in differences in parasite growth. Differences in erythrocytic growth rates between parasite clones affect parasite virulence (Chotivanich et al., 2000; Dondorp et al., 2005). Parasite growth is complex, composed of discrete biological steps contributing to differences in overall ‘growth.’ To identify genes and mechanisms regulating differential growth, a series of phenotypes ranging from bulk growth (e.g. blood smears and Hx-incorporation) to its nested steps (merozoite production, invasion efficiency, and cycle time) were measured in progeny of a cross between a CQ resistant and CQ sensitive parasite, Dd2 and HB3 respectively, and used in quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Progeny exhibit quantitative distributions of growth in all five growth assays. Significant QTLs from the two bulk growth assays and cycle time produce a preliminary list of 167 candidate genes. An unbiased method using whole genome datasets and bioinformatics was developed to prioritize the list. Putative functions were assigned using protein network datasets, gene expression correlations, and gene ontology enrichment resulting in a final list of 22 candidates. A relationship between parasite growth and drug sensitivity is observed in CQR parasites but not CQS parasites; suggessting CQ selection has altered the parasite genome and parasite fitness as measured by growth. Progeny inheriting ‘D’ alleles at three random markers are absent less often compared to progeny inheriting mixed alleles. This suggests the Dd2 genome is fitter. When progeny inherit a resistant pfcrt allele, there is an increase in the percent of absent progeny with ‘D’ alleles at three markers. Therefore CQ resistant progeny suffer from a fitness cost. Specific alleles implicated in the ‘CQR background’ were used to ask about parasite fitness and lethality support the idea that CQ selection alters the parasite genome by causing compensatory mutations in response to a cost to resistance. These compensatory mutations affect other parasite phenotypes such as growth. This hypothesis is further supported by observed growth differences in CQ-selected mutant lines.

TI  - High-density thermoelectric power generation and nanoscale thermal metrology
AB  - Thermoelectric power generation has been around for over 50 years but has seen very little large scale implementation due to the inherently low efficiencies and powers available from known materials. Recent material advances appear to have improved the technology's prospects. In this work we show that significantly increased generated power densities are possible even for established material technologies provided that parasitic losses are controlled and effective strategies are found for handling the large resulting heat fluxes. We optimize the performance of a thermoelectric generator in this regime, and discuss fundamental performance limits in this context. We present a design of a thermoelectric generator using conventional material and a microchannel heat sink that we predict can generate many times the power of a conventional thermoelectric, at a comparable efficiency. A high temperature vacuum test station is used to characterize the power generation, efficiency, and material properties of thermoelectric materials and generators. The results of a series of studies on various bulk and thin-film materials are presented, as well as packaged generator performance. The method of CCD thermoreflectance imaging is pursued in this thesis as a quantitative means for making non-contact temperature measurements on solid-state samples at the micro- and nano-scale. We develop and test a theory of the instrument and the measurement process to rigorously characterize the accuracy and precision of the resulting thermal images. We experimentally demonstrate sub-micron spatial resolution and sub-20 mK temperature resolution with this tool. High-resolution thermal images of thermoelectric elements, polysilicon-gate field effect transistors, and other integrated electronic devices are presented.

TI  - The development of palladium-catalysts for organic synthesis
AB  - Chapter 1. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions of aryl and heteroaryl halides with aryl-, heteroaryl and vinyl boronic acids proceed in very good to excellent yield with the use of 2-(2',6'-dimethoxybiphenyl)-dicyclohexylphosphine, SPhos. Additionally, a comparison of the reactions with SPhos and with 2-(2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl)-diphenylphosphine is presented that is informative in determining the relative importance of ligand bulk and electron-donating ability in the high activity of catalysts derived from ligands of this type. Further, when the aryl bromide becomes too hindered, an interesting C-H bond functionalization-cross-coupling sequence intervenes to provide product in high yield. Chapter 2. The direct transformation of aryl bromides into the corresponding Weinreb amides via Pd-catalyzed aminocarbonylation at atmospheric pressure is described. Electron-deficient, -neutral and -rich aryl bromides were all efficiently transformed to product. Furthermore, the process tolerates a wide variety of functional groups, is mild, and is operationally simple. Chapter 3. A general, functional group tolerant, and mild system for the Pd-catalyzed Heck carbonylation of aryl chlorides into the corresponding benzamides has been developed. This catalyst operates at one atmosphere of carbon monoxide using an inexpensive, air-stable and commercially available ligand. A variety of aryl chlorides were all successfully transformed to the corresponding amides using primary, a-branched primary, cyclic secondary, acyclic secondary, or aryl amines. Additionally, the mechanism of this reaction was studied using in situ IR spectroscopy and revealed the unique effect of sodium phenoxide in this reaction. Chapter 4. Pressurized microreactor systems greatly expand the range of reaction conditions and accelerate gas-liquid mass transfer. Heck aminocarbonylation reactions exemplify the potential for quickly and safely scanning of reagents and reaction conditions (1 to 15 bar and 100 - 160degC). The results reveal a general trend of increased yield of amide with temperature and selectivity for alpha-ketoamide production at lower temperature and higher pressure.

TI  - Electrical and thermal characterization of carbon nanofibers for interconnect and packaging applications
AB  - Copper interconnect technology is rapidly approaching its scaling limit due to a variety of factors involved with reducing feature size including: increasing resistivity, reliability concerns due to electromigration, and excessive power dissipation related to ever-increasing clock frequencies. The aim of this work is to present a series of fundamental electrical and thermal measurements and models to demonstrate the viability of implementing carbon nanofiber (CNF) structures into next-generation integrated circuit technologies. Through the use of various characterization techniques, the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of CNFs are revealed, and show great potential for carbon-based nanostructures in integrated circuit applications. The temperature-dependent electrical characteristics of vertically aligned CNF arrays for on-chip interconnect applications are presented. The electrical application of CNFs for on-chip interconnects is explored in three parts. First, the electron transport mechanisms in these structures are investigated using I-V measurements over a broad temperature range (4K-300K). The measured resistivity of CNF arrays is modeled based on known two-dimensional electron conduction mechanism in a disordered medium. The model assumptions are verified using high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) of the CNF-metal interface. Second, based on the developed low-temperature CNF conduction model, the ideal material for efficient electron transport is found to be a-axis graphite, exhibiting a morphology closely resembling multi-wall carbon nanotubes. To this end, palladium was used as a catalyst material for the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of CNFs as an alternative to nickel to improve the graphtic structure of the CNF. Finally, electrical reliability measurements are performed at different temperatures to demonstrate the robust nature and high current carrying capability of CNFs for interconnect applications. Thermal properties of CNFs are investigated using a novel copper (Cu)-embedded CNF array for thermal management applications. Fabrication of the composite material is based on techniques derived from high-aspect ratio copper filling. A copper electrochemical deposition (ECD) recipe is developed for optimal gap filling between the CNFs in the array. Two types of thermal resistance characterization are performed on the CNF-Cu composite: (1)An ASTM D-5470 based characterization technique and (2)A photothermal analysis technique. Both results agree well and demonstrate the high thermal conductance of the CNF-Cu composite for thermal interface material applications. A variety of modeling techniques are employed to investigate temperature-dependent characteristics of CNFs. Low-temperature modeling is performed to investigate the conductivity limit of CNFs and to elucidate the physics of electron conduction within the material. Electrothermal effects are modeled using tunneling theory to describe electron transport across electrode-CNF interfaces, and the effects of contact annealing. Since self-heating effects are pivotal in one-dimensional conductors and interconnects, electrothermal modeling is of absolute necessity to describe Joule heating-induced breakdown in the CNF. The modeling work performed here enhances our understanding of the coupled effects between electrical and thermal transport in CNFs.

TI  - Evolutionary and functional genomics of bacteria from the cold deep sea
SP  - 182
AB  - Chapter 1 introduces the deep sea environment. Recent studies of sequence-independent diversity of deep-sea microbial communities are reviewed and reanalyzed. These are compared to sequence-dependent studies evidencing the need for new culturing and isolation methods for deep-sea bacteria. The chapter ends by reviewing the current state-of-the-art of deep-sea genetics and genomics and describes the general features of the genomes of piezophiles. Chapter 2 describes the development of three new vectors for use in Photobacterium profundum and other Gram-negative bacteria. The first one (pEE3) is a suicide vector for insertional inactivation of genes. The second one is a general purpose cloning vector (pFL122) based on the broad-host-range replicon RSF1010. The third one is a broad-host-range vector carrying an arabinose-inducible promoter to use for gene expression studies. Chapter 3 explores the diversity evolution of cultured piezophiles. Three novel strains of piezophilic bacteria were isolated, one of them being the first Gram-positive piezophile ever isolated. Most of the cultured piezophiles, belong only to a narrow range of phylogenetic lineages which cluster within clades of known psychrophiles. In the ensuing discussion the hypothesis that cold-adapted piezophiles might evolve from polar water psychrophiles and disseminated through deep-sea oceanic currents is presented. During the study specific ribosomal RNA features of the 16S of piezophiles were identified. These features are correlated with the pressure adaptation of the strains. Chapter 4 describes a high-throughput transposon mutagenesis approach to identify genes important for growth at low temperature and high pressure. These genes belong to a wide variety of categories which are discussed in detail. A large fraction of the mutants impaired in growth at low temperature had gene disruptions in genes for the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, providing the first direct evidence of the role of the cell envelope in adaptation to low temperature. Chapter 5 presents the results of the sequencing and the analysis of the genome of the shallow water strain P. profundum 3TCK. The genome is compared to that of the deep-water strain P. profundum SS9 identifying unique regions that might be conferring fitness in different habitats. Among these is a cluster of genes for motility important for swimming in high viscosity found only in the deep-water strain, a set of genes for UV resistance found only in the shallow water strain, and the specific rRNA features described in chapter 3 found only in the deep-water strain. The motility gene clusters are further characterized evidencing the role for particular flagellins and motor proteins for swimming at high pressure. The UV and ribosomal features are exchanged between the shallow- and the deep-water strains and the phenotypes of the resulting strains are characterized.

TI  - Biodiversity patterns in tropical montane rainforest flora of Costa Rica
SP  - 123
AB  - This dissertation examines patterns of plant biodiversity and distribution of understory shrubs in the pantropical and specious family, Rubiaceae, in montane rainforest in Costa Rica. Conducting vegetation surveys between 100 and 2800 m along a continuous elevational gradient in old growth tropical rainforest, I tested the predictions of competing hypotheses for species richness patterns across various environmental gradients. These hypotheses included mid domain effect, area effect, climatic variables, and environmental variables such as soil nutrients. Results indicated a peak in species richness in the mid-elevations, with rainfall best predicting richness. A test of species propagation methods and a common garden transplant design enabled an investigation into the vulnerability of understory species to increasing temperatures associated with global climate change. A factorial design identified the most effective propagation methods for cuttings across substrate, chemical applications of rooting hormone, cutting type and life form within six species of the genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae). Cutting survival and biomass accumulation were not influenced by use of rooting hormone. The effects of substrate, cutting type and growth form produced significantly different results with the greatest survival in forest soil treatments in shadehouses, using stem cuttings and small shruby growth forms. Physiological examinations of leaf temperature tolerance for species in the genus Psychotria, specifically investigating the performance of the photosystem II, revealed complex patterns of response to predicted warming. Within naturally occurring individuals along the elevational gradient and cuttings transplanted to a common garden, there were little direct effects of temperature on photosystem II, due to broad temperature tolerances. However, biomass accumulation was reduced with increased warming demonstrating an important direct effect on productivity. Species responses to key factors such as temperature and rainfall are complex and species-specific but overall, as shown here, they influence the distribution of biodiversity in montane tropical ecosystems. Accurately predicting the effects of global climate change on the future distributions of tropical species enables us to assess the vulnerability of montane rainforests to global warming and better strive towards its protection for future generations, particularly where biodiversity is high in the mid-elevations, which are poorly protected in existing reserves.

TI  - Spiraling evolutionary patterns in cycling environments: The experimental evolution of physiologically superior ecological generalists
SP  - 131
AB  - This dissertation examines spiraling evolutionary patterns in cycling environments to rigorously test evolutionary hypotheses related to fitness and trade-offs, and also simulate realistic ecological conditions to bridge the disciplines of experimental evolution to environmental microbiology, using enteric bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental system. The first study examines evolutionary responses of the bacteria to an environmental acidic-alkaline range between pH 5.3 and 7.8 (15-5000nM[H+]). General hypotheses about adaptation to abiotic variables and coliform organism response to changing environments were tested. Six replicate lines of E. coli evolved for 2,000 generations at one of four different constant pH conditions: pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0 or 7.8. Both direct and correlated fitness changes in these environments were measured relative to the ancestor in direct competition experiments. This second study examines evolutionary responses to environmental acidity fluctuating temporally among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8 (5000-15nM[H +]). Two distinct temporal variations were used. One group of populations evolved for 2000 generations in a cycled regime fluctuating daily between a constant pH 5.3 and 7.8 cycle. The other group evolved during exposure for 2000 generations to a randomly shifting regime fluctuating stochastically day-by-day between pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0 or 7.8. Relative fitness changes were measured by direct competition experiments in both constant and stochastic pH regimes. This study initiated the first long-term natural selection experiment on adaptation to variable pH, investigating patterns of trade-offs, specialists, generalists, and acclimation in temporally fluctuating environments. The third study investigated Escherichia coli growth and survival in a novel "Host to Coast" laboratory Analog simulating an 11-day sequence cycling through the pH and temperature conditions of the small intestine, colon, sewer, seawater, human stomach, and back into the small intestine. This study investigated the evolutionary roles of pH and temperature in evolving increased growth and survival fitness of E. coli in environments of coastal seawater and human host. Patterns, such as high alkalinity evolving high growth fitness in seawater, are discussed. Results may have future implications for wastewater treatment/release into marine waters for the prevention of evolving superior strains of pathogenic E. coli.

TI  - Phylogeny, taxonomy, character evolution, and biogeography of glassfrogs (Amphibia: Centrolenidae)
SP  - 248
AB  - The present study provides a new hypothesis of the evolutionary relationships of Glassfrogs (Centrolenidae) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear loci, and addresses questions on the evolution and speciation of the group. Ingroup sampling includes 55.5% of the named taxa in the family, representing most of the phenotypic diversity described for the group. As outgroups, I included 35 species, most of which represent families traditionally associated with Glassfrogs. Gene sampling consisted of complete or partial sequences of three mitochondrial (12S, 16S, ND1) and three nuclear markers ( c-myc exon 2, RAG1, POMC) for a total of ∼4362 bp. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses for individual genes and combined datasets. The importance of analyzing mitochondrial and molecular datasets separately is discussed, with particular emphasis on the ways in which this approach clarifies interpretations of relationships within Glassfrogs and other Neotropical anurans. Based on the phylogeny obtained, I propose a new taxonomy of Glassfrogs and its sister taxon Allophryne ruthveni. This arrangement formalizes clades that have significant statistical support under Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian inference criteria, and that, in most cases, are phenotipically diagnosable. Centrolenid diversity is arranged into two subfamilies and a total of 12 genera, seven of which are new. Using Maximum Likelihood and Parsimony, I explore the evolution of morphological and behavioral features that characterize this unique group of Neotropical anurans. Each trait that has been postulated to trace relationships unambiguously in this group turns out to have had a complex evolutionary history with multiple origins and losses. Complete ventral transparency has evolved multiple independent times under all models of reconstruction, even those biased toward single origins. I demonstrate that repeated evolution of transparency has a significant inverse correlation across phylogeny with the presence of iridophores, which are hypothesized to protect internal organs from detrimental effects of solar radiation and heat. Complex derived behaviors, such as deposition of eggs on undersides of leaves, have evolved at least four times, and may be correlated with evolution of parental care. The evolution of sexually dimorphic traits (i.e., humeral spines) is ambiguous and depends on the method of inference; however, a scenario with recurrent origins of spines, probably selected in response to male-male intraspecific competition, is favored. The effect of incomplete sampling on reconstruction of ancestral character states is considered by comparing topologies and patterns of character evolution derived from analyses of complete and pruned datasets. Given the results, I suggest that when working with relatively large groups (i.e., ≥ 90 species), complete taxon sampling may not be so critical for an accurate reconstruction of character evolution, as long as morphological/behavioral diversity of all major clades is represented. The biogeography of centrolenid frogs is partially resolved. Glassfrogs originated in South America and dispersed multiple times into Central America. The most likely scenario for the current distribution of the Centrolenidae suggests a Guianan origin with subsequent dispersal into the Amazonia and the Chocó. Once the land connection between South and Central America was complete, and before the uplift of the Eastern Andean Cordillera, Glassfrogs dispersed to Central America at least four times. The uplift of the Eastern Cordillera and the Mérida Andes, coupled with drops in temperature during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, could have facilitated dispersal of cold-adapted species from the Guianas to the Cordillera de la Costa and then into the Northern Andes. Glassfrogs reached the Southern Andes via repeated dispersal from the Northern Andes. Finally, comparisons of phylogeny and species distributions strongly supports vicariance as the main speciation mechanism in centrolenid frogs.

TI  - Conformational analysis of heat shock factor 1 and its C -terminal domain
SP  - 144
AB  - Heat Shock Transcription Factor 1 (HSF1) is a key regulator of the expression of heat shock proteins during the heat shock response. It functions as a connector between the upstream stress signals and the downstream cellular responses needed for cell survival. HSF1 is activated by heat and other pathological or physiological stresses, undergoing homotrimerization to acquire the ability to bind to DNA, and structural and chemical modifications to achieve transcriptional competence. In aged animals, HSF1 function is impaired, leading to a decline in HSP70 gene expression and a defect in responding to stress. The C-terminal domain (CT), which encompasses the regulatory and activation domains of HSF1, is predicted to contain natively unfolded regions by PONDR ® disorder analysis. Natively unfolded domains play an important role in transcription factors, allowing them to undergo posttranslational modifications and interactions with a myriad of partners essential for the transcriptional process. Experimental evidence presented in this dissertation indicates that CT is natively unfolded under physiological conditions since it exhibits the following structural characteristics: (1) a very low abundance of secondary and tertiary structure as observed by circular dichroism, (2) no hydrophobic core as monitored by a TNS binding assay, (3) a large hydrodynamics radius as measured by SEC-HPLC, and (4) high structural flexibility as probed by limited proteolysis. Interestingly, CT can be induced to fold when the negatively charged amino acid residues are neutralized by acidic pH or the cationic detergent DTA. The "folded" CT is very compact, containing secondary structure and hydrophobic clusters. Interaction of CT and its physiological partner, the core domain of the TATA-binding protein (cTBP), indicates a moderate structural alteration upon complex formation. CT interacts at the hydrophobic sites of cTBP, with a dissociation constant of 0.91 μM, as determined using competitive TNS-binding assay. The "induced-fit" binding between CT and cTBP suggests a structural plasticity of the natively unfolded structure of CT. The structural flexibility of CT could also imply its adaptability to transiently interact with various transcriptional effectors/regulators.

TI  - Ontogeny and life history of shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum Lesueur 1818): Effects of latitudinal variation and water temperature
SP  - 74
AB  - Ontogenetic niche shifts usually occur concurrently with a change in developmental stage and likely evolved as a strategy to reduce mortality and optimize growth at each developmental stage. The optimal shift point may be flexible, however, and may be influenced by environmental cues. In this dissertation I address the following three objectives: (1) Compare habitat preferences and dispersal duration and timing of early life stages of shortnose sturgeon from a northern (Connecticut River, MA, USA) and a southern (Savannah River, SC, USA) river, (2) Determine the effect of three temperature regimes on the timing and pattern of downstream dispersal of shortnose sturgeon larvae, and (3) Link changes in morphological development with ontogeny of behavior in shortnose sturgeon. During the period of yolk-sac absorption, fish from the Connecticut and Savannah Rivers which were reared at the same temperature selected cover and dark habitat, sheltering under rocks and preferring darkness and black substrate. Once fish began feeding exogenously, they switched rapidly to a preference for open, bright habitat, emerging from rocks and selecting illuminated areas and white substrate. Connecticut River fish moved downstream for 6 days (days 7–12 after hatching) beginning immediately after feeding began. However, Savannah River fish had a longer dispersal with multiple, prolonged peaks and fish continued a low level of downstream movement for the whole larval period and as early juveniles (at least until day 62). The differences in dispersal between Connecticut and Savannah River fish, however, were expressed under the same laboratory conditions, including temperature. Thus, genetic differences between the populations do exist and conservation strategies should consider this. In tests with Connecticut River fish to determine temperature effects on dispersal pattern, rearing fish at 10°C delayed the onset of dispersal, but increasing the temperature (15 and 20°C) produced a dispersal with multiple peaks, rather than simply shifting the peak to a younger fish age. Fish were morphologically similar when they began dispersing, regardless of river or temperature. Colder temperature caused development to slow and fish to delay beginning dispersal. These results show dispersal of shortnose sturgeon early life stages is influenced by river temperature.

TI  - Dynamic coevolution and the maintenance of cooperation in Medicago truncatula-Sinorhizobium mutualism
SP  - 110
AB  - Mutualisms, such those between plants and pollinators, corals and dinoflagellates, and legumes and rhizobia, are vital to natural ecosystems. These and many other mutualisms have persisted for millions of years; however, their apparent stability poses an evolutionary puzzle because genotypes that maximize their own fitness at the expense of their partner (i.e. "cheaters") should invade and destabilize mutualism toward parasitism. Selective mechanisms that reward cooperative partners, such as sanctions or partner choice, may explain the evolutionary persistence of cooperation in mutualisms. Alternatively, if partner quality depends on the abiotic or biotic context, then a single cheater genotype may not enjoy a universal advantage. Context-dependent selection may also drive differentiation among coevolving populations for the traits mediating species interactions, thereby maintaining variation at a geographic scale. Studying the outcomes between the legume Medicago truncatula and its nitrogen-fixing mutualist Sinorhizobium from natural populations in their native range revealed that the quality of a plant or rhizobium partner depends on the genotype with which it interacts and on the availability of nitrogen—suggesting that different mutualist genotypes are favored depending on the composition of partner populations and the nitrogen environment. Comparing the fitness of plants and rhizobia in symbiosis with partners from the same, versus distant, populations showed that both plant and rhizobium populations were differentiated for the traits mediating benefit exchange. Finally, when inoculated with a mixture of strains, plant genotypes formed more nodules with rhizobia that confer high fitness benefits to that genotype, suggesting an important role for plant partner choice in enforcing rhizobial cooperation. Importantly, nodulation with plants resulted in increased fitness for the rhizobium strains inside nodules, and therefore partner choice can impose selection for rhizobial cooperation. Plant partner choice was also genetically variable within M. truncatula populations, indicating that this mechanism may respond to natural selection. These results indicate that context-dependence and plant partner choice are both important for the persistence of cooperation in plant-rhizobium symbiosis. Moreover, although the mutualism between legumes and rhizobia has endured for over 60 million years, the outcomes of coevolution in these interactions may be highly dynamic at shorter time scales.

TI  - Life history evolution in seasonal environments: Phenological and environmental determinants of thermal adaptation in Wyeomyia smithii
SP  - 139
AB  - Environmental variation poses a major evolutionary challenge to organisms. This is particularly true for seasonal environments where environmental factors fluctuate radically but predictably on an annual basis. Dormant life history stages often evolve to mitigate exposure to harsh seasonal environments (e.g., winter). In addition, norms of reaction, or the relationship between phenotype and environment, often evolve as a response to local environmental heterogeneity. My thesis explores how the seasonal timing of dormancy affects selection on reaction norms of active, non-dormant life history stages in temperate insects. Changing the dates of initiation and termination of winter dormancy changes the thermal habitat experienced during active growth and reproduction. Thus, geographic variation in the timing of dormancy complicates geographic patterns of thermal selection on active life history stages. Using available inter- and intraspecific life history data in conjunction with long-term weather data, I show that geographic clines in dormancy timing cause populations along the cline to experience similar exposure to cold temperatures during active growth. As a result, strong latitudinal trends in the timing of dormancy predict weaker latitudinal trends in thermal adaptation of active stages. I further illustrate this concept by examining geographic variation in the timing of winter dormancy, thermal sensitivity of development, and tolerance to thermal stress in the pitcher plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. The results from W. smithii suggest that selection applied specifically by the thermal environment of the growing season best explains geographic variation in the thermal sensitivity of development time. In contrast, geographic variation in the thermal environment of the entire year best explains geographic trends in thermal stress tolerance of active life history stages. These results suggest two major conclusions. First, thermal sensitivity and thermal tolerance can exhibit local adaptation in populations that also demonstrate local adaptation in diapause timing. Thus the evolution of one type of adaptation does not preclude the other. Second, dormancy timing unquestionably influences direct selection on active life history stages, but correlated selection on overwinter survival may strongly influence temperature tolerance of active life history stages.

TI  - Ultraviolet radiation as an environmental stressor of amphibians
SP  - 197
AB  - My thesis explored the effects of and potential mediating mechanisms for an important environmental stressor, ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. UVB radiation has negative effects on organisms in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. I used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of UVB radiation on a diversity of aquatic organisms (Chapter 2). UVB negatively affects aquatic organisms by reducing both survival and growth. In particular, UVB reduces growth of embryos more than any other life history stage. Some taxonomic groups may be more affected by UVB radiation than others. In our analysis, the growth of members of the kingdom Protozoa was suppressed by UVB radiation to a greater degree than any other kingdom. These analyses suggest that UVB is an important stressor in both freshwater and marine systems. Amphibians are a common component of freshwater systems and are experiencing world-wide population declines. These declines may be due to a number of causes including habitat loss, introduced species, global climate change, disease, toxic chemicals and UVB radiation. I used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the effects of UVB radiation on amphibians. By synthesizing the results of 41 articles on the effects of UVB radiation on amphibians (Chapter 3), I found a nearly 2-fold reduction in survival of amphibians exposed to UVB radiation. Salamanders (caudates) appear to be more susceptible to damage from UVB than frogs or toads (anurans). Moreover, survival of larvae was much lower than survival of embryos or metamorphic individuals under UVB radiation. In addition, I used factorial meta-analytic techniques to explore the interaction between UVB radiation and other stressors in amphibian habitats. UVB radiation acted synergistically with other stressors to reduce survival of amphibians. Behavioral avoidance of UVB radiation may help mediate the negative effects of UVB radiation on amphibians. In aquatic systems, behavioral avoidance usually requires movement out of shallow water, where UVB levels can be high, into deeper waters with lower UVB transmittance. However, these two microhabitats have very different thermal profiles, creating a trade-off between exploiting warm waters with high UVB levels and avoiding UVB by seeking cooler, deeper regions of ponds. I explored the microhabitat use of larvae of four species through a series of laboratory experiments, field experiments, and observational field transects at three different amphibian habitats (Chapter 4). Larvae did not avoid UVB radiation in either the laboratory or field experiments. Larvae in thermal gradients selected relatively high temperatures regardless of the UVB exposure at these temperatures. In field transects, salamander larvae were most common in deeper, cooler waters where UVB levels were lower. In contrast, anuran larvae were frequently observed in the warmer and shallower regions of each habitat. These regions also had the highest UVB levels, suggesting that anuran larvae are exposed to high levels of UVB due to thermoregulatory behavior. Behavioral avoidance of UVB radiation is not the only mechanism amphibians may use to prevent damage from UVB. Pigments such as melanin may allow larvae to exploit warm shallow waters by absorbing harmful UVB radiation before it causes cellular damage. I tested the efficacy of melanin as a photoprotective pigment in the larvae of two species, Rana cascadae and Pseudacris regilla (Chapter 5). I found no evidence of a photoprotective function for melanin in these larvae. In contrast, lighter colored tadpoles grew more under UVB radiation compared to darker colored tadpoles. Overall, exposure to UVB reduced survival of P. regilla larvae and reduced growth of R. cascadae larvae. Larvae of both of these species were frequently observed in very shallow water with intense solar radiation. This thesis emphasizes the importance of UVB radiation as an environmental stressor in aquatic habitats. Many aquatic organisms are negatively affected by UVB exposure. My thesis work quantitatively demonstrated that UVB radiation is one factor that reduces survival of amphibians and suggests that some species are exposed to high levels of UVB radiation in natural habitats. While UVB radiation is not the sole cause of amphibian population declines, my work suggests that UVB radiation is an important stressor for amphibians that should not be overlooked. In addition, UVB radiation is clearly an important stressor for many other aquatic organisms. Future work should consider the effects of UVB in aquatic systems, particularly the effects of UVB radiation on community structure and ecosystem function.

TI  - Life history divergence and tidal salt marsh adaptations of the coastal plain swamp sparrow
SP  - 148
AB  - Adaptation to local environments via natural selection is a powerful mechanism for population divergence and likely one of the primary causes of speciation. To understand how specific habitats shape local adaptation, it is helpful to study closely-related populations from widely differing ecosystems that have not had sufficient time to diverge by genetic drift. Throughout the following chapters I examine the distribution of morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypes within and between two subspecies of the swamp sparrow. These two populations, the tidal salt marsh endemic Melospiza georgiana nigrescens and the nominant inland subspecies, M. g. georgiana were incompletely isolated from each other following the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation. Since that time the increased nest predation, temperature, season length, salinity and tidal flow of the coastal marshes relative to inland wetlands has resulted in a number of adaptations among coastal sparrows due to natural selection, sexual selection, and phenotypic plasticity. Specifically I examine the habitat preferences of the coastal plain swamp sparrow, the difference in clutch size between the two subspecies, the rates of extrapair fertilization relative to male quality, the ecosystem-specific interactions between natural and sexual selection on plumage badges, and the role of conspecific attraction in nest placement. The environmental differences of the tidal salt marsh have played strong roles in the local adaptation and divergence of coastal plain swamp sparrows from their freshwater ancestors. Many of these divergent mechanisms may be similar among other tidal marsh endemics, although some (especially those related to sexual selection) may be specific to the swamp sparrow. In general, however, we see that the added environmental challenges of tidal ecosystems strongly alter selection regimes on a terrestrial vertebrate inhabiting this dynamic ecotone. The swamp sparrow system can further increase our understanding of how the interplay between environmental resources, sexual selection, and natural selection affects the local adaptations leading to evolutionary divergence.

TI  - Nanocalorimetric sensor for ultra-low-volume biological measurements and calibration by chemical method
SP  - 141
AB  - Microcalorimetry is an established technique in the biological sciences for determining energy generation and consumption. With recent developments in microfabrication techniques, nanocalorimeters or even picocalorimeters are now possible. Measuring the biological thermal signal from cells is very difficult, however, due to both the cells' low thermal activity level and the challenge of maintaining cell viability without undermining the sensitivity of the calorimeter. We have modified a commercial thermal sensor to acquire biological data. An integrative thermal shielding, evaporation prevention, and nanoliter sample-injection system was developed to deliver cells into the reaction chamber and preserve the sensitivity of the sensor. The modified nanocalorimeter has a power sensitivity of 7.6 nW/Hz½ and a temperature sensitivity of 136 μK/Hz½. The heat production of the cardiomyocytes was measured when cells were stimulated with high K+ solution. The method may be useful for future development of high-speed parallel devices for drug screening or bioanalysis.

TI  - Regional impacts of climate change on water resources of the upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia
SP  - 152
AB  - This dissertation aims to evaluate the climate change impacts on both hydrologic regimes and water resources of the upper Blue Nile River Basin in Ethiopia where hydrologic data are limited. The downstream countries of the Nile River Basin are sensitive to the variability of runoff from the part of the Nile Basin located in Ethiopia. Climate change affects water availability and the conditions will worsen with increasing water demands. Typical climate change impact studies compare the simulation results under future climate change scenarios with those from a baseline climate scenario representing current climate conditions. To analyze and evaluate the future changes in hydrology and water resources of the study area, data-parsimonious, yet reliable, methodologies and models are required. This dissertation presents three manuscripts for analyzing climate change impacts. The first manuscript consists of two parts: The first part is focused on the construction of the baseline climate scenario. Accurate reproduction of current climatic conditions (typically, 1961-1990) is a key to this step. The conditional generation method is proposed for this purpose. The second part is devoted to the construction of the future climate change scenarios. The outcomes of general circulation models (GCMs) are used for this step. This study uses six GCMs' outcomes for the 2050s to explore a range of projections due to inter-model differences. These outcomes are weighted to provide a plausible change in climatic conditions. The second manuscript is on the simulation of runoff using the proposed hydrologic model under different climate scenarios. Model evaluation and parameter regionalization for ungauged basins are important tasks given the limited data and information available. In the third manuscript, the results from previous analyses are integrated to evaluate climate change impacts on hydrology and water resources through a set of indices. The impacts of dam operations for hydropower generation under climate change scenarios on downstream countries are also assessed. The major findings of this study suggest that (1) climate would be wetter and warmer in the 2050s; (2) flow regimes would be enhanced, especially for low flows; and (3) the proposed dam operations would not affect the water availability to the downstream countries.

TI  - A statistical study on incipient plasticity of metals
AB  - Recent rapid development in the micro-machinery and chip industry has boosted fundamental research work into the sub-micron and even nano regime where the behaviour of the materials is not only governed by classic mechanics but also quantum mechanics. Unique applications may be enabled in the future since materials reduced to the nanoscale can show completely different properties compared to what they exhibit in bulk. Newly-invented testing technologies such as nanoindentation and focused-ion-beam fabrication now make it feasible to study the strength of nanomaterials which can provide useful information to the micron-machinery industry. It has been observed by many researchers that the strength of materials in nanoscale can be much higher than their bulk counterparts, implying the possibility of making devices with higher stress tolerance in sub-micron and nanoscale. However, the onset of plasticity is found to exhibit a statistical distribution rather than being a constant value. More interestingly, even holding the load in the sub-critical region may eventually lead to yielding, indicating that the material cannot sustain GPa level stresses indefinitely. This thesis attempts to explore the underlying physics of the incipient plasticity phenomenon observed in experiments using molecular dynamics simulations. We started from shearing a small block of Ni3Al with periodic boundary conditions, and observed the formation of initial plasticity nucleus from atomic clusters with larger than average displacements under the dual action of stress and thermal agitation. It was found from the simulated potential-step and stress-step curves that an avalanche of plasticity occurred when the largest relative displacements of the atoms in the system exceeded a critical value of one half of the Shockley partial. These atomic clusters were not stable before the onset of plasticity, but they were able to grow quickly into stable dislocation loops during the avalanche event. The statistical distribution of the atomic relative displacements before yielding was then examined to verify its evolution with stress and temperature. The distribution was found to follow a Weibull form at any step before yielding but some variables changed with stress and temperature. Based on the assumption that incipient plasticity occurs when some atom in the system is displaced more than the critical value, the statistics of relative displacements were put into a survival probability model which finally gave us fairly good predictions for various experimental results by extrapolating the sample size from nano scale in simulations to micron scale in experiments. However, the predicted strength in micro-pillar compression tests was still several times larger than the experimental values, possibly due to the different boundary conditions we used in the simulations when obtaining the statistics. To verify this, we performed simulations on the same material with a nano-sized column with free surfaces, and found that the most highly displaced atoms always occurred near a surface within a thickness of several angstroms from the surface. The statistics of the atomic relative displacements in the surface layers still obeyed a Weibull form. Based on the same assumption that instability is reached when an atom exhibits a relative displacement of about one half of the Shockley partial, the predicted yield strength of micro-pillars when extrapolating the statistics of the column surface in the simulations to the surface area encountered in real experiments on micro-pillars agreed a lot better with the experimental values, thus confirming that nucleation is more likely to start from the surface in a column during compression.

TI  - Incorporating environmental education content into a high school biology curriculum using scientific inquiry
SP  - 106
AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to incorporate environmental education into the biology classroom using inquiry learning. Science education can be applied to all aspects of life on earth. By educating people about the natural resources used to make food, clothes, everyday products, types of transportation and housing, we are able to show how humans impact our world today. A current study done by William F. McComas (2003) showed that many Biology textbooks have tried to touch on the topic of environmental education, but none have integrated it into the biology class particularly well. Some of the textbooks observed noted ecology topics only towards the end of the book for those teachers who have the time at the end of the year to cover said material. "Possessing knowledge of ecology enables individuals to make useful explanations and accurate predictions while informing decision making and "action taking." In this fashion, ecology provides a thread linking together various sub-domains of biology" (McComas, 2003). Environmental education relates to many aspects of biology because it affects the evolution and adaptation of species, anatomy and physiology of individuals living in a particular area. In addition it relates to the genetic makeup of offspring, the metabolic processes involved in plants and animals, and the utilization of a particular niche to occupy. Environmental education also impacts many important issues that students face today and therefore would be a good way to increase student learning about biological topics because the information is relevant to their everyday lives. Science education is a very important aspect of everyday life. Biology provides the basics for studying life on earth. By applying environmental education into a biology curriculum, students will gain a better understanding of biological diversity, interactions within ecosystems, adaptation, cycles, human impact, and even the use of technology. All of these factors are important in the science of biology and can easily show young minds the value of knowing how the environment works. It is important for the student population to become educated in all facets of the environment because of the many issues that the world and even local environments are facing, such as global warming, flooding, pollution and drastic changes in ecosystems. Inquiry learning, an instructional strategy used in teaching science, is an excellent way for students to become active within their environment while learning valuable facts concerning science today. Inquiry instruction prepares students for future environmental decisions by creating a scientifically literate community.

TI  - The mitochondrion in the life and death of Plasmodium falciparum
SP  - 145
AB  - Plasmodium falciparum is the causative protozoan parasite of the most severe form of malaria. This disease is still a major problem throughout many regions of the world and eradication efforts have fallen short. Although effective anti-malaria chemotherapies have been developed, we don't know why these drugs work and whether their effects on the parasite are static or cidal. Mitochondrial electron transport chain is a well established anti-malarial drug target, molecular details underlying the parasite demise have not been elucidated. However, the mitochondrion remains a validated drug target in the malaria parasite. Disruption of the mitochondrial electron transport leads to parasite death. Here we show that the blood-stages of the parasite seem to maintain an active electron transport chain to serve one function; de novo pyrimidine synthesis. By supplying P. falciparum with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), which does not require ubiquinone to function, the transgenic parasites become resistant to electron transport inhibitors. Surprisingly, disrupting the flow of electrons does not abolish the mitochondrial membrane potential in P. falciparum and these parasites have established an alternate mode of generating this potential. Subsequently, we explored the effects of atovaquone, alone as well as in combination with its synergistic partner, proguanil, on mitochondrial physiology and the stage specific static or cidal effects of the inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport. Our results suggest that, in P. falciparum, the in vitro effects of atovaquone and atovaquone/proguanil are dependent upon the erythrocytic stage of the parasites exposed to the drugs. We found a large proportion of ring-stage parasites are most resilient to drug treatment and seem to survive for up to 48 hours, with a small fraction remaining viable even after 96 hours of treatment. The survival of the parasites depends on their ability to exist in a 'static' phase; once treatment ceases, the parasites re-enter the erythrocytic development cycle as seen by parasite morphology. To further elucidate the mechanism of resistance development, we have analyzed the response of drug selected parasites to a subsequent drug treatment. These studies begin to provide information on the physiological state of the drug-inhibited parasites when mutations in mitochondrial DNA could arise that lead to drug resistance.

TI  - Effects of sward structure and climate change on the ecology and behaviour of grassland isopods
SP  - 1
AB  - In this thesis I examine the effect of microclimate on the diversity, abundance, population processes and behaviour of three grassland isopod species, as representatives of soil arthropod macro-decomposers, in the context of predicted climate change scenarios. It is shown that inter-specific differences in relative adaptability to the terrestrial habitat, in conjunction with habitat heterogeneity, are essential in understanding these dynamics. Variation in diversity resulted from disturbance both to the soil profile and sward structure due to grazing. Predictions from a spatial survey were tested using a twenty-year time series. Results highlight the importance of the equitability component of diversity. This same long-term dataset was used to examine aggregation in the field. Aggregating behaviour was strongest at the very lowest densities regardless of habitat. There was some evidence to suggest species-specific relationships between aggregation and micro-climatic conditions. Using laboratory experiments, the relationships between aggregation and temperature, relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit were examined more precisely. Species with more advanced adaptations to reducing moisture loss aggregated the least. Isopods aggregated more at higher temperatures and lower relative humidity. With moisture being a critical limiting factor to these invertebrates, choice of activity can be in part dependant upon climatic variables. The trade-off between foraging and sheltering behaviour and relative nocturnality were shown to vary according to moisture availability. The activities of the species least adapted to prevent water loss were altered significantly more than the other two species. A field experiment showed that the fitness costs incurred by reductions in moisture availability may be partially mitigated by the growth benefits of increased temperature.

TI  - Numerical Simulation of Directional Solidification Process and Microstructure Evolution of Superalloy Turbine Blade Castings
AB  - As key parts of airplane engine, high temperature properties of single crystal superalloy turbine blades have direct influence on the performance of an airplane engine. With the development of solidification simulation technology, studying the directional process and predicting the formation of casting defects are helpful to optimize technical parameters, avoid casing defects and reduce the development cycle and cost. Ray Tracing method was used to develop the dynamic heat transfer model of directional solidification process of multiple turbine blades with the consideration of complex heat radiation transfer among the multiple turbine blades and the furnace wall in the vacuum environment. The placed pattern of multiple blades on the chill plate, the furnace geometry and the withdrawal rate were considered in the model. The directional solidification process of single and multiple blades were simulated using the above model respectively. The temperature distribution during the withdrawal process was predicted, and the cooling curves were compared with the experimental results and they agreed well. The temperature distribution of multiple blades during withdrawal process in the horizontal direction was uneven because of the shades effect among the different blades. Model for microstructure evolution of turbine blades of superalloy was developed according to the characteristic of directional solidification process with the consideration of nucleation and grain growth. A capturing rule suitable for the finite difference grids was presented and could be used to describe the grain growth in random directions. A Discrete Layer method to predict the microstructure evolution at the scale of real turbine blade was developed based on the fact that the mushy zone during withdrawal process was continuous and thin in the longitudinal direction. The microstructure evolution of starter block and grain selector were also simulated using the Discrete Layer method. The experiments with various and uniform withdrawal rates were designed to improve the quality of product, avoid the casting defects and increase the productivity at the same time. The temperature distribution of different part in the blade was measured, while the microstructure and casting defects were observed. Stray grains occurred in all three blades in the experiments with uniform withdrawal rate, 7.0mm/min. In the other experiment, 7.0mm/min was used for first 20 minutes and then 3.5mm/min was used till to the end of directional solidification process. One of the three blades had no stray grains, while the other two had. The temperature distribution and microstructure evolution were simulated using the macro and micro coupled model presented in this paper. The simulated cooling curves and casting defects were coincide with the experimental. The accurate time to change the withdrawal rate was very important to control the quality of blades. It was indicated that decreasing withdrawal rate in advance when the mutational cross-section approached to the baffle could be helpful to both increase productivity and avoid casing defects.Alternate abstract:高温合金单晶叶片作为航空发动机中的关键部件，其高温性能直接影响着发动机的整体性能。随着凝固模拟技术的发展，开展高温合金叶片定向凝固过程数值模拟研究，研究定向凝固过程的规律并预测结晶缺陷产生的规律，有助于优化生产工艺，减少铸造缺陷，缩短试制周期，降低生产费用。 本文结合实际的高温合金叶片定向凝固过程，在重点考虑真空封闭炉腔内多叶片间复杂辐射换热的基础上，采用射线追踪法，建立了多叶片定向凝固过程的动态热传输模型。充分考虑了多叶片排列方式、加热炉几何尺寸、抽拉速度等工艺参数的影响。对单叶片、多叶片条件下的定向凝固过程进行了模拟，预测了定向凝固过程中叶片的温度分布情况，并与实验结果进行了对比，吻合较好。多叶片条件下由于叶片间的遮挡作用，水平方向上温度分布并不均匀。 本文针对高温合金叶片定向凝固过程的特点建立了微观组织演化模型，在考虑形核、生长模型的基础上提出了新的单元捕获规则，可在有限差分网格中描述枝晶沿任意方向的生长情况，并针对定向凝固过程固液两相区纵向连续且范围较小的形状特点提出了分层计算法，可用于计算高温合金叶片整体微观组织演变。本文设计了简单算例对微观组织演化模型进行了验证，此外，本文对单晶叶片引晶器、选晶器部分的微观组织演变进行了模拟。 本文针对抽拉速度这一重要的工艺条件设计了单晶叶片匀速及先快速后慢速的变速实验，实测了匀速、变速实验中单晶叶片的温度变化及缺陷情况。在以7.0mm/min匀速抽拉的实验中得到了3件叶片，均在缘板部位观测到了杂晶缺陷；变速实验中先采用7.0mm/min抽拉20min后改用3.5mm/min抽拉至结束，得到的3件叶片质量相对于匀速条件下的叶片有所改善，其中一件为完整单晶叶片，另两件杂晶尺寸减小。运用本文建立的宏、微观计算模型对匀速、变速条件下的单晶叶片定向凝固过程温度分布及组织演变进行了预测。模拟分析表明，变速时刻对于变速工艺的效果具有重要的影响，在截面突变处接近辐射挡板时提前降低抽拉速度则可以起到既避免缺陷又提高效率的目的。

TI  - Effect of tool parameters on residual stress and temperature generation in high-speed machining of aluminum alloys
AB  - The need throughout the machining industry for cost reduction and increases in productivity have contributed to new interest in high-speed machining. Even though, many model for machining exist, most of them are for low-speed machining, where momentum is negligible and material behavior is well approximated by the quasi-static laws. In machining at high speeds momentum could be large and the strain rate can be exceedingly high. For these reasons a fluid mechanics approach to understanding high-speed, very high-speed and ultra-high-speed machining is attempted here. Namely, a potential flow solution is used to model the behavior of the material around a tool tip during machining at high speeds, i.e. greater than or equal to 100 m/s. It is carefully argued that the potential flow solution is relevant and can be used as a first approximation to model the behavior of a metal during high-speed, very high-speed or ultra-high-speed machining events. At a minimum, the potential flow solution is qualitatively useful in understanding mechanics of high-speed, very high-speed and ultra-high-speed machining. Interestingly, the flow solution predicts that there is a ''stagnation' point on the rake face, not at the tool tip as is usually assumed. Because the ''stagnation' point is not at the tool tip, the flow solution predicts a significant amount of deformation in the work piece resulting in large residual strains and a possible related temperature rise on the finished surface. To verify the fluid flow model, an experimental apparatus has been designed to examine fluid flow in orthogonal machining. Experiments were conducted at room temperature for different Newtonian fluids, cutting conditions and cutting tools. It was seen that, indeed, the ''stagnation' point is not at the tool tip. Next, a modified Hopkinson bar apparatus is employed to simulate dry orthogonal machining at 30 m/s cutting velocity. A focused array of Mercury-Cadmium-Tellurium infrared detectors is used to measure the temperature distribution. A three-component quartz force transducer is utilized in measuring the cutting and feed forces. Measurements of the cutting and feed forces contributed to the ability to prove the steady-state conditions as well as to estimate the coefficient of friction on the tool rake face along with the partition of the thermal energy produced during the high-speed machining process. Force measurements show that at this speed, on the upper boundary of the range of cutting velocities for high-speed machining not high enough to be very-high speed or ultra-high speed cutting, the role of momentum is negligible and the cutting event is dominated by material deformation, making the fluid model less applicable. Much higher cutting speeds, beyond the capability of this apparatus, are needed to make the fluid approach accurate. Not-surprisingly, measurements of temperature distributions showed little heating of the finished surface. Therefore, a study of the temperature fields generated during machining with a cutting tool that has a wear-land was performed. It is seen that the wear-land contributes significantly to the heating of the workpiece and, at this speed, is the most likely mechanism for the generation of residual stress and a temperature rise on the finished surface.

TI  - Characterizing the Plio-Pleistocene evolution of sea surface conditions using the alkenone organic proxy
SP  - 268
AB  - Concern about future changes in Earth's climate has generated intense interest in the past behavior of the climate system. Over the past 5 million years the Earth's climate has transitioned from the warm early Pliocene interval, to the colder, more variable late Pliocene and Pleistocene periods, which were marked by the growth of large ice-sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. This dissertation applies a novel approach to understanding this important climatic transition by using the alkenone organic proxy to characterize past climatic variations in sea surface temperature and productivity. This work reviews the discovery, development, calibration, and potential caveats to the application of the alkenone organic proxy, explicitly examining the use of this method to study climatological problems over long (>1 Myr) timescales and concluding that there is enormous potential to apply this valuable tool to the study of long-term paleoclimate. Additionally, this dissertation documents the application of the alkenone organic proxy to the characterization of long-term climatic change at sites in the Coral Sea, eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) and North Atlantic. Results from the western Coral Sea indicate that the late Quaternary rise of the Australian Great Barrier Reef was not caused by a warming of regional sea surface temperatures as previously proposed and highlights the ability of the alkenone organic proxy to provide valuable climate information in regions where carbonate diagenesis has rendered other commonly used carbonate-based techniques unreliable. Work from the EEP and North Atlantic provide the first continuous, high-resolution records of variations in sea surface conditions through the Plio-Pleistocene climatic transition. These records indicate marked spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of sea surface temperature and productivity during this time interval. These datasets probe the validity of several existing theories for the Plio-Pleistocene transition and lay the foundation for an array of sites that will provide a spatial fingerprint of Pliocene to modern sea surface conditions.

TI  - Mixed burden softening and melting phenomena
SP  - 201
AB  - The blast furnace (BF) will remain the major iron producing unit for the foreseeable future. The cohesive zone, where ferrous materials soften and melt, affects the productivity of the BF. This research was focused on expanding the current understanding of the mechanism of softening and melting of the ferrous materials. The other objective of this project was to examine the potential use of direct reduced iron (DRI) and hot briquetted iron (HBI) as the BF burden. The materials used in this study were DRI, HBI, lump iron ore and pellets. A wide variety of experimental procedures were employed to completely understand the process phenomena. The softening and melting (SM) experiments were conducted under load and X-Ray fluoroscopy was used to visualize the process. The results of these experiments were conducive in determining a suitable mechanism of softening and melting of the burden. For single burdens of DRI and HBI, softening occurred when metal began to melt. For mixed burdens of DRI and pellets/lump ore, the initial deformation was not affected by DRI; however DRI dominated as the temperature increased and melting occurred only when DRI melted. Melt dripping was observed at temperatures close to meltdown. A FactSage slag model was used to obtain the evolution of liquid with temperature. It was compared with the bed shrinkage which indicated that the most likely reason of the softening of the burden is the deformation of solid, phases, especially iron. The bulk SM experiments were interrupted at temperatures of interest and samples were examined for the morphological changes. These experiments were instrumental in studying the burden interaction at different stages during softening and melting of the burden. In addition, in separate experiments (without load), the melting structure of DRI/HBI samples was studied. The results of these experiments were expanded to include viscosity, surface energy and deformation rate calculations which were helpful in understanding the melt exudation phenomenon. The microstructure of the materials showed a transition from heterogeneous to homogenous state with increasing temperatures. The melt dripping was predominantly observed in olivine fluxed pellets. The exuded slag was primarily composed of alkali rich phase which was found least viscous amongst all types of slags present in this system. The viscosity of the liquid and the structure of metallic shell facilitated the melt exudation from the burden. In addition, the liquid filled the iron shell and coarsened its structure. Based on the metallographic examination of the samples a mechanism of burden interaction was proposed. The burden interaction is followed by melt dripping and melting of the burden. The melting onset temperatures were estimated from the isothermal section modeling of the phase diagrams and liquid mass fraction calculations obtained using FactSage software and databases. The phase diagrams supported the experimental observations such as non-melting of olivine particles in the olivine fluxed pellets and slag homogenization at 1300°C in the basic pellets. Addition of magnesia in lieu of lime was found to provide beneficial impact, in particular on the rate of liquid evolution at high temperature. Effect of alkali, even in small amounts, was deleterious for high temperature properties, especially in terms of early melt onset and lowering of the viscosity of the slag formed.

TI  - Temperature-moderated constraints on optimal egg size and reproductive output in a northern population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta )
SP  - 148
AB  - This research is part of a long-term study on the life-history of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) that was initiated in Algonquin Park in 1978. I used long-term data to test the hypothesis that widely documented annual variations in egg mass (EM) and egg length (EL) are inversely related to the temperature of the spring or fall periods of follicular development. I also tested the hypothesis that clutch frequency (CF - the number of clutches per year) and clutch size (CS) are positively related to the temperatures of the previous fall. CF was related to temperature in smaller, but not in larger females. Mean EM, EL, CS and (accordingly) the mass of the first clutch were inversely related to the temperature experienced just prior to nesting season onset. I show that this inverse relationship is likely an artifact of selection for a temperature-moderated gonadal cycle, and I argue that the Smith-Fretwell model of egg size optimization is applicable to C. picta in the Algonquin population.

TI  - A multidisciplinary approach to the identification and evaluation of novel concepts for deeply buried hardened target defeat
SP  - 411
AB  - During the Cold War, Deeply Buried Hardened Targets (DBHTs) and the assets they protected were of great strategic and tactical concern to the Department of Defense. Megaton-class nuclear warheads were the only viable means of attacking many of these facilities, and even so, a small subset of DBHTs was anticipated to be robust even in the face of such an attack. Post Cold War, the threat posed by DBHTs has not disappeared. Rather, the conventional warfare advantages of the United States have led to an increasing emphasis by potential adversaries on the construction and use of hardened facilities such as DBHTs for protection of both conventional and unconventional assets. Further, the shift in perceived relative risk to the United States' national security from large scale all-out nuclear attack towards very limited attack by Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) has led some to hypothesize that "self-deterrence" may diminish the strategic value of current inventory nuclear weapons. The objective of the work described was to identify and explore a paradigm shifting solution that could offer leap-ahead capabilities to counter current and future DBHT threats while mitigating or eliminating the "self-deterrence" issue. Systematic evaluation of DHBT defeat alternatives lead to the selection of a thermal subterrene as a hypothetical means of providing such a capability. A number of possible implementation alternatives for a thermal subterrene were investigated, resulting in the identification of the RadioIsotope Powered Thermal Penetrator (RIPTP) concept for providing an effectively unlimited hard rock penetration capability using near-term technologies. However, the proposed approach was novel and thus required formulation and application of a physics based multidisciplinary analysis code to enable evaluation of lv design alternatives and analysis of performance. Technical considerations identified as important to the feasibility of a RIPTP for DBHT defeat included: packing of RIPTP components in available volume; close-contact melting in a medium with nonlinear thermodynamic properties; radiation shielding; radiation health physics; point source plume dispersal calculations; alternative technologies for production of radioisotopes; chemical and physical properties of isotope compounds; nuclear reactor characteristics; high temperature material stability and inter-material compatibility; weapon and delivery system integration; a variety of heat transfer regimes including radiation, conduction, convection, nucleate boiling, and film boiling; thermal/mechanical stress analysis (steady-state and transient); rock physical and thermodynamic properties as a function of temperature; detection/mapping of deeply buried facility spaces; and more. The following disciplinary analyses were composed into a multidisciplinary analysis code for a RIPTP: packing of RIPTP components in available volume; close-contact melting analysis; transmutation of isotope species by neutron activation; reactor neutron economy; radioisotope power generation through decay; metamodelled radiation shielding calculations for a RIPTP; and steady state thermal analyses for a RIPTP in various scenarios. Filtering of radioisotopes for potential suitability, their possible production mechanisms, state of technological development, and multidisciplinary analysis code predicted performance lead to the identification of Thulium-170 as the best isotope for powering a RIPTP using present-day technology and technical data. Ytterbium-169 was identified as an alternative isotope offering the potential for significant potential improvements over Thulium-170 in radiological safety as well as RIPTP performance and producibility. Production, however, was determined to require identification of a cost effective technology for highly enriching Ytterbium-168 from its low natural abundance. Performance analysis of the identified baseline Thulium-170 RIPTP suggested that the predicted low penetration rate of about 10 meters/day could be a significant negative factor with regards to possible viability of the concept. Consequently, a survey for potentially enabling technologies was performed using an adaptation of the Technology Impact Forecasting (TIF) approach. It was found that the greatest potential for improving performance of the baseline Thulium-170 RIPTP resulted from increasing overall power density of the penetrator. Several possible technology approaches to achieving significantly increased penetration rates (approximately 50 meters/day expected penetration rate vs. original 13 meters/day) were proposed. However, it was determined that the hypothetical technology having the greatest potential impact on thermal subterrene viability for DHBT defeat with respect to penetration rate was cost-effective enrichment for Ytterbium-168. Development of such a technology would eliminate or enormously reduce the impact of all identified RIPTP performance and producibility concerns. Alternatively, relaxation of the requirement for no radiological hazard to enemy combatants would enable selection of a fissile powered thermal subterrene to provide required power densities consistent with rapid penetration.

TI  - The evolution of a polyphenism by genetic accommodation
SP  - 173
AB  - An adaptive polyphenism is the ability of a particular genotype to respond to different environments by generating two or more alternative phenotypes, each of which is adapted to the particular environment. This adaptive strategy has evolved in many taxa, yet little is known about the evolutionary origins of this trait. This thesis focuses on how adaptive polyphenisms can evolve through a process called genetic accommodation. Genetic accommodation is a process by which a novel phenotype becomes established in a population through polygenic changes in the genetic background driven by selection on phenotypic variants that are produced by either mutation or environmental change. A polyphenism was experimentally evolved in a previously monophenic black mutant Manduca sexta larva through selection on genetic variants revealed by heat-shock. A corresponding change in juvenile hormone (JH) titer was observed as determined by a JH bioassay. A cross between a monophenic and a polyphenic individuals revealed that the evolved polyphenism is likely to be controlled polygenically with at least one gene of major effect. The work demonstrates how hormones can act to mask hidden genetic variation and shows how complex traits may evolve. Implications of such changes are discussed along with a more general view of the developmental basis of the process of evolution by genetic accommodation. The theory of genetic accommodation is then discussed in the context of classical theories and studies of adaptive evolution. The final step of genetic accommodation involves the removal of fitness cost and trade-offs associated with the evolution of the novel trait. Larval coloration and body size was found to be highly correlated and developmentally integrated by JH. Selection to uncouple the developmentally integrated traits revealed that developmental modules that are not under the control of the developmental integrator can evolve to overcome the potential constraint that arises as a consequence of developmental integration. Therefore, the final step of genetic accommodation relies on evolution of developmental modules to overcome potential trade-offs or costs. The ease with which a polyphenism could evolve in the laboratory demonstrates that polyphenisms can evolve from adjustments on pre-existing hormonal regulation. The relationship between the origins of novelties and polyphenisms is discussed.

TI  - The role of temperature in habitat selection by eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) near their northern range limit
SP  - 163
AB  - Temperature should be one of the most important factors influencing habitat selection in terrestrial ectotherms, because physiological processes depend on body temperature and body temperatures depend primarily on the habitats they occupy. The importance of temperature in habitat selection should be amplified in cool climates and for ambush predators, who must select habitat warm enough to detect and strike prey quickly. Using 4 years of telemetry data from 34 individuals, I investigated the role of temperature in habitat selection by eastern massasauga rattlesnakes (Sistrurus c. catenatus ) on the Bruce Peninsula, Ontario, near their northern range limit. Snakes were selective at the microhabitat scale, preferentially using locations with closer retreat sites and shrubs than random. Gravid females were most selective, using sites with more rock cover and less canopy closure than sites used by males and nongravid females. Landscape-scale habitat preferences were proportional to the availability of suitable microhabitat. The overwinter mortality rate (23% over 3 years) was among the highest reported for north-temperature vipers. Lethally low temperatures were a lesser concern for snakes during the active season than temperatures routinely too low for basic functions like prey capture and reproduction. Consistent with theory, snakes thermoregulated less accurately (i.e., body temperatures were further from preferred levels) when environmental temperatures were low, but thermoregulatory effort (i.e., how close body temperatures were to preferred levels, relative to environmental temperatures) varied with environmental temperature in different ways for different snakes. Gravid females maintained body temperatures suitable for embryogenesis by using sites with little forest cover and basking more when environmental temperatures were very low. Males and nongravid females did not make similar adjustments, and in fact used more ground cover (hindering thermoregulation) when environmental temperatures were very low. Gravid females may be required to bear the costs of a high thermoregulatory effort (e.g., reduced foraging success, increased predation risk) to successfully reproduce in an environment with a short and cool active season. Cold incubation conditions, a short time window between parturition and hibernation, and cold overwintering conditions likely result in high rates of neonate mortality, possibly limiting the northern distribution of massasauga rattlesnakes.

TI  - The evolutionary consequences of virus resistance
SP  - 166
AB  - Tradeoffs among abilities to contend with different factors that constrain fitness and abundance are fundamental aspects of many theories describing evolutionary and ecological phenomena. The tradeoff between competitive abilities and resistance to predation, herbivory and disease is one of the most widely studied tradeoffs, but direct measurements of this tradeoff and its effects are often difficult, owing to the practical constraints of many experimental systems. I used a microbial system of a viral predator and a bacterial prey to directly measure the cost of resistance to predation under a variety of experimental conditions in order to determine the ecological and evolutionary constraints that predator resistance imposes on populations. I measured the cost of resistance in the bacterium Escherichia coli to predation by bacteriophage T4 under a range of temperatures roughly spanning the usual thermal niche of E. coli. Temperature strongly affects the cost of resistance in an asymmetric fashion. At the host temperature for E. coli, virus-resistant genotypes are 15 to 25% less fit than virus-sensitive parental genotypes. At sub-optimal temperatures, the cost of resistance was ameliorated. At stressful temperatures, the cost of resistance was exacerbated. I subsequently evolved a group of T4-resistant E. coli genotypes for 500 generations in the absence of bacteriophage at sub-optimal, benign and stressful temperatures to determine whether temperature affects the abilities of resistant genotypes to ameliorate the cost of resistance through adaptation. There was no adaptive amelioration of the cost of resistance in the benign thermal environment. By far, the greatest degree of adaptive amelioration occurred at a stressful temperature near the upper thermal limit for E. coli growth. Genetic variance among resistant genotypes tended to increase in novel environments, suggesting that different genetic mechanisms underlay similar fitness changes within each selective regime. Resistance did not change the general pattern of thermal specificity achieved through the course of selection. Genotypes evolved in a thermally benign environment became thermal generalists and genotypes evolved in a thermally stressful environment became thermal specialists. Adaptive amelioration of the cost of resistance was temperature specific, with the degree of correlated amelioration in novel thermal environments decreasing progressively with temperature.

TI  - Surviving the Little Ice Age: Family strategies in the decade of the Great Famine of 1693–1694 as reconstructed through the parish registers and family reconstitution
SP  - 355
AB  - This research, undertaken as part of a larger, multi-temporal study of social relations and land use, examines parish registers for the commune of Uxeau (Canton of Gueugnon, Département of Saône-et-Loire, region of Burgundy, France) during the coldest decade of the "Little Ice Age." The work explores the types of analyses and research questions appropriate for very early registers that cover short intervals. Such registers usually lack the supplemental and corroborating records available for later periods, such as census lists, household enumerations and tax records. Analyses performed include some simple aggregative calculations and a thorough family reconstitution. More unusually, this study places particular emphasis on the peripheral entries not always included in the data bases for family reconstitution---those notations in addition to the main facts of baptism, marriage and burial, which provide detailed information on persons acting as godparents, marriage witnesses and mourners. Incorporating this data, allows extended family groups to be reconstructed for up to four generations, using parish records covering a period of only ten years---something that would otherwise have taken several decades worth of data to accomplish. It is the ties represented in the peripheral data that make possible the reconstruction of the social network, parish hierarchy, and economic relations within the parish. For example, the spatial mapping of the occupational data and the patterns of social alliances reveals two distinct agricultural ecotypes within the parish. The ten-year period of the study coincides with the coldest decade of "The Little Ice Age" and surrounds the "Great Mortality" from the famine of 1693-1694. The strategies for marriage and godparent alliances that emerge from the analyses appear to have effectively reduced risk in that precarious decade of harvest failures, uncertain land tenure and exorbitant taxes. Most of the inhabitants of the parish belonged to large communautés , a communal type of farm made up of multiple, cohabitating, extended family groups. The study shows some significant differences in the practices of these communautés from those of later periods and neighboring regions.

TI  - Population and feeding characteristics of hydrothermal vent gastropods along environmental gradients with a focus on a bacterial symbiosis hosted by Lepetodrilus fucensis (Vetigastropoda)
SP  - 229
AB  - Three gastropods occupy a range of habitats along gradients in hydrothermal flux at Juan de Fuca Ridge vents. I examined how these species co-exist and identified mechanisms driving their abundances. First, I measured temperatures and spatial patterns in adult densities of the three species at three distances from vents to test if thermal regime relates to their habitat selection. Lepetodrilus fucensis and Depressigyra globulus were most dense in-vent (0--25 cm) at variable temperatures (10±5°C): 2100 and 240 ind. dm-2 (respectively). Provanna variabilis was most abundant far-vent (51--75 cm: 60 ind. dm-2) at stable temperatures (3±0.5°C). Thermal conditions are key in their habitat selection; behavioural experiments showed that these gastropods select fluid temperatures <18°C. L. fucensis and D. globulus preferred 5--15°C, while P. variabilis preferred 4--12°C. The next studies sought to explain how Lepetodrilus fucensis reaches order of magnitude higher densities in comparison to other gastropods. First, I quantified L. fucensis recruitment and sex ratio patterns to identify innovative life history traits. I meaured size structure and density at in- and far-vent locations. Early postlarval juveniles occupied far-vent at remarkable densities (2419 ind. dm-2). To test for sex ratio biases, I sexed animals from different habitats and sizes. Populations nearest vents hosted the largest females (>6.0 mm), while peripheral habitats were male-biased. A transplant experiment showed that female survivorship and gonad fullness were significantly lower than males in far-vent locations. Sex ratio biases are driven by two mechanisms: females maximize their reproductive output by selecting optimal habitats and suffer relatively higher mortality in low flux. Next, I hypothesized that the Lepetodrilus fucensis gill symbiosis is a key adaptation. I used multiple approaches to determine if the prevalence of the association and relationship to the limpet's condition support this hypothesis. FISH probes specific to the 16S rRNA molecule of a gamma-Proteobacteria hybridized where bacteria were present. Direct sequencing using symbiont-specific primers gave a single unambiguous sequence, indicating high specificity. Light and TEM micrographs of gill tissue from a range of species also showed that the symbiosis is ubiquitous. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Comparative biochemistry of lipid and protein metabolism in marine invertebrate larvae from warm and *cold environments
SP  - 126
AB  - From the simplest single celled organisms to complex multicellular animals, metabolic regulation of changes in quantity and quality of proteins and lipids are essential to life. In this dissertation, the metabolism of protein and lipid synthesis and utilization was examined in developing embryos and larvae of species of marine invertebrates. Differential protein expression and lipid metabolism was studied during the early larval development of slow- and fast-growing larval families the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Early larval stages possessed more protein than lipid reserves, however triacylglycerols were used to fuel early development to the feeding larval stage. Differential protein expression was measured by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and a complex pattern of differential protein expression was observed for some of the acidic proteins, suggesting possible markers for "egg quality" in setting quantitative traits in larvae. The cost of protein synthesis was measured in the homogenates made from embryos of several species of temperate and Antarctic echinoderm using cell-free protein translation assays. The costs of protein synthesis in the three temperate echinoderm species studied ranged from 3.66 ± 0.79 to 8.33 ± 3.13 J (mg protein synthesized)-1, which is consistent with values that have been reported in the literature for other temperate species of animals. In contrast, however, significantly lower costs of protein synthesis were measured in Antarctic echinoderm species of 0.41 ± 0.15 to 1.79 ± 0.55 J (mg protein synthesized)-1. This low cost of protein synthesis observed in the Antarctic species suggests a potential adaptation to life in cold and nutrient-poor environments by having a low "cost of living." The egg lipid content was studied in several species of Antarctic echinoderm. Normal development was negatively impacted by low amounts of initial triacylglycerol content in the herbivorous Antarctic sea urchin S. neumayeri. In two congener species of predatory Antarctic sea star O. validus and O. meridionalis, variability in the egg lipid content of females was observed, but lipid reserves were sufficient in these species for normal development to proceed. The data presented here on maternal investment in eggs suggests the occurrence of nutritional stress in adult females of S. neumayeri.

TI  - Mussel genetics in relation to selection methods for high quality seed and treatment for tunicates
SP  - 169
AB  - An experiment was conducted to evaluate the potential for using the genetic measure of allozyme heterozygosity as a predictor of seed quality. A sample containing two year-classes of Mytilus edulis (marine mussels) was taken from seed lines in St. Peter's Bay, Prince Edward Island and selected using either elevated water temperature or air exposure. The purpose of the treatments was to determine if the survivors had a detectable increase in heterozygosity. Increasing the level of heterozygosity in cultured mussels may produce stocks that have increased growth and less mortality, traits that are important in mussel aquaculture. Differences in mortality between the cohorts may have been due to physiological condition, genetic characteristics or a combination of these factors. The results of this study indicate that selective treatments of naturally collected seed should be investigated as an option to increase productivity and that heterozygosity can be used as a monitoring tool of mussel populations. A second experiment involved selection techniques followed by a field trial involving three bays in P.E.I. The effects of air exposure or elevated water temperature treatments on samples of Mytilus edulis spat were examined. Selection treatments resulted in a ∼ 50% mortality from an 11-hour air exposure at 27°C and ∼75% mortality from a 6-hour exposure to 33°C water. After the initial treatment, survivors of the air exposure treatment were significantly (P<0.01) larger than the controls while survivors of the elevated water temperature treatment were smaller (P<0.01). The field study showed that the treatments had a significant effect on size, growth and survival, suggesting that relatively simple husbandry practices of weeding out weaker mussel seed can affect productivity. Physiological analyses from field mussels showed that controls had a higher metabolic rate than the treated groups. After ten months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality in the field compared to untreated control mussels. The results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness. Finally, a major problem for mussel aquaculture on P.E.I., Canada surfaced in the late 1990's with the introduction of a fouling organism, Styela clava. This organism infests mussel cultivation equipment to the point where production is no longer viable. This study examined the effects that two anti-fouling treatments, air exposure and acetic acid, had on mussel populations. Socked seed were exposed to three treatment regimes and subsequently placed on a long-line in New London Bay, P.E.I. The treatments were a forty-hour air exposure, thirty-second and two-minute acetic acid immersion. Treatment effects were measured after seven months in the field. Mussel quality was assessed using mussel sock weights, length, condition index and changes in heterozygosity. A significant decrease in sock weights was found for all treatments compared to controls (P< 0.05), revealing that significant mortality occurred in the treated populations. Results on the other characteristics used to assess mussel fitness found no long-term effects on the health or genetic structure of the treated populations.

TI  - Abundance and occupancy: Use of a mesocosm to test pattern and process
AB  - Field-based mesocosm studies may be used as conceptual experiments to examine theoretical questions using the generated empirical data. A field-based Drosophilidae-nectarine mesocosm, comprising sun and shaded microclimate treatments arranged in a checkerboard design, was used in this thesis to examine four theoretical objectives. First, the efficacy of spatial analysis for detecting empirical pattern was examined. Natural variation weakened spatial structuring. However, hypothesis generation was shown not to be affected by this inclusion. Second, enhancing the hypothesis generating capacity of spatial methods was assessed, and confirmed to be possible, through the use of a sensitivity analysis method developed here. The method distinguished between mechanism categories (intrinsic, extrinsic and natural variation) and assessed the relative strength of each category. Next, an empirical test of the He and Gaston (2000a) parameterisation method and model to predict abundance from occupancy was conducted. Abundance estimates derived using the parameterisation method were underestimated because individuals were highly aggregated within fruit. This model and method require further exploration at fine scales for highly aggregated species. The incorporation of spatially explicit information may improve abundance predictions. Finally, the influence of spatial variation in temperature on adult body size in Drosophila simulans Sturtevant was investigated. The simple developmental effects of temperature differences, or the simple effects of stressful temperatures on thorax length, were overridden by interactive effects between temperature and larval density. As a result, flies attained the same final sizes in the shade and sun. Under natural conditions both mortality and non-lethal effects of temperature and/or crowding are likely to play a role in the evolution of body size. The results of this thesis provide (i) an improved understanding of the influence of natural variation on spatial pattern, (ii) an additional tool for spatial hypothesis generation, (iii) an empirical test of an abundance-prediction model and (iv) an understanding of interactive and non-lethal effects on body size under field conditions. The thesis therefore provides empirical support for the usefulness of field-based mesocosms to examine theoretical objectives.

TI  - Mechanisms underlying sexual segregation in a monomorphic fish species
SP  - 1
AB  - I investigate mechanisms underlying sexual segregation in the lesser spotted dogfish, Scyliorhinus canicula, a model species which is monomorphic with respect to body size. Male and female dogfish exhibited sex-differences in horizontal and vertical space use.  Females refuged in shallow-water (3-5 m) caves for up to 75% of the time, but undertook nocturnal foraging excursions to depth (≤ 50m).  In contrast, males spent daylight hours in comparatively deep water (~18m) and nocturnally either ranged throughout the water column or occupied shallow-water habitats. The activity patterns of the sexes differed in the wild but not in the laboratory, indicating that sex-specific activity patterns of wild fish did not drive sexual segregation but were mediated through differential habitat selection.  Female refuging behaviour did not reflect the seasonal nature of grey seal sightings and thus it appears unlikely that predation risk underlies this behaviour.  Sex-differences were observed in the thermal habitat selection of wild dogfish, but not in those of laboratory-kept dogfish.  In addition, increased ambient temperatures did not increase rates of egg production, thus it is unlikely that females selected shallow water habitats to increase fecundity.  However, male dogfish made directed movements towards female refuges at the times when females emerged and returned, and laboratory-kept females increased their use of warm-water habitats when males were present.  It is hypothesised that social aversion is the principal factor driving sexual segregation in dogfish and that sperm-storing females refuge in shallow-water caves to avoid unnecessary mating attempts.

TI  - Physiological responses of Salmonella typhimurium under combined osmotic and heat stress
AB  - A notable exception to the enhanced antimicrobial activity generally seen with combination treatments is the combined effect of reduced water activity (aw) and heat inactivation where it is generally held that heat resistance or survival of several bacteria including Salmonella increases as the aw is reduced. However, recent reports suggest that reduced aw might increase or decrease heat resistance. Results of the present study showed that heating Salmonella Typhimurium at reduced aw (0.94) was protective at temperatures above 53-55°C but sensitising below this temperature. Using selective enumeration media to determine injury, it was shown that at lower heating temperatures (e.g. 50°C), cells survived at high aw with cytoplasmic membrane injury whereas at low aw these cells were killed. At higher temperatures (e.g. 60°C) ribosome degradation was a more important cause of death and was inhibited by low aw heating media thereby providing greater heat resistance. The time take for repair from injury varied with the different heating conditions and differed in the response to biosynthetic inhibitors such as azide, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. A lower than optimal growth temperature decreased heat resistance, while a high growth temperature increased it at both aw values (0.99 and 0.94). The effect of growth temperature was generally more pronounced at high aw. Habituation of Salmonella cells at low aw had no effect or decreased their heat resistance depending on the length of habituation and the heating condition. D50 reductions were always larger when heating at high aw compared to low aw conditions, whereas the reverse occurred in D60. The observed effect of low aw on Salmonella heat resistance cannot be generalised to all other bacteria. Other members of Enterobacteriaceae tested responded similarly, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram positives Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum all showed greater heat resistance at low aw regardless of temperature. Interestingly, Enterococcus faecalis, an enteric Gram positive, behaved similarly to the Enterobacteriaceae. Listeria monocytogenes, however, showed the opposite behaviour at both temperatures (50°C and 60°C).

TI  - Adaptability, Appropriate Nitrogen Application Rate and Tobacco-Leaf Roasting Technology for Some New Flue-cured Tobacco Varieties in Shaotong City of Yunnan Province
AB  - In order to increase diversity of flue-cured tobacco variety and accelerate extension of new flue-cured tobacco variety in Shaotong city of Yunnan province, the experiments of adaptability, appropriate application rate of nitrogen fertilizer and matched leaf-roasting technology were conducted in 2005 using Yunyan97, Yunyan203 and YH05 three new flue-cured tobacco varieties based on regional experiments of 2002-2004. The results of adaptability experiment showed that yield of each new variety was higher than that of control Yunyan85 and among which YH05 with highest, yield of Yunyan97 ranked the second and Yunyan203 the third. Yunyan97 was with the highest rate of top grade tobacco leaf and YH05 with the lowest. Yunyan97 also was with the highest production value of per unit of land Yunyan203 with the lowest. The investigation of field diseases resistance showed the diseases resistance of Yunyan203 and YH05 were better than control and Yunyan97 was similar with control. Based on the results mentioned above, it could be concluded that Yunyan 97 was with highest adaptability and was suitable to be planted in whole tobacco region of Shaotong city, YH05 was with higher diseases-resistance, especially for TMV and suitable to be planted in land with middle and low soil fertility, Yunyan203 was with high TMV and CMV-resistance and could be planted in areas where TMV was easily occurred. The results of fertilizer demand experiment showed that the appropriate application rate of nitrogen was 6 kgN for Yunyan97, 5kgN for Yunyan203 and 5 to 5.5 kgN for YH05 per mu respectively in middle fertility soil in Saoton city. The results of tobacco leaves roasting technology experiment showed that YH05 tobacco leaves should be roasted to yellow under high temperature and middle humidity and fixed color under rapidly increasing of temperature; Yunyan203 tobacco leaves should be roasted to yellow under middle temperature and humidity and fixed color under middle increasing rate of temperature; Yunyan97 tobacco leaves should be roasted yellow under middle temperature and humidity and fixed color under slow increasing of temperature.Alternate abstract:为尽快改变昭通市烤烟品种单一化现状，加快新品种的应用推广，在2002-2004年烤烟良种区域试验的基础上，2005年昭通市开展了云烟97、云烟203、YH05等新育（引）烤烟品种的适应性、需肥特性及烘烤配套技术研究。 适应性研究结果表明：三个新品种的平均亩产量都高于对照品种云烟85，其中以YH05最高，云烟97其次，再次是云烟203；上等烟比例以云烟97最高，其次是对照云烟85，再次是云烟203， YH05最低；平均亩产值以云烟97最高，其次是对照云烟85，再次是YH05，云烟203最低。田间自然发病情况的调查表明，云烟203、YH05的抗病性明显优于对照品种云烟85，云烟97综合抗性与对照云烟85接近。综合各性状表现，可以认为：云烟97适应性强，综合表现最好，各示范点表现比较稳定，可在昭通市各植烟县区进行大面积推广；YH05除昭阳区示范点较差外，其余示范点表现较好，抗病性较强，尤其高抗TMV，适宜在中等或偏下肥力土地种植；云烟203综合表现一般，但高抗TMV、CMV，可在TMV高发地区种植。 需肥特性研究结果表明，在昭通市中等肥力烟地下，云烟97的最佳施肥水平为亩施6kg纯N；云烟203为5kg纯N， YH05为5～5.5kg纯N。 烘烤配套技术研究结果表明，YH05品种烘烤时应采用高温、中湿变黄，快速升温定色的烘烤技术；云烟203品种烘烤时应采用中温、中湿变黄，适速升温定色的技术,而云烟97品种烘烤时应采用中温、中湿变黄，慢速升温定色的技术。

TI  - CH4 and N2O Emission and Their Influence on Global Warming Potential in Ground Cover Rice Production System
AB  - Field experiment and trace gas collection chamber was applied to study the effect of ground cover rice production system (GCRPS) on flux and dynamics of CH4 and N2O emission during second rice growth in Guangzhou- The experiments included five treatments of normal paddy (T1), plastic film mulching (T2), straw-mulching plus nomal N fertilizer (T3) (Urea), straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer (T4) and straw mulching plus CRF (T5)- The regularity of CH4 and N2O emission in GCRPS was discussed by comparison the flux of CH4 and N2O in different treatments- Total greenhouse effect, i-e- global warming potential (GWP), of each treatment was calculated to estimate the contribution of GCRPS to greenhouse effect in order to provide scientific knowledge for comprehensive estimating adaptability and plasticity of the GCRPS- Results showed that CH4 emission in normal paddy field and GCRPS concentrated in the nutritive growth stage of rice, being within 35 days after transplanting- However, there was little CH4 emission from the GCRPS treatments a small quantity of CH4 emission from normal paddy field during the later growing stage- The CH4 emission peak appeared in a few days after transplanting, which could last for several days- Then the amount of CH4 emission of paddy treatment and GCRPS treatments reduced to the lowest level- Compared to the normal paddy control treatment, the CH4 emission in GCRPS of whole growing stage declined by 16266 mg-m-2 to 17923 mg-m-2, i-e- by 79-8% to 88% of T1- It could be concluded that GCRPS could decrease CH4 emission- Among the GCRPS the plastic film mulching was the best on to refine the CH4 emission and straw mulching toke the second place- Different from CH4, the trend of N2O emission in normal paddy field was not regularly- That is to say, there was N2O emission peak in prophase of rice growth- However, the N2O emission of GCRPS treatments had consistent regularity- The N2O emission showed remarkable peak after first dressing in prophase of the growth, being about 20 to 30 days after transplanting- Afterwards, amount of N2O emission almost reduced to the lowest level during rice growth- Compared to normal paddy control treatment, the GCRPS treatments increased N2O emission- The N2O emission amount of straw mulching plus CRF (T5) increased by 37 mg-m-2, the plastic film treatment (T2) by 367-15 mg-m-2, straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer (T4) by 170-63 mg-m-2 and straw-mulching (T3) (Urea) by 804-84 mg-m-2 respectively- Among GCRPS treatments, the T5 gave the least emission, and T3 was the most- It indicated that the former possessed the least N2O GWP, the later tended to enhance the N2O greenhouse effect- Although N2O emission increased and CH4 decreased in GCRPS, total GWP of both CH4 and N2O decreased in the GCRPS compared to normal paddy- The GWP of normal paddy field was 1358392, while the GWP of T2 (plastic film), T3 (straw mulching), T4 (straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer), T5 (straw mulching plus CRF) were 294341, 522421, 328185, 286498 respectively- Compared to normal paddy treatment, the GWP of GCRPS treatments decreased by 61-5% to 78-9%- It was obvious that GCRPS could remarkably decrease the GWP- Within GCRPS treatments, mulch, fertilizers type and fertilization amount influenced the GWP (CH4 and N2O) significantly- Compared to normal paddy treatment, the GWP of T5 (straw mulching plus CRF), T2 (plastic film) and T4 (straw mulching plus lower N fertilizer) decreased by 75% more, while T3 (straw mulching) only by 61-5%- Many factors affected the CH4 and N2O emission in GCRPS, in which mostly included soil water content, soil temperature, pH, mulch material, fertilizer type, fertilization amount and so on- The reason of decline of the GWP in GCRPS was that the CH4 emission amount remarkably decreased- It was shown that CH4 was one of the primary greenhouse effect gases to contribute or to affect GWP in paddy field, while the N2O emission amount was the dominant factor to GWP in GCRPS-Alternate abstract:本文采用静态箱法，通过田间试验研究了广东晚稻常规稻田和覆盖旱种稻田在水稻全生育期内的CH4、N2O的排放量和排放规律。通过对常规稻田和覆盖旱种稻田间、覆盖旱种条件下的各种覆盖物处理间、不同的氮肥品种及用量处理间稻田CH4 、N2O排放的对比研究，探讨地表覆盖水稻旱种生产体系（GCRPS）稻田CH4、N2O排放规律，并通过对各处理稻田CH4和N2O总温室效应量，即全球增温潜势（GWP）的比较，评价各处理稻田CH4、N2O排放量及其温室效应大小，为综合评价GCRPS的适应性和可行性提供理论依据。 研究结果表明，不论是常规水田处理还是覆盖旱种处理，稻田的CH4排放都主要集中在水稻生长前期，即水稻移栽后的前35天以内；在水稻生长中、后期除了常规水田处理仍有一定量的CH4排放外，所有GCRPS处理都几乎没有CH4排放。稻田甲烷的排放规律表现为，水稻移栽后几天内便出现甲烷排放峰，峰期可持续数日，在移栽后35天以后，无论是常规稻田还是旱种稻田，甲烷排放量几乎降至全生育期最低水平。相对于常规水田处理而言，GCRPS各种覆盖处理都能极显著减少稻田CH4排放，整生育期覆盖旱种稻田CH4排放较常规水田降低了16266 g--2～17923g--2，减幅都达到了79-8%以上，地膜覆盖旱种处理减幅达到了88%。表明各种覆盖旱种（GCRPS）处理都能达到很好的减排（CH4）效果，其中以地膜覆盖旱种处理效果最好，稻草覆盖旱种处理次之。 对稻田N2O排放而言，常规水田（T1）的氧化亚氮排放无明显的规律，即在水稻生长期，无明显的排放峰值和峰期。覆盖旱种几个处理的稻田氧化亚氮排放有一致的规律，即在水稻生长前期，在第一次追肥后，稻田出现明显的氧化亚氮排放峰，排放峰大致出现在移栽后的第20天到第30天内。峰期结束后，氧化亚氮的排放量几乎降到一生的最低水平。相对于常规稻田，覆盖旱种处理均增加稻田氧化亚氮排放量。覆草旱种控释肥处理（T5）稻田N2O排放量增加了37 g--2，地膜覆盖旱种（T2）的增加了367-15 mg-m-2，覆草旱种低氮处理（T4）增加了170-63 mg-m-2，覆草旱种（尿素常规用量）处理（T3）增加了804-84 mg-m-2。覆盖旱种处理中，以覆草旱种控释肥处理的氧化亚氮增加量最少，覆草旱种尿素常规用量的最多。说明前者的环保效果好，后者则易引起氧化亚氮排放而增加温室效应。 虽然水稻覆盖旱种处理两种温室气体一增（氧化亚氮增加）一减（甲烷降低），两者（CH4和N2O）的全球增温潜势（GWP）结果表明，常规水田处理的GWP为1358392，覆盖旱种处理T2、T3、T4、T5的分别为294341、522421、328185、286498。覆盖旱种处理稻田的GWP较常水田处理规稻田降低了61-5％～78-9%，可见地表覆盖旱种水稻能极显著降低稻田的全球增温潜势（GWP）。在地表覆盖旱种系统（GCRPS）内，覆盖方式、氮肥品种（形态）以及施肥量不同，稻田排放的温室气体（CH4和N2O）的全球增温效应（GWP）也存在显著差异。相对于常规稻田，覆草旱种控释肥（T5）、覆膜旱种（T2）及覆草旱种低氮（T4）处理的GWP值可降低75%以上，而覆草旱种尿素常规用量处理（T3）的减幅为61-5%。从降低稻田GWP来看，影响覆盖旱种稻田CH4、N2O排放的因素很多，主要有土壤水分、土壤温度，土壤pH、覆盖方式、肥料种类、施肥量等。 常规稻田改覆盖旱种后GWP降低的主要原因是甲烷排放量明显降低，说明常规稻田的温室效应气体及其GWP的效应以CH4为主，而覆盖旱种条件下稻田N2O的排放量多少则直接影响着各覆盖旱种处理GWP值的高低。

TI  - Characterization of physiological and transcriptome changes in the ancient Siberian permafrost bacterium Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4 with low temperature and increased osmotica
SP  - 215
AB  - The Siberian permafrost is an extreme, yet stable environment due to its continuously frozen state. Average temperatures of -10 to -12°C concentrate solutes to an aw = 0.90 (5 osm), and limit nutrient diffusion into cells. The isolation of viable Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4 and Exiguobacterium sibericum 255-15 from ancient permafrost suggests that these bacteria have maintained some level of metabolic activity for thousands of years and are likely cryo-adapted. Past studies of cold-acclimated bacteria have focused primarily on organisms not capable of sub-zero growth. Siberian permafrost isolates E. sibericum 255-15 and P. arcticum 273-4, which grow at subzero temperatures, were used to study cold-acclimated physiology. Changes in membrane composition and exopolysaccharides were defined as a function of growth at 24, 4 and -2.5°C in the presence and absence of 5% NaCl. As expected, there was a decrease in fatty acid saturation and chain length at the colder temperatures and a further decrease in the degree of saturation at higher osmolarity. A shift in carbon source utilization and antibiotic resistance occurred at 4 versus 24°C growth, perhaps due to changes in the membrane transport. Both isolates had excellent survival after one year of being frozen at -20°C and moderate ice nucleation activity. To gain knowledge of the features for adaptation to low temperature and water activity, the genome of a Siberian permafrost isolate was sequenced. Psychrobacter arcticum 273-4, a gamma-Proteobacterium grows at temperatures as low as -10°C and displays marked physiological changes under low temperature vs. mesophilic growth and in the presence of increased osmotica (salt). Differential gene expression analyses at 4°C and 22°C, using microarrays specific for the predicted genes of P. arcticum 273-4, reveal that only a few genes known to be low-temperature and salt-responsive in mesophiles and in some psychrotrophs are differentially expressed in P. arcticum. Total respiratory activity increased in the presence of salt, due to increased number of Na + dependent dehydrogenase and decarboxylase transcripts suggesting that P. arcticum has adapted for energy generation in the low temperature and low water activity of the permafrost environment. Growth in salt-amended ½ TSB leads to induction of capsule genes and a capsule is visible around cells grown at both 22 and 4°C, which could allow P. arcticum to adhere to soil particles within the permafrost. Capsule production, lipid modification and compatible solute accumulation to balance internal osmolytes may allow P. arcticum to remain metabolically active within the low water activity of the Siberian permafrost.

TI  - Testing hypotheses about human adaptive evolution using matched molecular and phenotypic data
SP  - 136
AB  - Anthropological genetics and paleoanthropology traditionally occupied separate niches in the study of modern human origins, rarely cross fertilizing one another and occasionally adopting adversarial stances. This separation is unfortunate because of the critical interdependence of genetic and morphological approaches to understanding evolution. It is also completely surmountable due to the fact that there is a large body of evolutionary quantitative genetic theory available to study these problems. This dissertation includes a series of three studies demonstrating applications of evolutionary quantitative genetics to the study of the evolution of modern human phenotypes. The first study, addressed estimating the within- and among-region components of variance underlying different aspects of morphological size and shape. Only upper facial shape seemed to deviate from neutral expectations while other aspects of shape and size appear to be evolving neutrally. The second study involved comparing matrices of pairwise interpopulational genetic and phenotypic (cranial) distances in an extension of the comparative method. I used extremes of cold as a selective hypothesis. This allowed me to see which populations and which traits conformed to a neutral model of evolution and which did not. Cranial variation was largely neutral with the exception of measures of cranial breadth and nasal and facial width and height. A single population living in an extremely cold environment accounted for most of the deviations from neutrality. The third project presented a similar test of neutrality applied to the global distribution of skin pigmentation variation as measured by skin reflectometry at the 685nm wavelength. I used the same matrix comparison method as in the second project and incorporated latitude as a variable representing my selective hypothesis. The neutral model of skin evolution was rejected and the main cause of among population differentiation in skin reflectance at the global level appears to be adaptation by natural selection to local conditions consistent with adaptationist hypothesis of the selective importance of UV radiation.

TI  - Transcriptome and proteome analysis of Geobacillus stearothermophilus gene expression regulated by temperature
SP  - 125
AB  - Microorganisms adapted to high temperature have evolved a variety of mechanisms to survive in this environment (thermoadaptation). Biochemical studies have provided a vast array of information on thermoadaptation. For this work, a comprehensive analysis of changes in gene expression patterns was performed for a 15°C temperature difference within the Arrhenius range of Geobacillus stearothermophilus NUB3621. No differentially expressed transcripts were isolated by subtractive cloning at the defined temperatures of 50°C and 65°C. Yet, two-dimensional liquid chromatography identified 27 proteins which are upregulated and 101 proteins which are downregulated at 65°C. Protein H2, which is upregulated at 65°C, was sequenced and its corresponding gene cloned. This gene encodes 183 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 20.3 kDa and pI of 4.64. The protein sequence shares multiple characteristics with YkuU from B. subtilis. The amount of ykuU transcript in G. stearothermophilus NUB3621 was comparable at both 50°C and 65°C. With this protein as a model, it was concluded that some temperature regulated genes are controlled by a post-transcriptional mechanism. A 15°C temperature difference within the Arrhenius range alters expression of a family of proteins in G. stearothermophilus NUB3621. The function of these proteins and their role in cell survival at increased temperatures remains unknown. These thermoadaptation studies we have initiated with G. stearothermophilus have opened up a rather novel area of gene regulation. These studies will contribute to our understanding of how this organism has adapted and serve as a paradigm for investigations with microorganisms that exist near the extremes of planetary conditions. This is a challenging frontier of current biology that will have wide spread interest in both the scientific and the biotechnology communities.

TI  - Evolutionary changes at expanding range margins in the butterfly, Pararge aegeria
SP  - 353
AB  - In the UK, 25% of butterfly species have expanding distributions probably as a response to global warming as more habitat becomes climatically available.  Predictions for future warming range from 1.4ºC to 5.8ºC by 2100, and it is becoming increasingly important to identify factors affecting range expansion in butterflies both currently and in the future. In this study, some of the effects of range expansion were investigated in a British butterfly, Pararge aegeria.  This study confirmed that range expansion results in an increase in dispersal capability at the expanding range margin due to the non-random colonisation by dispersers.  However, this increase in dispersal resulted in a trade-off with reproduction resulting in a lower fecundity in range margin populations.  Repeated founder effects during range expansion resulted in a linear decline in allozyme variation towards the range margin resulting in genetically-deficient margin populations.  However, in an area with more continuous habitat, increased dispersal at the range margin was not selected for and genetic diversity remained similar despite range expansion.  Warm temperatures and periods of larval starvation were also responsible for increased dispersal propensity in populations at an expanding range margin with margin populations being more sensitive to warmer temperatures and better adapted to periods of starvation compared to the core populations.  This study also used computer models to investigate the importance of habitat availability and the pattern of habitat loss on range shifts.  Dispersal capability and range expansion were found to decline with increasing habitat fragmentation and the pattern of habitat loss and the presence of flight behaviour proved to be important in determining range expansion.  Despite increased dispersal at the range margin, it is suggested that further habitat fragmentation is likely to impede future range expansion in this species.

TI  - Thermal quality influences thermoregulation, behaviour and habitat selection at multiple scales in eastern milksnakes (Lampropeltis triangulum)
SP  - 92
AB  - Body temperature variation affects most physiological processes in terrestrial ectotherms and, therefore, can have a large effect on fitness. I studied eastern milksnakes at the northern extreme of their range, in a thermally challenging environment. Because of the particular importance of thermoregulation in thermal extremes, I hypothesized that thermal quality would influence thermoregulation, behaviour and habitat selection. In chapter one, I demonstrated that when thermal quality decreased, milksnakes increased investment in thermoregulation, a result contrary to the central prediction of the cost-benefit model of thermoregulation. Because ecotherms obtain heat from their environment, I predicted that when thermal quality was low, milksnakes would bask more and select higher thermal habitat. Milksnakes did not alter their habitat use in response to thermal quality. They did, however, alter their behaviour and were seen basking more and concealed less when thermal quality was low. In chapter two, my main goal was to determine if thermal quality affected habitat selection at multiple scales. Supporting my prediction, thermal quality influenced habitat selection at both the home range scale and the location scale. At both scales, milksnakes selected high thermal quality habitats (rocky outcrops, fields, and edges) and avoided low thermal quality habitat (forest). At the microhabitat scale, milksnakes selected locations with open canopy and many rocks. As a secondary objective, I tested the ability of 4 m resolution IKONOS imagery to accurately quantify habitat selection at the scale of the locations used by each snake. Although not as accurate as traditional field methods, remote sensing showed promise in measuring habitat selection at that scale.

TI  - Ecological genetics of heavy metal tolerant populations of Suillus luteus
SP  - 103
AB  - Genomic and transcriptomic aspects of the adaptation to increased environmental heavy metal concentrations were studied in relation to phenotypic observations of heavy metal tolerance in populations of the ectomycorrhizal basidiomycete Suillus luteus. S. luteus sporocarps were collected at nine different locations in the Campine phytogeographic district (province of Limburg, Belgium). At six of these locations the soil is severely polluted with heavy metals due to past activities of several zinc smelters and phenotypic characterization, by means of in vitro growth experiments, revealed an obvious increase of the heavy metal tolerance in the populations at these sites. However, evidence for natural selection was not found at the genomic level. AFLP and microsatellite marker analyses both indicated high levels of genetic diversity within the total sample and within geographic subpopulations, but limited population differentiation. No current or past reduction of the genetic diversity of populations inhabiting polluted environments was discovered, nor was population differentiation found to be related to the environmental heavy metal pollution. In accordance with the high level of genomic diversity revealed by the more-or-less neutral AFLP and microsatellite markers, considerable diversity was found at the level of the transcriptome by cDNA-AFLP analysis of a heavy metal tolerant and a nontolerant isolate. Although transcript profiling should be regarded as a tool for exploratory data analysis and some of the differences in expression level will be due to genetic hitchhiking and natural regulatory variation, some information was obtained about possible mechanisms that may explain the difference in tolerance level. Expression of a hydrophobin homologue, a water-repellent protein in the cell wall which is believed to protect against penetration of heavy metal containing solutions, may be partly responsible for the higher external zinc concentrations required to induce modulation of transcription in the tolerant isolate and candidate genes that may play a role in the detoxification of and cellular defense against heavy metals were identified as encoding a heat shock protein (HSP60), a putative metal transporter and several proteins involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. The results of these different experiments show that heavy metal pollution has limited influence on the genetic diversity of S. luteus populations, a result that seems unlikely a priori but that has been described in several other organisms. In case of S. luteus bottleneck events associated with the foundation of populations in polluted environments may have been prevented by the introduction of different tolerant genotypes, followed by sexual reproduction on the site and rapid evolution of the tolerance trait. Additionally, recurrent migration of tolerant genotypes that originate due to admixture in nonpolluted areas, which is very likely due to the high migration rates, may have attributed to the high levels of genetic diversity of populations in polluted habitats.

TI  - The quantitative genetic effects of small population size and environmental stress in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 199
AB  - The viability and persistence of natural populations may be threatened by genetic factors that accompany small population size. The principle genetic concerns associated with small population size are (i) the loss of adaptive potential and (ii) the loss of population fitness due to inbreeding depression. Experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster were used to address research questions associated with these genetic factors. Findings suggest that the loss of adaptive potential in small populations may be of equal or greater importance as inbreeding depression in maintaining population viability. The sternopleural bristle number was used as a model quantitative trait to examine the long-term decline of adaptive potential in isolated populations and changes in adaptive potential after gene flow events. Significant declines in adaptive potential were found to occur within small populations over time, and following severe bottleneck events, losses of adaptive potential were larger than theoretically expected. In addition, it was found that the loss of adaptive potential after many generations of small population size was not completely recovered by hybridization of experimental lineages. These results are most likely due to the loss of rare alleles occurring during bottleneck events. In a separate study, it was demonstrated that levels of adaptive potential (underlying bristle number) are significantly increased by high temperature stress, and that such increases were not explainable by the direct effects of historical selection. An analysis of male survivorship within small populations showed significant inbreeding depression for this life history trait, and demonstrated that the severity of inbreeding depression increased over the lifespan. In further experiments, factors potentially influencing inbreeding depression in small populations were investigated. It was found that high levels of ancestral inbreeding and inbreeding history significantly reduced inbreeding depression by 40% and 60%, respectively. In a separate study, the inbreeding rate was found to have no significant effect on inbreeding depression, but stressful inbreeding environments were associated with significant inbreeding depression declines of 80% or greater. Overall, strong support was obtained for the hypothesis that the effects of inbreeding depression can be limited by the purging of deleterious recessive alleles.

TI  - Seawater adaptation in juvenile green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris
SP  - 187
AB  - Aspects of the seawater (SW) adaptation of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), an anadromous species along the Pacific Coast of North America, were examined. In their natal rivers, temperatures have changed from historic patterns. To determine the effect of elevated and cycling temperature regimes on post yolk-sac larva to early juveniles, growth rates were measured. Significant differences were found between final wet weights, total lengths (TL), and specific growth rates (24°C & cycling 19--24°C > 19°C), indicating that these temperatures do not adversely affect juveniles (∼0.1--10 g) with abundant food and oxygen. Because some salmonids show decreased swimming performance ( Ucrit) during their parr-smolt transformation, we tested the hypothesis that juvenile green sturgeon decrease U crit during their analogous ontogenetic stage. U crit increased up until the size that SW tolerance was achieved, and then either decreased or increased depending on the season. Therefore, ontogenetic and endogenous factors appear to influence swimming abilities. A salinity tolerance study was conducted to determine the earliest age/size at which SW survival was possible for short-term (72-h) and long-term (28-d) exposure. Juvenile green sturgeon salinity tolerance increased with increasing size and age, with 100% survival in 72-h exposed fish occurring by 134 days post-hatch (dph; 86 g, 266 mm TL), and 100% survival in 28-d exposed fish by 7 months in two size groups (139 g, 336 mm TL; 342 g, 434 mm TL). To determine the metabolic costs and osmoregulatory mechanisms involved in SW adaptation, sturgeon (100, 170, and 533 dph) were acclimated to salinities of <3‰, 10‰, and 33‰. There were no differences in body-mass-adjusted oxygen consumption rates, and osmo- and ionoregulatory abilities were comparable among <3‰ and 10‰ groups, and with the 533 dph 33‰ group. Na+, K+-ATPase activities increased in pyloric caeca at 33‰, presumably due to drinking and SW absorption. Gill chloride cell size increased between 100 and 170 dph, and abundance relative to wet mass decreased with increasing age/size. These results indicated an age/body size effect in hyperosmotic adaptability, and that juvenile green sturgeon most likely enter SW by 1.5 kg (75 cm TL).

TI  - Geographic and temporal patterns of evolution and extinction of brachiopods through the late Paleozoic ice age: Global and regional patterns
SP  - 264
AB  - The serial pattern of mass extinctions and rebounds that characterized the Paleozoic history of marine invertebrate diversity was interrupted in late Paleozoic time by a long interval of weak diversification and unusually low rates of origination and extinction. This interval of sluggish macroevolution coincided precisely with the most extensive glaciation of the Phanerozoic Era, the late Paleozoic ice age. Using a database of geographic and stratigraphic occurrences of brachiopod genera, I show that climatic conditions of the late Paleozoic ice age caused low macroevolutionary rates by altering the biogeographic composition of the global brachiopod fauna. The onset of cold and highly seasonal temperatures in late Mississippian time caused the preferential extinction of brachiopod genera with narrow latitudinal ranges, which lived primarily at low latitudes and were therefore adapted to only small seasonal temperature changes. It was not until the late Paleozoic ice age waned in middle Permian time that narrowly-distributed genera were able to re-evolve at low latitudes and return the brachiopod fauna to its pre-ice age configuration. Because latitudinal range size was correlated with temporal duration, the preponderance of widespread genera with long average durations during the ice age caused macroevolutionary rates to fall and remain low while the glacial climate persisted. These data also demonstrate the causal linkages between climate and latitudinal gradients of diversity, latitudinal range size, and macroevolutionary rates for brachiopods during late Paleozoic time, and suggest that these same factors underpin the modern latitudinal diversity gradient of marine genera. Further analyses of brachiopod genera from Mississippian strata of the Central Appalachian basin reveal that the Late Mississippian mass extinction did not strongly select against genera because of their species diversity, regional relative abundance, body size, preferred facies, or environmental breadth. Mass extinctions in general did not select for traits known to influence background extinction rates; however, they did intensify background rates of extinction. This paradox can be reconciled for the Late Mississippian mass extinction because one trait, thermal tolerance, was amplified in importance during the glacial climate. This selective regime lasted through the glacial climate and underpinned the whole of the late Paleozoic ice age.

TI  - Knowledge based approach to waste utilisation for energy generation in Northern Ireland
SP  - 1
AB  - Waste disposal has become an increasing problem in many countries. Waste recovery for energy generation is investigated within this research work using Northern Ireland as the specific example. For setting up a decision support system, different scenarios and case studies were examined as part of the knowledge acquisition. To understand the environmental effects of waste utilisation for energy purposes, combustible waste types are classified and analysed with respect to their compositions and origins. A detailed study of the waste availability in Northern Ireland is provided for assessing technological and socio-economical viabilities. Moreover, the impacts of harvesting forestry and wood residues for energy generation are elucidated. The information gathered from these activities is used to simulate different power plant technologies such as moving grate furnaces (MGF), circulating fluidised bed combustion plants (CFBC) and rotary kilns as well as downdraft gasifiers and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC). Because of the lack of detailed operating data, the knowledge acquisition procedures were carried out using the ECLIPSE process simulation software. MGF results show the most cost-effective technology. IGCC demonstrates the best thermal conversion methods. This technology, however, is very susceptible to the feedstock properties such as moisture and incombustible content. Problematic waste types can be best processed within CFBC plants. Furthermore, the techno-economical feasibility of utilising manufacturing wastes for the internal energy supply is performed with respect to two industrial case studies. The results of over 154 simulations and information about 200 waste types are made available within two case libraries. In connection with the non-monotonic knowledge based system (case based reasoning), these cases are used as a decision support for assessing prospective waste to energy technologies. Some important results are schematically illustrated in terms of their case sequences. For case adaptation and extrapolation, least mean squares and artificial neural networks are used to tailor available scenarios to new situations. For assessing interactions and for case validations, multivariate methods such as self-organising maps, principal component analysis and multivariate validations are employed as part of the knowledge based system. For case optimisation, genetic algorithms are used in connection with optimal thermal processing values and desirable waste input.

TI  - Thermal acclimation processes in the grain aphid sitobion avenae (hemiptera: aphididae): characterising the effect of rapid cold hardening and seasonal acclimation on survival and movement thresholds at low temperature
SP  - 1
AB  - The ability of nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae to rapidly cold harden and to increase cold hardiness through successive generations reared at low temperature was investigated.  Rapid cold hardening increased survival at -8°C from 20% to 80% and extended the lower lethal temperature by 3°C.  No ecological costs in terms of development, longevity or fecundity were associated with RCH.  'Seasonally' acclimating aphids by rearing at 10°C for >6 months, increased the RCH ability of aphids, and the combination of seasonal acclimation and RCH actually enhanced fitness.  The ability of this species to rapidly cold harden provides a significant survival advantage, allowing the cold hardiness of individuals to track daily changes in temperature. The short generation times of aphids mean that developing embryos are subject to the same environmental temperatures as their mother.  Because of this so-called 'telescoping of generations', the cold hardiness of new-born nymphs is a function of both pre- and post-natal environmental temperatures.  Rearing aphids at 10°C extended the lower lethal temperature of the population by 3°C compared to aphids reared at 20°C.  Nymphs were consistently more cold hardy than adults, with first born nymphs exhibiting greater cold hardiness than those born later in the mothers reproductive life, suggesting that low temperature exerts an intergenerational selection for increased cold tolerance, combined with a preferential investment of increased cold tolerance in first born progeny through successive generations. The role of rapid and intergenerational cold hardening in the overwintering ability of Sitobion avenae are discussed with reference to the implications of global warming and the importance of this aphid as a vector of barley yellow dwarf virus.

TI  - Monitoring tropospheric composition using time of flight chemical ionisation mass spectrometric techniques
SP  - 284
AB  - The use of proton transfer reactions (PTR) to quantify volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurring in a variety of environments has increased in recent years. Here a 44.4 MBq 241Am source is used to ionise water vapour generating H3O+ protonated water molecules. This thesis describes how proton transfer reaction products fed into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS), can produce simultaneous mass spectra for the entire mass range of reacting species in an experiment and produce a mass resolution m/Δm greater than 1000. The scope of application of the investigation has been expanded to include the use of alternative chemical ionisation reagents with proton transfer reactions to form a broader based technique called chemical ionisation reaction mass spectrometry or CIRMS. Measurements of atmospheric VOC loadings at the University of Leicester show pronounced weekday and subdued weekend cyclic variations in atmospheric VOC loading and demonstrate the value of the equipment in monitoring Leicester's growing urban pollution. The PTR-TOF-MS is shown to support chemical ionisation reactions using the reagents, NO+, O2+, as in earlier selected ion flow tube (SIFT) work. In experiments using a selection of commonly occurring VOCs as analytes, NO+ and, to a lesser extent, O 2+ were found to be useful alternatives reagents to H 3O+. The results obtained were similar to the SIFT work with the same reagents, but they show the influence of the increased collision energy introduced by the potential gradient applied to the drift-tube and demonstrate the advantages of the broader based CIRMS approach. The value of switching to NO+ or O2 + as alternative chemical ionisation reagents has been demonstrated for use in the time-of-flight mass spectrometry environment.

TI  - Patterns and processes of life history variation in the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu
SP  - 224
AB  - This research explores the degree and causes of life history variation in the smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu. Smallmouth bass are an interesting study species for exploring life history variation for two main reasons: (i) many populations are in various stages of colonization thereby allowing characterization of life history dynamics as a population adapts to a new environment; (ii) they show paternal care, the presence of which may modify patterns of life history response. Variability is examined over a broad scale of geographically diverse populations, between adjacent populations, and temporally within populations. Results indicate that there is a large degree of variation in somatic growth and maturation among smallmouth bass populations and that climate, food availability, and mortality are important drivers of this variation. A significant amount of the among-population differences represent a combination of plastic responses and genetic adaptation to these three forces. Among populations spread over the present North American range of the species, there is a positive relationship between temperature and early growth but the association weakens in non-native populations. On a local scale, food availability and lack of ontogenetic diet shifting appear to have driven much of the phenotypic divergence in growth and maturation between two populations introduced from a common source a century ago. Finally, the results of an individual-based model show that selective mortality can influence population dynamics, somatic growth, and evolution of maturation in a short time span. However, the addition of survival functions associated with parental care reduces the magnitude of evolutionary response. This study underscores the importance of considering population life history as dynamic and capable of showing rapid plastic and/or genetic responses to both natural and human forces.

TI  - Studies on the artificial induced parthenogenesis of Singuo red carp (Cyprinus carpio var Singuonensis)
AB  - Singuo red carp (Cypriinus carpio var Singuonensis) and Crucican carp（Carassius auratus gibelio） were employed to investigate the production of parthenogenesis, the development of parthenogenetic embryo were also observed. The results were as follows: 1.Viable gynogenetic diploid larvaes of Singuo red carp were acquired by thermal shock after fertilization of inactivated Crucican carp sperms with the mature eggs of Singuo red carp. The sperms of Crucian carp were inactivated by UV with the dosage of 375mJ/cm2 -750mJ/cm².Temperature shock were selected to inhabit the polar-body release in 1min -3min after fertilization, or inhabit the first cleavage in 21min-39min after fertilization , heat shock were treated at 40.5℃-41℃ for 1min-3min, cold shock at 4℃-6℃ for 20min-40min. The results showed that the optimum inactive UV-irradiation dosage of Crucican carp sperms was 500mJ /cm². The highest hatching rate of 21.7% was obtained by cold shock in 2min after fertilization to induce polar gynogenesis. When the heating shock was applied in 27min and cold shock in 30min after fertilization, the hatching rates were 1.8% and 4.3% respectively. The first treating time was basically unanimous for heat shock and cold shock, but cold shock obviously abtained more viable larveas than heat shock.According to the chromosome numbers and morphology charasteristic of larveas , the all-female inheritance were found .The offsprings were identified as the gynogenetic cloning fishes of Singuo red carp. 2. Androgenetic diploid cloning fishes were induced by thermal shock after fertilization of inactivated Crucican carp eggs with the mature spermatozoas of Singuo red carp .When the hatching water temperature was 19℃-21℃,the eggs of crucican carp were immersed in three different ovarian fluids including EM,OF and SA.The eggs inactivated by UV with the dosages of 38mJ/cm2-190mJ/cm2.The haploid groups were merely irradiated by UV,the optimum dosage of UV treatment were determined according to the inductive percentage of haploid emryos.The groups of heat skock were exposed at 40.5℃-41℃ for 1min-3min to inhabit the first mitotic division in 24min-72min after fertilization,at intervals of 3min.The results showed that the optimum inactative outcomes of eggs were obtained when UV was used with the dosages of 76mJ/cm2 and the eggs were exposed in EM ovarian preserving fluids.The percentage of androgenetic haploid rates reache 57.2%.The times of diploidization treatment appeared two inductive heights in 24min-42min and 63min-72min after fertilization, the optimum hatching ratio of androgenetic embryos was 5.7 % when the time of heat shock were applied in 27min after fertilization.More androgenetic larvaes were obtained for the early shock than the later shock. According to the characters of androgenetic offsprings,the all-paternal morphology were found with the red homozygous recessive character, androgenetic offsprings were identified as the cloning fishes of Singuo red carp. 3.The production of androgenetic and gynogenetic haploid ,diploid embryo of Singuo red carp artificially induced by thermal shock in 20.5℃-21.5℃,observing the morphology characteristic and the development time sequence of different embryo and comparing the embryo development with the inbred carp in succession.The results showed the morphology character of haploid embryo was similar to diploid.The androgenetic haploid developed more slowly than gynogentic haploid and showed haploid syrdrome earier. Compared with androgenetic haploid ,the gynogentic haploid have more viable embryo, the development speeds of gynogentic embryo was similar to inbreed diploid carp. Both of the two kinds of haploid embryo couldn’t hatch the normal larvaes. The hatching time sequence of three kinds of diploid embryo was different as follows: androgenetic diploid 102.2h,gynogenotic diploid 78.5h and inbred carp 76.2h respectively. Androgenetic diploid embryo appeared obvious stagnantment at blastula stage and dosure of blastopore stage with two long-time development stage. The embryonic development of gynogenetic diploid kept basically pace with the inbreed carp.The hatching accumulated temperature of three kinds of diploid were androgenetic carp 1813.5[℃.h],gynogentic carp 1520.0[℃.h] and inbred carp 1455.6[℃.h] respectively , and indicated that parthenogenetic diploid embryo needed more hatching accumulated temperature.Alternate abstract:本文以兴国红鲤 （Cyprinus carpio var Singuonensis）和银鲫（Crucican carp）为材料，探讨了人工诱导兴国红鲤单性发育的不同途径，同时对单性胚胎发育进行了研究。主要结论如下： 1.银鲫精子经紫外线照射后与兴国红鲤卵子受精，再进行休克处理使染色体加倍，获得兴国红鲤雌核发育二倍体。具体方法是：银鲫精子在紫外线照射剂量375 mJ/cm2-750mJ/cm²，水温20.5℃-21.5℃,分别在受精后1min-3min、受精后21min-39min进行休克处理阻止第二极体排出或抑制第一次有丝分裂，热休克采取40.5℃-41℃处理1min-3min，冷休克4℃-6℃处理20min-40min,结果表明：UV照射剂量为500mJ/cm²（照射时间20min）对银鲫精子获得最佳灭活效果。受精后2min热休克或冷休克处理，可以诱导出极体雌核发育后代，分别获得10.3%和21.7%的出苗率；受精后27min进行热休克或受精后30min冷休克处理，可成功诱导出有丝分裂雌核发育后代,分别获得1.8%和4.3%的出苗率。极体雌核发育比有丝分裂雌核发育得到更多诱导成活后代，冷休克诱导效果优于热休克。雌核发育后代经染色体数目和形态学鉴定，与母本兴国红鲤表型一致。 2.银鲫卵子遗传失活与兴国红鲤成熟精子受精后经热休克处理，获得雄核发育二倍体克隆鱼。UV以38mJ/cm2-190mJ/cm2剂量分别照射浸泡在3种不同卵子保存液中的银鲫卵子，孵化水温19℃-21℃时，受精后24min-72min（每3min为一个梯度）进行热休克处理，将受精卵置于40.5℃-41℃温水中处理2min，以阻止第一次有丝分裂。结果表明：UV照射剂量为76mJ/cm2、使用EM卵子保存液时卵子获最佳灭活效果，单倍体诱导率达到57.2%；二倍化休克处理的时间在距受精后24min-42min和 63min-72min出现二个诱导高峰，其中受精后27min获得20h时胚胎存活率47.3%和出苗率5.7%。经过形态学和染色体数目鉴定，诱导后代与父本兴国红鲤表型一致。 3.热休克人工诱导出兴国红鲤雄核发育、雌核发育单倍体、二倍体胚胎，在水温20.5℃-21.5℃下连续观察各种胚胎发育的时序及形态变化特征，并与鲤自交后代胚胎发育进行比较。结果发现：单倍体胚胎与二倍体胚胎的各期形态特征相似，发育时序延迟。雄核发育单倍体发育速度慢于雌核发育单倍体，更早出现单倍体综合症。雌核发育单倍体发育速度与自交二倍体相似，出膜前期大量胚胎死于单倍体综合症。二种单倍体胚胎均无正常后代孵出。雄核发育二倍体，雌核发育二倍体和鲤鱼自交二倍体胚胎发育至孵出历时分别为102.2h、78.5h、76.2h。雄核发育二倍体胚胎在囊胚期和胚孔期存在二次较长时间的发育停滞。雌核发育二倍体胚胎发育速度与自交二倍体基本同步，出膜前期大量胚胎发育异常而死亡。三种二倍体的孵化积温依次为雄核鲤1813.7(℃.h)，雌核鲤1520.0(℃.h)，自交鲤1455.6(℃.h)，说明单性发育胚胎需要更多的孵化积温。

TI  - A New Dynamical Evolutionary Algorithm Based on the Entropy and its Application
AB  - Evolutionary Algorithm (EAs) gets inspiration from natural evolution and adaptation. Its fundamental principles are the survival of the fittest and the evolution in nature. It is a searching method owing the parallel, random and robust characteristics. In comparison with traditional methods, because of owing many superior properties, and no need of knowing additional information like glad and derivative, Evolutionary Algorithm can get many good results when dealing with some complex or non-linear problems. Nowadays, researchers in evolutionary computation pay much attention on the natural inspired computation, which suggests that we can employ some natural principles from natural sciences and the natural world to propose new computational models and methods. In this thesis, after the introduction of the EAs, a new dynamical evolutionary algorithm is proposed based on principle of minimal free energy from the statistical mechanics. This work is to indicate a new way or a new method in the research of EAs. The population of EAs is looked as a dynamical system or a particle system and those individuals are looked as particles. Based on the famous principle of minimal free energy and the knowledge of information theory, a new selection and acceptance strategy is defined. After the definition of the entropy of the particle system, the law of entropy increment is applied to control the algorithm running. In this process, the diversity of the population can be kept well. Meanwhile, by utilizing the temperature method of the Simulated Annealing Algorithm, the weight of the diversity would be decreased during the running of the computing for the purpose of quickly converging. The new algorithm is used to solve some global optimal problems and satisfactory numerical results are achieved. The results show it is good at keeping diversity of the system during the searching process, which gives us the confidence that the dynamical evolutionary algorithm is of some valuable performance for further research. The new dynamical evolutionary algorithm is also improved to use to solve some hard works, the multi-objectives optimization problems (MOP). The new models are built for some constrained MOPs. The good performance can be also got from the numerical experiments. Further research work on dynamical evolutionary algorithm is hoped under what we have done in this thesis.Alternate abstract:演化算法是一种借鉴生物界自然选择和进化机制发展起来的高度并行、随机、自适应搜索算法。与传统的优化方法相比，它具有普适性、鲁棒性、隐含并行性和自组织等智能特性，不需要知道更多的额外信息如梯度和导数的情况，并且通常能获得更好的结果。由于这些特性，演化算法特别适应于处理传统搜索算法解决不好的复杂的和非线性问题。 在现今的演化算法的研究中，学科之间的交叉以及将一些基础科学中的理论原则用于描述算法过程的方法得到了越来越多的重视。本文在介绍了演化算法的基本方法的基础上，就提出了一种基于统计力学中自由能极小化原理的新的动力学演化算法，为演化算法的研究提供新的途径。 本文将演化计算中的个体种群看作是统计力学中的一个粒子系统，根据著名的自由能极小化原理和信息论的知识，我们定义了一个新的选择接收策略。在给出了粒子系统的熵的计算方法后，利用熵增原理来控制整个程序的执行过程。利用能量变小而熵增加的原理，在算法的整个进化过程中较好地保持了种群的收敛性和多样性。同时，利用模拟退火算法的温度策略对我们的熵增过程进行温度控制，通过调解温度参数，是得多样性的权重在整个进化过程中逐渐减小，从而能更快地收敛到最优解。 在应用问题中，新的动力学演化算法被用于解决一些单目标全局优化问题，我们也得到了一些满意的解。数值结果显示出，算法能在搜索过程中很好地保持系统的多样性，从而避免过早收敛。 我们还将新的动力学演化算法应用于现今研究比较热门的领域，比如多目标优化问题。通过在单目标动力学演化算法的基础上进行改进，新的动力学演化算法在解决多目标优化问题的时候也取得了较好的结果。动力学演化算法的良好性能也让我们期待更加深入的研究。它为演化算法的研究加入了新的想法，也开辟了新的途径。

TI  - Several applied basic studies on main Trichogramma species for application in biological control in China
AB  - Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma are widely used in biological control against Lepidopterous pests. In considering future development of biological control, the focus should be placed on the applied basic research and the development of some key technologies. However, an insufficiency of basic research on Trichogramma wasps in China shows unconformity with its leading place in the world on application. This paper based on the present state of Trichogramma research, used main Trichogramma species of researching and applying in China as the studying target, aimed at key issues on influence of environmental factors in field, cold storage, species identification and non-target effect, studied concretely effects of high temperature shocks on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs, effect of pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton on reproduction and survival of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis, effects of cold storage on T. dendrolomi reared on A. eggs , system and application of molecular identification based on species-specific primers for important Trichogramma species in China, prefenence of Trichogramma dendrolimi and Trichogramma chilonis for eggs of predatory insects. The main results were summarized as follows:1 Effects of high temperature shocks on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggsTrichogramma wasps reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs have been widely used throughout China as biological control agent against some pests. However, in certain regions, high temperature prevailing in summer is suspected to execute a negative influence on the parasitoids. To simulate these adverse conditions, we applied single heat shocks (35℃ and 40℃) for 6 hours to middle stage and late stage of pupae of Trichogramma dendrolomi, and recorded the percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg, female ratio and longevity as well as the number of wasps with parasitization, percent emergence, number of wasps per host egg and female ratio in the next generation. The results showed the susceptibility of both middle stage and late stage of pupae to high temperature shocks, especially at 40℃. At this temperature, percent emergence and number of wasps per host egg were substantially reduced, and especially when the parasitoids experienced the high temperature shocks at late pupal stage, they nearly failed to achieve any emergence. For the progeny generation, all parameters as a whole seem to be little affected by the heat shock experienced in the parent generation.2 Effect of Pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton on reproduction and survival of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonisThe availability and quality of food played an important role in determing the effectiveness of parasitoids as control agents. The effects of pollen of regular cotton and transgenic Cry1Ac+CpTI cotton as a food source for Trichogramma chilonis were assessed in the laboratory by investigating paratization rate, prgeny survival and sex ratio. The results of this study under laboratory conditions are then considered in relation to determine whether pollen availability is likely to be an important factor in field performance and whether transgenic cotton pollen could affect survival and reproduction of T. chilonis. Females fed on a suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water lived as long as those fed on water alone or urfed, but significantly shorter than than those fed on honey alone and suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in honey, either with or without eggs rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica). T. chilonis females fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in honey parasitized and produced significantly more eggs, offspring and males than those fed on honey or water alone, suspention of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water and unfed. T. chilonis females fed on honey parasitized and produced significantly more eggs, offsping and males than those fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water, water alone and unfed. No significant differences were found among those feeding on suspension of pollen of regular cotton or transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water, water alone and unfed. The longevity, numbers of parasitized eggs, progeny survival and sex ratio of T. chilonis fed on suspension of pollen of transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton in water or honey did not differ significantly from those fed on suspension of pollen of regular cotton in water or 10% honey. Pollen and honey supplied a complete diet for reproduction and survival of T. chilonis and transgenic Bt+CpTI cotton pollen did not affect T. chilonis.3 Effects of cold storage on Trichogramma dendrolomi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggsTrichogramma wasps reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs have been widely used throughout China as biological control agent against some pests. Cold storage can permit more effective commercial rearing, transportation and inundative releasing of Trichogramma spp.. The effects of storage temperature (4℃, 7℃, 10℃ and 13℃), stage (egg, larva, prepupa and pupa) and time (2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks) were investigated on Trichogramma dendrolimi reared in A. pernyi eggs, by comparing percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg and female ratio in different combination. The results showed storage temperature, stage and time and interactions between these three factors substantially reduced the percentages of adult emergence rate, number of wasps per host egg, but not lowed female ratio. Among all stored temperatures, T. dendrolimi was susceptive to 10℃, its emergence was greatly impacted by this temperature, therefore was considered as unfavorable temperature for long-time storage. T. dendrolimi was not susceptive to 7℃ comparatively, which is favorable temperature for long-time storage. Favorable storage stage for long-term storage was different with temperatures (4℃ and 7℃). Larva and pupa stage at 4℃ and egg and pupa stage at 7℃ was found to be the most appropriate stage for storage, resulting in little adverse effects on the percentages of adult emergence rate and number of wasps per host egg. Compared to 25℃ controls, egg stage storage at 7℃ based on the percentages of adult emergence rate and pupa stage storage at 4℃ based on number of wasps per host egg were optimal cold storage conditions for T. dendrolimi reared on Antheraea pernyi eggs. 4 System and application of molecular identification based on species-specific primers for important Trichogramma species in ChinaSpecies-specific primers of Trichogramma chilonis, T. evanescens, T. ostriniae, T. brassicae, T. embryophagum, T. cacoeciae has been designed based on their rDNA- ITS2 sequence in this paper, and the specific primers of T. dendrolimi, T. ostriniae and the genus Trichogramma were retrieved from previously published articles. All of the specific primers were then applied to identification of multiple Trichogramma and host eggs samples through PCR assays. The results showed that our methods could produce clear, unique and reproducible target DNA bands from individual adult wasp. Furthermore, the species-specific primer-based results were fully consistent with those derived from morphological-based ones. So it can be concluded that molecular identification of the four important Trichogramma species in China, namely T. dendrolimi, T. chilonis, T. evanescens and T. ostriniae, and three exotic Trichogramma species, namely T. brassicae, T. embryophagum, T. cacoeciae can be realized by using the above-described diagnostic primers.The success or failure of application and research on Trichogramma spp. could depend on the investigate of endoparaitism and species in field. The identification of Trichogramma wasps remains very difficult owing to its minuteness, indistinguishable morphology and susceptibility to hosts and environment. Molecular identification technology based on species-specific primers was applied on (1) detecting of parasitism on sentinel eggs, in four treatments of Trichogramma spp. on controlling Helicoverpa armigera in cotton field; (2) identification of samples collecting from corn field. The results show that: (1) 6 and 9 eggs parasitized by T. dendrolimi were found in cotton fields with T. dendrolimi and combination of T. dendrolimi and T. chilonis released, and none of parasitized eggs were found in field with T. chilonis and T. brassicae released or control; (2) 114 samples from corn field all were indentified as T. ostriniae with 98.25% accuracy. The above results indicate that molecular assay may be used as high-efficiency tool on efficacy of biocontrol and investigation in field. Furthermore, limits and prospects of molecular identificaton basen species-specific primers were discussed.5 Prefenence of Trichogramma dendrolimi and Trichogramma chilonis for eggs of predatory insectsThe acceptability and suitability of eggs of five predatory insects to parasitization by Trichogramma were observed under no choice and choice situations in the laboratory. The results from no choice experiments showed that both T. denrolimi and T. chilonis could parasitize and emerge from Chrysoperla sinica and Chrysopa septempunctata, but could not parasitize Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata. In choice experiments, T. denrolimi substantially preferred eggs of C. sinica to the target host Ostrinia furnacalis as indicated by both contacts with host eggs and the number of eggs laid in the hosts. Trichogramma chilonis also contacted and parasitized more eggs of C. sinica than eggs of the target host Helicoverpa armigera, but the difference was not significant. In both parasitoids, there was no significant difference in number of wasps per host egg, female ratio of progeny and percentages of wasps with parasitization between target host and C. sinica.Alternate abstract:赤眼蜂属是生物防治中广泛用来防治鳞翅目害虫的一类重要天敌昆虫。应用基础研究及某些关键技术的研究是生物防治学科发展的主体。我国赤眼蜂的应用虽已步入世界先进行列，但基础研究不足，与我国的世界赤眼蜂应用大国身份不符。本论文基于国内外研究现状，以我国主要研究应用的蜂种为研究对象，结合实际生产和应用需求，针对与赤眼蜂应用密切相关的田间环境因子的影响、贮存、分类鉴定和非靶标效应等问题，具体开展了5项基础研究，旨在为推动我国赤眼蜂应用提供相应依据及科学工具。主要结果如下：1 高温冲击对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响我国普遍应用柞蚕卵繁殖和大量释放赤眼蜂防治多种农林害虫。然而，某些地区夏季高温可能会对其产生负面影响。为此，研究了柞蚕卵繁殖的松毛虫赤眼蜂于蛹中期和蛹后期经历6h35℃和6h40℃高温单次冲击处理，对当代羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比、寿命等4个指标和处理子代有效繁殖个体数、羽化率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比等4个指标的影响。研究结果表明，当松毛虫赤眼蜂处于蛹中期阶段和蛹后期阶段，在处理当代易受高温冲击影响，尤以40℃高温不利影响明显，主要表现在羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数两指标明显降低，其中蛹后期经历6h40℃高温冲击后，几乎不能继续发育羽化；而总体来看高温冲击对子代蜂各指标未表现出明显影响。2 常规棉花粉和转Cry1Ac+CpTI棉花粉对螟黄赤眼蜂繁殖和存活的影响在室内评价了常规棉花粉和转Cry1Ac+CpTI棉（Bt棉）花粉通过不同处理方式作为食物源对螟黄赤眼蜂寿命、寄生卵数、子代羽化数和性比等繁殖和存活特征的影响。共设计7个饲喂处理，即不饲喂（UNFED）、水（W）、水+常规棉花粉（W+P）、水+Bt棉花粉（W+BtP）、10%蜂蜜水（H）、10%蜂蜜水+常规棉花粉（H+P）和10%蜂蜜水+转Bt棉花粉（H+BtP）。在提供或不提供米蛾卵条件下，经W+P或W+BtP饲喂的雌蜂寿命与W或UNFED间无显著差异，但均显著短于H和H+P或H+BtP饲喂的雌蜂，而经H+P或H+BtP饲喂的雌蜂寿命又均显著长于经H饲喂的雌蜂。比较每雌寄生卵数和子代羽化数来看，各处理明显分为3类，即UNFED、W、W+P和W+BtP为最低，H为居中，H+P和H+BtP为最高。比较每雌子代性比来看，各处理也明显分为3类，即H、H+P和H+BtP为最低，W+P和W+BtP为居中，UNFED和W为最高。饲喂W+P和W+BtP的雌蜂寿命、寄生卵粒数、子代羽化数和性比分别与W+BtP和H+BtP饲喂间无显著差异。棉花花粉与蜂蜜组合成为螟黄赤眼蜂实现其最大存活和繁殖力的食物；初步表明Bt棉花粉对螟黄赤眼蜂无影响。3 冷贮对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响柞蚕卵繁殖的松毛虫赤眼蜂是我国最主要的生防产品，冷贮有助于其商品化生产、运输和释放应用。为了全面评价冷贮对柞蚕卵繁殖赤眼蜂的影响，作者采用柞蚕卵为寄主，以贮存温度（4℃、7℃、10℃和13℃）、贮存虫期（卵、幼虫、预蛹和蛹期）和贮存时间（2周、4周、6周和8周）为参试因子，研究了冷贮对松毛虫赤眼蜂羽化出蜂率、单卵出蜂数、单卵雌蜂比的影响。结果表明，三个因素均可单独和互作显著降低羽化出蜂率和单卵出蜂数，尤以贮存虫期的影响更为明显；但三个因素对单卵出蜂性比影响不大。综合各虫期对低温的反应，松毛虫赤眼蜂对10℃反应敏感，各虫期羽化出蜂率和单卵出蜂数明显降低，不适宜长期冷贮，对7℃反应相对较不敏感，最适宜长期贮存。适宜长期冷贮温度（4℃和7℃）条件下，适宜贮存虫期有所不同。在4℃条件下，为幼虫期和蛹期，7℃条件下为卵期和蛹期，羽化出峰率和单卵出蜂数相对其他虫期受冷贮不利影响较小。从对羽化出蜂率的影响来看，于卵期7℃下冷贮为最适宜；从对单卵出蜂数的影响来看，于蛹期在4℃和7℃为适宜。4 我国主要应用蜂种的分子鉴定体系及其应用根据螟黄赤眼蜂rDNA-ITS2序列设计了螟黄赤眼蜂、广赤眼蜂、玉米螟赤眼蜂及外引蜂种甘蓝夜蛾赤眼蜂、食胚赤眼蜂和卷蛾赤眼蜂的特异引物，同时采用文献中发表的松毛虫赤眼蜂和玉米螟赤眼蜂的特异引物以及赤眼蜂属特异引物对赤眼蜂成虫及寄主卵样品进行了PCR特异扩增分析。结果表明，采用上述特异引物可从单头蜂稳定地扩增出明显的目的DNA条带，并且分子鉴定结果与形态学鉴定结果完全吻合。因此，采用上述特异引物可以实现对我国4种重要赤眼蜂种，即松毛虫赤眼蜂、螟黄赤眼蜂和玉米螟赤眼蜂，及3种外引蜂种甘蓝夜蛾赤眼蜂、食胚赤眼蜂或卷蛾赤眼蜂的分子鉴定，形成了我国主要研究与应用蜂种的分子鉴定体系。客观评估赤眼蜂的田间控害作用及蜂种调查是赤眼蜂研究与应用中的重要环节。赤眼蜂体小，近缘种间形态难辨，难以鉴定雌蜂和幼期虫态，给上述问题的研究带来很大困难。本研究采用基于诊断引物的分子鉴定技术研究：（1）4种赤眼蜂放蜂防治棉田棉铃虫处理田间寄生率；（2）玉米田蜂种优势度。研究表明：（1）对照区无寄生，松毛虫放蜂区寄生9粒，松毛虫赤眼蜂和螟黄赤眼蜂混合放蜂区寄生6粒，螟黄赤眼蜂放蜂区和甘蓝夜蛾放蜂区未见寄生，采回的寄生卵经诊断引物Td596f/Td596r检测，结果均为松毛虫赤眼蜂；（2）采自玉米田间114个样品经诊断引物TrichF/ToR545检测，结果均为玉米螟赤眼蜂，一轮操作鉴定成功率达98.25%。上述结果确证，我们所构建的分子鉴定体系，可应用于大规模的田间生防效力评估和蜂种调查。5 两种赤眼蜂对捕食性天敌卵的选择性在室内采用非选择性和选择性方法，研究了松毛虫赤眼蜂和螟黄赤眼蜂对5种捕食性天敌卵的选择性。结果表明, 两种赤眼蜂均可寄生中华通草蛉和大草蛉卵，并成功在卵内完成发育；但均不寄生龟纹瓢虫、异色瓢虫和七星瓢虫。同时面临防治靶标和草蛉卵时，两种赤眼蜂均选择寄生草蛉卵，但嗜好程度存在明显差异。松毛虫赤眼蜂对中华通草蛉卵的接触次数和寄生粒数显著要多于亚洲玉米螟卵；螟黄赤眼蜂对中华通草蛉卵的接触次数和寄生粒数也多于棉铃虫卵，但未达显著水平。在子代性比、每寄主出蜂数和寄生雌蜂百分率几项指标上，两种赤眼蜂在各自靶标和中华通草蛉之间均差异不显著。

TI  - Geologic characterization and modeling of the updip basement ridge play of the Smackover Formation in the Vocation and Appleton Field areas, southwest Alabama
SP  - 291
AB  - The Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian) Smackover Formation is one of the most prolific oil and gas producers in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain. In the Conecuh and Manila Sub-basins, in southwest Alabama, shallow marine carbonate deposits of the Smackover Formation accumulated on local Paleozoic crystalline basement highs, defining the Smackover updip basement ridge play. In this geologic setting, Smackover accumulation occurred in four depositional packages that are easily identifiable in well logs: (1) shallow sub-wave base level, (2) microbial reefs, (3) shoreface/shoal/lagoon, and (4) tidal flat/sabkha. The distribution of the depositional environments has been illustrated in three-dimensional geologic models for the Vocation and Appleton Field areas. Smackover deposits have been affected by diagenetic events that have modified their petrophysical properties. Pervasive dolomitization is the most important diagenetic event from the point of view of hydrocarbon exploration. This early diagenetic process increased the permeability of rocks by connecting the pore system through the generation of intercrystalline porosity. Nonetheless, the original depositional fabric of the rock is the main control on the location of Smackover reservoirs. High quality reservoir rocks consist of thrombolite doloboundstone that identifies large microbial buildups, and ooid, oncoid dolograinstone to dolopackstone deposited in shoal and shoreface environments. A third type of reservoir is crystalline dolostone, which is primarily diagenetic in origin. The Smackover depositional sequence occurred during a transgressive-regressive cycle. In marginal areas proximal to its updip pinchout, Smackover accumulation was the result of the complex interaction of several regional and global variables (eustasy and tectonic/thermal subsidence), in addition to local factors such as paleotopography and carbonate productivity, which is strongly related to the environmental conditions. The exploration strategy in this oil play has to be oriented toward the location of basement structures thorough extensive gravimetric and/or magnetometric studies. The development of 3-D seismic surveys can then be focused on the identified basement paleohighs to improve the interpretation of their geometry, to determine if the Smackover Formation is completely or only partially covering the structure, and to search for the location of large microbial buildups.

TI  - Population genetics of accessory gland proteins and male-female post-mating interactions in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 100
AB  - It has been argued that male-female post-mating interactions drive rapid divergence of reproductive proteins between populations, leading to reproductive isolation and speciation. Here I report on three studies of Drosophila melanogaster populations that aim to shed light on the role of post-mating interactions in reproductive protein evolution, population divergence, the evolutionary processes that influence postmating interactions, and the potential genetic mechanism involved in the evolutionary processes. First I tested the hypothesis of rapid inter-population divergence of reproductive proteins by comparing a pair of populations reported to be undergoing sympatric speciation in Evolution Canyon, Israel. Contrary to expectations, I found no evidence of genetic differentiation between the two populations. I also conducted mate choice tests to determine if populations mate assortatively, as had been suggested by previous work. There was no significant departure from random mating in mixtures of flies from the two populations. I concluded that these two populations are not experiencing incipient sympatric speciation. Secondly, I tested for the influence of four evolutionary effects (sexual conflict, sexual selection by cryptic female choice, temperature-dependent selection, and inbreeding avoidance) on post-mating interactions using a pair of allopatric populations and a pair of temperature-selected lines. I demonstrate that relatedness of mates is a key determinant of male-female post-mating interactions by suppressing offspring productivity of singly mated females. This supports the post-mating inbreeding avoidance hypothesis. Lastly, I investigated two candidate reproductive protein loci (Acps) for their role in post-mating inbreeding avoidance and recognition of relatedness. Females from a U.S. population were crossed to males from an Israel population and matched for the same or different Acp genotype. After controlling for the effect of intrinsic male differences on offspring productivity, I found a significant association between lowered female fecundity and the similarity of the female and male at one of the Acp loci, Acp29AB. This is a novel finding that locus Acp29AB is involved in mediating the recognition of relatedness necessary for post-mating inbreeding avoidance in D. melanogaster.

TI  - Interspecific hybridization between sympatric coastal cutthroat and coastal rainbow/steelhead trout on Vancouver Island, British Columbia: A conservation and evolutionary examination
SP  - 96
AB  - Sympatric coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki ) and coastal rainbow/steelhead trout (O. mykiss irideus ) are thought to be reproductively isolated primarily by spatial and temporal separation. However, interspecific hybridization has been documented, thus raising the questions of how widespread hybridization is within their native range, and what are the nature and status of reproductive isolating mechanisms (i.e. prezygotic or postzygotic) in the hybridizing sympatric populations? In a broad survey of 37 populations on Vancouver Island, hybridization between these trout species was found to be widespread (Chapter 2). The frequency of hybridization varied among locations (HI = 3%–88%; II = 2%–54%), with some populations displaying hybrid levels indicative of hybrid swarms and may be undergoing ‘hybrid meltdown’. Several environmental factors appear to influence hybridization (e.g. forest harvesting, stocking, habitat availability, watershed size), however, no single factor appears to have a dominant effect. There is no consistent evidence for selection acting against first-generation (F1) hybrids, and in backcross hybrids inconsistent results implicate environment-dependent (i.e. extrinsic) selection (Chapter 3). Hybridization is reciprocal, but nuclear marker patterns show that the direction of hybridization is unidirectional in some populations (n = 5 out of 13 populations). Based on cytonuclear disequilibrium levels, a remarkable reproductive bias appears to exist (i.e. frequency of backcross hybrids with matched nuclear-mitochondrial marker composition exceeded mismatched genotypes). Selection against mismatch genotypes may be occurring, although a behavioural mating bias is more likely.

TI  - Environmental factors influencing weed interference in agricultural systems
SP  - 96
AB  - In all agricultural systems using few or no herbicides, cultural and mechanical techniques are crucial to economic viability. Further advances in non-chemical weed control will require in-depth knowledge of weed biology. The objective of new strategies likely will be to alter competitive interactions between crop and weed species. An important part of weed biology, and often the basis for competitiveness, is species response to the environment. Environmental conditions differ greatly in different parts of the world. In agricultural systems, the low nitrogen status of some soils requires most crops to be amended. Weed populations can experience a wide range of fertilization regimes from year to year due to different crop rotations. Fertilization patterns in a rotation can lead to differential growth and reproductive performance of weeds and competitiveness with crops. In research described in the first two chapters, we attempt to determine the extent that lowering parental nutrition would impact weed growth, reproduction, and offspring vigor. The purpose was to begin evaluating benefits of controlling nitrogen fertility in agronomic systems on low fertility soils. Another environmental factor that could influence weed competitiveness is temperature. The significance of temperature responses will become increasingly important in the future. Global climate change models are predicting increases in the earth's average surface temperature between 1.4–5.8°C during the 21st century. As temperatures increase it is conceivable that warmer temperatures will alter competitive balance between crop and weed species, intensifying weed pressures. The expression of temperature response also will be a function of other interacting factors such as the ability to acquire water and nutrients. Resource acquisition is controlled to a large extent by root growth and interactions with soil microorganisms. The third chapter of this thesis is focused on temperature responses of selected plant species from an agroecological system. The purpose was to begin assessment of possible climate change effects on weed competitiveness. All of our experiments made extensive use of the weed Senna obtusifolia due to its importance in crops in the Southeastern U.S.

TI  - Mechanisms of coexistence in the sympatric lizards, Ctenotus robustus and Ctenotus taeniolatus (Scincidae) on the sand -mined coastal dunes of Port Stephens-Myall Lakes
AB  - This study examined mechanisms of coexistence in Ctenotus robustus and C. taeniolatus on sand-mined dunes in the Port Stephens-Myall Lakes region, south eastern Australia. Ctenotus robustus and C. taeniolatus coexisted in medium vegetation, but C. taeniolatus were rare in or absent from open vegetation and C. robustus rare in or absent from dense vegetation. With regeneration from open to dense vegetation: canopy cover, litter mass, and understorey patchiness increased; and patchiness of litter decreased. Ctenotus robustus attained larger snout-vent lengths (SVL) than C. taeniolatus. Sexes hatched at similar sizes but SVL at maturity was smaller for males than females. Relative to SVL, both species showed male-larger sexual dimorphism and C. robustus were heavier with a larger head than C. taeniolatus. However, all morphological differences were small. Growth was faster in more open vegetation, and juvenile C. robustus grew faster than juvenile C. taeniolatus. Only male C. taeniolatus showed potential to breed within 12 months of hatching. However, larger size at first breeding may have been an advantage due to intraspecific interactions, and increased clutch size with SVL. Ctenotus taeniolatus selected lower laboratory temperatures and cooler microhabitat (0–50% time from 0800–1600 h > 40°C) in medium vegetation than C. robustus. In open vegetation C. robustus used the relatively uncommon cooler microhabitats which were hotter than equivalent microhabitats in medium vegetation. Ctenotus taeniolatus survived on open vegetation when competitive effects of C. robustus were reduced. However, reduced residency times and lack of breeding showed that open vegetation was less suitable for C. taeniolatus than medium or dense vegetation. Removal of C. robustus from medium vegetation resulted in an influx of C. taeniolatus and improvement in their body condition. Removal of C. taeniolatus from medium vegetation increased residency times of C. robustus (probably juveniles) However, slower growth of C. robustus in medium vegetation suggested that it was less suitable habitat than open vegetation. In dense vegetation hotter microhabitats (75–100% time from 0800–1600 h > 40°C) were uncommon and cooler than equivalent microhabitat in medium or open vegetation. Competitive effects from C. taeniolatus prevented juvenile C. robustus using dense vegetation but dense vegetation did not provide suitable habitat for adult C. robustus. Overall, thermal requirements seemed more important than the relatively weak competitive effects. However, the two are likely to have interacted to determine pattern of distribution of C. robustus and C. taeniolatus across the vegetation regeneration states.

TI  - This wild strange place: Local narratives of literacy use in Appalachian families over three generations
SP  - 190
AB  - This study focuses on the purposes for literacy that people of southern West Virginia have constructed during their lifetimes. Although it is concerned with the literacy histories of people who were born and raised in southern West Virginia, it primarily focuses on the connection between that literacy history and the economic and cultural history of southern West Virginia. By studying three families and three generations within those families, the study constructs an historical perspective of the economic and cultural changes this region has endured and works to illuminate the effect these changes have had on literacy development. This study should be considered a “local narrative” of literacy rather than a “little narrative.” The term “local narrative” places more emphasis on the importance of geography in constructing people's literacy practices. The goal for this study is to uncover some of the purposes of vernacular literacy practices for the people in West Virginia. This study examines the ways that the context of southern West Virginia has constructed purposes for people's everyday reading and writing, and what people think and feel about those purposes. The primary methodology used to collect the field texts was interviewing. One member from three different generations of three different families was interviewed. Eleven different life-history interviews were conducted. To ensure their validity, they were recorded, with the subject's permission, as well as transcribed, and field notes were also taken. The completed study features three case studies of the families. The categories that Barton and Hamilton (1998) identified in Local Literacies: Reading and Writing in One Community describe themes that held true across the case studies. The lists for literacy uses that Shirley Brice Heath (1983) constructed in Ways with Words: Language, Life, and Work in Communities and Classrooms and Denny Taylor and Catherine Dorsey-Gaines (1988) constructed in Growing Up Literate: Learning from Inner-City Families also held true across the case studies. This study adds three different categories to these three lists: popular-culture reading, as well as personal-improvement reading and writing.

TI  - Evolutionary genetics of the land snail Cepaea nemoralis in the Central Pyrenees
SP  - 872
AB  - The pattern of life is a discontinuous one: both fossils and modem taxa show a clustering of forms separated by gaps. Evolutionary theory explains these gaps by relatively rapid transitions happening long ago, leaving few identifiable intermediates. One mechanism for this 'punctuated equilibrium' process suggests that these dramatic changes take place in small isolated populations at the edges of a species' range. This notion was tested in the land snail Cepaea nemoralis in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Geographical patterns of genetic differentiation in enzyme polymorphisms ('molecular area effects') suggest that the population was once fractured into smaller units which, after a process of genetic disruption, recolonised their original range. The interface between two of these areas was mapped by an analysis of enzyme polymorphisms. Pure populations and their hybrids were then compared for adaptational differences (shell and body colour, thermal behaviour and mortality rates), and for reproductive isolation (as calculated by estimates of selection against hybrids from the enzyme dine width using field determinations of dispersal rate). No significant adaptive differentiation or reproductive barrier could be established between the two molecular areas. Instead, the same processes of adaptation seem to have taken place within the areas, in response to altitude and insolation. Furthermore, I investigated the possibility of a hybrid advantage effect taking place within the zone of hybridisation, where mean shell size is larger, resulting in more eggs being laid. Hybrid genotypes are thus likely to disperse faster than those of the pure types, dissipating the genetic differentiation between area effects more quickly than by random mixing. Present day selection is unlikely to determine the pattem of molecular area effects, as they do not coincide with geological, climatic, and vegetational discontinuities. Rather, they are relics of history, arising from the expansion of glacial refuges. The dynamics of this process were investigated by tracking vegetation patterns from ancient pollen cores, and by an analysis of mtDNA and enzyme variant distribution. The results of this study counter the expectations of the proposed mechanism of punctuated equilibrium. They are a reminder that, for most of the time, living organisms are robust to dramatic evolutionary change.

TI  - Evolution and plasticity of body size of Drosophila in response to temperature
SP  - 175
AB  - Ectotherm body size is positively correlated with latitude, giving rise to body size clines, found in different continents. Ectotherm body size also shows a developmental response to temperature, increasing at lower developmental temperatures. To investigate the effects of temperature in the evolution and plasticity of body size dines, I used two species of the genus Drosophila as model organisms. To investigate the cellular mechanism underlying the evolution of wing size clines the two newly established D. subobscura wing size clines in the Americas were compared with the ancestral European dine. Clinal differences in Europe and South America were due to changes in cell number, whereas clinal differences in North America are due to changes in cell area. These results suggest that the cellular mechanism underlying the establishment of wing size clines is contingent and not predictable. The genetic control of body size in the D. melanogaster South American body size cline was investigated by means of QTL mapping. The results found in South America were consistent with those previously found in Australia, and in both continents the inversion In(3R)P was associated QTL controlling wing area. Genes of the insulin signalling pathway, known to affect size, were characterized in their effects under different temperature and larval crowding regimes. The evolution of plasticity of body size traits was analysed using different thermal selection regimes. The phenotypic plasticity of wing size and its cellular components was examined by rearing flies, selected under fixed or variable thermal environments, at two different experimental temperatures. Plasticity of wing size did not vary among the different selection lines, however, plasticity of both cellular components of body size did. Costs and benefits of adaptation to cyclical thermal environments were assessed with larval competition assays and by assessing size when all lines were reared under cyclic thermal conditions.

SP  - 180
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effects of hypohydration on cardiovascular responses, fatigue, and metabolic responses in healthy male cigarette smokers (S) and male nonsmokers (NS) during long duration, submaximal exercise. Variables measured were heart rate, systolic blood pressure, rate-pressure product, rating of perceived exertion, tympanic temperature, relative oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate, and blood glucose. Eight untrained male S (M ± SD: age 25.8 ± 5.3; VO2PEAK 34.9 ± 7.6) and eleven untrained male NS (M ± SD: age 25.6 ± 3.4; VO2PEAK 31.8 ± 5.4) participated in the study. Subjects performed 60 minutes of cycle exercise at 50% VO2PEAK under a euhydrated treatment and hypohydrated treatment. The order of treatments was random and a time period of at least three days separated the treatments. Both treatments were performed in a temperature-controlled environment of 23 to 25 degrees Celsius. Hypohydration induced by controlled sauna exposure and fluid restriction the night prior to testing yielded percent body weight reductions for S and NS of 2.2 ± 0.6 and 2.4 ± 0.5 respectively. Physiological measurements were recorded at rest, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exercise. Response variables “Δ” (hypohydrated minus euhydrated) were compared using repeated measures ANCOVA for group (S and NS) and time (rest, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes). Additionally, steady state measurements for variables were determined by averaging values recorded at 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exercise. Steady state response variables “Δ” (hypohydrated minus euhydrated) were compared between groups using 2-sample t-tests. Paired t-tests were used to make within-group comparisons. Smokers demonstrated significantly higher Δ glucose values over time, F(5,85) = 2.86, p < .05. Pairwise comparisons indicated that at five, t(85) = 2.52, p < .05, and 45, t(85) = 2.03, p < .05) minutes of exercise, Δ glucose values for the smoking group were significantly (p < .05) higher than those for the nonsmoking group. Two-sample and paired t-tests comparing steady state measurements indicated no significant differences for any variables. The results from this study suggest that healthy male cigarette smokers and male nonsmokers have similar responses to submaximal exercise performed at room temperature in a mild hypohydrated state.

TI  - A genetic analysis of the adaptation to high temperature in selected lines of Escherichia coli
SP  - 189
AB  - Dissecting the genetic basis of adaptation has long challenged biologists, but the advent of high-density array technology makes the genetic and molecular characterization of adaptation possible. Using six lines of experimentally evolved populations of Escherichia coli grown for 2000 generations at high temperature (42°C), the genetic and molecular basis of adaptation was studied at the levels of gene copy number and gene expression. A total of 5 duplication and deletion events occurred in three independently derived lines during the adaptation to high temperature. The remaining three lines had no detectable gene duplication and deletions events. In one case, the same region of the chromosome was duplicated in all three lines and in this region of common duplication are a number of candidate genes known to play a role in stress and stationary phase survival. At the level of gene expression, a priori candidate genes, the heat-inducible genes, exhibited significantly different patterns of expression in three evolved lines relative to their ancestor. Genome wide measures of the transcriptome in a subset of three lines indicate that evolutionary changes in the expression of heat inducible genes in the extracytoplasmic stress response play an integral role in high temperature adaptation. Overall, heat inducible genes were significantly more likely than non-candidate genes to exhibit significant evolutionary expression changes. A genome wide examination of evolved changes in expression reveals that for each line a large portion of the genome (5%) experiences expression changes, however this is only slightly more than expected due to chance alone. A total of thirty-nine genes, 92% more than expected due to chance alone, show at least moderate levels of evolutionary replicability across independently derived lines. In comparison, adaptation at the level of functional groups is slightly more replicable suggesting that selection may work to modify overall function as opposed to the expression level of individual genes. In total, these studies begin to uncover the complicated and heterogeneous ways to achieve high temperature adaptation in bacteria.

TI  - Phytate utilization by Tetrahymena
SP  - 74
AB  - Phytate, myo-inositol hexakisphosphate, is the storage form of phosphate in seeds and grains and is a major form of environmental phosphate loading from fertilizer inputs and agricultural runoff. Little is known about the effects of phytate on heterotrophic protozoa. Members of the genus Tetrahymena were chosen as the model organisms for this study because of their wide geographic distribution and adaptability. I found that Tetrahymena can use phytate as their sole phosphate source when grown in comparable concentrations to cells grown in media containing orthophosphate. The internal phytate concentration increases dramatically during the logarithmic phase of growth and then decreases during the stationary phase. These internal levels are as much as 10-fold greater for T. vorax than those for cells grown in phosphate and no phytate, suggesting diet as a main source of accumulation. Results for similar assays on T. thermophila showed comparable internal levels, whether cells were grown in phytate or phosphate. Multiple potential phytases were identified by gel activity assays. A 170 kDa phytase was found associated with the pellicle. This phytase is located in the cell membrane facing the exterior of the cell. A pH optimum of 5.0–5.5 and temperature optimum 55°C for the pellicle phytase is similar to known phytases of microbial and plant origin. Potential inhibitors and substrates were also investigated.

TI  - Size variation and fitness consequences in age 0 westslope cutthroat trout
SP  - 184
AB  - Phenotypic diversity is an important component of ecological diversity in fishes, potentially leading to divergence and speciation via local adaptation stabilizing populations in variable environments. Although benefits of being large are well documented, size variation may have benefits as well. Understanding the spatial distribution of size variation across important productivity gradients will contribute to understanding of relationships between inland salmonids and their environment. For age 0 westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) in the Coeur d'Alene basin, Idaho, I found most size variation to occur at the broadest scale studied (10km2) associated with temperature and productivity gradients. Instream habitat variables but not age 0 size structure differed between wide and narrow valley streams. At the stream reach scale, habitats occupied by large and small age 0 cutthroat trout differed, but at the habitat unit scale, units occupied by homogeneously-versus heterogeneously-sized individuals did not differ. Maintenance of population abundance and diversity may depend on diverse habitats at the reach scale whereas maintenance of meaningful habitat complexity may depend on management at the stream scale. I used the growth record available in sagittal otoliths to examine overwinter size selective mortality and phenotypic adaptations in two streams that differed in temperature. I found overwinter selection for growth rate in 2001–02 but not in 2000–01. Direction of selection was different in the two streams, favored fast growth in the warm stream and slow growth in the cold stream. Fish in the warmer stream varied more in emergence timing whereas fish in the colder stream showed compensatory growth characteristics that reduced intrapopulation size variation and increased average size. Populations at the extremes of critical environmental gradients may be less variable and therefore more sensitive and less resilient to disturbance, but may also represent intraspecific diversity that is important to conserve. Conservation of intraspecific variation will likely require the maintenance of high quality habitats across multiple gradients, including landform, temperature, and productivity, and across the spatial scales at which those gradients occur.

TI  - Life history influences the genetic structure of populations of Fundulus heteroclitus, Menidia menidia, and Geukensia demissa in a PCB-contaminated estuary, New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, United States
SP  - 153
AB  - Genetic diversity is essential for the long-term persistence of a population or species because it is required for adaptation to environmental change. Exposure to toxic chemicals causes directional selection that reduces genetic diversity, potentially leaving populations unable to adapt to future environmental change. The life history of a species, particularly patterns of migration and dispersal, strongly influences the distribution of genetic variation among populations. This research was conducted to determine whether populations of species with distinct life histories in New Bedford Harbor (NBH), MA, an estuary contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exhibit a loss of genetic diversity or altered genetic structure. Populations of two marine fishes, the non-migratory Fundulus heteroclitus and the migratory Menidia menidia, and one bivalve, Geukensia demissa, were sampled at sites in and around NBH. Allele frequencies at enzymatic loci were used to assess genetic structure and diversity. Selection experiments using PCB 126 were conducted with the fishes to determine if genetic patterns at field sites could be attributed to contaminants. Although F. heteroclitus populations inhabiting NBH are highly resistant to the effects of PCBs, no relationship between allozyme patterns and contamination or PCB-tolerance was detected. However, genetic distance among populations was strongly related to geographic distance among sites. Menidia menidia surviving embryonic exposure to PCB 126 in laboratory selection experiments were distinct from controls at one enzymatic locus, phosphoglucomutase (PGM*). Juveniles of this species collected from NBH exhibited genotypic frequencies significantly different from those expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium conditions, suggesting a correlation between PGM* genotype and tolerance to PCB exposure. Allele frequencies among populations of G. demissa were homogeneous at all loci except the leucine aminopeptidase (LAP*) locus, but it is likely that this resulted from local differences in temperature and/or salinity. The smallest size class had higher heterozygosity at a malate dehydrogenase (MDH-2*) locus, but patterns were similar between sites inside and outside NBH, and, therefore, were not attributed to contaminants. The results of this study indicate neither significant loss of genetic diversity nor alteration of allele frequencies for populations of these species in NBH, but genetic patterns clearly reflected differences in life history.

TI  - Regulatory evolution of Hsp70 in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 151
AB  - The research described in this thesis aims to elucidate adaptive evolution of Hsp70 expression in Drosophila melanogaster. First I analyze heat shock transcription factor (HSF) activation in D. melanogaster lines that have been evolving in the laboratory at different temperatures for several years. These populations have evolved differences in Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance levels, and I show that the magnitude and time course of HSF activation also differ among these lines. Thus, HSF activation can evolve rapidly and likely plays an important role in the evolution of the heat shock response. Second, I describe three D. melanogaster populations that are polymorphic for transposable element (TE) insertions that disrupt the promoter of the hsp70Ba gene. These insertions alter Hsp70 expression, inducible thermotolerance, and fecundity, suggesting that TEs can create intraspecific variation in gene expression that selection can act upon. Indeed, that the TEs have inserted within the same region of the hsp70 promoter and have common phenotypic and fitness effects suggests that these insertions represent a general mechanism through which selection manipulates hsp70 gene expression. Third, I characterize an additional TE that disrupts an hsp70 promoter—in this case the hsp70Bb gene. This TE provides additional evidence that the hsp70 promoters are vulnerable to such insertions. I directly test the consequences of all 4 TEs in a common genetic background, and show that each of the TEs reduces reporter gene expression after heat shock and 3 of the insertions significantly reduce heat-inducibility of the hsp70 promoter. This thesis constitutes the first elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie the evolution of Hsp70 expression in Drosophila. Further, it is one of few studies to show that TEs—which are often deleterious or neutral—can also have positive fitness consequences and in natural populations. Finally, in characterizing the nucleotide sequence variants that underlie intraspecific changes in gene expression, organismal phenotype and fitness, this dissertation sheds light on the process of adaptive regulatory evolution.

TI  - Charmonium production in heavy -ion collisions
SP  - 172
AB  - We investigate the production of charmonia in collisions of heavy nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies. We first construct a two-component model of charmonium production in heavy-ion collisions, which includes (i) early hard J/ψ production coupled with nuclear, Quark-Gluon Plasma and Hadron Gas suppression and (ii) statistical production of J/ψ's by coalescence of c and c¯ at the hadronization transition. We present a new calculation of J/ψ interactions in the QGP and both components are evaluated within a common thermal evolution scenario. Available data on J/ψ production at CERN-SPS and BNL-RHIC energies are reasonably well reproduced, although the ψ′/ψ ratio indicates that ψ′ hadronic suppression is underestimated. We then improve our approach to account for in-medium effects on open and hidden charm states, inferred from recent lattice QCD results. Within a kinetic theory framework, we solve rate equations for charmoniurn abundances during the course of a heavy-ion collision. The survival of J/ψ states above the phase transition temperature Tc favors their recreation in the QGP. In-medium effects in the hadronic phase, possibly linked to the (partial) restoration of chiral symmetry, largely resolve earlier identified discrepancies in the ψ′/ψ ratio.

TI  - Effects of temperature on the behaviour and life-history traits of two species of temperate grasshopper. (BL: DXN070008)
SP  - 1
AB  - The nymphal and adult life-history traits of three ecotypes of Chorthippus brunneus, representing a cline in climate continentality, were monitored at four ambient rearing temperatures, ranging from 25 to 40oC.  Significant genotype-environment interactions showed evidence of counter-gradient selection.  Ecotype responses were interpreted as evidence of local adaptation to thermal conditions.  Fitness values were calculated for each ecotype in respect to rearing temperatures. The relative nymphal and adult life-history trait responses, of three C. brunneus ecotypes, to an increase in ambient temperature versus an addition of radiant heat were compared.  Contrary to predictions, ecotypes showed a co-gradient response in thermoregulatory ability in respect to thermal conditions.  The results are discussed in respect to trade-offs in thermoregulation. The effects of the nutritional environment on the nymphal and adult life-history trait responses of C. brunneus to an increase in radiant heat were assessed.  Responses to an increase in radiant heat were greater on the higher quality food.  However, compensatory mechanisms on the low food quality diet, including an extended ovipositioning period, reduced variation in reproduction output between the two diets. The reasons for Orthoptera's notable exception to Bergmann's rule are explored.  Using a deterministic model, based on data collected in previous chapters, I tested three possible hypotheses for this phenomenon.  The model suggests that differential plasticity of potential clutch size and potential clutch number, in respect to temperature, is the most likely explanation for reduced size at maturity in colder environments. The local movements of Chorthippus albomarginatus were assessed in the field and were significantly correlated to temperature.  A random walk model was constructed and parameterised with the data collected.  Step movements were derived from a skewed distribution.  The effects of a rise in temperature on rates of dispersal are predicted.

TI  - Natural history of the Gila monster in Nevada
SP  - 55
AB  - Aspects of the natural history of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) were investigated in southern Nevada. A model was developed to describe attributes of the habitat where Gila monsters are found in southern Nevada by comparing reported localities against elevation and structural geology variables. The most suitable habitat in southern Nevada is located in low elevation areas (400–1200 m) with relatively complex geologic structure. Gila monsters were also studied over two seasons at a single field site using radio-telemetry to investigate activity, thermal biology, refuge selection, hibernation, and home range. Gila monsters were most active in late May and early June. They generally maintained lower body temperatures than do other diurnal lizard species in this area by remaining in underground refugia for most of the year. Refuge site selection differed among seasons and was influenced primarily by the above-ground thermal environment. Gila monsters in Nevada typically travel over twice as far as Gila monsters in southwestern Utah. Nevada Gila monsters also had larger home ranges than those from either southwestern Utah or western New Mexico, even though the Nevada lizards are significantly smaller in body size.

TI  - Research of Carbon Sink Capacity Caused by Rock Weathering Process in China
AB  - Rock weathering caused by the carbonic acid reaction with minerals to produce dissolved bicarbonates which are carried by rivers to the oceans is an important part in carbon cycle. The process causes significant carbon dioxide consumption, the accurate calculation of which may partly explains the missing sink of carbon and may do some contribution to the research in Global Change. The CO2 uptake by carbonate dissolution (which is also called karstification) on the continents is counterbalanced by the CO2 release by carbonate precipitation in the ocean. The same is not true for silicate weathering. Silicate weathering is more important than carbonate weathering as a long-term control on atmospheric CO2. Rock weathering is controlled by a great range of factors which includes rock property, climatic conditions, CO2 concentration in atmosphere/soil, vegetation and so on. Analyses of the influences of factors to rock weathering show that sometimes the weathering process may be controlled mainly by one factor, but in most cases rock weathering is controlled by all factors integratedly. A global erosion model (GEM-CO2) developed by Amiotte Suchet allows to calculate the flux of atmospheric/soil CO2 consumed by chemical erosion of continental rocks. In the thesis, the CO2 consumption by rock weathering in China is estimated based on GEM-CO2 and the Chinese Resources and Environment Database, and its distribution is show in a GRID map with a spatial resolution of 1000m*1000m. The total carbon consumption is about 4.72*107TC/a, about 52.65% of which are caused by carbonate and 47.35% of which are caused by silicate. The model results are close to previous estimation by other researches. The flux of CO2 consumed by rock weathering increases where carbonate rock outcrops are more abundant and when drainage intensity increases. The results show that the main consumption of CO2 is localized in Guangxi province, Guizhou province, Chongqin, North Hubei province, and Southwest of Hunan province, because of large area with a high proportion of carbonate rocks and high humidity. Karstification is a good connector of Geological processes and Biological processes. Many methods are tried in order to accurately estimate the karst solutional speed and then the CO2 consumption by karstification, such as analyzing elements in river, dissolution kinetics, dissolution survey experiments and so on. In the thesis, the karst solutional speed is estimated by a model. Analyses of the influences of some factors to karstification get following conclusions: 1.Temperature and precipitaion are main climatic factors involving in karstification. There is an obvious positive correlation between the karst solutional speed and precipitation. But it’s not the same between the karst solutional speed and temperature. Temperature influences karstification in a more complex way; 2.Biological processes influences karstification through increasing the acidity of water by metabolic outcome, and then accelerating the reaction between water and rock and hastening the releasing of Calcium element from soil. The intensity of biological process can be assessed with the value of NPP(Net Primary Productivity); 3.As part of reactor, the soil CO2 drives karstification, which can be verified by the positive correlation between the concentration of [HCO3－] in river or in spring and the CO2 concentration in soil. There is a positive correlation between the intensity of soil respiration and the CO2 concentration in soil.Based on above knowledge and data from continuous experiments and observations, a karst solutional speed model in tropic and subtropical zone in China is developed to describe the relationship between karst solutional speed and temperature, precipitation, NPP, and intensity of soil respiration. The data was non-dimensionized to improve the comparability of different parameters. The archetype of the model was selected with Response Surface Analysis. The effect of correlations between independent factors was analyzed. And the regression equation was worked out. Statistical test show that the adj.r-square of the model is 0.9171 and the significant level is 99.5%. The forecasting karst solutional speed values by the model are close to the observational data. So the model is highly significant. The model was applied in Zhujiang Drainage Basin which is located in subtropical zone. The data of distribution of temperature and precipitation were produced based on observed data in weather stations climate interpolation and through interpolating and topographty rectifying. The data of distribution of NPP and soil respiration intensity were produced by TEPC model (Tessrestrial Ecosystem Production process model in China). Then the distribution of karst solutional speed in Zhujiang Drainage Basin is calculated with the model and the environmental data. The karst solutional speeds estimated by above models are close to the estimations by different models.Alternate abstract:岩石的风化作用同时参与了短时间尺度和长时间尺度的全球碳循环，科学揭示岩石风化对碳循环影响的机制和程度，对于全球碳循环研究、全球变化研究有重要意义，不仅可以部分地解决“遗漏汇”问题，还能为完善碳循环模型作贡献。 本文首先评述了当前岩溶、岩石风化以及碳循环的研究现状和存在问题，探讨了硅酸盐岩和碳酸盐岩在不同时间尺度上的碳汇意义，全面分析了影响岩石风化的多种因素及其控制机理。针对传统岩溶研究在区域尺度研究上的不足，将遥感和GIS方法引入数据获取、处理及分析过程中，实现了数据和研究成果从点源向区域面上的尺度转化。为此，作者详细讨论了从多波段遥感数据提取地质信息以及空间数据的插值、订正等方法，并进行了相应的实验研究。 在此基础上，作者一方面依据成熟的GEM-CO2模型，对中国的岩石风化的碳汇效应进行了完整而全面的估算，对其空间分布格局进行了深入分析，填补了我国在岩石风化的碳汇效应估算方面的空白；另一方面，作者基于桂林岩溶试验场十余年来的连续定点观测数据，选取平均气温、降水、土壤呼吸和NPP为影响因素，经过观测数据的极差标准化，基于反应面分析模型的模型原型选择；变量的共线性诊断；及参数估计与显著性分析等过程，建立了碳酸盐岩溶蚀速率模型。显著性检验表明，该模型具有良好的拟合优度，并且99.5％的显著性水平下仍然显著成立。为将此模型推广应用到珠江流域，使用遥感数据和TEPC模型计算得到珠江流域NPP以及土壤呼吸强度数据。同时利用本文第三章计算的气候数据，最终计算得到中国珠江流域的溶蚀率以及碳汇的空间分布及值域。对热带亚热带岩溶的典型区域－珠江流域岩溶作用的碳汇效应进行的实验表明：珠江流域年溶蚀量为8159612.303t碳酸钙，碳979153.48t，其中1/2的碳，约489576.74t来自大气或土壤CO2。通过和其它模型的对比，各模型估算的结果数量级相同，说明本文建立的热带亚热带岩溶区溶蚀率模型是可信的。

TI  - Temperature-dependent sex determination and the evolutionary potential for sex ratio in the painted turtle, Chrysemys picta
SP  - 214
AB  - Many reptiles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a sex-determining mechanism in which the incubation environment permanently determines offspring sex. This research had two main objectives: (1) to evaluate the roles of two traits (nesting behavior by females and offspring sex ratios in response to thermal incubation conditions) thought to be important for maintaining sex ratios in this system, using the painted turtle ( Chrysemys picta), and (2) evaluate the adaptive significance of TSD in a genotypic sex determining system (GSD). Observations on the nesting behavior of painted turtles suggest that either females in this population do not use soil surface temperature as a cue for selecting nest sites, or select sites with intermediate soil surface temperatures that may be less likely to bias sex ratios. Geographic comparisons from two populations of C. picta inhabiting differing climates (Illinois and New Mexico) demonstrated that the New Mexico population exhibited a significantly higher pivotal temperature (temperature producing a 1:1 sex ratio) than the Illinois population. However, this difference was small compared to differences in climatic conditions experienced by the populations. Chrysemys picta nests from Illinois and New Mexico experienced similar nest temperatures despite a relatively hot year in New Mexico. Nests in New Mexico were not laid in sites most likely to reduce nest temperatures, but instead at sites experiencing high soil moisture, which indirectly reduced nest temperatures. In simulation models, pivotal temperatures evolved more rapidly than did nest-site choice by females in response to perturbed sex ratios. Natal philopatry to nest sites also caused maladaptive nesting behavior in terms of Fisherian sex ratio selection. Simulation models demonstrated that TSD invades populations exhibiting GSD and reaches fixation through several avenues that do not include a widely accepted adaptive function for TSD (the Charnov-Bull model). Results from these studies suggest that the likelihood of TSD being relatively neutral compared to GSD in reptiles deserves more attention. Consequently, selection for female behavior and offspring thermal sensitivity to adaptively adjust sex ratios may be fairly weak. This conclusion is supported by the small observed differences in pivotal temperatures and lack of strong patterns of thermally-based nest-site selection.

TI  - Evolutionary and environmental effects on thermoregulation among complex lizard communities
SP  - 131
AB  - A community of ten sympatric lizard species was studied in a mountain canyon in southern Arizona to determine the effect of phylogeny on habitat use and thermoregulation. Habitat use, body temperatures ( Tb) and operative environmental temperatures ( Te) were recorded in the field, as well as the selected temperature range (Tsel) for active lizards in the laboratory. Te varied significantly with elevation, time of day, macrohabitat, and microhabitat with most of the variation occurring at the microhabitat level, indicating a small spatial scale of thermal heterogeneity at the study site. At most times of day and in most macrohabitats, Te bracketed Tsel for the species indicating that maintenance of Tb within Tsel was possible during most daylight hours. Randomization analyses of matrices of phylogenetic similarity, habitat use and microsite temperature overlaps showed significant correlations between phylogenetic similarity, habitat use, and field active Tbs. There was no correlation between phylogenetic similarity and T sel. Indices of thermoregulation calculated for each species revealed that although these lizards thermoregulated effectively, there was no correlation between the matrix of phylogenetic similarity and similarity matrices for accuracy or effectiveness of thermoregulation. Pseudocommunity analyses showed no partitioning of thermal resources, indeed species tended to use similar thermal resources despite disparate habitat use. The significant effect of phylogeny on microhabitat use, and field Tb but not on Tsel suggests that microhabitat selection may override thermoregulation, possibly due to tradeoffs between thermoregulation, foraging, predator avoidance or reproduction.

TI  - Body size, temperature, and the evolution of herbivory in reptiles
SP  - 340
AB  - I critically review the literature on the biology of Recent herbivorous reptiles to explain why it so few herbivorous reptiles have evolved (<1% of >8000 living species) and to identify the conditions that favor the evolution of herbivory. Despite their divergent evolutionary histories, most herbivorous reptiles live in warm climates, and have converged on a common suite of morphological, physiological, and life-history characteristics. Herbivory appears to evolve from omnivory, primarily in seasonal climates, and possibly results from an energetic deficit caused by switching between an herbivorous and a carnivorous diet. The mechanistic basis of this cost is hypothesized to be the consequence of changes in the community structure of fermentative endosymbionts that are responsible for digesting plant fiber and releasing energy and nutrients into their host's gut. Most aspects of the biology of herbivorous reptiles have been poorly studied. Liolaemid lizards are likely the smallest and least studied herbivorous reptiles. A sample of 31 species of liolaemids, with diets ranging from insectivores to herbivores, were examined and found to have dental and gut characteristics similar to those of other herbivorous lizards. These characteristics also correlate with the proportion of plant matter in the diet suggesting some traits associated with the evolution of herbivory evolve in a correlated fashion. Herbivorous reptiles produce small clutches of large eggs (or neonates) relative to nonherbivores. Herbivorous turtles do not exhibit an increase in clutch size with increasing latitude, but nonherbivorous turtles do. Clutch mass is similar between herbivorous and nonherbivorous reptiles indicating that herbivory does not impose constraints on reproductive effort. Instead, selection is expected to favor large-bodied neonates (with accordingly large guts) because large digestive tracts may be a necessity of plant digestion. An energetic model was developed to understand the interplay among body size, temperature, and the biogeography of three herbivorous lizards ranging widely in body size and geographical and climatic distribution. Simulations show that lizards from warm environments with scarce food resources need to be large bodied because large animals expend energy reserves less quickly. Small lizards are able to thrive as herbivores in cool climates because of their ability to exploit unpredictable thermal resources and their low gross energy needs.

TI  - Identification of genes that positively and negatively regulate life span and stress resistance in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 90
AB  - Genome sequencing reveals that a large percentage of Drosophila genes have homologs in humans, including many human disease genes. The goal of this research was to develop methods to efficiently test Drosophila genes for functions in vivo. An important challenge is the fact that many genes function at more than one point during development and during the life cycle. Conditional expression systems such as promoters regulated by tetracycline (or its derivative doxycycline) are often ideal for testing gene functions. However, generation of transgenic animals for each gene of interest is impractical. Placing the doxycycline-inducible (“tet-on”) promoter directed out of the end of the P transposable element produced a mobile, doxycycline-inducible promoter element, named PdL. PdL was mobilized to 228 locations in the genome and was found to generate conditional (doxycycline-dependent), dominant mutations at high frequency. The temporal control of gene over-expression allowed generation of mutant phenotypes specific to different stages of the life cycle, including metamorphosis and aging. Novel phenotypes were identified for some known genes, including specific developmental defects and increased or decreased life span. During normal aging Drosophila hsp22 protein accumulates >150-fold throughout the fly, while other hsps are unchanged or accumulate to much lower levels. The pattern of hsp gene expression observed during aging appears most similar to that caused by oxidative stress. Drosophila hsp22 is a member of the small heat shock protein family (shsps). To assay for effects of hsp22, the ubiquitous pattern of hsp22 gene expression observed during aging was mimicked in young flies using the “tet-on” doxycycline regulated promoter system. hsp22 over-expression made young flies more similar to old flies in that stress resistance and viability were reduced. Induction of hsp22: lacZ and hsp70:lacZ reporter transgenes in response to acute stress was normal in the presence of hsp22 protein over-expression and in old flies. The data suggest a model in which chronic oxidative stress during aging causes an accumulation of toxic levels of hsp22.

TI  - Plant evolution in fire -prone environments
SP  - 110
AB  - My dissertation work examines fire as a selective force in plant evolution. My investigation of sprouter and nonsprouter growth rates (Chapter 2) examines intra-specific variation in the ability to resprout after fire. This work on closely related sprouters and nonsprouters attempts to shed light on the evolutionary implications of the loss of resprouting ability. Chapters 3–5 examine the possible evolutionary role of plant flammability. Plants are not only shaped by the selective environment that fire creates, but, as fuel, plants can influence the nature of the fire they experience. In Chapter 3, I use phylogenetic comparative methods to test for an evolutionary correlation between fire response traits and flammability in pines. This work reveals a pattern of correlation evolution in which evolutionary increases in flammability have been associated with increases in fire-dependent recruitment. Chapter 4 answers critics who have charged that flammability is not a trait upon which evolution can act. In this chapter, I test whether a potential flammability trait that varies in nature can have local effects on fire intensity. My experimental manipulation of shrub canopy architectures revealed that one candidate flammability trait, dead branch retention, can significantly increase fire temperatures. This work suggests that plants may indeed influence the nature of fire they experience. Chapter 5 examines whether increased flammability can evolve under natural selection. In this simulation model, flammability evolves due to an association between an allele that promotes flammability and alleles at unlinked loci that give high fitness. Flammability behaves as a spatial modifier of generation time. My co-author, Ben Kerr, and I term this process “genetic niche-hiking.” More generally, “genetic niche-hiking,” can explain the evolution of altruistic traits in spatially-structured systems. Ecologists have long viewed fire as a destructive force to which plants have responded through the evolution of life-history strategies that allow species to cope with this powerful force. My thesis work suggests that a more full view of fire and plant evolution should include the possibility that plants are authors of their own evolution. Plants may be shaping their environment, and in doing so, changing the nature of fire that they and their offspring experience.

TI  - The physiological responses to burst activity and temperature stress in two cultured strains of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
SP  - 111
AB  - This study examined the physiological effects of exhaustive exercise and thermal stress on two cultured strains of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared under identical conditions. Both strains of originated from the St. John River, NB. Strain 1 was in its first generation of culture whereas strain 2 had been cultured for 3 generations. Exhaustive exercise experiments, conducted at 4 months post-hatch, revealed significant strain x time interactions in the oxygen consumption rates (MO2) and ammonia excretion rates (Mamm). When comparisons between cultured and wild fish (from the Catamaran Brook) were made, it was found that wild salmon recovered to resting MO2 and Mamm faster than cultured fish. No significant interactions were noted for phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate and glycogen concentrations. At 8 months post-hatch a significant strain x time interaction was observed for whole-body lactate concentrations, however, no interactions were present at 8 months post-hatch for plasma lactate concentrations. Both the acute (15 to 20 or 25°C) and the graded temperature (15 to 20°C, over a 3 hour period) challenges resulted in significant effects over time for both MO2 and Mamm Strain x time interactions were also noted in both the 5 and 10°C acute challenges. Survival rates of 100% were observed in strain 1 fish following all temperature challenge experiments. In contrast, survival rates for strain 2 fish dropped to 90% and 60% following the 5 and 10°C temperature challenges, respectively. Taken together, the results of these experiments reveal subtle physiological differences between both strains of fish. However, the increased mortality noted for strain 2 fish in the temperature experiments suggests that strain 1 fish were physiologically more fit than the strain 2 fish (cultured for an additional 2 generations).

TI  - Temperature, body size and life history in Drosophila melanogaster. (BL: DXN062078)
SP  - 1
AB  - Body size in Drosophila melanogaster results from the combinations of evolutionary genetic and developmental effects, both of which are affected by the thermal environment. Evolution or development at lower environmental temperatures results in increased body size in fruitflies, however, the reasons for these adaptations remain elusive. To investigate whether larger size is favoured at lower temperature through natural selection on adult males, life-span and age-specific-fertility of males from lines artificially selected for increased and decreased body size were examined at two different temperatures. Larger males were found to be fitter than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was much greater at the lower experimental temperature. Similar males did not perform significantly differently from controls at either experimental temperature. These findings suggest that thermal selection for larger adult males is at least in part responsible for evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures in this species. An investigation into the evolution of plasticity of body size traits was performed. The phenotypic plasticity of body size and its components; cell size and cell number, were examined by rearing populations of flies that had evolved in constant and variable thermal environments at two different experimental temperatures. Plasticity of body size was comparable among all of the populations examined, however, plasticity of both cellular components of body size was significantly greater in flies adapted to variable thermal environments. The lifespan and fecundity of eight replicated populations of continually mated flies from a cline along the Eastern coast of Australia, when maintained at two different temperatures in the laboratory, was also examined, and no latitudinal trend in either longevity or lifetime fecundity was observed. However, there were some differences in the pattern of fecundity over the lifetime of individuals along the cline.

TI  - Listeria Monocytogenes - Inactivation by Essential Oils and High Pressure, and Contribution of Genetic Variation to Stress Resistance
SP  - 97
AB  - A variety of non-thermal mild preservation techniques have lately been introduced in food production, or are currently being investigated thoroughly for potential use in food processing. Two of these novel preservation techniques are the use of essential oil compounds isolated from plants and of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) treatment. Applications of these preservation methods, alone or combined, have shown to reduce the viable numbers of microorganisms occurring in foods, and in addition, are able to preserve the nutritional and sensory characteristics of the product. The objectives of this thesis were to asses the antimicrobial potential of these combined processing techniques against the foodborne bacterium Listeria monocytogenes , which can cause serious disease with a relatively high mortality rate. In addition, to get more insight in the primary cellular targets that are affected upon HHP treatment of L. monocytogenes , we examined the mechanism underlying increased HHP tolerance of an isolate of this organism. Chapter 1 gives a short introduction on L. monocytogenes. Furthermore, mild and novel preservation techniques in food processing are addressed, with special emphasis on the use of essential oil compounds from plants, and the use of High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP). General characteristics and the mode of action of these preservation techniques are described, followed by resistance mechanisms that bacteria use to counteract their potentially lethal action. This chapter is concluded with the combined use of these preservation methods, and an outline of this thesis.In Chapter 2 , it is demonstrated that various plant-derived volatiles, namely, S-carvone, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and decanal, have the ability to reduce the viable numbers of L. monocytogenes if used in combination with mild heat treatment, while these treatments alone were not affecting the viability of this pathogen. These findings show that essential oil compounds can play an important role in minimally processed foods, and can be used in the concept of Hurdle Technology to reduce the intensity of heat treatment or possibly other individual hurdles.In Chapter 3 , the combined antimicrobial action of carvacrol or thymol in combination with HHP was investigated at different temperatures. These treatments showed a synergistic action, with greater antimicrobial effects upon pressurisation at 1 oC than at 8°C or 20°C. Furthermore, addition of carvacrol to cells after exposure to sub-lethal HHP treatment showed reductions in viable numbers that were similar to those using simultaneous treatment with carvacrol and HHP. Synergism was also observed between carvacrol and HHP in semi-skimmed milk that was artificially contaminated with L. monocytogenes .The study demonstrates the synergistic antimicrobial effect of essential oils in combination with HHP. Together with the results described in Chapter 2, these data indicate the potential of essential oils to be employed in food processing if combined with other techniques.A major problem that successful application of HHP treatment faces is the variable piezotolerance of bacterial species, strains within a species, and even cells within pure cultures that are not homogenous. In Chapter 4 , we investigated the characteristics of a L. monocytogenes ScottA isolate, named AK01, that was derived from a wild type (wt) culture after a single pressurisation treatment. The survival of exponential and stationary phase cells of AK01 was at least 2 logs higher than that of the wt over a broad range of pressures (150-500 MPa), while both strains showed higher piezotolerance in the stationary than in the exponential phase of growth. In semi-skimmed milk, exponential phase cells of both strains showed lower reductions upon pressurisation than in buffer, but again, AK01 was more piezotolerant than the wt. The piezotolerance of AK01 was retained for at least 40 generations in rich medium, suggesting a stable phenotype. Interestingly, cells of AK01 lacked flagella and were elongated, and this strain showed slightly lower maximum specific growth rates at 8°C, 22°C and 30°C than the wt. Moreover, the piezotolerant strain AK01 showed increased resistance to heat, acid, and H 2 O 2 compared with the wt. The difference in HHP tolerance between the piezotolerant strain and the wt strain could not be attributed to differences in membrane fluidity, since strain AK01 and the wt had identical in situ lipid melting curves, as determined by Fourier Transfer Infrared spectroscopy.In Chapter 5 , the mechanisms underlying the altered phenotypic characteristics of AK01 are further examined. In this chapter, high piezotolerance, immobility, and reduced virulence were conclusively linked to a single amino acid deletion in the highly conserved glycine-rich region of the regulatory protein CtsR ( Class three stress gene repressor). CtsR negatively regulates the expression of Class III heat shock genes ( clpP , clpE and the clpC operon). The Clp proteins prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins that might be toxic to the cell. In the mutant strain AK01, expressing the CtsRΔGly protein, we observed upregulation ofclpP , which demonstrates the involvement of Class III heat shock genes in increased survival upon HHP treatment and other stresses. Replacement of the wt ctsR gene with the ctsRΔGly gene in a wt background resulted in a mutant strain that also lost its motile character, and importantly, also showed attenuated virulence.The deletion of three base pairs in the region of ctsR that normally encodes four glycines is seemingly not an isolated incident, since we detected the same mutation in the majority of other spontaneous piezotolerant isolates of L. monocytogenes . This suggests a functional role for this mutation in L. monocytogenes to survive unforeseen events that do not allow for adaptation of normal cells, but require genetic diversity.In conclusion, this work demonstrated some of the potentials that novel techniques, like the use of essential oils and HHP, can offer alone or combined with other novel or traditional techniques, like heat treatment. We furthermore investigated risks that could emerge from the use of those novel techniques. The occurrence of the piezotolerant strain AK01 of L. monocytogenes demonstrated the existence of bacterial heterogeneity within a supposedly pure wt population with regard to HHP resistance. The variance of piezotolerance within a microbial population, but also between different strains, is an important parameter that determines successful application of HHP treatment. This will be an important aspect for risk assessment of HHP treated foods that are, or will become, available on the market. Tailored HHP treatments, possibly in combination with additional mild preservatives, will be required for different products, and increased knowledge about the effects of these treatments will enable the food industry to produce safe foods at minimal costs.Alternate abstract:Recentelijk zijn diverse milde niet-thermische conserveringstechnieken geïntroduceerd in de voedselverwerking, en andere worden momenteel onderzocht op hun mogelijke toepassing in verwerkingsprocessen van levenmiddelen. Twee van deze nieuwe conserveringstechnieken zijn de toevoeging van etherische plantenextracten (essential oils) en de toepassing van Hoge Hydrostatische Druk (HHP). Het is gebleken dat door gebruik van deze conserveringsmethoden, afzonderlijk of in combinatie, een efficiënte reductie van microorganismen kan worden bewerkstelligd, terwijl de nutritionele en sensorische kwaliteit van het product behouden blijft. Een belangrijke doelstelling van deze dissertatie was het beoordelen van de anti-microbiële werking van deze gecombineerde technieken op hun effectiviteit tegen de pathogene bacterie Listeria monocytogenes, welke de levensbedreigende ziekte listeriose kan veroorzaken. Deze bacterie kan worden aangetroffen in levensmiddelen die niet afdoende zijn behandeld of geconserveerd dan wel zijn nabesmet. Daarnaast is het mechanisme bestudeerd dat ten grondslag ligt aan verhoogde HHP tolerantie van een L. monocytogenes isolaat, om meer inzicht te krijgen in de primaire cellulaire respons van dit organisme welke een rol speelt bij resistentie tegen HHP behandeling. In de introductie (Hoofdstuk 1) wordt kort ingegaan op de voedselpathogeen L.monocytogenes. Vervolgens komen nieuwe milde en niet-thermische conserveringstechnieken aan de orde, met nadruk op het gebruik van etherische plantenextracten en hoge hydrostatische druk. De algemene eigenschappen en werkingsmechanismen van deze technieken worden beschreven. Verder wordt ingegaan op de respons van bacteriën op deze behandelingen en hun overlevingsstrategieën Ten slotte wordt het gecombineerde gebruik van deze technieken besproken, en wordt een overzicht van de inhoud van dit proefschrift gegeven. In Hoofdstuk 2 wordt aangetoond dat afdoding van L. monocytogenes kan worden bewerkstelligd door gebruikmaking van relatief lage concentraties van vluchtige componenten geïsoleerd uit kruiden, namelijk S-carvon, cinnamaldehyde, thymol en decanal, in combinatie met een milde hittebehandeling. Afzonderlijke toepassing van deze verbindingen of milde hitte behandeling had echter geen antimicrobieel effect. De resultaten geven aan dat etherische oliën een belangrijke rol kunnen spelen binnen het concept van de Hordentechnologie. Een reductie van de intensiteit van bijvoorbeeld thermische behandelingen of andere conserveringsmethoden kan op een dergelijke wijze worden gerealiseerd voor minimaal behandelde levensmiddelen. Het Hoofdstuk 3 beschrijft het onderzoek naar de gecombineerde anti-microbiële activiteit van carvacrol en thymol in combinatie met HHP bij verschillende temperaturen. Deze behandelingen laten een synergistisch effect zien dat groter is bij 1°C dan bij 8 of 20°C. Bovendien bleek dat additie van carvacrol na een sub-letale HHP behandeling een vergelijkbare afdoding van Listeria monocytogenes tot gevolg had als een gelijktijdige behandeling met carvacrol onder HHP. Een synergistisch effect van carvacrol en HHP werd niet alleen waargenomen in een buffer, maar eveneens in halfvolle melk die kunstmatig gecontamineerd was met L. monocytogenes. Deze studie toont het synergistische effect van carvacrol en HHP aan. Evenals in Hoofdstuk 2 wordt hier de potentie van het gebruik van etherische oliën in combinatie met andere conserveringsmethoden aangetoond. Een serieus probleem waar succesvolle toepassing van HHP mee te kampen heeft is de variatie in druk-tolerantie tussen micro-organismen. In Hoofdstuk 4 worden de eigenschappen onderzocht van een L. monocytogenes isolaat (stam AK01) met hogere HHP tolerantie dan het wildtype. Stam AK01 werd geïsoleerd uit een wildtype cultuur na een enkelvoudige hoge druk behandeling. Cultures van stam AK01 in zowel het exponentiële als het stationaire groeistadium vertoonden overleving die ten minste twee log-eenheden hoger was dan die van het wildtype na blootstelling aan drukintensiteiten tussen 150 en 500 MPa. Zowel het wildtype als stam AK01 hadden een hogere druk-tolerantie in de stationaire groeifase dan in de exponentiële groeifase. Beide typen cellen vertoonden een verminderde reductie als gevolg van HHP behandeling na groei in halfvolle melk vergeleken met buffer, maar ook hier vertoonde AK01 een hogere druk-tolerantie dan het wild type. De druktolerantie van AK01 bleef behouden gedurende ten minste 70 generaties in een rijk medium, wat een stabiel fenotype suggereert. Opmerkelijk is dat de AK01 cellen geen flagellen hadden, langer dan normaal waren, en een licht gereduceerde maximale specifieke groeisnelheid hadden bij 8, 22 en 30°C vergeleken met het wild type. Bovendien vertoonde de druk-tolerante stam AK01 een hogere weerstand tegen hitte, zure condities en waterstofperoxide dan het wildtype. Het verschil in druk-tolerantie tussen AK01 en het wild type kon niet worden toegeschreven aan verschillen in membraanfluïditeit; beide stammen hadden een identieke in situ smeltcurve van hun lipiden, gemeten met FTIR. In Hoofdstuk 5 worden de mechanismen die ten grondslag liggen aan de gewijzigde fenotypische karakteristieken van AK01 verder onderzocht. Er wordt aangetoond dat hoge druk-tolerantie, immobiliteit en verlaagde virulentie van stam AK01 wordt veroorzaakt door deletie van één aminozuur (glycine) in het sterk geconserveerde glycine-rijke domein van het regulatoire eiwit CtsR ( Class three stress gene Repressor). CtsR remt de expressie van de klasse III genen die worden geïnduceerd door een thermische schok (clpP, clpE en het clpC operon). De Clp eiwitten gaan de accumulatie van (gedeeltelijk) gedenatureerde eiwitten tegen, welke mogelijk toxisch zijn voor de cel. Bij de expressie van het gemuteerde CtsR in AK01 (dat een glycine mist) werd verhoogde expressie van het gen clpP waargenomen. Dit toonde aan dat de klasse III thermische schok genen betrokken zijn bij de verhoogde weerstand tegen HPP en andere stresscondities. Uitwisseling van het wildtype ctsR gen in een wildtype stam met het gemuteerde ctsR gen resulteerde in een mutant welke eveneens verminderde mobiliteit en virulentie vertoonde. De deletie van 3 baseparen in het domein van CtsR dat normaliter voor vier glycines codeert lijkt geen incident te zijn, aangezien we dezelfde mutatie konden aantonen in de meerderheid van spontane hoge druk-tolerante isolaten van Listeria monocytogenes. Deze bevindingen suggereren dat de mutatie in het CtsR eiwit van Listeria monocytogenes een functionele rol vervult in een overlevingsstrategie waarbij adaptatie niet mogelijke is, maar genetische variëteit een uitkomst biedt. Samenvattend heeft deze dissertatie aangetoond dat nieuwe niet-thermische conserveringsmiddelen, zoals het gebruik van etherische oliën en hoge druk, effectief kunnen worden gebruikt om bacteriën af te doden, al dan niet in combinatie met nieuwe of traditionele methoden zoals hittebehandeling. Verder zijn een aantal risico’s onderzocht die kunnen voortvloeien uit het gebruik van dit soort nieuwe technieken. De isolatie van een Listeria monocytogenes stam met verhoogde hoge druk tolerantie toonde aan dat er binnen een wildtype culture heterogeniteit bestaat aangaande hoge druk resistentie. De variatie in druktolerantie binnen een microbiële populatie, maar ook tussen verschillende microorganismen, is een belangrijke parameter welke mede bepalend is voor de succesvolle toepassing van hoge druk. Dit is een belangrijk aandachtspunt in risico evaluatie van hoge druk behandelde levensmiddelen die op de markt worden gebracht. HHP behandelingen, mogelijk in combinatie met aanvullende milde conserveringstechnieken, dienen te zijn toegespitst op specifieke producten. Uiteindelijk zal kennis omtrent de effecten van deze behandelingen op bacteriën de voedselindustrie beter in staat stellen veilige levensmiddelen te produceren tegen zo laag mogelijke kosten.

TI  - Ecology and evolution of an annual plant following fire in the Mojave Desert
SP  - 184
AB  - Plant succession following disturbance in deserts is difficult to study because there is no well-defined series of species replacements and “successional stages” contain many of the same plant species. Persistence of the same species through successional stages introduces the possibility that desert species could respond to natural selection induced by disturbed environments. This study details changes in perennial vegetation, plant distribution, and small-scale abiotic environments on the scale of individual annual plants in order to examine corresponding changes in plant character phenotypes and natural selection in response to disturbance caused by fire. Two burned and two unburned populations of the Mojave Desert annual plant, Amsinckia tessellata were compared in a Coleogyne ramossisima dominated shrubland in Joshua Tree National Park. Perennial community composition was drastically altered by burning, and A. tessellata distribution did not significantly change. However, the microhabitat (light, temperature, and soil moisture) experienced by A. tessellata individuals differed between sites only sporadically, mostly during early spring months. The most dramatic effect of burning upon plant phenotypes was in altering plant response to microhabitat. Plants from burned sites responded to microhabitat in a less predictable and more temporally heterogeneous manner. Phenotypic variation and natural selection were estimated and compared between burned and unburned sites for three components of fitness and lifetime fitness. Phenotypic variation of plant characters and fitness variables was considerably higher in the novel burned environment for most of the plant characters measured. However, total linear selection was neither consistently stronger nor weaker in burned habitats for most character groups. Negative nonlinear (variance decreasing) selection coefficients were not more common in unburned sites compared to burned sites except for a single character group and fitness component. The two years showed highly variable selection, likely because the first sampling year was a high rainfall El Nino year while the second was an average rainfall year. Despite the temporal and spatial variation associated with the abiotic environment and selection between burned and unburned environments, A. tessellata populations could potentially diverge in response to changes in the environment wrought by disturbance.

TI  - Dynamics of adaptive evolution in two experimental viral systems
SP  - 95
AB  - Two species of coliphage were adapted to a novel thermal environment (44°) by serial passaging in a homogenous environment at a low multiplicity of infection. Genomewide nucleotide changes were identified by whole genome sequencing. Both phage achieved tremendous gains in fitness in the new environment during the course of the experiments with little or no loss of fitness in the ancestral environment. Although the number of mutations underlying the fitness gains varied greatly between the two systems, early large-effect mutations were common to both phage. Five missense mutations were observed during the adaptation of &phis;X174; the first two substitutions were responsible for 85% of the total fitness gain. Adaptation to a less extreme environment (41.5°) was necessary before G4 could be adapted to 44°. Seventeen mutations were observed: 14 missense, two silent, and one intergenic. The first three missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. The order in which mutations occurred was determined by probing archived isolates with radiolabeled oligonucleotides. This revealed the surprising result of extensive polymorphism in both phage systems. While there was evidence of epistasis, many of the mutations were beneficial in a variety of genetic backgrounds. Although many adaptive pathways were available, other factors, such as mutational rate heterogeneity, limited the number of pathways that were likely to be followed. This study provides the most complete descriptions to date of the adaptive evolution of a microbial system.

TI  - Ecological studies of larval Glyptotendipes paripes (Chironomidae: Diptera) in selected central Florida lakes for creating an exploratory temporal and spatial model of nuisance populations
SP  - 163
AB  - Ecological and physiological influences on the chironomid midge, Glyptotendipes paripes, were examined to develop a qualitative spatial and temporal computer model of larval distributions in central Florida lakes. Larval population distributions of G. paripes were examined over a two-year period in three central Florida lakes (Dora, Yale, and Wauburg) in relation to selected water and sediment physico-chemical properties. Lake bathymetry and sediment physical compositions were extensively mapped in each lake. Composition of midge larvae in the gut contents of fish in relation to the standing crop of midge larvae in Lakes Dora and Yale was studied. Development times for immature G. paripes were determined in the laboratory by rearing under a series of constant temperatures. These data were used to construct an exploratory spatio-temporal computer model of G. paripes larval distributions in central Florida lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the primary, significant influences on distributions of G. paripes larvae in the study lakes were water depth and the following physico-chemical sediment characteristics: dry weight, total organic carbon and presence of sand, muck or vegetation. While G. paripes larval distributions tended to be associated with shallower, sandy substrates in Lakes Dora and Wauburg, these larvae were distributed over/in muck bottom areas of Lake Yale. The development requirements of this species were calculated to be 716 degree-days above 9.0°C from egg to emergence. Gut content analysis indicated that bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were indiscriminate feeders on midge larvae in shallower portions of the lakes and larvae in deeper portions of the lakes perhaps were not within the grazing range of the fish. When validated against previously collected data from Lakes Jesup and Monroe, the computer model successfully estimated G. paripes larval distributions. The final model was effective at estimating larval distributions in Lakes Dora, Yale and Wauburg with the exception of the field data collected from Lakes Dora and Yale during the latter part of the field study. Further work is needed to determine and understand the environmental conditions that produced the unusual changes in G. paripes distributions noted in these lakes that resulted in model predictions deviating from field data. Theoretical manipulations of conditions within the model produced results that indicated the model to be useful in preliminary ecological studies by providing initial hypotheses on G. paripes larval population responses to selected environmental conditions studies.

TI  - A critical review of techniques used for the comparison of power generation systems on grounds of safety and environmental impacts, incorporating case studies of coal and hydropower generation systems in southern Brazil. (BL: DXN056929)
SP  - 1
AB  - This thesis discuses the usefulness and practicality of modern analytical techniques including life cycle analysis, environmental impact assessment, risk analysis and social costing as applied to decision making over future power generation systems. These techniques originate primarily from northern states whereas they are now being applied in southern countries. This thesis examines the utility of these methodologies in the south, in particular, in Brazil. In a review of three major studies that attempted to advance the methodology of comparative assessment of fuel chains it was found that the outcome of ranking the relative merits, on environmental and health grounds, was method-dependent. Two approaches clearly identified a ranking in which fossil fuel chains, particularly coal, have higher social costs due to estimated impacts of atmospheric pollutants on the general public and global warming. On the other hand, the other reported health risk estimates that to a larger extent overlapped, identifying the wind off-shore alternative as the one with highest mortality estimate. In this thesis risk assessment techniques based on actuarial and dose response functions were tested against four case studies in Southern Brazil. The use of the actuarial approach, based on mortality risk statistics collected in Brazil, reveals that difficulties of applying this type of technique in the Brazilian context. The biggest problem is simply lack of data on the health risks of the many activities that are associated with fuel changes assessed. For the hydropower plants, the main source of mortality risk was estimated to be related to construction activities, while for the power plants operation of power plants and coal transport were estimated as the main sources of mortality risk. First it is necessary to point out that the activities that showed higher risk are the ones which are more demanding on the workforce. As long as the mortality risk and individual risks are kept within accepted levels more demanding activities on the workforce will generate more employment which, while increasing the numbers of accidents, is an important benefit of these projects either during construction or during operation. An important caveat is the uncertainties in the estimation of road transport risks which showed the potential for these to dominate the analysis.

TI  - Geographic physiological variation and northern range limits in the cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma)
SP  - 180
AB  - Studies of the factors that influence the distribution of organisms are central to ecological research. Previous work on limiting factors in the establishment of an organism's geographic range has traditionally focused on survivorship. In my approach, I consider sublethal range-limiting mechanisms. Cottonmouths are excellent model organisms for studying sublethal northern range-limiting factors. Within their range, cottonmouths are often common and locally abundant. Despite their apparent adaptability, cottonmouths do not range above 38°N latitude. The lack of a more northerly distribution is unusual for several reasons and I tested several possible explanations for the current southern distribution of cottonmouths. In order to assess the possibility of reproduction as a sublethal range-limiting mechanism, I investigated the effects of a natural and experimental temperature/photoperiod regime on testosterone cycles of male cottonmouths. Testosterone concentrations were measured in three groups. The first was a field group. The second was a lab control group, which received approximated natural temperature and photoperiod conditions for Northwestern Arkansas. The third was an experimental lab group, which received approximated temperature and photoperiod conditions of a region above the cottonmouth's northern range limit. Both the field and lab control groups demonstrated a single testosterone peak in August. The experimental group also demonstrated a single peak, but the peak was phase shifted by one month to September. Through the coupling of energetic calculations with time and environmental temperature, I demonstrated how male cottonmouths may eliminate the breeding cycle and how reproductive failure may serve as a sublethal range-limiting mechanism. To address the possibility of metabolism as a potential sublethal range-limiting mechanism, I investigated geographic variation in resting metabolic rates of cottonmouths along a latitudinal gradient in central (Louisiana) and peripheral (Missouri, Arkansas) populations. I detected a significant effects and interactions of body mass, temperature, time of day, and latitude of origin. Metabolic cold adaptation appears to operate in cottonmouths from northern populations. Energetic calculations show that while hibernation metabolism is more costly near the northern range limit, it is most likely not a northern range-limiting factor.

TI  - Testing the viability and significance of magma mixing in continental arcs using the Sierra Nevada batholith, California, as an example
SP  - 187
AB  - The occurrence of contemporaneous, chemically diverse rock types (including diorite, granodiorite and granite) in magmatic arcs suggests a genetic relationship among them. Field and geochemical studies in the Mesozoic Sierra Nevada batholith of California indicate that end member magma mixing between 52 weight percent SiO2 basalts (chemically similar to dioritic plutons of the batholith) and 72 weight percent SiO2 granites is an important process in generating chemical diversity in that arc. Additionally, isotopic data for Sierran arc rocks indicate that two distinct mixing processes occurred: open system (granites represent reworked pre-Mesozoic crustal rocks) and closed system (granites represent juvenile additions to the crust). The concept of closed system mixing is new to petrology and is herein termed “internal mixing”. The concept of internal mixing is hypothesized to occur between basaltic liquids and granitic liquids derived through partial melting of penecontemporaneous diorites, and is supported by chemical, isotopic and geochronologic data for some suites of Sierran rocks. Further support for this hypothesis comes from the demonstration that Sierran granites are chemically comparable to experimentally derived partial melts of Sierran diorites. Recognition of internal mixing processes dramatically increases estimates of juvenile material present in the arc and coincidentally increases estimates of crustal growth rates in the arc. New numerical models of magma mixing that account for the recent recognition that arc basaltic magmas often contain up to 8 weight percent H2O offer additional validity to the hypothesis that mixing can be an important process in arc magmatism. Calculation of liquidus temperatures, magma viscosities and densities for hydrous high-alumina basaltic liquids demonstrate that the addition of water reduces or eliminates recognized barriers to mixing between dry basaltic and granitic magmas. Consequently, magma mixing is presented as a viable and important mechanism for generation of intermediate composition magmas that dominate the eruptive and intrusive products of continental arcs. Furthermore, mixing is presented as an important process in the generation of Earth's continental crust.

TI  - The role of habitat quality in shaping evolutionary dynamics, population dynamics, and conservation planning
SP  - 137
AB  - Understanding ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in habitat quality is increasingly important as biologists seek to address human-mediated environmental change. I investigated effects of natural temperature variation on individual fitness and population dynamics of Drosophila melanogaster inhabiting rotting apples in orchards. I also examined how critical habitat designations have influenced recovery plans for threatened and endangered species. I exposed D. melanogaster to field temperatures in rotting apples and measured survivorship and development time. Extreme temperatures in sun-exposed apples reduced survivorship of D. melanogaster by more than 50% relative to that in shaded apples. This difference is comparable to that caused by seasonal changes in ambient temperature, and suggested that selection will target traits conferring greater heat resistance. I next conducted a 3 x 2 factorial experiment that revealed an interaction effect of ethanol and temperature variation between shaded and sun-exposed apples on development time. Adverse effects of high ethanol concentrations and extreme temperatures in sun-exposed apples mitigated one another. Expected correlation between selection for ethanol and heat resistance depends on whether this result derived from cross-induction of physiological stress responses or abiotic interactions between temperature and ethanol. To test an hypothesis that habitat heterogeneity reduces climate-induced population variability, I established populations of D. melanogaster during summer and autumn in large field cages that enclosed “landscapes” of rotting apples. I manipulated habitat heterogeneity with shade cloth to create homogeneous landscapes of either shaded or sun-exposed apples, and heterogeneous landscapes with both. Population density and growth rate varied less between summer and autumn in heterogeneous cages than in either homogeneous treatment. These results suggested that managing for habitat heterogeneity may reduce population variability and thus mitigate risks of stochastic extinction. Lastly, I examined how critical habitat designations influenced recovery plans for threatened and endangered species. Plans for species with critical habitat were not more likely than others to prescribe habitat-based recovery actions or habitat-based recovery criteria. Findings suggested that recovery plans for endangered species have not benefited from critical habitat designations and raised questions about how policies might be amended so that future recovery plans will benefit.

TI  - Evolution of microstructure and defect structure in manganese-aluminum-based permanent magnet alloys
SP  - 213
AB  - In this study, the transformation behavior of MnAl-based ferromagnetic alloys was investigated. The low-cost and availability of the Mn-Al base metals along with their high mechanical strength, machineability and high magnetic energy product (BH) per unit weight make these materials attractive candidates for permanent magnet applications. These alloys derive their magnetic properties from the metastable L10 τ-phase, which generally appears towards the Mn-rich side of the near equiatomic composition. The magnetic properties of these materials are strongly influenced by the microstructure and characteristic defect structure of the τ-phase. The τ-phase exhibits a unique defect structure, which includes twins, stacking faults, anti-phase domain boundaries and dislocations. Understanding the true nature of defect generation is necessary in order to be able to develop processing techniques to enhance and optimize the properties of these materials. The τ-phase derives from a phase mixture of &egr;(hcp) and &egr; ′(B19) phases through various heat treatment processes. Controversial mechanisms are reported in the literature regarding the nature of the &egr; + &egr;′ → τ transformation. Phase transformation mechanisms that are displacive and those involving a massive transformation have been reported. In this study, the true nature of the τ-phase formation was investigated experimentally by utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and in-situ TEM heating experiments. It was shown that both of the transformation modes, i.e. massive and displacive mechanisms, can operate and result in τ-phase formation. The atomic nature of the displacive transformation was studied in detail to elucidate the viability of transformation of a two-phase mixture into a single phase through a shear transformation. In the absence of stress, the massive mode was shown to dominate microstructural evolution in bulk materials. The isothermal nucleation and growth kinetics of the massive transformation were quantitatively studied and compared with similar alloy systems. The nature of growth interfaces, which are believed to play a major role on the generation of the defect structure of the τ-phase, and planar defects were extensively studied by electron microscopy. Models for defect generation were developed to account for the extraordinary defect density in the τ-phase.

TI  - Actin-based motility in a geometrically simplified system
SP  - 199
AB  - Actin polymerization is required for the generation of motile force at the leading edge of both lamellipodia and filopodia and also at the surface of motile intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes . Local catalysis of actin filament polymerization is accomplished in L. monocytogenes by the bacterial protein ActA through nucleation of actin only at one pole, allowing asymmetric formation of an actin “comet tail” and unidirectional movement. Small polystyrene beads (≤0.5 μm diameter) coated uniformly with ActA protein can break symmetry and undergo directional movement in an actin-rich cytoplasmic extract if local asymmetries are built up by random fluctuations of actin filament density or thermal motion. Thus the actin polymerization-based motility generated by ActA can be employed to move non-biological cargo, as has previously been demonstrated for classical motor molecules such as kinesin and myosin. Initiation of unidirectional movement of a symmetrically coated particle is a function of bead size and surface protein density. Larger beads (up to 2 μm diameter) can initiate movement only if surface asymmetry is introduced by coating the beads on one hemisphere or if the Xenopus laevis egg extract is diluted, effectively decreasing extract viscosity. Extract viscosity does not affect the average speed. Observations of actin-based motility in diluted extract allow us to separate symmetry-breaking and tail elongation into two distinct processes and begin to delineate what is required for each. The host cell factors involved in comet tail formation include some of the same proteins found to be involved in lamellipodial protrusion in motile cells. Does this protein component conservation also mean that the ultrastructure of these two motile systems are similar? By performing platinum replica electron microscopy using the simplified system of ActA-coated beads in a range of dilutions of X. laevis egg extract, we found that actin comet tails have a branched organization very similar to that seen in lamellipodia. Arp2/3 localizes to Y-junctions and S1 decoration shows correct directionality at those branch points. However, unlike filaments in lamellipodia, the actin filaments of the comet tail appear strikingly twisted and under significant torsional stress.

TI  - The Practice of Dance Teaching Within the National Curriculum at Key Stages 3/4 in Yorkshire Schools
SP  - 339
AB  - This research was motivated by a desire to see a greater number of Key Stage (KS) 3/4 pupils (11-16 years of age) given the opportunity to experience Dance in schools. Preliminary investigative research in Yorkshire revealed considerable variations in levels of teachers' knowledge and understanding of dance and pedagogy, suggesting that pupils' dance experiences varied accordingly. This provoked an investigation to discover who was teaching dance, what was taught under the title of dance and how dance was taught to the 11-16 age group. An extensive and comprehensive literature review revealed a paucity of empirical research focused on the practice of dance teaching in schools. The research problem was investigated using quantitative and qualitative research methods. The three research instruments: questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and lesson observations were piloted in Leeds and refined for the main research in Yorkshire. Responses to the questionnaires (175 teachers and 23 dance artists/animateurs, giving a total sample of N=198) were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods of analysis. A purposive sample of six questionnaire respondents (two female specialist dance teachers, two female teachers who taught Dance as part of Physical Education and one male and one female dance artist/animateur) were subsequently selected for individual interviews and lesson observations. The Non-numerical Data Indexing Searching and Theorizing (NUDIST) software was used to analyse the transcribed semi-structured interviews. The observations focused on the use of different teaching styles and were analysed in accordance with those proposed by Mosston (1986). The teacher's location in the dance space was based on Gray's use of a Spatial Mapping Plan (1984a; 1984b; 1989). Results from the descriptive statistical analysis revealed that respondents favoured Creative Dance, using predominantly Reproductive teaching styles combined with Mid-Range teaching styles at KS 3. All the styles were used almost equally at KS 4 with Mid- Range most frequently selected. Four experimental Hypotheses stated that the respondents' selection of dance genre; the choice of teaching styles at KS 3 and KS 4; and opinions of dance issues, will vary with Gender (IV 1) and Years of Dance Teaching Experience (IV 3). These Hypotheses were all rejected at the .05 level as no significant differences were found. The interviews and observations supported the findings of the questionnaire. A significant influence on pupils' learning appeared to be the teacher's use of space increasing his/her accessibility to all pupils. In conclusion, the research demonstrates that teachers focus on the teaching of Creative, Expressive, Educative dance genre in Yorkshire secondary schools, and they further indicate that composition, performance and appreciation are fundamental traits of dance experience. Practical classes followed the familiar format of introduction/warm-up, development and conclusion. Above all, the results demonstrate a need for greater knowledge and understanding of dance and pedagogy if it is to be promoted as an important part of the curriculum. Increased levels of appropriate Initial Teacher Training (ITT) and In-Service courses are necessary to develop teachers' expertise and confidence, and enable more pupils to have the opportunity to experience Dance in school.

TI  - STUDIES ON HEREDITARY CHARACTER OF SEX-LIMETED BLACK NEWLY-HATCHED LARVAE
AB  - This paper is a further step into the research on characteristics and their expression mechanisms in order to discover the hereditary mechanisms of silkworm temperature-sensitivity. This paper analyzes both the expression periods of silkworm temperature-sensitivity and hereditary effects of incubation under high temperature and low humidity (HTLH) conditions on silkworm offspring, and, by applying RAPD technique, searches for the molecular marker of temperature-sensitive allele. The results are as follows: 1. Using xianban as laboratory materials, the experiments show that, the HTLH condition over 20 hours during the periods of head bluing or bluishing of silkworm eggs is conducive to the expression of temperature-sensitivity, which condition has no accumulative effects on the induction of temperature-sensitivity. The relationship experiments between the exposure to HTLH during different periods of embryo stages of silkworm eggs, and the hatching of female or male silkworms, shows that the sensitive periods of temperature-sensitivity induction are the first and second days before hatching. During this period, the total protein and RNA are significant different, which might be the induction result of the temperature-sensitive allele. This physiological and biochemical phenomena of embryo prove that the periods of head bluing and bluishing are the sensitive periods of inductive expression of temperature-sensitive genes. The significant differences of the total protein and RNA in silkworm eggs two days before hatching might be the reason of the inductive expression of temperature-sensitive genes of silkworm eggs. 2. The fasting vitality of newly-hatched larvae under condition of natural temperature and humidity is higher than that under condition of high temperature and low humidity. Under incubation conditions of natural temperature and humidity, or high temperature and low humidity, the fasting vitality of the chocolate newly-hatched larvae is higher than that of the black newly-hatched larvae. The further researches on the incubation condition's effects on the vitality of offspring newly-hatched larvae show that HTLH incubation effects the vitality of offspring newly-hatched larvae through effecting the current generation's physique. 3. The male moth from the newly-hatched larvae under HTLH incubation Condition, when used as male parent in crossing, may cause decreasing of hatching ratio of offspring eggs; the female moth, has trend of increasing compared to that from natural temperature and humidity incubation condition; the ratio of unfertilized eggs has decreasing trend. The emergence breeding from newly-hatched larvae, from silkworm eggs under HTLH(HTLH) and natural temperature and humidity (NTH) incubation condition, are grouped into such groups as HTLH ♀X NTH♂、NTH ♀X HTLH♂、HTLH ♀X HTLH♂、NTH♀ X NTH♂, and the amount of laid eggs among each group, whose offspring silkworm eggs are incubated under natural condition, is not significantly different. 4. Using OPE-15 as primer, and DNA of the black newly-hatched larva as template, the RAPD amplification produces a specific DNA fragment of about 150bp, while the chocolate newly-hatched larva doesn't produce this band. The specific band might have relations with transit gene controlling silkworm character of the sex-limited black newly-hatched larvae.Alternate abstract:为了揭示蚕温敏性遗传的机制，在前人研究的基础上，围绕蚕胚胎温敏性的遗传特征及表达机制，作进一步的深入研究。本文对蚕温敏性表达时期的分析及对高温干燥催青蚕种后代的遗传效应进行研究，并运用RAPD技术，试图寻找温敏性等位基因的分子标记，结果如下： 1．本试验用限伴作为研究材料，经实验证明，蚕卵在蚕胚胎发育的点青期或转青期接触高温干燥20小时以上，均能够诱导温敏性的表达，且高温干燥对温敏性的诱导没有累积效应。 蚕卵在胚胎发育不同阶段接触高温干燥与雌雄蚕孵出的关系试验表明，蚕卵温敏性诱导的敏感期在蚕孵化前的第一、二天。在此阶段，蚕卵的总蛋白和总RNA发生比较明显的变化，这可能是蚕卵温敏性基因被诱导表达的结果。从这一胚胎生理生化的变化现象进一步旁证了温敏基因被诱导表达的敏感期在点青期至转青期。蚕卵的总蛋白和总RNA都在蚕卵孵化前两天发生比较明显的变化可能是蚕卵温敏性基因被诱导表达的原因。 2．自然温湿条件下催青孵化出的蚁蚕的绝食生命力高于高温干燥催青孵化出的蚁蚕的绝食生命力。在自然温湿或高温干燥两种催青条件下，孵化出的赤蚁蚕的绝食生命力均比黑蚁的绝食生命力高。进一步研究不同催青条件对后代蚁蚕生命力的影响，结果表明高温干燥催青通过影响当代蚕的体质而对后代的蚁蚕绝食生命力产生一些影响效应。 3．蚕卵在高温干燥条件下催青，孵出的蚁蚕经饲养而发育成的雄蛾，用其作杂交的父本有使后代卵的孵化率降低的趋势；雌蛾，其后代卵的孵化率与自然温湿的雌蛾相比有升高的趋势；不受精卵率则有降低的趋势。 在高温干燥和自然温湿条件下催青的蚕卵，孵出蚁蚕经饲养至化蛾，组配成高温干燥♀×自然温湿♂、自然温湿♀×高温干燥♂、高温干燥♀×高温干燥♂、自然温湿♀×自然温湿♂等组合，其后代的蚕卵在自然条 件下催青时，各组合间的产卵量差异不显著。 4．以OPE?5为引物，黑蚁蚕的DNA 为模板进行RAPD扩增时，得到一条约250bp特异性的DNA片段，而赤蚁的RAPD扩增产物没有此条带。初步推测该特异性扩增条带可能与控制家蚕限性黑蚁性状的易位基因有关。

TI  - Selection for improved feed utilization in Atlantic salmon
SP  - 108
AB  - The thesis, which is based on five experiments, discusses possible selection strategies for improving feed utilization in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Relative feed intake (DFI), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) were significantly higher in offspring from a selected line than those from a wild, unselected line (Paper I). The higher growth of the selected line was the result of both greater feed consumption and more efficient feed utilization for growth. This implies that selection for increased growth in Atlantic salmon may improve both of these traits. Accumulation of yttrium in tissues was very low and not related to weight gain of individual Atlantic salmon fed diets containing YCl3 ( Paper II). Since growth and feed intake is highly correlated, it is concluded that YCl3 is not suitable as a bio-marker for measuring feed intake. Long-term feed intake and feed utilization can now only be recorded for families of salmon reared in separate cages or tanks. A significant family component indicates that the variation in DFI, TGC and FER in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon has a genetic component ( Paper III). The response in feed utilization declines as growth is increased. A significant family component for the deposition of energy per kg weight gain, indicates a possibility to improve feed utilization in Atlantic salmon by selection for less energy in weight gain. A significant effect of sire for the apparent absorption coefficients (AAC) of K, Ca, Mg, Zn and Fe suggests that the variation in AAC of elements in seawater-reared Atlantic salmon is partly governed by genetic factors ( Paper IV). The AACs of K, Cu, Mg and Zn were correlated to body weight and/or growth rate. Estimated heritabilities for AAC of elements and a significant family component for AAC of amino acids, indicate that the variation in AAC of elements and amino acids in freshwater-reared Atlantic salmon has a significant additive genetic component (Paper V). This implies that these traits may be changed by the ongoing selection for increased growth in Atlantic salmon, and should be monitored and possibly used as selection criteria to prevent undesirable correlated responses.

TI  - Development of a high power density combustion system for a silicon micro gas turbine engine
AB  - As part of an effort to develop a microfabricated gas turbine engine capable of providing 10–50 Watts of electrical power in a package less than one cubic centimeter in volume, this thesis presents the design, fabrication, packaging and testing of the first combustion system for a silicon micro heat engine. The design and operation of a microcombustor is fundamentally limited by the chemical reaction times of the fuel, by silicon material and fabrication constraints, and by the inherently non-adiabatic nature of the operating space. This differs from the design of a modern macrocombustion system that is typically driven by emissions, stability, durability and pattern factor requirements. The combustor developed herein is shown to operate at a power density level that is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any other power-MEMS device (2000 MW/m3), and establishes the viability of using high power density, silicon-based combustion systems for heat engine applications at the micro-scale. This thesis presents the development of two specific devices—the first device is a 3-wafer level microcombustor that established the viability of non-premixed hydrogen-air combustion in a volume as small as 0.066 cm 3, and within the structural constraints of silicon; the second device is known as the engine “static-structure”, and integrated the 3-stack micro combustor with the other non-rotating components of the engine. Fabricated by aligned fusion bonding of 6 silicon wafers, the static structure measures 2.1 cm x 2.1 cm x 0.38 cm, and was largely fabricated by deep reactive ion etching through a total thickness of 3,800 μm. Packaged with a set of fuel plenums, pressure ports, fuel injectors, igniters, fluidic interconnects, and compressor and turbine static airfoils, this structure is the first demonstration of the complete hot flow path of a multi-level microengine. The 0.195 cm 3 combustion chamber has been tested for several tens of hours and is shown to sustain stable hydrogen combustion with exit gas temperatures above 1600K and combustor efficiencies as high as 95%. The structure also serves as the first experimental demonstration of hydrocarbon microcombustion with power density levels of 500 MW/m3 and 140 MW/m 3 for ethylene-air and propane-air combustion, respectively. In addition to the development of the two combustion devices, this thesis also presents simple analytical models to identify and explain the primary drivers of combustion phenomena at the micro-scale. The chemical efficiency of the combustor is shown to have a strong correlation with the Damkohler number in the chamber, and asymptotes to unity for sufficiently large values of Da. The maximum power density of the combustor is also shown to be primarily limited by the structural and fabrication constraints of the material. Overall, this thesis synthesizes experimental and computational results to propose a simple design methodology for microcombustion devices, and to present design recommendations for future microcombustor development. Combined with parallel efforts to develop thin-film igniters and temperature sensors for the engine, it serves as the first experimental demonstration of the design, fabrication, packaging and operation of a silicon-based combustion system for power generation applications at the micro-scale.

TI  - Breeding soundness evaluation of Zebu bulls with special reference to variations in clinical parameters and sperm characteristics in sires extensively managed in the dry tropics of Costa Rica
SP  - 53
AB  - This thesis aimed to investigate the breeding soundness of Zebu ( Bos indicus) bulls extensively managed in Costa Rica, with special reference to the identification of variables associated with their final ranking as potential breeders. Particular attention was paid to the prevalence of sperm abnormalities in the ejaculate, as well as eventual seasonal variations-and their causes-in clinical parameters and the spermiogramme. Breeding soundness evaluations (BSE) were performed under field conditions in Bos indicus (Bi) (n = 598), Bos taurus (Bt) (n = 252) and Bos indicus × Bos taurus bulls (Bi × Bt) ( n = 48) in four different climatic regions of Costa Rica. Low scrotal circumference (SC; less than 30 cm) was the most common clinical finding in bulls more than 2 years of age. The percentage of unsound bulls with sperm abnormalities in the ejaculate, especially head defects and proximal droplets, increased as SC decreased (P < 0.05), being higher in bulls having a decreased testicular consistency (TC) (P < 0.001) and long scrotum (P < 0.01). Frequencies of sperm abnormalities were also higher in bulls less than 2 years of age than in older sires (P < 0.01) and were highest in Bi × Bt bulls (P < 0.001). The prevalence of bulls unsound for breeding was lower (P < 0.01) in Bi sires (29%), intermediate in Bt (41%) and higher in Bi × Bt (48%). Sperm morphological examinations in 302 Zebu bulls, aged 1.5–9 years, from the dry Pacific zone of Costa Rica, confirmed the relationship between sperm morphology and clinical andrological parameters. The fine morphology of testes and cauda epididymides from 11 sexually mature Zebu bulls with normal (n = 3) or decreased TC ( n = 8) at palpation was also studied. The overall results confirm the higher adaptability of Zebu bulls to the tropical environment, as well as the relationship between SL, SC and TC with testicular normality and, therefore, with a normal sperm morphology in the ejaculate. The findings also suggest that nutrition, rather than ambient temperature, is the major factor contributing to variations in the reproductive function of Zebu bulls in the tropics.

TI  - Evolutionary potential of the annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, in relation to global warming
SP  - 221
AB  - Impending climate change will test the capacity of plant populations to evolve heat and drought tolerance. The goal of this research was to assess the evolutionary potential of populations of an annual legume, Chamaecrista fasciculata, to novel conditions due to global warming employing a quantitative genetic approach. Climate models suggest that southern populations currently experience a climate similar to that which is predicted for northern populations in the future. Investigation into the magnitude and nature of genetic variation for performance of northern populations across a range of environments will provide insight into limits to adaptation. I sampled populations from an aridity gradient in the Great Plains in Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, northern Oklahoma, and southern Oklahoma. In a pair of greenhouse drought experiments, I found clinal variation among these populations with respect to morphological traits, phenotypic plasticity, and physiological response to drought. Furthermore, there was a reversal in the effect of watering such that northern populations had higher fecundity in well-watered conditions whereas the opposite was true for the most southern population. Pedigreed lines from three populations (MN, KS, and southern OK) were produced by controlled crosses in the greenhouse and progeny were reciprocally planted into field sites in MN, KS, and OK. Phenotypic selection analysis demonstrated that selection regimes differ among the field sites. Short phenology and thin leaves are favored in the north, whereas slower phenology and thick leaves are favored in the south. With few exceptions, quantitative genetic analyses indicated that all populations harbor substantial genetic variance for these traits in all environments. However, although the northern population exhibits relatively high mean fitness in terms of fecundity and expresses significant genetic variance in the intermediate site, it has substantially lower fitness and no significant additive genetic variation in the southern site. The additive genetic correlation structure of northern populations across environments does not indicate a constraint to evolutionary response. However, selection response is predicted to be severely constrained by among-trait additive genetic correlations that are not in accord with the direction of selection. Modest responses to selection may prove biologically significant in an incrementally changing environment.

TI  - The evolutionary significance of melanism in the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis
SP  - 135
AB  - Evolution is defined as a change in gene frequency over time and occurs via several mechanisms, including natural selection, genetic drift, gene flow, and mutation. This study investigates the first three mechanisms in populations of the common garter snake, Thamnophis sirtalis. High levels of melanism (black coloration) occur in island and mainland populations in the western basin of Lake Erie. The frequency of melanism varies among populations but is stable within populations. Color pattern is probably determined at one locus with melanism recessive to normal coloration. Dorsal coloration may influence natural selection in two ways. Melanism may be advantageous if dark coloration increases heating rates or equilibrium temperatures. However, melanism may be detrimental if reduced crypsis leads to greater detection by predators. To determine how melanistic snakes differ from normal snakes, I tested for associations of color pattern with morphology, growth, and behavior and found melanism may be associated with a greater number of subcaudal scales, a slower growth rate in mass, and a longer latency to move. To determine whether melanistics differ in thermal properties, I measured heating rates and equilibrium temperatures in matched pairs of normal and melanistic snakes. I found no thermal differences among neonates or subadults, suggesting that if melanism provides a thermal advantage, it is restricted to larger body sizes. To determine whether melanistics are subject to greater predation, I measured predation intensity using clay models. I found no difference in attack rate between normal and melanistic snake models. In addition to these selection hypotheses, I also examined the role of population size, gene flow, and genetic drift. Estimation of population sizes suggests that some populations are small enough for genetic drift to influence allele frequencies. However, estimation of gene flow from patterns of molecular variation using FST- and coalescent-based approaches suggests that gene flow is high (greater than 3 migrants per generation). If estimated gene flow rates are correct, genetic drift should be swamped by migration, and variance in morph frequency among populations is better explained by differences in selective regimes. However, if these rates overestimate contemporary gene flow, drift may be primarily responsible for this variance.

TI  - Structural, dielectric, and optical properties of potassium tantalate niobate thin films prepared by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition
SP  - 388
AB  - The structure-property relations of potassium tantalate niobate (KTaxNb1−xO 3) thin films have been investigated to assess their viability as nonlinear optical materials. Single phase, epitaxial films were deposited by low pressure metalorganic chemical vapor deposition over the entire solid solution range. Under optimized growth conditions, the composition of the films could be controlled within 5 atomic percent. The factors determining the domain structure of the KNbO3 thin films were studied. Thermally-induced strain and depolarization effects were responsible for the film domain structure. For films possessing a mixed domain structure, the volume fraction of each domain variant depended on lattice mismatch. A thickness dependence on the structural, dielectric, and optical properties was observed for the KNbO3 thin films. The phase diagram of the epitaxial KTaxNb 1−xO3 thin film system was determined from x-ray diffraction and temperature dependent dielectric measurements. At room temperature, the morphotropic boundaries of the films occur at x ≈ 0.30 for the orthorhombic to rhombohedral phase transition and at x ≈ 0.74 for the rhombohedral to cubic phase transition. This differs significantly from the bulk equilibrium phase diagram and is attributed to the lattice misfit strain, which stabilizes the rhombohedral structure over the tetragonal phase. Second harmonic generation (SHG) of the KNbO3 thin films was strongly influenced by the domain structure. The measured SHG coefficients of unpoled films were typically one to two orders of magnitude lower than the bulk. At normal incidence, this reduction was attributed to the presence of 180° antiparallel domains. However, at oblique incidence, the domain effects were lessened and higher nonlinear optical susceptibilities were obtained. Measured effective susceptibilities ranged from 0.7 to 16.9 pm/V. The SHG susceptibilities for the KTaxNb1− xO3 films was dependent upon composition. The nonlinear optical coefficients decreased with increasing tantalum concentration. The refractive indices and spontaneous polarization also decreased with increasing tantalum content. Crystalline defects in the films also contributed to the second harmonic signal. No second harmonic generation was observed for the KTaO3 thin films as expected from symmetry considerations.

TI  - Consequences of ecological specialization in long-term evolving populations of Escherichia coli
SP  - 108
AB  - This dissertation asks two major questions: (1) Does adaptation to a specific environment necessarily cause losses in performance or functionality in other environments? and (2) What are the population genetic mechanisms responsible for any such losses? These questions are addressed using 12 populations of Escherichia coli that evolved in a simple, glucose-limited laboratory environment for 20,000 generations. During this time, all of the populations became progressively better adapted to growth in this environment. In Chapter I, I examine the consequences of this evolution for the bacteria's capacity to utilize 93 substrates, and thereby quantify the extent to which specialization led to losses of function. On average, diet breadth of the evolved populations declined significantly relative to the ancestors, but complete loss of function on any given substrate was rare. I also measured the relative fitness of the evolved populations in four foreign environments, in which improved fitness was frequently found. In Chapter II, I quantify diet breadth after multiple evolutionary time points to determine whether antagonistic pleiotropy (AP) or mutation accumulation (MA) explains a greater proportion of the observed functional decay. The evolution of increased mutation rates in three populations allowed a critical test of the MA model. Mutator lines are expected to lose functions much more rapidly than the wildtype lines under MA, but not under AP, as the rate of adaptive substitution was similar across lines. These classes of lines did not significantly differ in diet breadth, contrary to the predictions of MA. Most losses of function occurred early in the experiment when beneficial mutations were being substituted most rapidly, a pattern that is consistent with AP. Thus, AP appears more important than MA for the tendency toward decreased diet breadth in these evolving populations. In Chapter III, I examine the effects of adaptation to a constant 37° environment on thermal niche. The mean maximum growth rate of all evolved populations increased at moderate temperatures, but decreased at extreme high and low temperatures. Most of these changes in thermal niche occurred over the first 2,000 generations, when selection was most intense. Together these results suggest that AP was responsible for improved performance at moderate temperatures but reduced growth at extreme temperatures. Chapter IV is a case study of functional decay, and focuses on the loss of D-ribose catabolic function that occurred in all populations by generation 2,000. The mutation rate for this loss of function was found to be extremely high and caused by deletions associated with an IS150 element inserted upstream of the operon. Mutants bearing only this mutation also conferred a small benefit in the selective environment. Given these findings, population genetic models suggest that the loss of ribose catabolic function was caused by (i) an unusually high mutation rate, such that these mutants appeared repeatedly in all populations, (ii) a selective advantage in the experimental medium that drove these mutants to fixation, and (iii) linkage of these mutations to other beneficial mutations of larger effect.

TI  - Evolutionary ecology and population genetics of tychoparthenogenesis in the mayfly, Stenonema femoratum (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae)
SP  - 137
AB  - Tychoparthenogenesis is characterized by low hatching success of unfertilized eggs, (less than ten percent) from females of typically sexually reproducing species. Because hatching success is low, the predicted two-fold advantage of obligate parthenogenesis does not exist with tychoparthemogenesis. This suggests that some other advantage must be responsible for its maintenance. To investigate the potential adaptive significance of tychoparthenogenesis, I documented population and habitat variation in tychoparthenogenetic capacity and investigated biotic and abiotic correlates of tychoparthenogenesis in the mayfly, Stenonema femoratum. Tychoparthenogenetic capacity (% unfertilized eggs hatching) varied among habitats in 1996, but not in 1997. Temporary stream females had significantly higher tychoparthenogenetic capacities compared to those of permanent streams and lakes. But in 1997, habitats were not significantly different. All populations showed female biased nymph sex ratios. Temporary streams showed low nymph densities compared to the other habitats, however, habitats did not differ in adult density. Tychoparthenogenetic capacity was negatively related to nymph density, suggesting tychoparthenogenesis may function in reproductive assurance. Habitats differed in their abiotic characteristics, however, tychoparthenogenetic capacity was correlated only with water temperature. Populations with higher tychoparthenogenetic capacities exhibited lower observed heterozygosity, however, all populations contained substantial genetic diversity. Temporary streams showed significantly lower heterozygosity compared to permanent streams and lakes. Fixation index was significantly greater than zero for all but one population, indicating heterozygote deficiencies. Temporary streams had significantly greater fixation indices compared to permanent streams and lakes. Populations showed weak but significant genetic differentiation among subpopulations, possibly due to local clustering of sibs, but there was no significant genetic differentiation among populations, suggesting substantial gene flow among populations. I estimated population outcrossing rates for two populations. Multilocus outcrossing rates were tm = 0.734 (Little Dixie Lake) and tm = 0.505 (Rock Bridge Gans Creek). Results also indicated biparental inbreeding in LD, but not in RBG. Correlation with selfing was large in both populations, indicating heterogeneity in outcrossing rates. Correlation with paternity was high in both populations, indicating that outcrossed sibs within families were sired by the same father. Progeny sex ratios were female biased, but family outcrossing rate was not correlated with family sex ratio.

TI  - Characterization and assessment of compost for suppression of selected turfgrass diseases
SP  - 193
AB  - The use of composts for turfgrass disease management allows for a reduction of pesticide use in traditional chemical control practices. Up to five composts were characterized and evaluated for suppression of turfgrass diseases. The monitoring of temperature and oxygen throughout the composting process was the best method tested in evaluating compost maturity. Controlled environment experiments with selected compost treatments suppressed dollar spot of turf (Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F. T. Bennett) by up to 58% and, in field trials, were not significantly different than fungicide controls (P = 0.05). Similarly, fall applications of compost reduced snow mould (Microdochium nivale Fr. Samuels and Hallet, Typhula ishikariensis Lasch ex. Fr.) severity to levels not significantly different from fungicide controls and increased green-up of turf (recovery from disease and/or winter dormancy) by up to 63% compared to fungicide and 54% compared to fertilizer controls (P = 0.05). Microbial characterization of composts revealed high culturable colony counts. Moreover, 29% of bacteria isolated displayed proteolytic activity. Two bacterial identification systems gave variable results, whereas phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was a valuable indicator of microbial community dynamics. Many bacterial isolates tested in the plate challenge experiment displayed antagonistic activity towards selected turfgrass pathogens. Antagonistic activity of composts relies on a number of factors, and although their relative importance varies, microbial activity levels, population dynamics, nutrient aspects, as well as other associated chemical and physical factors all have a part in turfgrass disease suppression.

TI  - Intergalactic dust and metals in cosmology
SP  - 234
AB  - This thesis addresses the creation, distribution, and cosmological implications of intergalactic dust and heavy elements (‘metals’). Most cosmic metals must have formed in stars in galaxies, yet a significant fraction of all metal lies the in the intergalactic medium (IGM). How these metals escaped their progenitor galaxies is currently an open question, which we address using cosmological N-body/hydrodynamical simulations to which we add prescriptions for the chemical evolution of galaxies and for the ejection of metals into the IGM by dynamical processes, by supernova-driven winds, and by radiation-pressure driven dust efflux. The method provides detailed calculations of the amount and distribution of cosmic metals, and the results demonstrate that winds and radiation pressure—but perhaps not dynamics—might account for most of the intergalactic metal observed, if it was ejected at redshift z [special characters omitted] 8 from relatively large galaxies. These and other calculations indicate that unless it is largely destroyed during ejection, a significant level of intergalactic (IG) dust should exist. If this dust reddens attenuated light less than dust in galaxies (perhaps due to selective destruction or galactic retention of very small grains), it could seriously affect recent determinations of the Hubble diagram sing Type Ia supernovae, without having been detected by those observations. Intergalactic dust would also reprocess some diffuse extragalactic background light from optical wavelengths into the far-infrared (FIR), and the expected contribution can be compared to observations of the cosmic microwave (CMB) and FIR backgrounds. This strongly constrains the density of IG dust but does not rule out a cosmologically significant level. Finally, we address the question of whether the entire CMB might be dust emission. Such ‘cold big-bang’ models have long provided an alternative to the widely accepted hot big-bang models, but have difficulty accounting for the highly thermal nature of the CMB. We estimate the temperature, calculate the evolution, and discuss the anisotropies of a homogeneous radiation background emitted at high redshift by population III objects and thermalized by a mixture of dust types. These calculations are compared in detail to current observations to assess the current viability of cold big-bang models.

TI  - Studies on postponed aging in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 196
AB  - This study utilizes populations of Drosophila melanogaster to study various aspects of postponed aging. For example, in Chapter Two, I measured the return rate of demographic traits under reverse demographic selection, finding that life span rapidly approached the level of the control population. Starvation resistance and the S allele of Phosphoglucomutase also fell within the 67 generations of this experiment, while early fecundity increased within the same time frame, suggesting that antagonistic pleiotropy governs these life-history characters. Desiccation resistance, on the other hand, continues to be maintained at the same level as that of the ancestral stock, suggesting mutation accumulation as the mechanism for its evolution. In Chapter Three, I investigate the implications of the maintenance of a selection response upon relaxation by imposing relaxed stress selection on stocks selected for enhanced resistance to starvation and desiccation stress, and then observing the response to reverse selection. I found that after 35 generations of relaxed selection, longevity, early fecundity, and desiccation resistance have not changed significantly in the relaxed desiccation populations, suggesting that the alleles affecting these characters lack significant antagonistic pleiotropy. Starvation resistance, on the other hand, rose significantly in the relaxed desiccation populations, indicating that they have responded to the new selection regime. These results suggest that significant erosion or reversal of selection responses upon relaxation is not a general phenomenon. Also, patterns of correlated response to upward selection may not be preserved in the response to relaxed selection. This illustrates a more general point that the evolutionary and genetic relationships between characters may not be fixed even over short periods of evolution, a point of salience for evolutionary models that assumed such fixity. RNA's for the heat shock protein (hsp) genes hsp22 and hsp23 have previously been found to be induced during Drosophila aging, suggesting that these genes might have specific functions at late ages. Thus, Northern blot analysis was used to determine if selection for increased lifespan has affected the expression of several small hsp genes. I found a consistent upregulation of hsp22 RNA levels in all five postponed senescence stocks relative to their controls (Chapter Four). In Chapter Five, ten new outbred population were created by crossing inbred laboratory strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Five populations were selected for postponed senescence, and five were maintained as controls. I tested whether patterns of indirect response observed in the original populations selected for postponed senescence can be altered significantly by using populations with a very different genetic history. Imposing selection for increased longevity results in a significant increase in longevity. At the same time, early fecundity for the five selected stocks falls below that of the control populations. A related character, starvation resistance, does not seem to be changing during the 22 generations of selection. And, if it is differentiating, it is doing so in the opposite direction from that observed previously.

TI  - Juvenile Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) feeding ecology in Prince William Sound, Alaska
SP  - 172
AB  - Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) are commercially exploited along the Asiatic and North American Pacific Ocean continental shelves. In Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, herring were commercially important until a year class failures in 1993. A noticeable lack of life history information on juveniles was available in PWS to use for studies addressing the failed recruitment. This study describes the seasonal herring feeding ecology in PWS nursery areas from 1996 to 1998. Zooplankton from 535 vertical tows and herring diet data from 3,282 stomach contents were collected from Eaglek, Simpson, Whale and Zaikof Bays. Zooplankton species composition was dominated by small calanoid copepods, cyclopoids, invertebrate eggs, and adult euphausiids in March prior to the spring phytoplankton bloom. Small calanoid copepods, especially Pseudocalanus spp., were dominant during the peak abundance. Oikopleurans were abundant from August to October. The zooplankton density peaked at 1,234 to 5,594 individuals m−3 between June and July 1996. Zooplankton density was significantly lower in 1997 than 1996. Seasonal density and diversity were found to vary among and within the four bays. The abundance of prey in herring diets was correlated to the timing and degree of zooplankton prey availability. Feeding was highest at 1,192 items per fish in July 1996 and decreased until winter (December to March) when the number of empty stomachs ranged from 70 to 90%. Lower zooplankton densities in 1997 were reflected in significantly lower abundances of prey in 1997 diets. Prey selectivity was negatively correlated with zooplankton densities among months. Diel and ontogenetic feeding trends as well as differences between feeding depths were noted. Assimilation rates of smaller herring were closer to basal metabolic rates and herring less than 3 g had insufficient energy reserves to survive the winters of 1995–1996 and 1996–1997. These patterns suggest that juvenile herring are dependent on an abundance of prey to successfully feed and have enough energy reserves to overwinter. The effects of increased temperatures on zooplankton fluctuations and changes in herring condition may have had population level consequences in PWS. Successful feeding when prey abundance and composition was highly variable reveals herring's adaptability to multiple environments.

TI  - Latitudinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. (BL: DXN051599)
SP  - 1
AB  - There is widespread latitudinal variation in ectotherms. This latitudinal variation is often the result of a combination of the evolutionary genetic and developmental effects of the changing environment. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism in which to study this variation. Genetic, latitudinal clines have been found in a number of traits of Drosophila melanogaster. Body size, egg size and ovariole number have been found to increase, and development time to decrease with latitude in more than one continent. Parallel latitudinal clines in different continents indicate that natural selection is responsible for this genetic variation. The developmental effects of the environment can act in the same or opposite direction to the evolutionary effects.To further investigate latitudinal variation in D. melanogaster, latitudinal variation in starvation resistance, fat content and larval growth efficiency were studied. Starvation resistance and fat content in South American populations were found not to vary with latitude. Larval growth efficiency was studied in both South American and Australian populations, and larvae originating from high latitude populations were able to convert a fixed amount of food into larger adult body size. In addition, at lower experimental temperatures, larvae originating from both high and low latitudes converted food into larger adult size.An investigation into the genetic basis of the clines in body size in South America and Australia was performed. Chromosome substitution analysis was done to establish whether any of the chromosomes had large effects on body size, and whether these effects differed between the 2 continents. Chromosome 3 was found to have the largest effect on body size in both continents, with the other chromosomes also having some effect.

TI  - Analysis of stage-differentiation in Trypanosoma brucei using developmental mutants and molecular regulators
SP  - 236
AB  - The life cycle of the trypanosome undergoes a series of differentiation steps to adapt to the different environments encountered by the parasite. In particular the differentiation of the bloodstream form to the insect stage procyclic form has been well characterised and a map of events formulated. However, the actual underlying control mechanisms are as yet unknown. The aim of this project was to dissect the underlying mechanisms of control of bloodstream form differentiation. Three approaches were taken, first bloodstream cells strain GUP2965.3 was cultured in vitro and the differentiation ability of the cells analysed. It was observed the bloodstream cells adapted to in vitro culture in the media HMI-9 quickly and efficiently. It was discovered that the addition of 6mM cis-aconitate (pH7) and reduction in temperature to 27°C resulted in optimal differentiation and cell survival in GUP2965.3 cells. Secondly, the respiratory poison potassium cyanide was used to select for cells which were unable to differentiate to procyclic forms. The selection regime derived cell lines which demonstrated lower levels of differentiation compared to wild type cells. The differentiation defective cell lines were then cloned and analysed using a number of markers for differentiation. The experiments revealed that the defective cell lines were capable of initiating differentiation but were unable to complete the process. In particular they appeared to arrest at an early procyclic phase and were unable to progress to the mature procylic stage. In the final approach, a stage regulated MAP kinase was identified in T brucei, pK2.7, where mRNA was bloodstream stage enriched. The sequence of pK2.7 demonstrated the presence of the conserved dual phosphorylation motif, TXY, specific to the MAP kinase family of molecules. Furthermore pK2.7 had an unusual C-terminal extension which may be important in the regulation, function and localisation of the protein. To elucidate the functions of pK2.7, gene over-expression and ablation was attempted. The results obtained suggests that pK2.7 may be an essential gene in the trypanosome which may play a role in the signal transduction pathways.

TI  - Latitudinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 136
AB  - There is widespread latitudinal variation in ectotherms. This latitudinal variation is often the result of a combination of the evolutionary genetic and developmental effects of the changing environment. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism in which to study this variation. Genetic, latitudinal dines have been found in a number of traits of Drosophila melanogaster. Body size, egg size and ovariole number have been found to increase, and development time to decrease with latitude in more than one continent. Parallel latitudinal dines in different continents indicate that natural selection is responsible for this genetic variation. The developmental effects of the environment can act in the same or opposite direction to the evolutionary effects. To further investigate latitudinal variation in D. melanogaster, latitudinal variation in starvation resistance, fat content and larval growth efficiency were studied. Starvation resistance and fat content in South American populations were found not to vary with latitude. Larval growth efficiency was studied in both South American and Australian populations, and larvae originating from high latitude populations were able to convert a fixed amount of food into larger adult body size. In addition, at lower experimental temperatures, larvae originating from both high and low latitudes converted food into larger adult size.

TI  - Studies on the Ecology of cotesia plutellae Kurdjumov and its Protection and Utilization
AB  - In this dissertation,ecological factors that affected the parasitizing action of Cotesus plutellae were studied with the rotational composite design of quadratic regression and uniform design. The influence of certain measure in the protection of C .plutellae was evaluated with life table established according to acive factors on the diamondback moth (DBM) and parameters such as popu1ation trend index (I) and index of population control (IPC).population dynamics of C.plutellae and the diamondback moth (DBM), phalla xylostella (L.) in different kinds of vegetable fields were investigatad systematically. The results showed that p.xylostella and C. plutellae had the same trend. In initial stage of growth of vegetables, parasitic rate was rather low, while the harvest time, population of DBM increased, and so did the rate of parasitism. These showed that the potential ability of C,plutellae to control the DBM was quite powerful.Parasitism of C.plutellae affeted by some environmental factors Illumination time attributed little to its parasitic rate and searching effect. The rate of parasitism and searching effect deceased with the increase of host density. The rate of parasitism went up with the increasc of C. plutellae, but its searching effect declined. The ambient temperature had a great impact on parasitism. At l50C, C. plutellae almost ceased hunting for host and the rate of parasitism approached to zero. At 27-280C, searching effect reached its climax and rate of parasitism increased to 47.22%.. C. plutellae almost stop searching and rate of parasitism was extremely low at 350C. C.plutellae was greatly affected by the spatial states, e.g. density of vegetables and size of plant. In a specified space, given a certain amount of C.plmellae and hosts, the rate of parasitism went down with the increase of density and size of plant. The adaptability of C.plutellae to the host avaiIability was also probed. The results showed that the rate of parasitism of C. plutellae increased stably within six days after emergenee. In the first day the parasitic rate of the third instar larvae of DBM was 72.94%, and it reached 88.79% in the sixth day, which showed that the absence of host in a short time did not affect the control effect of C plutellae on DBM.The green house consisted to a certain degree in controlling DBM. In the treatment with released C.plutellae, the rate of parasitism increased to 27.4% in a l/4ha vegetable plot. while in the field with no C plutellae released, it dropped to 7%. Therefore the control efficiency was improved 22% by releasing C .Plutellae, moreover. Population trend index in the field released pleutellae was 0.709 times of that of no C. Plutellae released. Hence, releasing C.Plutellae had some control effect on DBM.DBM got the resistance to the most chemical pesticides. Within 72h, DDVP only killed 40.37% of their larvae and cypermethrin just killed 33.54%, while these chemical insecticides had a strong influence in the adults survival rate of C.plutellae, mating and oviposition behavior.For instance, bisultap killed 93.59% of C.plutellae adults and suppressed 76.47% of female oviposition within 48h. Bilological pesticides, such as Bt.caierdi, libao and neem, were also used to deal with DBM.B .t could kill 25.05% of larvae within 24h and 97.l9% within 72h. Furthermore. the majority of DBM chrysalises could not emerge normally.B.t had a relatively gentle lnfluence li C.plutellae adults. It killed just 40.l8% and suppressed barely l l .78% of female parasitism. Studies on the field had obtained similar results. In the vegetable plot where the chemical pesticide had been sprayed for a long time, namely, in the chemical control region, the rate of parasitism was mere1y 22.7%, while in the region utilized the biological pesticides, e.g.neem, B,t, the parasitic rate reached to 37.8% and 33.3% respectively. The index of population trend of DBM in chemical control region was 1 .03 times of non-drags sprayed region, but in B.t or neem applled region was 0.25 and 0.36 times of non-drags sprayed region.Results showed that C. plutellae was dominant natural enemy of DBM.Augmentation and release of C. plutellae could improve its field control effect on DBM in the south China, but the cost was rather expensive and need further researches. For these reasons, the key of factor conservation of C. plutellae was to stop employing chemical insecticide in the field.Alternate abstract:本文从保护利用小莱蛾绒茧蜂（Cotesia plutellae Kurdjumov）的角度出发，采用二次正交旋转组合设计，均匀设计等方法，对影响其寄生作用的生态因子（温度、光照、空间异质性等）进行了分析，并以作用因子组配的生命表及种群趋势指数（I）和控制指数（IPC）评价了不同措施对小菜峨绒茧蜂的保护作用，现将主要试验结果简述如下：通过田间不同蔬菜品种上小菜蛾绒茧蜂与小莱蛾种群数量关系的系统调查，结果表明小莱蛾绒茧蜂与寄主小菜蛾（Plutella xylostella L.）在不同的蔬菜品种上是相同的变动趋势，即无论在绝对数量还是相对数量上都表现出明显的跟随现象，在蔬菜生长初期，寄生率较低收获后期，小菜蛾种群升高，寄生率也升高，表现出较强的控害潜能。小菜蛾绒茧蜂的寄生行为受到各种环境因子及自身属性的影响，绒茧蜂的寄生率和寻找效应与光照时间呈正相关，但作用不明显；随着寄主数量增加，绒茧蜂的寄生率和寻找效应呈下降趋势, 蜂量的增加可以提高绒茧蜂的寄生率，但降低其寻找效率。环境温度对绒茧蜂的寄生行为影响显著, 在15℃，小菜蛾绒茧蜂停止寻找寄主，寄生率几乎为0, 随着温度的升高，活动能力加强，寻找效率很高，寄生率上升，27-28℃小菜蛾绒茧蜂寻找效率最大, 寄生率高达47.22%,超过28℃后，绒茧蜂寻找效率降低，寄生率也下降，35℃时，几乎停止搜索，寄生率极低。小菜峨绒茧蜂空间异质性反应明显，蔬菜种植密度及植株大小时绒茧蜂的寄生率都有影响，在特定空间内，一定的蜂量和寄主虫量条件下，随着种植密度增加和植株增大，绒茧蜂寄生率随之下降。绒茧蜂对寄主缺乏的适应性，研究表明绒茧蜂羽化后，由于寻找不到合适龄期的小菜蛾幼虫而延迟寄生，在6天内，随着时间推移，寄生率反而有所上升，在提供寄生后第1天寄生3 龄幼虫的寄生率达72.94％, 第6天寄生率可达88.79％。可见短时间的寄主缺乏不影响绒茧蜂的控制能力。在大棚蔬菜种植中，由于大棚的影响，小菜蛾绒茧蜂的寄生率偏低，只有29.5％, 比棚外的35.8％低，但大棚对小莱绒成虫扩散阻碍效果更强，总体上，棚外的小菜蛾种群的趋势指数是棚内的1.466倍，大棚对小菜蛾种群有一定控制作用：田间释放绒茧蜂控制小菜蛾种群的试验结果表明，1／45ha的大棚菜地内释放1200头绒茧蜂，寄生率可达27.4%,而未放蜂区寄生率只有7％,放蜂控制效果可提高22％, 由于绒茧蜂的干扰，放峰区的小莱蛾种群趋势指数是未放峰区的0.709倍，放蜂对控制小菜蛾种群起一定的作用。小菜蛾已对大多数化学杀虫剂产生了抗药性。用药72小时后敌敌畏处理的小菜蛾幼虫死亡率只有40.37％,兴棉宝只有33.54％，但杀虫剂对绒茧蜂成蜂的存活率，交配、产卵作用都有较大影响，杀虫双处理成蜂48小时内死亡率高达93.59％，对雌蜂寄生抑制率达76.47％; 生物制剂B.t，菜蛾敌，绿宝，印楝处理小菜蛾幼虫，在24小时内，B.t处理组死亡率为25.05％,但72小时后可达97.19％．且已化蛹的小菜蛾也绝大多数不能正常羽化。生物制剂对绒茧蜂成虫的影响较小，72小时内B.t处理组死亡率只有40.18％，且对雌蜂寄生抑制率也只有11.75％。田间的观察也得出相似的结果，在长期施用化学农药的菜地（化防区）绒茧蜂的寄生率仅22.7％，但施用生物制剂的印楝区和B.t区分别可达37.8％和33.3％，化防区的小菜蛾种群趋势指数比未施药区的还高，是未施药区的1.03倍，而 B.t区和印楝区的小菜蛾种群趋势指数只有未施药区的 0.25倍和 0.36倍。综上所述，绒茧蜂对小菜蛾的自然控制能力较强，是小菜蛾种群的优势天敌。在华南地区，大量繁殖释放绒茧蜂可以提高其田间控制效果，但其技术成本较高，有待进一步研究；因此，菜地停止使用化学杀虫剂是绒茧蜂保护的关键。

TI  - Biology and behaviour of the parasitoid Anagyrus kamali Moursi [Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae]
SP  - 179
AB  - The parasitoid Anagyrus kamali Moursi [Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae] has been recently introduced into the Caribbean as a biological control agent against the Hibiscus Mealybug (HMB), Maconellicoccus hirsutus Green [Homoptera: Pseudococcidae]. Information on this parasitoid is scarce and investigations of its biology and behaviour were conducted to optimize its mass-production, and improve our understanding of the A. kamali/M. hirsutus system. Host selection experiments showed that, of nine species tested, HMB was the only suitable mealybug species for A. kamali development. Third nymphal instar was the optimal stage for wasp mass-production since A. kamali progeny from this stage had a female biased sex ratio and it had a weaker immune response as evidenced by lower encapsulation rate than adult female HMB. Parasitoid functional response was of type III in variable-time conditions, ensuring the preservation of HMB population at low density, and of type II–III in fixed-time conditions, leading to a better use of HMB population in mass-rearing. Temperature and photoperiod had a profound impact on parasitoid fecundity, 26°C and LD 0:24 being the optimal condition to maximize A. kamali oviposition. Parasitoid body size was positively correlated to its fitness. Large parasitoids lived significantly longer, had a higher fecundity, and progeny emergence with a lower sex ratio than small ones. Studies on mating showed that A. kamali is arrhenotokous and that multiple mating is required to optimize progeny sex ratio. Progeny production by mated females was also higher than that of virgin females. Female parasitoid fecundity was negatively correlated to their density due to mutual interference. Under mass-rearing conditions, 75 female A. kamali per cage was the optimum. Finally, under stored condition, food supply and low temperature (20°C) appeared essential to sustain parasitoid longevity. However, storage periods up to 14 days did not affect parasitoid lifetime fecundity. For optimal mass-production, 75 male and female A. kamali should be released in a cage containing 30–36 sprouted potatoes infested with 15 HMB egg masses each three weeks. After a three week-period, this should allow the production of 900 parasitoids over a 12 day-period.

TI  - On the interaction between atmosphere and vegetation under increasing radiative forcing: A model analysis
SP  - 161
AB  - Atmosphere-vegetation interaction. Terrestrial vegetation exerts a significant influence on the atmosphere. For instance, it determines by its reflectivity (albedo) the input in shortwave energy from the sun, it controls the fluxes of water vapour and of carbon dioxide, and influences by its surface roughness the flow in the planetary boundary layer. However, in current global climate models that are used to project the evolution of the global climate under an increasing greenhouse gas induced radiative forcing, the structure of terrestrial vegetation, which determines the properties and the functionality of the land's surface with respect to the atmosphere, is assumed to remain constant and not responsive to the changing climatic conditions. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential role of feedbacks in the atmosphere-vegetation system in the framework of a computationally very efficient conceptual model. The conceptual model. The conceptual model is based on strongly simplified but largely realistic representation of the atmosphere and the terrestrial vegetation on a regional level. It includes essentials of water related two-way feedbacks, such as the influence of vegetation on evapotranspiration and therefore on the surface energy balance, and the impact of temperature and drought on biomass growth and mortality. Response to increasing radiative forcing. In the simulation experiments the atmosphere-vegetation system of a mid-latitude region is subject to an increasing external radiative forcing. The analogous simulations with the dynamic biomass scheme indicate at first a transient growth of biomass related to the temperature increase up to a critical threshold in radiative forcing. The increase in biomass leads to a slight mitigation, respectively its decrease to a slight reinforcement of the temperature increase, because of the change in evapotranspiration. Model extended by dynamic roots, cloud feedback and adaptation. This picture changes if one takes into consideration an additional feedback loop. This feedback is based on the hypothesis that drought stress implies not only a reduction in above ground biomass, but also a reduction in rooting systems and therefore a reduction of the amount of water accessible to the plants for transpiration. The investigations with a scheme that couples cloudiness to regional evapotranspiration indicate that cloud feedback tends to stabilize both states. In order to investigate the role of the adaptability of terrestrial ecosystems to changing climatic conditions, a simple scheme of adaptation has been implemented into the conceptual model. The conceptual nature of the model presented in this work restricts its applicability to the qualitative investigation of feedbacks in the atmosphere-vegetation system. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Temperature/development relationships and life history strategies of Arctic Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) and their insect parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae and Diptera: Tachinidae), with reference to predicted global warming
SP  - 194
AB  - Increases in temperature and precipitation predicted under global warming are expected to be most pronounced and thus have their greatest impact on ecosystems at high latitudes. Insects constitute a major component of the foodwebs of terrestrial ecosystems and should be among the first organisms to show noticeable responses to predicted global warming, especially in the Arctic where climatic conditions are often limiting. However, interactions among species must also be taken into account. The genus Gynaephora Hübner (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) is represented in North America by two species, G. groenlandica (Wocke) and G. rossii (Curtis), and their geographic distributions overlap broadly across the Canadian Arctic. Both species are found at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, and the population of G. groenlandica at this site is thought to be limited mainly by parasitoid-induced mortality rather than by climatic conditions. Field observations, surveys, and temperature-manipulation experiments were conducted at Alexandra Fiord; laboratory rearing was conducted under controlled conditions at the University of Victoria. Life histories and seasonal phenologies for Gynaephora species and their insect parasitoids were elucidated from field studies, and temperature/development relationships for selected stages of most of these species were derived from laboratory rearing. The results of field studies and laboratory rearing were compared and used to formulate predictions about the responses of these insects to predicted global warming. Seasonal phenologies of the parasitoids provide optimal access to new hosts but parasitoid-avoidance strategies of Gynaephora larvae ensure that a proportion of their populations escape parasitism. Laboratory rearing showed that the relative timing of host and parasitoid seasonal phenologies is maintained over a broad range of temperatures; therefore, temperature increases predicted under global warming are unlikely to have any great effect on host-parasitoid interactions. However, increased cloudiness associated with the predicted increase in precipitation might have profound effects resulting from lower ground-level temperatures caused by a lack of solar heating. The extent of this effect is uncertain but might lead to reproductive failure in Gynaephora species, with similar repercussions for the insect parasitoids. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Evolution and maintenance of sexually selected traits in the lesser wax moth
SP  - 160
AB  - Pair formation of in the lesser wax moth (Achroia grisella) is characterized by male ultrasonic advertisement signals and female orientation toward signaling males. Because a female's opportunity to obtain increased somatic benefits by mating with a particular male is limited, the possibility that females obtain genetic (indirect) benefits by virtue of preferring certain males and male signals was investigated. Controlled breeding experiments demonstrated that in some environmental conditions the offspring of females mating with attractive males matured faster than the offspring of females mating with non-attractive males. However, under other conditions the offspring of females mating with non-attractive males developed faster and heavier than the offspring of females mating with attractive males. These findings suggest that a good genes model of female choice may operate in A. grisella, but the process depends on environmental conditions. Recent studies demonstrate that sexually selected traits in many species have considerable genetic variation, indicating that a substantial amount of additive genetic variance is maintained despite the strong directional (sexual) selection imposed on these male traits by female choice. There are virtually numbers of mechanisms that may possibly contribute to the maintenance of additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits. In this dissertation, the role of environmental heterogeneity in maintaining additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits was investigated in A. grisella. I examined the reaction norms of two genetic groups that were derived through five-generation of artificial disruptive (two-way) selection. Some signal and developmental characters were found to exhibit substantial phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, significant crossover interactions for pulse rate (PR) and maturation duration occurred between the two genetic groups due to their different responses to the various environmental conditions tested. For example, the high PR lines generated relatively faster PRs than the low PR lines at low temperature (22.5°C), whereas under high temperature (30°C), the low PR lines produced relatively faster PRs than the high PR lines. Because PR is one of the important signal characters that contribute significantly to male attractiveness, different genetic groups may be favored in various environmental conditions due to the alternation of selection pressure imposed by female choice. Thus, additive genetic variance of sexually selected traits may be maintained due to the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of environment. Nonetheless, the occurrence of crossover interactions for pulse rate in A. grisella challenges current indirect sexual selection models (Fisherian runaway and good genes) because the fundamental assumption of trait reliability is violated. The mating success of a male will be largely determined by his relative attractiveness to his neighbors. To compete with other males for sexually receptive females, males may modify their acoustic advertisement signals. In this study, I examined the plasticity of acoustic behavior of A. grisella males during signal competition. When a close-range signaler (competitor) was present, males raised their PRs, but they only sustained the elevated PRs for an average of 10 min. The males having low basal PRs increased significantly more in PR than those having high basal PRs. Thus, the signal modification of males during competition may enhance male's attractiveness to females. In addition, the plasticity of acoustic behaviors of A. grisella males may contribute to the maintenance of additive genetic variance for sexually selected traits.

TI  - Genetic polymorphism and adaptation to environmental heterogeneity in an intertidal barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides
SP  - 139
AB  - The northern acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides, was used as an ecological model system to investigate how environmental heterogeneity structures patterns of variation at particular polymorphic loci. Static sampling from a variety of habitat types in nature demonstrated an extremely fine-scaled covariance between genotype and the level of physical stress experienced by barnacles in particular habitat types. This pattern was evident at the locus encoding the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) enzyme, but was not observed at another allozyme locus (Gpi) or a neutral DNA marker (the mtDNA control region). These data implicate balancing selection at the Mpi linkage group. To specifically address this hypothesis, genotype frequencies were documented at multiple time points in the barnacle life-cycle and from various habitat types. The viabilities of the two homozygous Mpi genotypes were habitat-dependent, suggesting that a Levene model of balancing selection maintains allelic variation at the Mpi locus. Furthermore, selection at Mpi was observed to occur as a pulse of genotype-specific survivorship during a two week period immediately following metamorphosis from the larval to the adult phenotype. Experimental manipulations of the level of temperature/desiccation stress in the field created the same pattern of selection for alternative homozygous genotypes in alternative intertidal environments. An experiment conducted in a flowing seawater laboratory demonstrated that the mechanism of selection at the Mpi locus results from the presence of mannose in the barnacle diet and exposure to physiological stress. Mpi homozygotes exhibited significantly different growth rates when cultured on a mannose-enriched diet and exposed to thermal stress. The phenotypic differences between the homozygous genotypes also predicted survivorship in the experimental treatments. The data indicate that homozygous Mpi genotypes differ in their ability to process mannose-6-phosphate in the glycolytic pathway; when individuals shift to anaerobic metabolism as a result of physiological stress, differences in enzyme activity may result in the observed pattern of differential survivorship.

SP  - 151
AB  - Peridotite in the earth's upper mantle undergoes polybaric, fractional melting as it rises adiabatically beneath mid-ocean spreading ridges. As liquid is continually extracted, peridotite becomes increasingly depleted in incompatible components. The amounts and compositions of partial melts of depleted peridotite are important parameters in models of MORB petrogenesis, but have not been well-constrained previously. I present partial melting experiments on a depleted peridotite composition at 10 kbar and 1250–1390°C. My experiments make use of small aggregates of glassy carbon particles into which partial melt is extracted at high temperature. I have been able to analyze low degree partial melts (<10%) and quantify the effects of incompatible element depletion on the melting behavior of peridotite. Special tests of the approach to equilibrium in this study confirm the validity of the aggregate melt extraction technique, which has sparked much debate in the literature (see Chapters 2 and 3 for details). Melts of depleted peridotite differ in important ways from melts of fertile peridotite, mostly due to lower alkali contents and chemical consequences thereof. At low melt fractions, melts of depleted peridotite have less SiO 2, more CaO, and higher CaO/Al2O3 than melts of fertile peridotite at the same melt fraction. According to these results and others in the literature, solidus temperature is a linear function of incompatible major element content. Melt fraction at cpx-out is proportional to normative cpx in source peridotite. Liquid compositions from this study are in good agreement with calculations using the quantitative models of Kinzler and Grove (1992a), Langmuir et al. (1992), and Ghiorso and Sack (1995). Calculations of polybaric, fractional melting of primitive mantle using the models of Langmuir et al. (1992) and Asimow (1997) indicate that about half of all liquid contributed to MORB is formed by partial melting of depleted peridotite. The data presented in this thesis provide information about amounts and compositions of partial melts formed from depleted peridotite, an important upper mantle constituent beneath mid-ocean ridges, and can be used to improve quantitative models of MORB primary magma formation and further our understanding of MORB petrogenesis.

TI  - An experimental evaluation of the benefits and costs of sexual selection
SP  - 51
AB  - An enduring question in evolutionary biology concerns the selective forces behind sexually selected traits. A number of hypotheses have been proposed: adaptive mate choice, self-reinforcing association, pleiotropy, and conflict. Within this dissertation I report on two independent, replicated, experiments, each performed on an outbred, laboratory-adapted, population of Drosophila melanogaster, that test aspects of the adaptive and conflict hypotheses, respectively. In each experiment sexual selection was removed through enforced monogamous mating with random mate assignment, or retained in polyandrous controls. Evolutionary changes between the populations were evaluated after 35–55 generations of exposure selection. In the first experiment I evaluated the opportunity for adaptive mate choice by measuring the rate of adaptation to a novel thermal environment. The populations were exposed to chronic low-grade thermal stress that substantially reduced their reproductive rate. Relative to thermally naive controls, the thermally stressed populations substantially adapted, evidenced through net reproductive rate and its components, total surviving progeny and development speed. Sexual selection had no measurable effect on the rate of adaptation. These results indicate that variation in sexual fitness was largely unrelated to variation in thermal tolerance. In the second experiment I evaluated the cost of sexually selected conflict. Conflict occurs between mates when adaptations benefit individuals of one sex at a cost to their mates. Monogamous mating constrains the reproductive success of mates to be identical, thereby converting any prior conflicts between mates into opportunities for mutualism. Evolution was allowed to proceed under the conditions to which the flies had been adapting for over 200 generations. In the monogamous populations males evolved to be less harmful to their mates and females evolved to be less resistant to male-induced harm. The monogamous populations also evolved a greater net reproductive rate than their promiscuous controls. These results indicate a potentially widespread cost of sexual selection due to conflicts inherent to promiscuity.

TI  - Compensatory Growth, Life-History Decisions and Welfare of Farmed Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) Parr
SP  - 181
AB  - In nature, growth rates are rarely maximised but are instead optimised by natural selection. Compensatory growth, a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom, is evidence of this: when growth conditions improve after periods of poorer than normal growth, many organisms will grow at faster than normal rates. This allows them to achieve a desired body size despite unexpected setbacks in growth. This thesis investigates compensatory growth in the context of social interactions and life-history decisions in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. The fish in the experiments were 0+ parr on an accelerated smolt regime, producing out-of-season smolts ca. 6 months in advance of the natural cycle. In the experiment described in Chapter 2, six groups of individually marked fish were subjected to periods of unseasonably low temperature during successive periods of three or six weeks in the spring. Their growth rates were compared to that of a control group that was not exposed to low temperature. Four out of the six experimental groups showed clear compensatory growth spurts when they were returned to warm water. The mean size of fish in the two groups that did not exhibit compensatory growth was close or equal to that of fish that had already compensated. Thus, fish only initiated a period of compensatory growth if they were below a target size threshold for the time of year. Chapter 3 examines the behavioural mechanisms behind compensatory growth responses. By automatically registering movements of fish that were individually identified with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, the exact feeding and activity patterns of individual fish within groups were recorded over a period of days. While on average growth-compensating fish did not spend more time feeding than controls, they were more aggressive; as a result dominant fish within each group gained more exclusive access to the feeding area during periods of compensatory growth. The extent to which compensatory growth could be achieved was therefore dependent on both the social status of the individual and the dominants' ability to monopolise the food patch. Sexual maturation is an increasing problem in aquaculture due to the use of accelerated smolt regimes, probably because rapid growth rates trigger maturation during a crucial decision period in the spring prior to spawning. The experiment described in Chapter 4 used three groups of parr, exposed to successive three-week periods of low temperature between April and June, in an attempt to reduce the incidence of sexual maturation. There was some evidence that a growth setback caused a reduced and delayed investment in gonads. However, contrary to expectations, the incidence of maturation did not differ between the experimental groups and a control group. Periods of compensatory growth after the experimental groups were returned to warm water may have negated the effects of the low temperature treatment on the decision to mature. In addition, the absence of seasonal cues due to the constant photoperiod may have resulted in a less strictly defined decision window. Sexual maturation and smolting are often considered to be mutually inhibitory processes. However, some mature parr make the decision to smolt and do so with varying degrees of success. The question of whether the fish could undergo the processes of maturation and smolting at the same time was investigated in chapter 5 by following the development of smolt characteristics (smolt coloration and sea-water adaptability) in sexually mature and immature parr.. Smolt characteristics were more developed in immature fish, but nevertheless the mature males did show signs of smolting, and larger mature males could adapt to sea water. I suggest that the inhibition of smolting by sexual maturation is a result of two processes: firstly, that mature parr often do not fulfil the necessary requirements to make the smolt decision; secondly, that in mature parr that do decide to smolt, androgens inhibit or delay the development of smolt characteristics, but do not entirely prevent smolting due to the delay between spawning and emigration. The development of dorsal fin damage, which is primarily caused by aggression, was followed in Chapter 6 in four groups of parr of different mean length. The probability of having fin damage was strongly related to relative body size within each group: the largest fish in a tank were up to six times more likely to have damaged fins than the smallest fish. Studies of small groups of salmonids have demonstrated that subordinates are the main recipients of fin damage, but the present study indicates that the reverse is true in larger groups. This may be because dominant fish compete aggressively amongst themselves and incur fin damage, while less aggressive individuals adopt alternative feeding strategies that reduce the risk of injury. Erosion of the operculae is often seen in cultured fish, but little is known about the causes of the condition. While vitamin deficiency has been implicated in some cases, fish that show none of the other symptoms of vitamin deficiency may still develop opercular erosion. Chapter 7 describes how the development of opercular erosion was recorded in four groups of parr of different mean length. Erosion of the operculae developed during the early summer but healed completely during the late summer and autumn. The larger fish in a tank were generally more likely than smaller fish to have eroded operculae. I suggest that the condition resulted from physical injury caused by aggressive interactions between fish, and that a shift in behaviour with increasing body size reduced the rate of attack on the operculae later in the year, allowing them to recover from injury. The final chapter brings together the findings and concepts of the previous chapters. The implications of the findings for aquaculture are also discussed.

TI  - Studies on artificial parthenogenesis of the commercial silkworm races
AB  - The rate of appearance of Silkworm parthenogenetic eggs was very below in natural state. But induced by physical and chemical factors, certain parthenogenetic eggs and larvae appear. Some fundamental studies on the parthenogensis of commercial silkworm ovarian eggs induced by the hot water which invented by Astaurov, were carried out, The results showed as follows: 1.The parthenogenetic eggs were obtained when these commercial races induced by hot water. But the rate of appearance of parthenogenetic eggs varied markedly according to the traces used. More parthenigenetic were obtained in gybrids. 2.During hot water treatment, the effect of temperature ion the rate of parthenogenetic eggs was more significant than that of soaking time should be kept at 44-46deg C for 14-18minutes. 3.Certain parthenogentic eggs appeared when the treatment was carried out within 48 hrs after the ovarian eggs had been taken out from a female moth. But when the treatment was carried out within 12hrs or 36hrs, the rates of parthenogenetic eggs were higher. 4.During the period from emergence to hot water treatment, two protected method to ovarian eggs. In- body and out-body were taken. The result obtained by the second method was satisfied, the rate of parthenogenetic eggs increased by 5.5% than another method. 5.The hereditary feature of the varieties also affected the rate of apperance of silkworm parthenogenetic eggs. The parthenogenesis has maternal effect, which resulted in the difference of the rate of parthenogenetic eggs between the reciprocal hybrids. 6.After the virginal moth was kept at 4deg C for 3 days or 2 days, they could lay about 30-40% of total eggs within 12 hrs when kept at 25deg C. 7.After the virginal moth was kept at 5deg C for 4 days or 8 days, then transferred them into the environment at 30deg C, the moth could lay about 60-80% of total eggs within 7 hrs. When hot water treatment was taken, more high rate of parthenogenetic eggs could be achieved than the artificial method of intaking eggs from the ovarian. 8.Some materials were obtained by crossing the commercial stocks with PC-43, which was parthenogenetic tine introduced from Russian. Reproduced by parthenegenetic method, the rate of parthenogenetic eggs of these materials maintained at a high and stable level. And the economic characters of them also improved, especially the ratio of cocoon shell. 9.Using parthenogenesis, a new parthenogenetic line was bred out from the chilling and named it PC-W. Even instant acid treatment or acid treatment after chilling was carried out to PC-W, about 30% of larvae hatched out from treated eggs. After several generations, the economic characters of the line were improved. 10.After the ovarian eggs were kept at-11deg C for 30 minutes, 30-50% of total eggs started meiotic parthenogentic development.Alternate abstract:家蚕有偶发性的孤雌生殖，但人为地用理化因素刺激可获得一定比例的孤雌生殖发育卵和幼虫。为提高孤雌生殖技术，并为以后孤雌生殖在家蚕性别控制领域、基因纯化及杂种优势机理等方面的运用研究打下基础，本研究主要运用Astaurov的温汤处理诱导家蚕孤雌生殖方法，对现行蚕品种孤雌生殖的四个方面作了研究，得出的主要结果如下：1.供试的家蚕现行品种都可获得一定比例的孤雌生殖发育卵，但品种间孤雌生殖发生率有较大差异。杂交种的孤雌生殖发生率明显比原种要高。2.温汤处理诱导家蚕孤雌生殖过程中，温度变化对孤雌生殖发生率的影响，显著超过浸渍时间对孤雌生殖发生率的影响。现行蚕品种诱导温度以44-46℃为宜，浸渍时间以14-18min为好。3.卵巢卵取出到温汤处理的时间在48hr内都可得到一定的孤雌生殖发育卵，以经过12hr和36hr处理时孤雌生殖发生率最高。4.处女蛾羽化至处理期间，卵巢卵的两种保护方式即体内保护与体外保护对孤雌生殖发生率有一定差异，体外保护稍优于体内保护。5.品种的遗传特性对孤雌生殖有一定的影响。孤雌生殖具有母本效应，母本孤雌生殖发生率高的，其杂交子代的孤雌生殖发生率也有提高的趋势。6.处女蛾用4℃冷藏3d或2d可促使其在12hr内产下30-40％的未受精卵。7.运用5℃冷藏处女蛾4d后再将其移入30℃高温环境进行刺激,可使处女蛾在7hr内产下60-80％的未受精卵，运用温汤处理诱导，可获得比常规取卵方法更高比例的孤雌生殖发育卵。8.用从俄罗斯引进的无性孤雌生殖系PC-43（中系原种）与现行品种的6个中系原种杂交并进行孤雌生殖继代表明，这些杂交材料在维持比较高的孤雌生殖发生率同时，其经济性状有了较大提高，特另是茧层率提高尤为明显。9.从现行家蚕品种中，筛选出一个无性孤雌生殖系PC-W，通过即时浸酸，冷藏浸酸处理表明，该系孤雌生殖发生率较为稳定且经济性状有逐代提高趋势。10.运用-11℃冷冻未受精卵30min可获得了30-50％的减数分裂发育卵。

TI  - Test of alternative domains of attraction in the dynamics of a fishless oligotrophic lake
SP  - 193
AB  - The theory of domains of attraction (alternative “stable” states) allows variability, thresholds and persistence as integral parts of ecological system functioning. This thesis investigates the potential for alternative domains of attraction in a zooplankton community. Two alternative states have been proposed for the zooplankton community of small fishless, oligotrophic, mountain lakes. In the “competition state”, Daphnia (Cladocera) outcompete solitary rotifers and impede predator recruitment. This state is persistent and resilient to disturbance. In the “predation state”, predation by Chaoborus (Diptera) on both prey types alters community dynamics to favor rotifers over Daphnia. Persistence of the predation state requires reduced prey competition, enhanced young predator recruitment in summer and predator survival in high densities overwinter. I carried out graded field experiments using reduced Daphnia densities and predator additions in the spring to generate and test the predator state. I monitored lake and enclosure communities for three consecutive years using an adaptive sampling concept. Chaoborus recruitment was enhanced in enclosures and the new predator cohorts survived overwinter in high densities. However, developmental delays prior to the winter period prevented persistence of the predator state over several generations. Enhanced predator densities in the spring, as well as cold temperature, delayed Daphnia population onset and increase, which released solitary rotifer populations needed to feed young predator recruits in early summer. However, in the higher predator treatments, both prey types stayed depleted till late summer which resulted in delayed predator development. Laboratory experiments showed that although Chaoborus americanus can pupate at 5°C, they could not metamorphose into adults below 9°C. Cold water can delay their reproductive phase and delay timing of young predator recruitment. I conclude that Shirley Lake, under current nutrient levels, does not have two domains of attraction. Nonetheless the presence of a threshold between states enlarges the window for coexistence of weaker competitors or rare species. Thresholds lead to alternative domains of attraction in some systems, and to transient state in others. From a management perspective, extended transient states can either lead to misleading interpretation and erroneous interventions if permanent changes are expected or be used as tools to produce temporary changes.

TI  - Pyroxene thermometry in chondritic meteorites (BL)
SP  - 1
AB  - Ordinary chondrites experienced various degrees of thermal metamorphism (the petrographic types) once they accreted into the parent asteroid, during the formation of the Solar System. The thermal model for ordinary chondrites is matter of debate: namely, there is some uncertainty as regards number of parent bodies, accretionary history, metamorphic regimes, heat source and thermal structure. This study explores the thermal history of ordinary chondrites through the application of pyroxene geothermometry; data from mineral composition, microstructures and cation ordering, obtained by means of electron microprobe, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, provides new constraints for the parent body thermal model: (1) Ordinary chondrites accreted into parent body at T $<$ 600$\sp\circ$C. (2) The thermal metamorphism is a prograde process (not retrograde). (3) The petrographic types developed through at least different temperature regimes in the ${\sim}900{-}500\sp\circ$C interval, where ${\sim}900\sp\circ$C represents the metamorphic peak. (4) After a diverse high-temperature evolution, the different petrographic types cooled similarly in the ${\sim}350{-}500\sp\circ$C range, likely at rates of 10$\sp\circ$C/ky. Data are discussed in the light of the various parent body thermal models in the literature and favour a thermal evolution either in distinct bodies for each petrographic type, i.e., the "multiple parent body" model, or in km-sized "onion shell-type" bodies, thus much smaller than previously suggested (i.e., $\sim$100 km in radius). A glaciological study of one of the most fertile meteorite concentration areas on Earth, the Frontier Mountain ice field (Antarctica), was undertaken as field work for this thesis. On the basis of data on ice dynamics, a model for the origin of the meteorite concentration is proposed. In particular, data indicates that: (1) The present-day glaciological conditions at Frontier Mountain can fully explain the meteorite accumulation: it is unnecessary to call upon paleo-scenarios, as previously suggested. (2) The accumulation model can be described as "stagnant ice against an absolute and submerged barriers".

TI  - Lipids in cod (Gadus morhua L.) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) eggs, with special emphasis on reproduction and quality
SP  - 60
AB  - Throughout the world, fish provide an source of animal protein. Therefore the dwindling world fisheries are of great concern. Reproduction is probably the most important issue in this respect, and factors affecting reproductive success are of utmost importance to assure sustainable fish populations for future generations. This study focused on comparing Baltic and Atlantic populations of cod and salmon. Landlocked salmon, which has a limnic diet, was also included. The objective of this work was to compare lipid composition of eggs from these three environments and relate it to egg quality. Since the Baltic Sea is heavily polluted, the relation between xenobiotics, and reproductive success was studied. To elucidate the effect of spawning environment on the lipid composition of salmon eggs, river stocks were compared. Dietary effects were studied by feeding females from one environment with food from another. We focus on results related to the biologically important fatty acids 22:6n-3 (DHA) and 20:4n-6 (AA), as well as cholesterol and its oxidation products (COPs). We found: (1) DHA content in cod egg phosholipids was slightly (after at least one gonadal cycle) affected by diet. For salmon, egg DHA remained stable in spite a change of diet. Further, its content was inversely related to river winter-temperature. (2) AA content was related to egg quality in cod and salmon. In landlocked salmon the importance of AA was even larger. (3) Salmon eggs exhibiting the pollution-related syndrome M74 had elevated levels of both DHA and COPs, whereas levels of AA and cholesterol were unaffected. These eggs also had a lower level of the astaxanthin, a potent antioxidant. Based on our findings we suggest that (i) the DHA level is genetically determined and that the difference between salmon stocks reflects an adaptation to temperature. This is supported by studies on importance of DHA in regulating membrane fluidity at low temperatures. (ii) AA, being a precursor of prostaglandins, is essential for the development of normal physiological functions in eggs and larvae. This should be considered when feeding broodstock and juvenile fish. (iii) Elevated levels of DHA in M74-affected salmon may be related to exposure to xenobiotics, which increase COPs contents and decrease antioxidant levels.

TI  - The potential role of parasites and the influence of size on female mate choice of Schistocerca americana and Dichromorpha viridis, with paternity verified via random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDS) technique
SP  - 87
AB  - To examine female mate preferences, crosses with one female and two males of different sizes were assembled. After nymphs hatched, random amplified polymorphic DNA was utilized to assess paternity. Various primers were tested for their ability to yield bands that could distinguish individuals. Of the 75 primers tested, 45 yielded consistent bands. Paternity was assigned if three markers from three primers were shared between offspring and a male. In general, fertilization patterns were consistent with a hypothesis of last-male sperm-precedence. There were some differences in behavior between two types of experiment sets (males were removed after mating or allowed to stay in the cage after copulation). Males of D. viridis mated for a shorter duration and males of S. americana associated (rode the female without genitalia contact) with females when in the presence of other males. These behaviors probably result from the perceived competition that other males pose. Females may be using such behaviors in their favor or may be engaging in cryptic choice for certain males. In a companion study, size of S. americana was found to be heritable from fathers to offspring. Large, heavy males probably have an advantage even if last-male sperm-precedence is the rule. From previous work, large and heavy males were found to obtain more matings in a semi-natural study. In the current study, heavy males were found to incorporate more $\sp{14}$C into their reproductive organs and pass this on to the females during copulation. Females may be using protein donation as a cue for oviposition. To assess the role that parasites may play, a two-year study of grasshopper species was taken. A parasite of the Malpighian tubules, Malameba locustae, was found in both nymphs and adults. Nymphs were infected more than adults, a criterion crucial to Hamilton and Zuk's theory for how female mate preferences should evolve in a system where parasites influence female choice. Thus this parasite-host system would be useful in testing this theory and other theory regarding the role of parasites in shaping sexual selection regimes.

TI  - The effects of food supply and nutrition on black bear reproductive success and milk composition
SP  - 156
AB  - I investigated the relationship between food abundance and black bear reproductive success. Black bear reproductive potential had been hypothesized to be related to natural food abundance in other studies but the effect had not been tested. Pregnant females should select dens of maximum thermal efficiency to conserve body fat used for thermoregulation. If this were so they could allocate more depot fat to lactation. I examined data on natal den type (open nest, brushpile, covered) and subsequent survival of cubs in Massachusetts and Minnesota over 11 and 13 years, respectively. I could not detect any differences in cub survival but the power of tests was low (power = 0.139 to 0.258). I could not predict either litter size or MFYS from environmental and harvest variables. When natural food abundance was low black bears used cornfields intensely and did not differ in body weight from high food years. Litter size and MFYS were related to litter order; first litters were smaller and had lower survival than subsequent litters. Sixty percent of Massachusetts females had their first litter at 3 years old. Twelve of 20 first litters were of single cubs and 10 of 12 first litters were totally lost. I hypothesized that female black bears operated according to the life history theory of tradeoffs between present and future reproduction. Having cubs is not very costly to bears, raising them is. Thus, females had cubs at an early age (3 years old) but often could not find enough food in spring to both lactate and continue structural growth. Thus, first litters were usually lost. I provide the first direct test of the hypothesis of the effect of diet quality on milk composition and cub survival in free-ranging bears. Milk composition differed between years of varying spring diet quality. Milk fat was lower when diet fat was low but MFYS was not different between the high fat and low fat years. I conclude that in Massachusetts, and likely most of eastern North America, natural food abundance has little effect on bear reproduction because bears can access alternate food sources.

TI  - A genetic basis for life history differences among populations of the midge, Chironomus riparius (Diptera: Chironomidae)
SP  - 170
AB  - Laboratory and field experiments were conducted with six populations of Chironomus riparius to test for variation among the populations in life history parameters such as growth, mortality and/or reproductive rates. Egg masses of C. riparius from five field populations and one laboratory population were obtained and used to initiate laboratory cultures for experimentation. Environmental effects on life history variations could be ruled out because experiments were conducted with larvae that had been reared in the laboratory for several generations under identical conditions. Populations were compared under a variety of experimental conditions to test whether they would respond similarly, if genetically similar, or differently, if their genotypes were different. The populations were subjected to a variety of experimental conditions in the laboratory in which temperature and food quality were manipulated. The population collected from Strouble's Creek, Virginia demonstrated a pattern of high growth rate and low mortality rate, while the population collected from the final clarifier at the Madison, Wisconsin sewage treatment plant showed a pattern of low growth rate and high mortality rate. When several populations were transplanted into a high chlorine environment at the Blacksburg, Virginia sewage treatment plant, the population that had been previously exposed to the chlorine showed a significantly lower mortality rate than the other populations. A series of toxicity tests revealed different sensitivities among several populations to an experimental pesticide. Differences among populations were also found in numbers of egg masses produced, numbers of eggs per egg mass, length of time until the onset of adult emergence, and the overall length of the emergence period. The results of this study show the importance of genetic differences among populations of C. riparius. Many commonly measured life history parameters that are usually assumed to vary primarily from differences in environment, have been shown to vary as well from underlying genetic differences between populations. The role of genetics should be assessed, whenever possible, in studies where comparisons between populations of aquatic insects are made, in order to determine the degree to which genetics and environmental variables contribute to observed population differences.

TI  - Evolutionary genetics of the least killifish
SP  - 171
AB  - This research focuses on two separate but related areas of the biology of Heterandria formosa, the Least Killifish. The first involves the genetic covariance structure of thermal stress tolerance and life history traits. The second concerns population structure and gene flow. The conceptual motivation for these studies is the nature of ecological forces responsible for species ranges, and the nature of tradeoffs, if any, between thermal stress tolerance and absolute fitness. To investigate the covariance structure, I conducted two artificial selection experiments. In one, I mass-selected on heat and cold stress tolerance to determine correlated responses in the "opposite" stress tolerance and in a suite of life history traits presumed to affect absolute fitness. In the other, I performed group selection on population size to investigate possible correlated responses in thermal stress tolerance and in life history traits. In the mass selection experiment, there was no direct response to selection on either heat or cold stress, although the results suggest a response in cold stress tolerance in fish from one source population. Source populations (SC and FL) differed in cold stress tolerance, indicative of past adaptive differentiation. In the group selection experiment, two lines selected for small population size responded to selection. There was no correlated response in thermal stress tolerance or in any life history trait, although the lines were differentiated in an unknown trait responsible for timing of reproduction. My initial hypothesis was that populations on the Florida peninsula should be farther from migration-drift equilibrium than populations on the mainland. The evidence did not support this hypothesis. Instead, it appears that populations in the northeastern part of the species range are more recent in origin, and may be farther from equilibrium than populations in the rest of the species range. In addition, the data imply that there has recently been substantial cross-peninsula migration in Heterandria formosa, as evidenced by the better fit of the data to a two-dimensional model of gene flow.

TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of molecular and quantitative genetic variation in ephemeral pond populations of Daphnia pulex
SP  - 124
AB  - I investigated temporal and spatial patterns of quantitative- and molecular-genetic variation using the fresh-water invertebrate, Daphnia pulex, as a model system. First, I performed an experiment designed to reveal environmental and genetic variation for an important fitness trait, diapause termination, in temporary pond dwelling populations of Daphnia pulex. Significant effects of photoperiod and temperature on hatching success were observed in both inbred and outbred sexually produced diapausing eggs. Outbred diapausing eggs had greater hatching success than inbred eggs, indicating the presence of non-additive genetic variation for hatching. Hatching success was greater under environmental conditions mimicking early season conditions in the natural environment. These results suggest that the timing of hatching is an adaptive response to natural selection. I next used a combination of quantitative trait analysis and molecular genetic analysis to examine temporal variation in a natural population. Periods of clonal reproduction lead to a build-up of genetic disequilibrium. Yearly bouts of sexual reproduction changed the levels of expressed genetic variation and mean phenotypic values by reducing genetic disequilibrium. The levels of molecular genetic variation were reduced by clonal selection and restored the following year by the input of variation from a seed bank of diapausing eggs. These results demonstrate that non-additive genetic variation and seed bank effects influence the evolutionary trajectory of temporary pond populations of Daphnia. Finally, I examined quantitative- and molecular-genetic variation among 19 populations of western Daphnia pulex. These populations showed a high degree of spatial differentiation for quantitative and molecular characters. Molecular patterns of variation were used to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis of relatedness among populations. The phenotypic and genetic (co)variance structure of morphological and life-history characters was not constant between populations. The constancy of the (co)variance structure was inversely correlated with the degree of relatedness between populations.

TI  - Mutation and the evolution of age-specific mortality rates: Experimental results and statistical developments
SP  - 393
AB  - Demographic analyses of Drosophila melanogaster allowed to accumulate spontaneous mutations for 10, 19 and 47 generations revealed: (i) significant genetic variance generated by mutation (mutational variance) for age-specific mortality rates early in life, (ii) lower mutational variance at advanced ages, (iii) genetic correlations caused by mutations (mutational correlation) that were positive between ages separated by one or two weeks but declined as ages become further separated, (iv) increased genetic correlations between mortality rates with increased mutation accumulation, and (v) little change in mean age-specific mortality rates under mutation pressure (i.e., little mutational bias). Similar results were obtained for mutations experimentally induced by P-element mutagenesis. Insertional mutations differ from spontaneous mutations in their magnitude but not their age-specificity. Estimates of pleiotropic effects of individual mutations ranged over nearly 10 days (approximately 20–25% of the average maximum lifespan of the lines). Predictions from the two predominant evolutionary theories for senescence, mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy, are tested using mutation data and the observation that mortality rates decelerate and level off at advanced ages. We argue that existing models are not consistent with the data and suggest ideas that might reconcile theory and observation including: redundancy models, heterogeneity models, and positive pleiotropy. Statistical concepts are developed for estimating the influence of environmental and genetic effects on mortality rates. The character process model extends quantitative genetics to function-valued characters (also called “infinite-dimensional characters”) by employing parametric models for covariance functions. This model works better than standard multivariate techniques or fitting orthogonal polynomials. Next, maximum likelihood methods are developed for estimating the parameters of the Gompertz family of age-specific mortality models and comparing the fit of competing models. The statistical power to detect substantial differences in mortality rates is investigated. Lastly, data are examined from experiments that examine the longevity effects of temperature, dietary restriction, laboratory selection, and inbreeding. Novel decomposition techniques show that longevity differences from temperature shift and dietary restriction result predominantly from differences in the rate of increase in mortality with age, while increases in longevity through laboratory selection result predominantly from a reduction in baseline mortality rates.

TI  - Evaluation of Trichogramma ostriniae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) as a biological control agent against the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae): Biological, behavioral and ecological perspectives
SP  - 129
AB  - The biology and behavioral ecology of Trichogramma ostriniae, an introduced egg parasitoid of Ostrinia nubilalis and other lepidopteran species were studied in the laboratory and under field conditions. The inter- and intra-specific discrimination, competition, and the effectiveness of T. ostrinia and T. nubilale were also investigated. For T. ostriniae to complete its life cycle, it took 6.7 days at 33$\sp\circ$C and 20 days at 17$\sp\circ$C. Comparison of several theoretic models indicated that a transformed day-degree model and the Hilbert-Logan model were better for predicting the development of this parasitiod. The wasps reared on O. furnacalis by the seventh generation and at 27$\sp\circ$C had a lower level of parasitism than wasps from other generations and at other temperatures. The differences among generations for the time female wasps spent drumming host eggs did not show any host and generation related trend. European corn borer egg parasitism was positively correlated with egg density. Female T. ostriniae might exhibit the Type II or Type III functional response depending on the temperature. The field data suggested a Type II functional response when data were pooled for all replicates. The effects of weather, plant size, and distribution of egg masses on egg parasitism by the wasp were studied in a sweet corn field. Logistic regression analyses indicated that percentage of eggs parasitized was negatively related to an increase in leaf area and distance of eggs from release point. Eggs on leaves in the upper third of a corn plant received much less parasitism than those on the middle and lower third. Temperature as well as the length of exposure of egg to wasps also affected the level of egg parasitism. Laboratory test on the cross breeding between T. ostriniae and T. nubilale indicated no successful hybridization. The results of the inter- and intra-specific discrimination and competition between the two species revealed that only female T. ostriniae discriminated eggs parasitized by females of the same species. When both species oviposited the same egg, T. ostriniae was most likely to be able to complete development. The level of egg parasitism by releasing T. ostriniae alone was found to be 15% higher than that by releasing T. nubilale alone, and 20% higher than by releasing a combination of the two species. Further analyses using the logistic regression model for independent and correlated data indicated T. ostriniae to be more efficient at discovering host egg masses than T. nubilale. Mutual interference between the two species was the main factor for the lower level of egg parasitism when the two species were released together. The results suggest that T. ostriniae is the better candidate for augmentative releases for control of the European corn borer, and the two species should not be released into a corn field at the same time.

TI  - A comparative study of effects of changing food production system on quality issues in a school foodservice operation
SP  - 226
AB  - Implementation of a cook-chill food production system has been considered an effective and viable means for school foodservice operations to decrease costs and increase productivity. However, there is a lack of consensus among users of a cook-chill system with regard to the ability of the system to achieve these goals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of changing the food production system from a conventional to a cook-chill system on students' acceptance of a selected menu-item, time-temperature control, waste composition, foodservice employees' job satisfaction, and the financial implications in a Midwest school district. One group pretest-posttest repeated measures design was used to test hypotheses. Data about individual plate waste and students' acceptance were collected three times in three elementary schools. The time-temperature history of the test item was monitored, and a waste stream analysis was conducted in the cook-chill system. Employees' attitudes and job satisfaction were measured 4 months before, 5 months after, and 1 1/2 years after the implementation. Financial data for three academic years were compared. There was significantly less percent plate waste of the test menu-item in the cook-chill system than in the conventional system. A significant difference in the average serving size of the test menu-item was found among schools and between the two test periods. All acceptance ratings increased in the posttest for Group A (fourth grade in Phase 1 & fifth grade in Phase 2) and decreased in the posttest for Group B (fifth grade in Phase 1 & sixth grade in Phase 2). There were wide variations in the reheating time and method and also the holding time and temperature among schools and between the two systems. Production packaging waste and food wastes accounted for 76% and 24% of total wastes by weight, respectively, in the cook-chill system. The cook-chill system negatively affected employees' attitudes and did not increase their job satisfaction level 5 months after the implementation. However, the overall employees' job satisfaction significantly $\rm(p\leq.05)$ increased 1 1/2 years after the implementation of the cook-chill system. Significant savings in food cost and labor cost per meal were not observed with the installation of the cook-chill system during the first year of operation. Results of this study do not support some of the perceived benefits of a cook-chill system identified in the previous literature.

TI  - Ecology of the fringe-toed lizard, Uma notata, in Arizona's Mohawk Dunes
SP  - 137
AB  - Uma notata in the Mohawk Dunes had population densities in good habitat of 15-17 lizards/ha. Testis volumes peaked in April-May and declined to low levels by August. Egg production peaked in May during 1995 but did not occur in spring 1996. Minimum convex polygon home range estimates were 530 (±70 SE) m2 for 2 adult males and 228 (±82) m2 for 8 adult females. Adjusted for sample size bias, these estimates were 994 (±422) and 774 (±302) m2, respectively. Subadults had smaller home ranges. Uma notata actively used perennial plants as escape cover, preferentially selecting Ambrosia dumosa. I found significant use of plant materials in Uma notata diet with both ontogenetic and seasonal shifts in proportions of plant items. Their diet included 65 taxa of arthropods from 39 families, along with 13 plant species in 7 families. I also studied survival rates, tail loss, substrate selection, and thermal effects.

TI  - Adaptation to a variable environment: tadpole development strategies in the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) (BL)
SP  - 1
AB  - In Britain Bufo calamita is a threatened species that breeds in ephemeral pools. Although transient, these pools may be predictably variable to tadpoles that can detect changes in proximal cues associated with drying ponds. However, recent shifts in land use have led to unpredictable changes, both in the species' terrestrial environment and the composition of aquatic communities. This anuran is therefore an ideal model for the study of life history variation, with the aim of this thesis to investigate the adaptability of B. calamita tadpoles to conflicting selection pressures.Growth responses of B. calamita tadpoles from populations with a history of competition from B. bufo were the same as those from allotopic populations. Also, despite being vulnerable to predation from Triturus helveticus, B. calamita larvae did not respond to the visual, tactile and chemical cues of a caged newt. Biotic factors can be important regulatory forces; but for species that breed in ephemeral ponds, hydroperiod is the primary determinant of tadpole survival. The effects of density and temperature on the growth of temporally isolated cohorts of B. calamita larvae were investigated in one German and three British populations. The results of these experiments indicate that although both density and temperature regulate growth, temporally separated cohorts only responded differentially to temperature; with growth that was consistent with hypothesised responses to desiccation risk. In replicated ponds, B. calamita responded to desiccating conditions with retarded tadpole growth; but, despite the formation of tadpole aggregations within the sunlit areas of desiccating ponds, they did not display developmental plasticity. Therefore, for species such as B. calamita, the advantages of breeding in highly variable environments may be to exploit predictably transient habitats that are rich in food but low in competitors and predators, rather than evolving plastic responses to desiccation risk.

TI  - The effects of induced triploidy on the reproduction of the rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss) and the nile tilapia (oreochromis niloticus)
SP  - 1
AB  - Triploid rainbow trout produced by heat shock and control (diploid) siblings were raised separately at similar density, feeding and water quality regimes. No significant differences in body weight or condition factors were observed; however the weight of the eviscerated carcass was on average 20% higher (P<0.05) in triploid fish compared to diploid fish at 20 and 44 months post-hatching. The effects of triploidy on males were most evident during the final stages of spermatogenesis; in contrast, the gonadal development of triploid females was affected during its early stages, with the majority of the oogonia (30-70%) remaining within the oogonial clusters. A major finding was the presence of male-differentiating areas in most triploid females examined, which by the end of the sampling period appeared as gonadal hermaphrodites. Testicular weight, gonado-somatic index, sperm cell density and spermatozoa motility were significantly lower in triploid than in diploid male siblings, although some triploid males produced viable progeny when crossed to normal (diploid) females. Characterisation of this progeny by image analysis of nuclear DNA revealed the presence of a near-triploid genome. A single 5 month-old juvenile had developed testes in meiotic phase, providing a first evidence for the generation of limited numbers of viable progeny by autotriploid rainbow trout males. A cytogenetic analysis was carried out on monosex diploid and triploid populations of Nile tilapia. Synaptonemal complex analysis in diploid genotypes revealed the presence of an incompletely paired segment in the terminal region of the longest bivalent in heterogametic (XY) genotypes, which was not observed in homogametic genotypes. This unpaired region provides cytological evidence for the chromosomal basis of sex determination in O. niloticus. Meiotic analysis in triploids revealed the presence of longer (P<0.0001) synaptonemal complexes in heterogametic (XXY) than in homogametic (XXX) genotypes, with a significantly different (P<0.0001) nature of pairing evident between both groups. A model to explain the different progress in gametogenesis observed between male and female teleosts is discussed.

TI  - Regulation of nest construction behaviour and nest development in vespine wasps with special reference to Dolichovespula norwegica and D. sylvestris (BL)
SP  - 1
AB  - The objective of this thesis was to examine various aspects of behavioural regulation of nest construction in Vespine wasps. This was achieved by examining nest structure principally in colonies of Dilichovespual sylvestris and Dolichovespula norwegica at various developmental stages. Some aspects of nest construction behaviour were also examined in Vespula vulgaris.D. sylvestris and D. norwegica were found to have very similar behaviour in fibre selection, pulp processing and paper manufacture. The Doichovespula species were, however, found to exhibit several behavioural differences in paper manufacture to V. vulgaris. Comb and envelope in V. vulgaris were found to be shorter and thicker than those of the Dolichovespula species. Comb and envelope paper was also found to be thicker in V. vulgaris than in D. sylvestris and D. norwegica. The use of short, thick fibres in V. vulgaris led to envelope with a lower tensile strength than that of D. sylvestris and D. norwegica.The ability of the colony to elevate its temperature was found to increase during development, reaching a peak at the start of the production of the reproductives. The colony showed its greatest ability to thermoregulate shortly before the maximum envelope thickness was reached in the nest.Several factors were examined which may limit the ability of the colony to elevate nest temperature. These included the number of workers, eggs, small larvae, large larvae and pupae. Differences between colonies in their ability to elevate nest temperature were only significantly explained by the number of old larvae present.The results presented in this thesis indicate that workers use simple behavioural rules in the regulation of construction of comb, comb supports and envelope. The use of very simple behavioural rules may have penalties to the colony in terms of the adaptability of the nest structure. However they reduce the time spent by workers surveying the nest and processing information.

TI  - Biology, life-tables and prognosis model of the cabbage moth, Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
SP  - 110
AB  - Studies on the population dynamic of Mamestra brassicae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were conducted during 1988-1992 in order to improve forecasting and control. The influence of temperature on development, fecundity and survival were investigated in climatic chambers, and lower developmental thresholds and thermal requirements were established for the preoviposition period and the immature stages. Pheromone traps were tested in cabbage fields at 5 locations in south-eastern Norway during 1989-1991. The trap catches were low at all locations and years, and the traps could therefore not be recommended for practical monitoring. A degree-day model for prediction of favourable times for assessment of infestation level and insecticide application was developed, validated and implemented. Mortality in the immature stages, and larval dispersal, was investigated in the laboratory and in the field. Highest mortality was found in first instar larvae and in hibernating pupae. The mortality in first instar larvae was probably caused by failure to locate and establish feeding sites and predation, whereas the winter loss probably was caused by unfavourable weather conditions. Life tables for five generations of a natural population of M. brassicae on white cabbage in As during 1988-1992 was constructed and analysed. Generation survival was very low, and the key factor was mortality in small larvae. The stage specific mortality appeared to be mainly density-independent. Parasitoids and pathogens were of little importance in controlling the M. brassicae population, although they were more or less persistently present throughout the experimental period. Trichogramma semblidis (Aurivillius) (Trichogrammatidae) was reared from eggs, and Microplitis mediator (Haliday) and Aleiodes (Aleiodes) sp., both Braconidae, were reared from larvae. Erynia virescens (Entomophtorales) was identified in medium and large larvae. Implications of the results in this study for integrated pest management is discussed, and management tactics are proposed.

TI  - Separation of volatile flavor compounds from model orange juice using pervaporation system
SP  - 141
AB  - The manufacture of concentrated orange juice results in major physical and chemical losses of volatile flavor compounds mainly by evaporation. This results in a product with an inferior sensory quality. One method of improving the sensory quality of orange juice is to recover the lost aroma compounds by pervaporation and to feed them back into the final product. The purpose of this study was to investigate the performance of two types of pervaporation membranes and one nanofiltration membrane for the recovery of orange juice aroma by pervaporation. The studies were conducted using a model orange juice aroma solution containing major volatile flavor components reported in the literature. The model orange juice aroma consisted of seven typical aroma compounds at a total concentration of 70 ppm, and the membranes used were polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-1060), poly (dimethylsiloxane) + silicalite (PDMS-1070) and DS-7. Three major parameters, flux, productivity and enrichment factor, increased with increasing temperature. Flux and selectivity showed a dramatic increase in all the components at 70$\sp\circ$C. This increase appears to be resulted from both the activation energy of model components and increased flexibility of the active layer of the membrane. Downstream pressure was the most important factor affecting the performance of pervaporation in this study. Depending upon high (12 in Hg vac.) or low (25 in Hg vac.) downstream pressure, the overall results were remarkably different. Comparison of the three membranes, PDMS 1060, PDMS 1070 and DS-7, showed that PDMS 1070 and DS-7 had higher selectivity but lower flux for non-polar hydrocarbon groups than the PDMS 1060. On the other hand, PDMS 1060 was more selective and permeable for polar groups, such as trans-2-hexenal, ethyl butyrate, octanol and linalool, than the PDMS 1070 and DS-7. Potential use of pervaporation for orange juice aroma compound recovery was verified through this study. This study indicates that aroma compounds, especially volatile flavor and aroma compounds, can be enriched several tens to hundreds of times.

SP  - 62
AB  - Larval, pupal and adult samples of Culoptila cantha, from a large riffle of the Brazos River in north-central Texas from January, 1995 to March, 1997, indicated a predominately trivoltine cycle during both years; the over-wintering generation spanned 6-7 months and warm-season generations spanned 2-3 months. Water temperature thresholds of 22-24 and 27-29$\sp\circ$C appeared to synchronize emergence of the over-wintering and first warm-season generations, respectively; the later warm-season generation emerged asynchronously. Emergence occurred near dusk and peak diel flight occurred within an air temperature range of 15-30$\sp\circ$C. Mean fecundity was highest in March and decreased throughout the summer and fall. Larvae and pupae aggregated on the downstream undersides of clean, 10-20 cm diameter cobbles in the head of the riffle. Eggs, larvae of all instars, larval cases, case reconstruction progression and behavior, pupae, and adults are described.

TI  - Wolbachia symbiosis in the agriculturally-important predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis
SP  - 111
AB  - This study focused on detecting, describing, and evaluating the biological effects of Wolbachia endosymbionts in the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Wolbachia were found in adults and eggs of M. occidentalis using Wolbachia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers which amplify the 16S ribosomal RNA and ftsZ genes. Wolbachia also were found in their prey, the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). Wolbachia DNA from the two mite species was sequenced and compared. Parsimony analysis indicated the mite Wolbachia sequences were very similar to one another and to Wolbachia from insects. Wolbachia DNA could be transiently detected in the uninfected predatory mite Amblyseius reductus Wainstein (Acari: Phytoseiidae) after feeding on infected spider mites, indicating the infection status of any predatory arthropod's diet should be considered before using the PCR to detect Wolbachia. In insects, Wolbachia causes nonreciprocal reproductive incompatibilities in crosses between infected males and uninfected females; the reciprocal crosses are normal. Genetically similar populations of M. occidentalis differing in the presence of Wolbachia (due to heat-curing of one population) were crossed to assess the effects of the symbiont. Wolbachia did induce non-reciprocal incompatibilities in this parahaploid mite, evidenced by significantly fewer viable eggs, higher proportions of egg shriveling as compared to the reciprocal and control crosses, and no or few female progeny. To determine whether the proportion of Wolbachia-infected M. occidentalis in a polymorphic population would increase over time (because infected females can reproduce with both infected and uninfected males), three M. occidentalis populations were initiated with 10% infected and 90% cured mites and monitored for 22 generations. Wolbachia infection did not spread rapidly through the populations. Imperfect transmission rates and fitness costs were detected, which may prevent the rapid spread of Wolbachia. This suggests Wolbachia would not be useful as a "drive mechanism" for inserting useful genes into field populations of M. occidentalis.

TI  - Comparative physiology and macroecology of thermal tolerance in ectothermic vertebrates with correlates of phylogeny and biogeography
SP  - 133
AB  - "Temperature and moisture are the two master limiting factors to the distribution of life on earth" (Krebs 1994). Ecologists have dedicated much study to the understanding of these factors and how they influence species and their biogeography. Organisms have four options in dealing with the climatic condition of their habitats: (1) tolerate the temperature and humidity regardless of possible consequences to fitness, (2) move to more suitable climatic conditions, (3) death, or (4) escape fitness limiting conditions through evolutionary adaptation. It is this forth option which has been one of the primary interests to comparative physiologists and physiological ecologists in explaining (1) how physiological processes function with respect to the environment, (2) how the physiological capacities of an organism enable it to live in conditions not suitable for other species, and (3) how the environment may "fine-tune" or even directionally select for particular physiological processes increasing the relative fitness of future generations. An organism's distribution and geographic range result from physiological tolerances and its ability to adjust physiological processes to maximize survival, growth, and reproduction under a diversity of environmental factors characteristic to its geographic region. This principle has been described by Liebig's Law of the Minimum which states that the distribution of species is governed by the environmental factor for which a species has the narrowest tolerance range or least adaptability. As described, physiological ecologists agree that temperature is probably one of the most pervasive factors in determining the distribution of animals. In this work, I address the importance of species specific thermal tolerance in an attempt to explain some macroecological patterns of distribution among fishes. The first two chapters are an evaluation and review of thermal tolerance in studies of comparative physiology. I measured the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for more than 600 individuals to statistically evaluate the variability associated with the end points loss of righting response (LRR) and onset of spasms (OS) used in determining CTMax. In my review of thermal tolerance, I found 388 of 725 papers to provide data for a historical and taxonomic review with a discussion of various methodologies and uses for the measure of species specific thermal tolerance. In the third chapter, I investigated the correlates between the comparative physiology of thermal tolerance and macroecological patterns of distribution for several fishes found in Oklahoma. Although temperature and the physiological tolerance for changing thermal regimes are major limiting factors affecting species distribution, studies of macroecology have not adequately addressed the relationship between temperature and an organism's geographic distribution. Studies of macroecology often fail to investigate the underlying physiological factors and tolerances that influence animal distribution. This is one of the first attempts to use a "true" physiological parameter in macroecology.

TI  - Consequences of, and opportunities for, genetic differentiation among populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii
SP  - 77
AB  - Herein, I have utilized the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, as a model system for investigating processes of genetic differentiation among populations. First, I performed a set of line-cross experiments under both near-optimal and density-limiting conditions in order to examine the genetic basis of population differentiation. Both dominance and epistasis have contributed to the divergence of fitness (r$\sb{\rm c}$) among ancestral and derived populations, but not between ancestral or between derived populations. The expression of nonadditive effects depends upon the environment in which they are assessed. In conjunction with previous data from W. smithii, these results provide empirical support for Wright's (1977) "shifting balance" theory of evolution. I next completed a survey of allozyme variability within and among 34 populations of W. smithii throughout nearly the entire species range. The location of the margin of the maximum extent of the Laurentide Ice Sheet defines a boundary in the distribution of within- and between- population variability, both of which decline north of this boundary. These results suggest that northern populations are the product of a range expansion which has been recent relative to the establishment of populations south of New Jersey. Patterns of electrophoretic variability are inversely related to patterns of additive genetic variability for the photoperiodic regulation of seasonal development. These results suggest that quantitative genetic measures of variability provide a more accurate assessment of the adaptive potential of populations than electrophoretic or DNA-based biochemical measures. Finally, I performed selection for increased stress tolerance under conditions of thermal and nutrient-limiting stress for approximately 10 generations in order to examine variation in persistence and adaptation among southern, northern, and hybrid populations of W. smithii. One half of the selected lines went extinct. There was no effect of geographic origin or level of hybridization on population extinction. Among the surviving populations, hybridization constrained performance, indicating a latent outbreeding depression that was not apparent in either the F$\sb1$ or F$\sb2$ hybrid generation. Survivorship through heat and desiccation shock was higher in surviving selected lines than in their respective controls. This thesis contains previously published and co-authored material.

TI  - Interactions between cauliflower mosaic virus isolates and Nicotiana species that determines systemic necrosis
SP  - 168
AB  - Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) strain D4 induces a systemic mosaic while W260 induces systemic necrosis in addition to the mosaic symptom in Nicotiana clevelandii. To determine which W260 genes are responsible for the systemic necrosis symptom, I tested chimeric viruses constructed from the D4, W260, and CM1841 strains and found that W260 gene VI elicited systemic necrosis. To investigate the inheritance of systemic necrosis, I crossed N. clevelandii with Nicotiana bigelovii, a host that reacts with a systemic mosaic symptom upon infection with W260. All F1 plants developed a systemic mosaic after inoculation with W260 and the F2 generation segregated 3:1 for systemic mosaic vs. necrosis. These results indicate that the systemic necrosis symptom in N. clevelandii is induced by the interaction of a single, recessive host gene and gene VI of CaMV. Gene VI of CaMV strain D4 has previously been shown to determine systemic infection of solanaceous species including N. bigelovii. Another CaMV strain, CM1841, cannot systemically infect N. bigelovii following a mechanical inoculation, but is capable of recombination with the D4 gene VI coding sequence present in transgenic N. bigelovii and the recombinant is responsible for the development of systemic infection. To study the temporal and spatial appearance of recombinant viruses, I inoculated CM1841 mechanically and by agroinoculation to transgenic and nontransformed N. bigelovii. In agroinoculated transgenic plants, inoculated leaf tissue turned necrotic around the point of agroinoculation. The first leaves to develop systemic symptoms were necrotic in both agroinoculated and mechanically inoculated transgenic N. bigelovii. The predominant type of virus recovered from the inoculated and first systemically infected leaves was the wild type CM1841 rather than a recombinant. A shift in symptom type from necrosis in the lower leaves to a chlorotic mosaic in the upper leaves was associated with the recovery of recombinant viruses, indicating that the recombinants predominated only in later stages of pathogenesis. Necrosis and resistance that comprise a viral hypersensitive response (HR) are traits that are not necessarily linked. Analyses of progenies of crosses between N. glutinosa, N. clevelandii, N. bigelovii, and N. edwardsonii suggest that necrosis and resistance associated with the HR of N. edwardsonii to CaMV strain W260 are two genetically unlinked traits derived from the two progenitor species of this host, N. glutinosa and N. clevelandii, respectively. Also, results obtained with a cross between N. edwardsonii and N. bigelovii suggest that necrosis and resistance associated with the HR of N. edwardsonii can be genetically separated, since the F1 progeny of this cross was resistant to infection by W260, but local lesions were chlorotic, rather than necrotic. In all of the experiments described above, I found that local and systemic necrosis elicited by CaMV isolates in Nicotiana hosts is enhanced under conditions of low light intensity, short days and temperatures of 18-20 C.

TI  - Thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) in south-central Florida
SP  - 103
AB  - During 1994 and 1995, I studied several aspects of the thermal ecology of the gopher tortoise in south-central Florida. My findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Body temperatures of hatchings in laboratory thermal gradients were influenced by hydration and nutritional status. Individuals selected lower body temperatures when dehydrated than when hydrated, presumably to reduce further evaporative and respiratory water loss. Individuals also selected higher body temperatures when fed than when fasted, which may enhance digestion when fed and reduce energy expenditure when fasted. (2) Laboratory studies revealed no effect of ontogeny on heat tolerance or thermal preference. However, radiotelemetry of free-ranging individuals during summer revealed that juveniles apparently thermoregulated less effectively than adults. When preferred body temperatures were physically attainable, such body temperatures were maintained 88% of the time by adults but only 56% of the time by juveniles. Juveniles allowed their body temperatures to stray from preferred primarily during the morning as a result of delayed emergence and at night. Rather than occupy the warmest parts of burrows near the entrance, all juveniles were observed to spend the night at a depth of approximately one meter where they were cooler than preferred but safer from nocturnal predators such as racoons. (3) Gopher tortoises acclimatized to seasonal changes in their thermal environment by modifying their tolerance of high body temperatures. Heat tolerance increased from spring to summer, decreased in fall, and declined further in winter. Lab experiments suggested that proximate stimuli for these changes were temperature acclimation and photoperiod acclimation. Interestingly, tortoises did not exhibit seasonal changes in selected body temperatures when placed in laboratory thermal gradients. In the field, radiotelemetered adults maintained body temperatures within the preferred range $>$80% of the time that it was physically possible throughout the year. This seasonal consistency of thermoregulation was accomplished primarily by modification of basking behavior, with tortoises basking during spring and fall but not during summer. At all times of the year, adults restricted foraging activity to the hottest part of the day. In doing so, they elevated body temperatures to maximal preferred levels by sunset and thereafter maximized nighttime body temperatures.

TI  - The role of adaptation in the establishment in the United States of Brachymeria intermedia (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), a parasitoid of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae)
SP  - 168
AB  - An unresolved issue in classical biological control concerns the importance of adaptation in the establishment of introduced natural enemy species. One theory for the relatively low rate of establishment in classical biological control is that introduced species may lack sufficient genetic variation to adapt to their new environment. The importance of adaptation was investigated in a series of experiments with Brachymeria intermedia (Nees) (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae), a pupal parasitoid of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae). Attempts to introduce B. intermedia from the Mediterranean region into New England on several occasions from 1908 to 1963 were considered unsuccessful until 1965, when establishment was finally confirmed. I tested the hypothesis that introduced wasps adapted to the harsher climate of the northeastern United States in a series of experiments with B. intermedia from several U.S. and European locations. Attempts to cross wasps from Corsica and Massachusetts resulted in mating asymmetry, with matings between Corsican males and Massachusetts females occurring less often than for the reciprocal cross or within-strain crosses. This asymmetry resulted from decreased attractiveness of older Massachusetts females, less aggressive courting of all females by Corsican males, and possibly higher receptivity of Corsican females to courtship by males. Comparisons of oviposition rates of five wasp strains at different temperatures and photoperiods did not yield differences consistent with adaptation hypotheses, though in some respects U.S. wasps were more similar to each other than to European wasps. The strains did differ in ability to survive exposure to subfreezing temperatures, in support of the adaptation hypothesis. Survival was strongly influenced by wasp size (dry weight), suggesting that colder environments select for smaller size. A half-sib analysis revealed no additive genetic variation for weight in reciprocal crosses of Massachusetts and Corsican wasps. However, offspring from different crosses differed significantly in weight and in the proportion surviving freezing, consistent with the adaptation hypothesis and supporting the notion of genetic differences between populations.

AB  - The snapping turtle has a wide geographic range allowing me to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation among embryos and among hatchlings in survival and growth rates, sex and temperature selection in response to temperature and food represents adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity. Each population differed in embryo viability, mass at hatching, and hatching growth rates and survival rates. Hatchling mass and growth rates were greater in the southern populations. Incubation temperatures significantly affected survival rates of embryos and hatchlings, hatchling mass and hatchling growth rates. The northern population had the lowest survival rate at low temperatures contrary to predictions. Food availability did not significantly affect hatchling survival rates. Feeding regime had a significant effect on hatchling growth rates in southern populations. Pivotal temperatures did not vary among populations. Selected temperatures of hatchlings were not significantly affected by population, incubation temperature or food availability.

TI  - Reproductive ecology of Gryllotalpa major (prairie mole cricket)
SP  - 92
AB  - The prairie mole cricket (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae: Gryllotalpa major Saussure) is a burrowing insect native to the tallgrass prairie of the south-central United States. G. major is a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, but not enough information has been available on life history and general ecology to support listing of the species. Males construct specialized burrows from which they call to attract females for mating. I found that these burrows are aggregated in the moist springtime prairie soils. Females fly through the aggregations of burrows and drop to the ground in the vicinity of calling males. Females are not constrained in choosing a mate, and there is variation in the males' calls that is at least potentially available to females for assessing mates. Females enter the males' acoustic burrows and presumably mate there, but burrows are not used for oviposition sites. Males do not sequester resources important to females, and male parental care is not likely. The acoustic-burrow entrance is sealed after a male switches from an advertisement to a courtship call, and sealed burrows are used as evidence of successful mate attraction. Based on these observations and criteria, the species has a classical lek mating system, an essential piece of information for making predictions used in conservation decisions. Sexual advertisement in the form of acoustic display is energetically expensive and in addition to other costs of mating. Call effort is adjusted in some species in response to competition from other males or to changes in climatic conditions. I found that call rate adjustments were made with social interactions and changes in soil temperature, but group size did not have an effect on calling effort in this study. Prairie mole cricket males do not adjust their call intensity in relation to competition, female availability, soil temperature, or soil moisture. Males produced more complex calls in response to closer calling neighbors, but it appears that prairie mole cricket males may selectively respond to only the nearest one to two neighbors. In addition to the advertisement call previously described, I identified courtship and aggressive calls. There is also a substrate component to the advertisement call that may be important in male-male spacing.

TI  - Laser-spark ignition and the nitrogen-hydrogen radical
SP  - 116
AB  - Laser-induced breakdown is studied in ammonia and ammonia-oxygen gaseous mixtures. We investigate the emission spectra of the NH and N$\sb2$ diatomic molecules in pure ammonia optical plasmas using multispecies spontaneous emission spectroscopy. Gas temperatures are inferred in the decaying optical plasma by theoretical reproductions of the experimental spectra. Laser-induced breakdown microplasmas (laser sparks) are used to ignite combustible ammonia-oxygen gaseous mixtures. We determine the minimum ignition energy requirements and laminar flame speeds over much of the flammability limits of these gas mixtures. The experimentally determined flame speeds are compared to theoretical laminar flame speeds. High-speed shadowgraph photography and planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging of the NH free radical is used to study the temporal and spatial development of the optical plasma in combustible and noncombustible ammonia-oxygen mixtures. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal evolution of gas temperature and species concentrations as well as spatial symmetries in the laser-induced breakdown plasma is essential for numerical modeling of laser-spark ignition. Experimentally determined quantities such as temperature, free-radical relative number densities, minimum ignition energies, and flame speeds can be used to validate such models. In all laser-induced breakdown studies, the optical discharge was created by focusing Q-switched Nd:YAG laser 1.064 micrometer wavelength pulses into the gas sample. Focused laser-pulse intensities range from 10's to 100's of GW/cm$\sp2.$

TI  - Evolutionary studies in Batrachoseps and other plethodontid salamanders: Correlated character evolution, molecular phylogenetics, and reaction norm evolution
SP  - 220
AB  - I tested several hypotheses of correlated character evolution in the salamander family Plethodontidae. Using a phylogenetically-based comparative method, I confirmed that genome size is positively correlated with embryonic developmental time, an important life history trait. However, no relationship was found between egg size and developmental time. I estimated phylogenetic relationships within Batrachoseps, a group of eight species distributed along the west coast of North America using DNA sequence data from a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome b. Taxonomy of the group has been difficult because of the high degree of morphological conservatism. Two of the three currently recognized widespread species are shown to contain deeply differentiated, distinct historical units. Relationships among these units are generally congruent with previous hypotheses of relationships inferred from allozyme data. Several cases of incongruence between allozyme and mtDNA data may reflect isolation followed by secondary contact. Taxonomic changes are recommended, resulting in the recognition of a minimum of 20 species. Reaction norms depict the adult phenotype as a function of the environment in which development proceeds. I examined the evolution of a reaction norm, number of trunk vertebrae as a function of developmental temperature in Batrachoseps, using my phylogenetic hypothesis. Number of trunk vertebrae varies at many levels within Batrachoseps. Parallel clines in number of trunk vertebrae occur along an environmental gradient in three taxonomic units in the Coast Ranges of California. Because number of trunk vertebrae is affected by developmental temperature in other vertebrates, I hypothesized that the parallel clines resulted from a shared plastic response to environmental differences. I found extensive variation in reaction norms among population and species, but plasticity was not sufficient to account for the pattern of parallel clines. Plasticity may affect the evolution of traits in two conflicting ways, by facilitating or retarding it. I tested these hypotheses using data on plasticity in number of trunk vertebrae and change in number of trunk vertebrae in nine species of plethodontids. Changes in number of trunk vertebrae occurred more frequently than expected by chance in lineages in which it was plastic. This is consistent with the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity facilitates evolutionary change.

TI  - Genetic relationships among arctic Daphnia: Implications for the origins and evolutionary significance of polyploidy
SP  - 212
AB  - This thesis examines genetic relationships among members of the Daphnia pulex complex from arctic North America to extend our understanding of the origin and evolutionary implications of polyploidy. MtDNA analyses of diploid and polyploid D. pulex clones from a low arctic site revealed that the melanized polyploid clones were divergent from the unmelanized diploid clones and had a mtDNA genome that was more closely related to those of temperate D. pulicaria or D. melanica than to D. pulex. These clones were re-classified as D. middendorffiana because of their hybrid origin. Surprisingly, two unmelanized polyploid clones of D. pulex had a mtDNA genome that was similar to that of a more genetically divergent species, D. tenebrosa. A more extensive arctic survey suggested that two independent hybridization events between refugial races of D. pulicaria gave rise to D. middendorffiana. Results from RFLP analyses at a conserved rDNA region (12s-16s) confirmed that no species of the D. pulex complex other than D. pulicaria was more closely related to D. middendorffiana. Clones of D. tenebrosa from low and high arctic sites clustered into two divergent mtDNA lineages, with no association of haplotypes with geographical location, ploidy level, or pigmentation. The second part of this thesis examines whether polyploid clones are better adapted to low temperature environmental stress than their diploid counterparts. Life history experiments revealed that polyploid clones of D. middendorffiana had lower fecundity, larger egg and offspring, and larger body size than their diploid counterparts at high temperature. They also showed a tendency to mature at an earlier age than the diploids at low temperature. Three polyploid clones were outcompeted by a diploid clone from Churchill at 20$\sp\circ$C. By contrast, two out of three polyploid clones outcompeted a diploid clone from temperate areas under the same temperature. Polyploid clones had higher survival at both low temperature and high salinity than diploid clones but lower survival under high temperature. The molecular results have shown the importance of hybridization for the generation of polyploidy in Daphnia whereas the ecological results have provided an important explanation for the prevalence of polyploids at arctic sites.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a temperature sensitive lethal (TSL) genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wied.)
SP  - 272
AB  - A genetic sexing strain Toliman-TSL of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wied.) (Diptera: Tephritidae) has been created for the purpose of sterilization and release in Guatemala. It has been evaluated by tests both in the laboratory and in the field. The strain is based on the Vienna-TSL strain, which incorporates a temperature sensitive lethal gene (tsi) linked to the gene for white pupa (wp) on chromosome 5. Females of the strain are homozygous for this lethal; males are heterozygous for wp tsl. They carry a 5-Y translocation (T(Y;5)1-61) bearing the wild type alleles of wp and tsl. To create Toliman-TSL both wp tsl and T(Y;5)1-61 were separately introduced into a Guatemalan genetic background. Recovering the wp tsl homozygote was difficult, requiring 11 generations of crosses. The strain yields only males when the temperature is raised from 25°C to 33°C. Careful regulation of rearing densities in normal factory production is essential to avoid overheating and to ensure good quality flies. On this basis the ideal 'seeding rates' of eggs were worked out, which could be three times higher in larval cultures destined to produce males-only for release. In tests to investigate sensitivity to gamma radiation from a CSi37 source, where pupae were exposed under conditions of anoxia, it was found that a 100 Gy of gamma rays gave more than 9 9% sterility and 150 Gy, 99.7% sterility. Quality parameters (adult emergence, adult longevity, adult size, flight ability, mating index) were only affected by irradiation in two instances: (1) adult emergence was depressed in Vienna-TSL after exposure to 40 Gy and above (2) flight ability in the Petapa (standard) strain was depressed by exposure to 150 Gy. Both TSL strains showed significantly lower adult emergence and flight ability than Petapa, but significantly greater weight and greater longevity when deprived of food. Study of the response of Vienna-TSL to substerilizing doses, showed transmission of partial sterility into future generations (5 generations investigated) after exposure to 40-80 Gy. At a 100 and 120 Gy exposures, transmission could not proceed beyond generation 1. Toliman-TSL has been introduced twice into mass production, the first time in '94-'95, breakdown occurred within 6-7 generations. In the second period of culture ('95-96), there have been less than 1.3 % aberrant pupae (brown females, white males) for up to 12 generations. The strategy and procedure for factory strain replacement is discussed. Toliman-TSL was evaluated for mating competitiveness in field cages and for dispersal in the open, both in a coffee plantation. Toliman-TSL males were twice as effective as feral males in mating with feral females, and superior to Vienna-TSL males. In field releases, both Toliman-TSL and Petapa disperse about the same and slightly further when females were absent. In much larger field releases, Toliman-TSL males induced measurable sterility in eggs sampled from coffee beans, reaching an average of 34% in the final 3 weeks of a 13 week release period. In a parallel trial Petapa releases (males plus females) produced hardly greater sterility than in a control area with no releases. Trapping showed that Toliman-TSL males were more readily caught than Petapa. It was concluded that Toliman-TSL was several times more competitive than the standard strain and that its use for SIT control was possible.

TI  - Natural variation within a clock gene of Drosophila melanogaster: A phenotypic and molecular analysis
SP  - 252
AB  - The clock gene period encodes a repetitive series of Threonine-Glycine (Thr-Gly) pairs in D. melanogaster. This sequence is polymorphic in length and shows a clinal distribution in Europe, whereby the shorter length variants are more frequent in warmer regions and the longer ones in colder areas. A series of new correlations performed with the European population data suggests that thermal selection may be a factor in generating the cline. DNA sequence analysis of various Thr-Gly haplotypes supports a model where the (Thr-Gly)20 and (Thr-Gly)23 alleles are considered as ancestral, since all variants can be derived from them. A reciprocal dine is observed for the (Thr-Gly)20 length valiant in eastern Australia, suggesting that selection may be maintaining the polymorphism, and a further correlation of temperature with allele frequency suggests, as in European populations, that the dine may be thermally mediated. However, the other major allele the (Thr-Gly)17 was spatially homogenous. The temperature compensation of the dock was examined by investigating the freerunning locomotor activity cycles of different natural Thr-Gly length variants from Europe and Australia. A relationship between Thr-Gly length and temperature compensation which could help explain the continental spatial differences was observed. Locomotor activity profiles in light/dark cycles were also examined in the European variants, and revealed subtle phenotypic differences between the Thr-Gly length variants that could also contribute to the observed clinal patterns. The energy expenditure of different Thr-Gly length variants was also measured and revealed behavioural adaptations for possible fitness advantages. Throughout the behavioural analyses there was also evidence that the structural (Thr-GIy)3 motif played an important role in the temperature compensation mechanism and energy expenditure of the fly.

TI  - The biology of Sargochromis codringtoni (Boulenger, 1908) in Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe
SP  - 286
AB  - The biology of Sargochromis codringtoni in Lake Kariba has been investigated and is described. The diet of S. codringtoni was examined by analysis of stomach contents from the juvenile to the adult stage. A size related dietary shift was evident. The diet of juveniles was dominated by planktonic Crustacea and chironomid larvae. Sub-adults feed primarily on pulmonates, whilst the diet of the adult fish is dominated by prosobranchs. Predator-prey data on adult fish was subjected to analysis of indices of electivity and the values indicated that there was negative selection against bivalves. Prey selection experiments confirmed this result as the fish showed no particular preference for any particular snail species but avoided the bivalves. The anatomical features related to feeding showed that S. codringtoni is well adapted to handling a molluscivorous diet. Gastric evacuation and food consumption were estimated on three different occasions characterising three seasons. The gastric evacuation curve was a decaying exponential and gastric evacuation rates ranged from 0.0743gh$\sp{-1}$ at 19$\sp\circ$C to 0.401gh$\sp{-1}$ at 29$\sp\circ$C. S. codringtoni consumed 4.45%-13.96% of its body weight a day depending upon temperature.

TI  - Clonal diversity and individual adaptability in two colonizing parthenogenetic insects
SP  - 110
AB  - This thesis deals with the characteristics of two successfully invading and colonizing parthenogenetic insects, the greenhouse cockroach, Pycnoscelus surinamensis and the spearwinged fly, Dipsa bifurcata. Many parthenogenetic species are geographically more widely distributed and ecologically broader than their sexual relatives. This success in colonizing and invading abilities has partly been attributed to the existence of broadly adaptable genotypes, which are able to survive and reproduce under a wide range of environmental conditions. The evolution of such "general purpose genotypes" is discussed and currently used methods to estimate environmental adaptability and environmental sensitivity are evaluated. The hypothesis that successfully invading clones of the parthenogenetic cockroach P. surinamensis consist of general purpose genotypes is tested by comparing temperature tolerance and desiccation resistance among clones of P. surinamesis and its sexual ancestor, P. indicus. The results suggest that there is no single set of life history traits with respect to temperature tolerance and desiccation resistance that characterizes all of the successfully invading clones. Most parthenogenetic species are composed of several clones and clonal coexistence is, contrary to theoretical predictions, common among parthenogenetic populations. Clonal diversity and the dynamics of clonal coexistence were investigated in seven populations of the parthenogenetic fly Dipsa bifurcata by electrophoresis. Environmental factors affecting clonal dynamics are discussed and related to ecological and genetic characteristics of the different populations. Temporal variation in clone frequencies for four of these populations were monitored over seven years and the fluctuations were analyzed and related to estimated fitness differences among clones. The frequency changes were cyclic and synchronous for all populations and corresponded to the seasonality of the environment. The seasonal fitness variation among clones suggests the presence of a seasonal niche separation which could act as a mechanism promoting clonal coexistence.

TI  - Consequences of temperature, viscosity, and small size for early life-history processes in the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus
SP  - 146
AB  - I examined two implications of size for early life history stages of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. First, ciliated larvae operate at a physical scale where movement is strongly influenced by the viscosity of sea water. Experiments uncoupled two confounding effects of temperature on larval swimming and feeding: direct effects on physiological processes, and indirect effects on mechanical processes due to changes in sea water viscosity. To separate these effects, I manipulated sea water viscosity through (a) temperature change and (b) addition of biologically-inert polymers. An environmentally relevant, 10$\sp\circ$C drop in water temperature reduced swimming velocity by 40%, water movement by 35%, and suspension feeding by 67%. Viscosity change was sufficient to account for 40%, 55%, and 60% of these reductions in rates, respectively. Much of the effect of temperature was therefore explained by mechanical effects of the external environment. High viscosity also shifted ingestion toward larger particles. These results underscore a problem of using temperature coefficients, such as Q$\sb{10}$'s, to infer effects of temperature on physiology. Second, larger free-spawned eggs present a larger target for sperm, but afford lower fecundity. To determine whether the fertilization benefit of large size offsets the fecundity cost, I analyzed zygote production as a function of egg size using a model of fertilization kinetics. For eggs of constant organic density, zygote production decreases as a function of egg size, regardless of sperm concentration. Zygote production is predicted to increase, however, as eggs are enlarged through hydration or through addition of a low-cost accessory structure. In D. excentricus, removal of the egg jelly coat reduced fertilization rates. The kinetics model indicated that 53% of this reduction could be accounted for by the change in target size, and 23% by the change in density. Selection experiments with untreated eggs confirmed that larger targets are favored in fertilization. The ovum has 70 times the organic density of the jelly coat. Thus, addition of a jelly coat weakens the life-history tradeoff between target size and fecundity. Accessory structures could allow the production of energetically smaller eggs by reducing the fertilization cost associated with small egg size.

TI  - Host exploitation at low temperatures by Trichogramma minutum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae): Heritability estimates, selection, and the effect of selection on associated biological characteristics
SP  - 89
AB  - Females of Trichogramma minutum Riley were found to have significant mean heritability (h$\sp2$ = 0.43) for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C. This indicated that host exploitation could be improved by selection. The applied artificial selection over 8 generations doubled the parasitoids ability to exploit hosts at 15$\sp\circ$C. This result remained stable for two generations after selection pressure was removed; gains were again achieved when the selection pressure was reapplied for an additional three generations. The average realized heritability for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C decreased from 0.35 to 0.09 over 8 generations of selection. This suggested that directional selection of parents in each subsequent generation reduced the amount of genetic variation. The proportion of females parasitizing the host at 15$\sp\circ$C was significantly different between selection and control lines suggesting that this trait was improved indirectly during selection for host exploitation at 15$\sp\circ$C. Rearing Trichogramma at 25$\sp\circ$C did not decrease its ability to parasitize hosts at low temperatures. This is important for mass rearing of Trichogramma because females of Trichogramma reared at 25$\sp\circ$C have a faster developmental rate, higher emergence rate, fecundity and sex ratio than those reared at 15$\sp\circ$C. The results suggested that host exploitation at low temperature can be improved in Trichogramma and this will have a significant impact on its use for biological control in cooler climates.

TI  - Biological and geographical limits on the production dynamics of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) on the southwestern Scotian Shelf
SP  - 156
AB  - The interrelationship among stock abundance, spatial distribution, growth and recruitment for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) on the southwestern Scotian Shelf was assessed using data from standard bottom trawl surveys conducted by Canada (1970-92) and the United States (1963-86). Recent studies using survey data to describe interannual variation in the the spatial distribution of marine fish stocks have yielded contradictory results. Several sources of imprecision and bias in these distributional indices were identified which limited their utility for describing the geographic response of groundfish stocks to changes in total abundance. An improved modelling approach was developed which described the statistical relationship between total abundance-at-age and local density of juvenile haddock for sub-areas of the stock range. Systematic variation among sub-areas in parameter estimates of the model was consistent with density-dependent habitat selection: juvenile haddock responded to increases in total abundance-at-age by increasing their local density in sub-areas where they were absent or scarce when abundance was low. A distinct spatial gradient in growth of haddock was also evident with individuals resident in the Bay of Fundy being larger than their counterparts on the southwestern Scotian Shelf. This difference necessitated partitioning the survey data into two subcomponents for the analysis of interannual variation in growth. Both stock abundance and bottom water temperature influenced interannual variation in growth of haddock, however, their relative importance depended on the time period, subcomponent, and age-classes considered. Growth of juveniles on the southwestern Scotian Shelf varied inversely with stock abundance. Body size characteristics of adult haddock on the southwestern Scotian Shelf were positively correlated with recruitment which suggests that interannual variation in population fecundity may be an important source of recruitment variation. A simulation example suggested that estimates of spawning stock biomass are not proportional to population fecundity which could explain the widespread lack of correlation between spawning stock biomass and recruitment.

TI  - Evolutionary trajectories in recently established populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)
SP  - 94
AB  - The evolutionary implications of establishing refuge populations for rare species have received little attention. One means by which evolutionary trajectories may be altered is if genetic variability is lost in refuge populations. I examined allozyme variability at 16 loci for western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) populations with known histories of introduction. Translocations had little effect on genetic variability as measured by heterozygosity. However, refuge populations had considerably lower levels of allelic diversity than parental populations. All losses were of relatively rare alleles (frequency less than 0.1 in parental population). These losses were probably due to an undocumented bottleneck early in the introduction history. A literature review revealed that genetic variability is often reduced in refuge populations, typically involving the loss of alleles. Such losses are important as they may compromise the evolutionary potential of these populations. Populations may also experience rapid evolution in life history traits when introduced to novel environments. I described life history traits for four recently established populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Female mosquitofish from thermally stable habitats, Bonham and Garrett, were characterized by delayed size at maturity, high fat content, and large embryos. In contrast, females from a thermally unstable habitat, Wabuska, were characterized by maturity at small size, low fat content, and small embryos. Females from Parker, a warm spring, matured at an intermediate size, had low fat content and large embryos. These differences are of interest because these populations shared common ancestors in 1937. To test whether these differences in traits were due to plasticity or rapid evolution, captive populations from the four study sites were maintained under common-garden conditions for two generations. No population differences were observed for reproductive traits, including reproductive allocation and embryo weight. Fat content was significantly different among populations in the common-garden experiment. In both the common-garden and in the field, Wabuska females matured at significantly smaller sizes. The observed variation in the field reflected plasticity for reproductive traits, but rapid evolution has apparently occurred for size at maturity and fat storage for these recently established mosquitofish populations. The conservation implications of these results are discussed.

TI  - The economic impact of climate change on India's agriculture
SP  - 199
AB  - It is widely held that the current rate of increase in $\rm CO\sb2$ production from human sources will lead to climate change. This dissertation uses an economic model to analyze the effects of that climate change on the agricultural sector of a country, India. This dissertation distinguishes itself from other studies by attempting to capture farmers' capacity for adapting to a changed climate. More precisely, the profit-maximizing framework is used to describe farmers' behavior in the presence of rainfall, among other variables. Only rainfall is chosen as a climatic variable as it is said to be the limiting input to Indian agriculture. India is chosen because its agricultural sector is large and covers various climates. This variety of climates serves to capture Indian farmers' adaptability to climate change. The model, a series of crop-supply and input-demand equations, is estimated with cross-sectional and time-series data. The equations are then re-computed for the new levels of technology and rainfall that are predicted to occur when ambient $\rm CO\sb2$, levels are double their current values. The model omits the effect of changes in temperature, which is predicted to rise. Higher temperatures will reduce yields; the direct, fertilizing effect of higher $\rm CO\sb2$ levels should, however, more than offset the reduction in yields. Nevertheless, the model predicts that changing rainfall levels, resulting from $\rm CO\sb2$ doubling, lead to an increase in the production of rice and potatoes, to a decrease in the production of many staples and to an increase in the demand for all inputs. When technology is allowed to change as well, then the model predicts increases in the output of most crops and in the demand for labor and materials. These results are sensitive to the forecast period, which is determined by the time it takes for $\rm CO\sb2$ levels to double. Higher population levels, predicted to occur at the time of $\rm CO\sb2$ doubling, will absorb almost all the increase in agricultural production. The increasing demand for labor in the agricultural sector, resulting from climate change, will absorb a large part of the increase in population.

TI  - Dormancy of Heterodera glycines in Missouri
SP  - 81
AB  - A two-year study was conducted in field microplots to determine the relative importance of soybean phenology and soil temperature on the induction of dormancy in soybean cyst nematode, Heterodera glycines. Infested microplots were planted with near-isogenic soybean lines (selections from 'Clark') differing for date of maturity. Eggs of H. glycines, extracted from cysts collected monthly from each microplot, were used in hatching tests and bioassays to determine dormancy. Egg-hatching and J2-infectivity rates decreased beginning in July, indicating dormancy induction. Hatching rates were not related to soil temperature, and did not differ consistently among soybean isolines. The monophasic changes in all nematode responses (hatching, infectivity, and reproduction) with peak mid-summer rates suggest that H. glycines produces one primary generation per year under central Missouri conditions. Changes in hatching rates and the timing of minimum and maximum rates suggested that H. glycines eggs exhibit more than one type of dormancy. Trehalose accumulation occurs during dormancy induction in other nematode species, and its use as a marker for dormancy of H. glycines was investigated in a two-year field microplot experiment. Changes in the glucose, trehalose, total protein, and glycogen contents og eggs retained within cysts were monitored monthly. Trehalose accumulation was highly negatively correlated with soil temperature. Thus, trehalose accumulation is not a useful marker for dormancy in contrast to dormancy induction, which was temperature-independent.

TI  - Characterization of acute and chronic toxicity of fluoranthene and the potential for acquisition enhanced tolerance in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)
SP  - 166
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine if fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, can evolve tolerance of exposure to fluoranthene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. A population of fathead minnows was acutely exposed to fluoranthene in the presence of UV radiation. Survivors were allowed to recover and then bred to produce a putatively more tolerant F$\sb1$ generation. Fish from the selected population had significantly shorter LT50 values and reduced swimming capacity compared to wild fish. Genotype at the Gpi-2 (glucosephophate isomerase) locus was significantly related to time to death in all acute exposures, including those conducted in a chronic experiment. These results are likely explained by an opercular deformity which was apparent in 33% of the F$\sb1$ treatment fish and in 34% of their offspring. Shifts in genotypic frequencies were not apparent in the selected population. A separate population was chronically exposed over an entire generation. Compared to a control population maintained identically except for the exclusion of fluoranthene, egg production (33% reduction), hatching success (21% reduction), and larval survivorship (37% reduction) were significantly lower in this population. Enhanced tolerance was not apparent in LC50 determinations, although an examination of the concentration-response distribution suggested an adverse effect due to egg and larval exposure to fluoranthene prior to the test. However, LT50 values indicated that the exposed population was approximately 30% more tolerant. Egg production by F$\sb1$ fish, the production of the F$\sb2$ generation, was not significantly different for the treatment and control fish. There was a 12% difference in genotypic frequency at the PGM locus between F$\sb1$ treatment and control fish. Accidental loss of parental fish precluded a comparison between generations. There was no significant difference between swimming fatigue times for exposure and treatment F$\sb1$ fish swum at several temperatures. These results indicate that Gpi-2 genotypes differ in their tolerance of acute exposure, that acute exposure of fathead minnows can cause morphological deformities, that chronic exposure can hinder reproduction, and that fathead minnows can evolve tolerance of future. These results also suggest that swimming performance is not altered by this acquisition of tolerance.

TI  - Body size and proportions in the Late Pleistocene Western Old World and the origins of modern humans
SP  - 427
AB  - Predictions derived from two competing models of modern human origins, "Replacement" and "Regional Continuity", were tested using osteometric and femoral cross-sectional data reflective of body size and proportions for Late Pleistocene and recent humans from Europe, Africa and the Near East. Specifically, given a strong genetic component and low selective rates on the features studied, Replacement predicts the earliest modern humans in higher latitudes will exhibit a tropically-adapted morphology (assuming Africa was the center of the hypothesized single origin); later humans in these regions will have evolved more cold-adapted proportions. Regional Continuity, on the other hand, permits only minor shifts in body shape, due to climatic change and/or improved cultural buffering. Univariate, regression and multivariate analyses of both raw and "log shape" data reveal a close morphological affinity between the early modern Europeans (EUP, $\geq$ 20,000 BP) and recent Africans. Like Africans, the EUP sample had long limbs (particularly distal segments), relatively smaller joints and relatively short and narrow trunks. Allometric effects may account for the trunk shape features, but the other features either violate allometric expectation or are isometric. Thus, allometry alone cannot account for EUP body shape. Two ordination methods (UPGMA clustering and principal coordinates analysis with minimum spanning tree) of log shape data group the EUP sample mean with recent Sub-Saharan and/or North Africans. Principal components analysis of log shape data reveals that most EUP specimens fall within the recent Sub-Saharan African range of variation. However, most fall within the recent European range of variation, as well, albeit at the extremes of that range. Other fossil groups cluster as follows: European Late Upper Paleolithic (LUP) and Mesolithic specimens cluster with recent Europeans, European Neandertals are "hyper" cold-adapted, and thus different from all recent groups, Late Pleistocene North Africans cluster among recent North Africans (excepting the Jebel Sahaba sample, who have Sub-Saharan affinities), and there is some suggestion that the small Skhul/Qafzeh sample has Sub-Saharan affinities. These results are interpreted as evidence for a lack of local continuity associated with the origins of modern humans, at least in Europe. These data do not, however, preclude the possibility of some (albeit small) contribution of genes from Neandertals to succeeding populations, as is postulated in Brauer's "Afro-European Sapiens" model.

TI  - Nonequilibrium flows with smooth particle applied mechanics
SP  - 199
AB  - Smooth particle methods are relatively new methods for simulating solid and fluid flows though they have a 20-year history of solving complex hydrodynamic problems in astrophysics, such as colliding planets and stars, for which correct answers are unknown. The results presented in this thesis evaluate the adaptability or fitness of the method for typical hydrocode production problems. For finite hydrodynamic systems, boundary conditions are important. A reflective boundary condition with image particles is a good way to prevent a density anomaly at the boundary and to keep the fluxes continuous there. Boundary values of temperature and velocity can be separately controlled. The gradient algorithm, based on differentiating the smooth particle expressions for (u$\rho$) and (T$\rho$), does not show numerical instabilities for the stress tensor and heat flux vector quantities which require second derivatives in space when Fourier's heat-flow law and Newton's viscous force law are used. Smooth particle methods show an interesting parallel linking them to molecular dynamics. For the inviscid Euler equation, with an isentropic ideal gas equation of state, the smooth particle algorithm generates trajectories isomorphic to those generated by molecular dynamics. The shear moduli were evaluated based on molecular dynamics calculations for the three weighting functions, B spline, Lucy, and Cusp functions. The accuracy and applicability of the methods were estimated by comparing a set of smooth particle Rayleigh-Benard problems, all in the laminar regime, to corresponding highly-accurate grid-based numerical solutions of continuum equations. Both transient and stationary smooth particle solutions reproduce the grid-based data with velocity errors on the order of 5%. The smooth particle method still provides robust solutions at high Rayleigh number where grid-based methods fails. Considerably fewer smooth particles are required than atoms in a corresponding molecular dynamics simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection. Nevertheless, the smooth particle trajectories are essentially Newtonian trajectories, for particles with mass m, subject to an effective potential function 2Pn-$\sp{-2}$w(r). Accordingly, high-pressure subsonic problems, with v$\sp2$ $<<$ c$\sp2,$ cannot be reliably solved using this method. A further limitation of the method is its inability to treat free surfaces accurately. Not just subsonic flows can be treated. Shock waves propagate very well in smooth particle systems. For the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability problem with a small amplitude interface perturbation, compared to the wavelength, the interface amplitude grows linearly and the growth rate agrees with the analytic value within 3%. The smooth particle method promises to be of special interest whenever it is desirable to include fluctuations. Smooth particles also provide an interesting eddy viscosity for use in turbulence studies.

TI  - The reproductive behavior and ecology of the tidewater goby Eucyclogobius newberryi (Pisces: Gobiidae)
SP  - 230
AB  - The tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) is an endangered fish restricted to California's coastal estuaries. I conducted field studies of two populations in north-central California over three years (1991-1994) to investigate population dynamics, reproduction and feeding ecology. I also investigated the tidewater goby's unusual sex-role reversed mating behavior, in which females compete more intensely than do males for access to mates. Tidewater gobies inhabited coastal lagoon, creek and brackish marsh habitats, preferring shallow slack-water areas. Fish and eggs were collected over a wide range of salinity (2-27 ppt) and temperature (9-15$\sp\circ$C). Fish from marsh habitats were larger, which may reflect better food resources or longer lifespan. Clutches averaged 300-500 eggs, with the largest clutches collected from the Pescadero population and from marsh habitats. Marshes may therefore be important habitats to conserve. Tidewater gobies preyed opportunistically on benthic invertebrates, principally ostracods, chironomids and Corophium amphipods. Observations of feeding behavior suggested that habitat differences in diet could reflect substrate differences. Juveniles fed at all hours while adults fed primarily at night, but their diets did not differ. Although spawning could occur in any month, it peaked in spring, with a smaller peak in late summer. Both sexes spawned repeatedly and most adults died after the spring spawning season. Laboratory and field observations revealed that the tidewater goby is moderately sex-role reversed. The male constructed a burrow in sand, where he cared for the entire clutch of a single female. Although males defended territories and courted females, females displayed more striking nuptial coloration, fought more intensely for mates and often initiated courtship. The potential reproductive rate of females was 1.24 times greater than that of males. According to sexual selection theory, this should produce a female-biased operational sex ratio and thus result in more intense sexual selection pressure on females. Experimental manipulation of the sex ratio revealed that individuals adjusted their behavior according to the local sex ratio, not the population sex ratio. Mating success was influenced by courtship behavior and female nuptial coloration, but not by intrasexual competitive behavior or body size.

TI  - Muscle growth, development and enzyme activity in cold and warm water fish species exposed to different temperatures
SP  - 1
AB  - The purpose of this thesis was to compare muscle growth, development and metabolism in fish that have been adapted through the process of evolution to different thermal conditions. For each species a "natural" thermal regime was compared with a thermal extreme.The developing fish, optimum temperature for myofibre hyperplasia and fast muscle growth is within the thermal range of the spawning season for each species. As a result, total muscle growth is impaired when thermal regime differs from that found in the natural habitat for each species.In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar, L.), a cold water species, increasing the temperature above the "natural" thermal range resulted in impaired myogenesis and growth, while in tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus, Peters), a tropical species, decreasing the temperature below the optimum "natural" thermal range resulted in decreased muscle fibre hyperplasia and growth.In Atlantic salmon (newly hatched and juveniles) and tilapia (fry and juveniles) fast growth is related with an increased activity of the respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) in relation to the activity of the glycolytic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of their axial muscle tissue.At the coldest temperature of the thermal range of tilapia, activity of CCO does not increase, indicating a lack of a capacity to compensate for the Q10 effect of temperature on the rate of aerobic metabolism. In sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax, L.), which is a eurythermic fish species, cold acclimation resulted in some changes in the ratio of mitochondrial enzyme activity and the ratio of LDH:CCO, indicating that in each species the response of fish muscle to thermal acclimation can vary.

TI  - Advanced melting systems for nickel base superalloys
SP  - 1
AB  - A literature review detailing the materials properties required for the latest generation of aero-engines has highlighted the need for "clean" nickel-base superalloys. The difficulties of assessing "clean" alloys has been reviewed as has literature dealing with current commercial melting systems for these alloys. A detailed assessment of literature on ingot production and refining by Electron Beam Cold Hearth Remelting (EBCHR) has also been carried out. This ascertained that low density inclusions (LDI's) can be eliminated in the hearth by surface tension, gravity and the effects of the high vacuum.Based on the literature reviewed and historical experience at INCO ALLOYS LIMITED, a programme of trials was designed to evaluate the viability of producing semi-commercial scale ingots by EBCHR in three nickel base alloys with the required cleanness and mechanical properties.Ingots of 250mm diameter have been produced in INCONEL* alloy 718, INCO* Waspaloy and Alloy APK12 (similar to UDIMET** 720). Good ingot surfaces were generally obtained with a reduction in oxygen and nitrogen levels achieved for all the alloys compared to the feedstock material. Electron Beam Button Melting (EBBM) indicated that a reduction in the number and size of oxide inclusions was obtained after EBCHR for all the alloys.The flexibility of the EB heat source was used to optimise conditions to obtain equiaxed as-cast grain structures which were successfully converted to wrought fine grain sizes by hot working for all the alloys.Mechanical testing of the fully wrought structure established that a significant improvement in Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) properties was obtained for all the alloys. Statistically relevant sampling of tests carried out at one stress condition showed that a much reduced scatter was obtained compared to data from conventional material. Evaluation of LCF sample fracture surfaces indicated no premature failures in the EBCHR materials due to random defects.

TI  - The mineralogy, geochemistry, physical properties and possible industrial applications of volcanic zeolitic tuffs from Santorini and Polyegos Islands, Greece
SP  - 514
AB  - The microcrystalline vitric mass of Pliocene volcanic tuffs of Santorini and Polyegos islands, in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, has been replaced by authigenic zeolites and clays. The Santorini tuffs are dominated by heulandite type 2 and 3, the classification based on thermal tests, illite/smectite phases, and mordenite, opal-CT, cristobalite, feldspar, quartz and amphibole. The composition of the heulandite minerals can range from (Na2.12K2.56 Ca0.40Mg0.19) (Si29.97A16.08O72) 24H2O and (Na2.60K2.28Ca0.48Mg0.27) (Si29.71 A16.20O72) 24H2O, where Na and K dominate in different proportions, to more calcic members (Na1.56K1.26Ca1.19Mg0.58) (Si29.35A16.71 O72) 24H2O where Ca and Mg dominate. Microprobe analyses classify the heulandites as type 3. Heulandite classification, then, requires the combined use of thermal tests and microprobe analyses. The heulandites show a platy crystal habit and they form, by the mean of dissolution, pseudomorphs after the inner parts of glass shards. The tuffs from the north part of Polyegos island are dominated by mordenite and illite, rarely illite/smectite, along with heulandite type 3, opal-CT, kaolinite, quartz and feldspar. The composition of the mordenite includes, as well as the typical Na-Ca members, with analyses within the known field of mordenite composition, mordenites with unusual high K values. So the formula can range from a (Ca0.68Mg0.49Na4.05K0.52) (Si41.06Al6.94O96) 24H2O where Na and Ca dominate and the Na/K ratio is 7.79 to (Ca1.20Mg0.20Na2.31K2.39) (Si40.61A17.41O96) 24H2O where the Na/K ratio is 0.97. The mordenites show a fibrous habit and replace the inner part of lapillus pumice fragments. They were probably formed by the circulation of hydrothermal fluids through the volcanic tuffs, followed by the emplacement of rhyolitic lavas in the area. The hydrothermal alteration event led to the formation of numerous baryte and galena veins and flats. The examination of other crystal phases present in Santorini tuffs indicates that not all of the products in the Santorini volcanic suite were the result of the involvement of more fertile asthenosphere, as was believed. Volcanic products, like the tuffs examined, show mineral chemistry similarities with their counterparts from the two ends of the volcanic arc. Therefore, the maximum crustal thinning under the central part of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, which is responsible for this different source for the generation of magmas in this area of the Arc, had not been completed before the Upper Pliocene, at the very earliest. The examination of geochemistry reveals that the parent materials were dacites to rhyodacites in Santorini and dacites-rhyodacites to trachyandesites-trachytes in Polyegos. The volcanic tuffs from both areas are the product of a fractional crystallisation process with most distinctive evidence found in Polyegos. Santorini shows evidence of magma mixing process also. The traditional cation exchange capacity methods require modification when used with tuffs rich in zeolites regarding the saturation time and the ammonia measurement techniques. Nevertheless, the zeolitic tuffs exhibit excellent cation exchange properties higher than it was expected. Their great ability to combine with lime, in water saturated environments, and act as pozzolanic materials, improves the performance of concrete mixtures. Mixtures which are made by replacing ordinary Portland cement, for calcined zeolitic materials and in various proportions, are able to reach and maintain compressive strength values, higher than standard concrete cubes which are made of 100% Portland cement as the binding agent. Finally, using relatively cheap mineral separation techniques, like dry sieving, fractions rich in zeolite minerals can be easily obtained.

TI  - Mitochondrial malic enzyme (mep-2*) genotype, temperature and growth in juvenile atlantic salmon (salmo salar l)
SP  - 1
AB  - The genetic variation at the diallelic mitochondrial malic enzyme (MEP-2*) locus represents one of the most widespread polymorphisms detected in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Previous studies of this locus in wild fish populations have found evidence to suggest an adaptive genetic response to local environmental temperature. In both Europe and North America, latitudinal clines in the frequencies of the two MEP-2* alleles exist, that show the same correlation with environmental temperature. In addition, these studies have identified variable associations between MEP-2* genotypes and phenotypic variation in juvenile growth in freshwater. Because growth performance is known to influence survival and reproductive success in Atlantic salmon, it has been postulated that differences in MEP-2* genotype growth performance could be a factor underlying the basis of this apparent adaptive response. This thesis investigates the relationship between MEP-2* genotype, temperature and growth performance in juvenile Atlantic salmon. The thesis aims were (i) to determine whether the genetic variation at the MEP-2* locus in the Atlantic salmon was associated with differences in juvenile growth performance in freshwater, (ii) when any such differences were established, and (iii) to what extent water temperature influenced the association. These were achieved by monitoring MEP-2* genotype growth performance and survival in juvenile Atlantic salmon, hatchery reared under warm (ambient plus ca.4°C), ambient (seasonally variable ambient water temperature) and cold (ambient minus ca. 4°C) water temperature regimens. The results obtained in this study clearly demonstrate that the genetic variation at the MEP-2* locus in the Atlantic salmon is associated with significant differences in juvenile growth performance in freshwater. Associations were observed both early in post-hatch development, and later when the fish had made the transition to exogenous feeding. Furthermore, these associations were found to be strongly influenced by both temperature and feeding ration. These are specific new findings which significantly add to our present knowledge of the MEP-2* polymorphism in the Atlantic salmon. Although these associations did not influence survival in the study, it is postulated that if the same effect were to occur in natural populations, the genetic response indicated could influence fitness. Additionally, it is possible that these genotypic differences in growth performance could be of relevance to selective breeding programs within the salmon farming industry. However, whether the genetic response exhibited was directly due to the MEP-2* locus on its own, or to some other linked locus or loci, remains to be demonstrated.

TI  - Interspecific Competition, Predation, and the Coexistence of Three Closely Related Neotropical Armoured Catfishes (Siluriformes - Callichthyidae)
SP  - 178
AB  - Tropical ecosystems are renowned for their high biodiversity with many closely related species living together. Alpha diversity of tropical freshwater fishes is also extremely high, as exemplified by the cichlid fauna of the Great African lakes and the neotropical characins. Since Hutchinson in 1959 posed his often quoted question: "Why are there so many animals?", factors affecting species diversity have been important subject of study and discussion in ecology. Given the limits of the physical environment, two different biological processes are probably responsible for most of the organization of equilibrial communities: competition and predation.Critics of the view that competition and predation play a major role in structuring communities argued that several factors keep populations below a level where competition or predation could be strong. Reviews of the literature on field experiments designed to demonstrate the influence of competition and predation revealed that only 9% of the studies were conducted in the tropics.The tropical rainforest is one of the most stable environments in the world. Temperature and humidity are almost constant, but important fluctuations in the water level of streams and swamps occur. Extreme conditions limiting population densities and leading to the extinction of populations are often hard to imagine. The high number of species will lead to complex biological interactions. More studies on competition and predation in the stable environment of the tropical rainforest are necessary to evaluate the importance of both processes in structuring communities.A case study is presented concerning three medium-sized armoured catfishes of the family Callichthyidae: Callichthys callichthys, Hoplosternum littorale and Hoplosternum thoracatum. In order to evaluate the influence of competition and predation on the catfish communities, four factors were investigated in detail: 1) geographical distribution, 2) diet overlap, 3) reproductive seasonality and nest-site differentiation, and 4) predation.In Suriname (South America), both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur all over the country. Both catfishes are abundant in both coastal plain swamps with standing water and rainforest creeks in the interior with running water. Hoplosternum littorale, on the other hand, is restricted in its distribution to coastal plain swamps. Salinity tolerance experiments demonstrated that one-week old larvae of H. littorale could not survive in electrolyte-poor water (e.g. rain water). The 'clear water' of rainforest creeks in the interior may be compared to slightly contaminated distilled water with very low electric conductivity. Larvae of both C. callichthys and H. thoracatum survived and developed further in rain water. The pattern of distribution in Suriname can be considered as a model of the distribution of the three catfishes in South America. In South America, H. littorale is not only conspicuously absent from clear water streams draining the weathered Precambrium Guyana and Brazilian Shields, but also from 'black water' streams with humic acids and also a low conductivity (e.g. the Rio Negro). Within the Amazon drainage system H. littorale seems restricted to 'white water' streams loaded with Andean sediments and with a higher conductivity than both clear water and black water. In Suriname, actual syntopy of the three species occurs in coastal plain swamps. In rainforest creeks of the interior C. callichthys and H. thoracatum occur syntopically. Consequently interspecific competition among the three callichthyids is possible.Analysis of the stomach contents of larvae, juveniles and adults of the three armoured catfishes revealed no significant interspecific differences in the diet of larvae, juveniles and adults. However, ontogenetic differences in diet composition among larvae, juveniles and adults where significant for all three catfishes. Larvae of C . callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum fed almost exclusively on Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda. The stomach contents of juveniles were more diverse and included micro-crustacea, insect larvae, aquatic insects and some detritus. Adults ingested large quantities of detritus which probably reflected the inability of large fish to seperate effectively benthic invertebrates from substrate. Chironomid larvae where found in large numbers in the stomach of adult specimens. The short alimentary tract of the three catfishes and the structure of its wall make it improbable that these fishes are able to assimilate detrital nonprotein amino acids. The posterior part of the intestine is thin-walIed and has a respiratory function. The anterior digestive portion is relatively short. Morphologically the three callichthyids are adapted to a benthic way of life and a diet of soft-bodied aquatic invertebrates. The similarity in the diet and their bottomdwelling habit provide the basis for grouping the three armoured catfishes into one ecological guild. Competitive interactions are expected to be potentially strong among members of a guild.Male C. callichthys, H. littorale and H. thoracatum construct and guard a floating bubble nest in flooded swamps. Although the habit of constructing a floating bubble nest probably evolved as an adaptation to the oxygen-depleted environment of tropical standing waters, some of the characteristics of the nests of C.callichthys and H. thoracatum may have evolved as a response to the unpredictability of the fluctuations in water level and water velocity in rainforest creeks. The conspicuous nests allow the study of the temporal pattern of breeding, the spatial distribution of the nests and the differentiation of the nest-site microhabitat among the three species. Daily surveys in coastal plain swamps revealed a similar, bimodal breeding season in the three catfishes. Nests were observed in both the short and long rainy season. The bimodal breeding pattern in Suriname is probably related to the unreliability of the rainfall in the short rainy season of December-January. In French Guiana the rains of December-January usually do not fail and an unimodal breeding season of H. littorale is found. Significant differences in nest macrohabitat selection were found among the three callichthyids. Nests of H. littorale were built in herbaceous swamps, while C . callichthys and H. thoracatum nested in swamp forest under trees. The two forest nesting species differed in the microhabitat at the nest site. Nests of C . callichthys were constructed in extremely shallow water and in holes of tree roots and earth. Nest densities in the selected habitat were low in C.callichthys and H. littorale, but relatively high in H . thoracatum. Nest-site differentiation in the rainy season (the main feeding period) may prevent competitive exclusion among the three catfishes.The potential predation pressure on eggs, larvae and juveniles of H. thoracatum was estimated by combining laboratory predation rates of 24 predator species (both invertebrates and vertebrates) with the density of the predators in the swamp as determined by chemofishing with rotenone. The contribution of a particular predator species to the total predation pressure on H.thoracatum was determined to a large extent by the density of the predator in the swamp. Seemingly innocuous predators with low or moderate predation rates in the laboratory may be extremely important in the swamp due to their abundance. Smallsized fishes and aquatic invertebrates are probably major predators of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum. The potential predation pressure on eggs is high, but the aggressive nest guarding behaviour of the male catfish and concealment of the nests probably protects the eggs effectively from most aquatic predators. Larvae are not guarded by the male and the potential impact of the 24 predators on the larvae of H. thoracatum is large. Although the experiments were performed with H. thoracatum there is no good reason to expect important differences in predation rates on larvae of the three armoured catfishes. Even if only 2.5 % of the potential predation will be realized due to other prey available, the high mortality of early developmental stages of H. thoracatum (and C. callichthys and H. littorale ) in the swamp could be easily explained as the effect of predation. Potential predation pressure and the number of predators that were able to prey on H. thoracatum sharply declined with increasing age (size) of the juvenile catfish. The heavy armour of bony plates and stout pectoral spines protect older juveniles and adults from most potential predators. The high potential predation pressure in the swamps and the low density of juvenile catfish at the end of the rainy season suggest that predation is important in structuring these catfish communities.Although larvae of the three armoured catfishes C. callichthys , H. littorale and H. thoracatum show differences in tolerance to electrolyte-poor water, the three species occur together in coastal swamps. Interspecific diet overlap is very high, and the three catfishes show no differentiation in their breeding season and diel pattern of activity. Ontogenetic changes in the defense mechanisms of armoured catfishes result in a situation in which both predation and competition exert control at different times in the life cycle. Predators probably kill most of the larvae and juveniles, leaving only a few individuals to escape and reach adulthood. If the number of escapes would exceed the number of adult deaths, the populations eventually become sufficiently dense to compete. However, in this situation nest-habitat segregation may prevent competitive exclusion of one of the three species .

TI  - The Physiological Ecology of the Phase Polymorphism in the African Armyworm Moth, Spodoptera exempta (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
SP  - 193
AB  - The effects of larval phase polyphenism on adult reproductive biology, and larval nutritional and thermal ecology of the African armyworm moth, Spodoptera exempta (Walker) were investigated.Differences between moths which were reared from solitaria and gregaria larvae were obtained in fecundity (weight-adjusted) and pre-oviposition period. Number of egg batches, oviposition period and longevity of female moths were influenced by adult diet and not by larval phase. Phase effects, on fecundity and pre-oviposition period were removed by rearing larvae as solitaria for three generations.Larval food consumption and utilization indices were affected by phase and instar; the direction of differences depended on whether solitaria larvae were first- or third-generation. There were no differences in growth rates between phases. Weight-adjusted triglyceride contents of larvae were higher in the gregaria in two out of three trials. Solitaria larvae contained more body water. Rearing of larvae in different sizes of containers did not affect the triglyceride levels within phases, but affected water content in the solitaria.At constant ambient temperatures of 17.5, 22.5 and 25°C, gregaria larvae developed faster than solitaria. At 30°C, larval period was shorter for the solitaria than the gregaria. The rate of development did not differ between phases at 35°C. Gregaria larvae lost their black pigment at 35°C and above. Anaesthetized black larvae attained higher rates of increase in temperature than larvae of lighter pigment when exposed to radiant energy. Loss of the black pigment at higher temperatures was accompanied by loss of ability of gregaria larvae to heat up faster under radiant energy. Studies on behaviour failed to demonstrate any preference of larvae in one phase for illuminated or shaded areas.The implications of these findings for the life history of S. exempta and the problems involved in research on phase polyphenism are discussed.

TI  - Comparative ecology and life history of two temperate, northwestern Atlantic searobins, Prionotus carolinus and Prionotus evolans (Pisces: Triglidae)
SP  - 186
AB  - Research of fish emphasizes economically important species (e.g., Clupeiformes, Gadiformes, Pleuronectiformes), so our knowledge of life history variation in fishes is limited by the relatively small number of non-commercial species that have been studied. Largely in response to this, two unexploited species (northern searobin, Prionotus carolinus (Linnaeus, 1771), and striped searobin, P. evolans (Linnaeus, 1766)) were studied in a central part of their range, the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Museum specimens and archived fishery-independent data sources were reviewed to outline their life cycles and population characteristics. Both species occurred year-round in the Mid-Atlantic Bight, migrating seasonally in an onshore-offshore as well as a north-south pattern and spawning from May to October. Prionotus carolinus was typically more abundant than P. evolans, and water temperature was useful for explaining seasonal differences in distribution and abundance between the two species. Their population sizes were fairly steady over the last 2-3 decades, unlike many other benthic species whose abundances have declined during this period. Larval, metamorphosing, and newly-settled juvenile searobins were collected during 1991-1992, and these stages were found to be much more abundant than previously reported. Prionotus spp. early life history was further emphasized by analyzing microincrements (validated as daily) in sagittal otoliths. For both species, flexion of the notochord was complete at 6-7 mm standard length (SL) and by three weeks after hatching; this morphological transition closely preceded settlement (at about 8-9 mm SL and about one week later). Both species grew 0.3-0.4 mm d$\sp{-1}$ as larvae, and settled juveniles grew at a similar or faster rate (0.3-0.6 mm d$\sp{-1}$). Prionotus carolinus concentrated its spawning later in the season (principally in August) so that young-of-the-year (YOY) individuals were smaller, on average, than YOY P. evolans. The size range of YOY P. carolinus also overlapped with the size range of yearling conspecifics, which confounded cohort analysis of length frequencies. Continental shelf habitate appear to be important nursery grounds for P. carolinus, based on the wide distribution and high densities of YOY fish there, and P. carolinus may represent a major component of total juvenile fish production for the Mid-Atlantic Bight shelf.

TI  - Within-population variation in demography of Taraxacum officinale
SP  - 151
AB  - A central question in evolutionary biology has been, how is within-population genetic diversity maintained in the face of selection and drift. I examined the potential contribution of environmental seasonality to the maintenance of diversity within plant populations by asking: Is demography of a natural population season-specific? Does season-specific demography vary among biotypes within the population? Are season-specific responses influenced by the competitive environment? Can the patterns of genotype performance among seasons be responsible for preserving genetic diversity within a population? Demography of a natural population of Taraxacum officinale in Morgantown, WV, USA, examined with Lefkovitch transition matrices, was season-specific. Population growth was sensitive to perturbation of growth and fertility of small individuals from October through July. Large individuals contributed disproportionately to population growth during late summer. Detecting these dynamics is important for understanding long-term population growth and viability. Lefkovitch matrices calculated for five biotypes (leaf morphs) within the population indicated that differential biotypic demography within the year contributes to preserving genetic diversity. A common environment experiment confirmed that biotype differences were genetically-based. Replicates of five genotypes (representing each of the biotypes) planted into the field in each of four seasons confirmed the importance to diversity of differential fitness to seasonal environments. Several genotypes performed better in warm months. A second group performed better in cool seasons. Despite seasonal differences in fitness components, genotypic performances across seasons were equivalent. Genotypes (representing three of the previous biotypes) planted with Plantago major, Poa pratensis and Trifolium pratense suggest that differential performance to seasons is influenced by biotic as well as abiotic components in the environment. Differential genotype responses to seasonal environments represent the temporal variation in fitness necessary for maintenance of genetic variation. Therefore, temporal environmental fluctuations are expected to contribute to the persistence of the genotypes present in this natural population. This effect of temporal environmental heterogeneity, in combination with spatial heterogeneity, may be important to many species which exist in cyclically fluctuating environments as even subtle differences in the environment may result in genetic adaptation within populations.

TI  - Intra- and interspecific factors in the dynamics of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) populations
SP  - 104
AB  - This review summarizes the results of seven papers on intra- and interspecific factors affecting the dynamics of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) populations in Finnish lakes. The main aims of the research were: (1) to compare and select methods for estimating year-class strength and density of vendace; (2) to gather quantitative data on certain vendace populations for many fish generations; (3) to find out the mechanisms affecting vendace year-class strength; (4) to assess the effects of fishing on vendace population dynamics; and (5) to find implications for fisheries management in lakes. The main results were: Fishing affected the fish community structure and consequently year-class strength and population dynamics of vendace. Regular two-year oscillations were found in vendace populations under intensive fishing. Survival and growth of 0+ vendace were regulated by density-dependent processes. The condition of adult vendace was negatively related to stock biomass. Changes in the egg dry weight and year-class success were related to changes in the adult condition. Favourable feeding conditions for vendace larvae occurred with low vendace stock biomass and with warm springs. The long-lasting period of vendace scarcity may be related to changes in fish community structure induced mainly by climatic factors. The management of vendace fishery should take into account the density dependent regulation of year-class strength as well as the effects of fishing on the fish community structure.

TI  - Oviposition behavior along a temperature gradient in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 141
AB  - Oviposition behaviors of Drosophila melanogaster were investigated by testing wild-type flies along a temperature gradient. Individual females were tested and the mean temperature of the substrate in which eggs were oviposited was used to estimate the oviposition temperature preference. Adult acclimation temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30$\sp\circ$C) during the 72 hours prior to the assay had a significant effect on the mean oviposition temperature and the two were positively correlated. Developmental temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30$\sp\circ$C), from egg to adult had no effect on this behavior. Low genetic variability was found for this trait. Heritability ($h\sp2$) was estimated to be 0.04 for the strain tested with a mother-daughter regression. Also, no difference was found among four strains from different geographic origins (two tropical and two temperate). However, after one year, flies from populations reared at 30$\sp\circ$C had a significantly higher mean oviposition temperature preference than those reared at 15$\sp\circ$C. Crosses between these two populations, reared at both 15 and 30$\sp\circ$C, indicated significant effects due to both genetic and environmental influences. Analysis of locomotor behavior during the assay indicated a difference between the substrate temperatures preferred for oviposition versus that for a resting location by the females. The females select oviposition sites with temperatures that are higher than the temperatures at which they prefer to rest. Discussions include the optimal strategies for oviposition site temperatures and the possibility of bet-hedging strategies for this behavior. The behavior of inserting eggs into the substrate was also investigated. Significant differences were found among the four geographic strains tested. The strain from the location with the highest average temperatures throughout the year inserted the highest percentage, while that from the location with the mildest temperatures inserted the least. After several generations at 15 and 30$\sp\circ$C, flies inserted a lower percentage of eggs than in the initial generations. The percentage of eggs inserted at different temperatures along the gradient was analyzed. This revealed a general trend of increased insertion percentages at higher temperatures. Results support the hypothesis that the insertion of eggs into the substrate is a mechanism to prevent desiccation.

TI  - Marine cladocerans in Narragansett Bay
SP  - 304
AB  - This dissertation examines feeding and population dynamics of marine cladocerans. Feeding rates of Podon polyphemoides on Gymnodinium sanguineum at 1-100 cells $\cdot$ ml$\sp{-1}$ (6-638 $\mu$g C $\cdot$ l$\sp{-1}$) increased with food concentration, and ranged from 1.4 to 20.2 cells $\cdot$ animal$\sp{-1} \cdot$ h$\sp{-1}$, equivalent to 3-30% of body C $\cdot$ h$\sp{-1}$ at 18$\sp\circ$C. In consecutive experiments, P. polyphemoides fed in the light, but not in the dark. P. polyphemoides fed on G. sanguineum in a natural plankton assemblage, but not on Skeletonema cosfatum. P. polyphemoides, at 14-22$\sp\circ$C, had good survival to birth of the first brood when fed C. sanguineum, but little growth and no reproduction on Cryptomonas baltica or Skeletonema. Generation times for P. polyphemoides decreased from 12 days at 10$\sp\circ$ to 3 days at 22$\sp\circ$C. Population dynamics of cladocerans were studied at a station in the West Passage of Narragansett Bay. Evadne nordmanni, Podon polyphemoides P. leuckarti, P. intermedius, and Penilia avirostris were collected in quantitative sampling. E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides, the most abundant, had late spring-early summer and fall periods of abundance, separated by midsummer population collapses, and fall reappearances. Each period of occurrence was characterized by a decline in brood size, and by appearance of sexual individuals. When E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides co-occurred, brood sizes were correlated between species, but negatively correlated with abundance of adult calanoid copepods (summer only). Both species showed increased fecundity during a bloom of heterotrophic gymnodinioid dinoflagellates. In summer, mortality was correlated with decreasing population growth rates of E. nordmanni and P. polyphemoides. The summer collapses were due to increased mortality, possibly due to predation. The late fall declines of Podon and Evadne were associated with declining birth rate, due to low water temperature and high incidence of sexual reproduction. Production of P. polyphemoides was estimated at 79 mg C $\cdot$ m$\sp{-2}$ in 1988 and 533 mg C $\cdot$ m$\sp{-2}$ in 1989. Cladocerans of the family Podonidae are characterized by high feeding rates and short generation times, resulting in high birth and population growth rates. These life history characteristics may contribute to their drastic population fluctuations.

TI  - Interspecific competition between native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in streams
SP  - 108
AB  - Brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are thought to be negatively impacted by introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in many eastern North American streams. I attempted to determine whether (1) the longitudinal pattern of brook trout and rainbow trout abundance in streams was due to competition, (2) temperature had an effect on aggressive interactions between the species, and (3) selection of stream positions was affected by competition. Through field sampling and observation in a small Pennsylvania stream I found the typical pattern of brook trout occurring more abundantly upstream and rainbow trout becoming more abundant downstream. Habitat observations indicated that rainbow trout adults obtained access to preferred deep-water habitats during summer low flows, while the two species occurred in similar habitats in spring when space was more abundant. Individually enclosed age 1 fish of both species exhibited similar survival and growth rates at upstream and downstream locations. These findings suggest that for age 1 fish, neither brook trout nor rainbow trout possess an inherent advantage at the stream locations in which they predominate, and that fish $\ge$ age 1 may compete for habitat. The lab experiments conducted at 13$\sp\circ$C and 18$\sp\circ$C indicated that brook trout were more aggressive and had higher growth rates than paired rainbow trout, but there was no difference in foraging success between the two species. I found temperature to have little effect on the interaction among native brook trout and rainbow trout. However, both species grew equally well when held separately, which suggests neither species possess an inherent physiological advantage at these stream temperatures. Positions selected by brook trout and rainbow trout in multiple-fish pools were directly related to fish size, but there was no correlation between fish position and fish size in single fish pools. The field experiment involving removal of rainbow trout from interspecific pairs demonstrated that brook trout did not shift positions if they were more aggressive, but those that were not aggressive did shift positions. The results suggest that brook trout and rainbow trout actively compete for stream positions, with fish size and aggressiveness important factors determining outcomes of the interaction.

TI  - Effects of heat, lactic acid, and modified atmosphere packaging on Listeria monocytogenes on cooked crawfish tail meat
SP  - 119
AB  - The generation time of L. monocytogenes was calculated to be 72.2, 28.5, 17.01, and 6.9 h on crawfish tail meat held at 0, 4, 6, and 12$\sp\circ$C, respectively. Potassium sorbate (PS) (0.3%) spray treatments on crawfish held at 4$\sp\circ$C, extended the lag phase of the bacterium. However, once exponential growth began, a generation time not significantly different (P $>$ 0.05) than that of untreated crawfish was observed. Samples sprayed with 0.3% citric acid (CA) and held at 4$\sp\circ$C supported growth of the bacterium equally well as that of untreated samples. Thermal inactivation of L. monocytogenes using a three neck reactionary flask method yielded D$\sb{55,60,65}$ values of 10.23, 1.98, and 0.19 min, respectively. A z value of 5.5$\sp\circ$C was calculated. Polybag and cellulose casing methodology yielded significantly higher (P $\ge$ 0.05) D$\sb{60}$ values of 4.68 and 3.84 respectively, for the bacterium. D$\sb{60}$ values for L. monocytogenes decreased as the percent lactic acid (LA) spray treatments levels were increased. Increasing sensitivity to heat with LA was not solely due to a reduction of pH. D$\sb{60}$ values for the bacterium on samples packed in air, O$\sb2$, CO$\sb2$, or N$\sb2$ were not significantly different (P $>$ 0.05), however, D$\sb{60}$ of samples packed under O$\sb2$ were lowest. Generation times for heat damaged L. monocytogenes on crawfish meat stored at 4$\sp\circ$C and packed under air, O$\sb2$, CO$\sb2$, or N$\sb2$ was determined. Twenty percent of the cell population was damaged when thermally treated at 60$\sp\circ$C for 12.5 min. The bacterium consistently grew slowest in CO$\sb2$ and O$\sb2$. Samples receiving a treatment of 1% LA, packaging under either of the 4 different atmospheres, and storage at 4$\sp\circ$C, were lethal to the bacterium. These studies indicate that post-packaging heat treatments of 60$\sp\circ$C or greater in the presence of CO$\sb2$ or O$\sb2$, and the addition of 1% LA sprays, would be detrimental to the survival of L. monocytogenes on crawfish meat.

TI  - Meiotic chromosome abnormalities in a laboratory stock of the crane fly Nephrotoma suturalis
SP  - 147
AB  - Spermatocytes in a laboratory stock of the crane fly Nephrotoma suturalis (designated the JD stock) expressed a statistically significant higher mean number of meiotic chromosome abnormalities (15.7%) compared to progeny of Wild derived Nephrotoma females (1.2%). These abnormalities occurred in Meiosis I. Anaphase bridges lacking acentric fragments were the most prevalent abnormality, followed by autosomal univalents, and chromatids and fragments. The chiasma frequency of this laboratory stock (5.15 chiasmata) was not statistically different from the chiasma frequency of progeny from wild-caught N. suturalis females (5.35 chiasmata). Survival of the JD stock was significantly reduced compared to the survival of Wild derived progeny. The developmental rate of the JD stock was significantly slower than the Wild derived progeny during the early part of the life cycle. Among the hypotheses tested were that location and temperature caused the higher number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis. However, the number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis was not significantly altered in four locations for two generations. Also, two temperature environments did not significantly change the number of chromosome abnormalities in the JD stock or in Wild derived progeny. Since these environmental factors did not affect the occurrence of meiotic abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis, the alternate hypothesis of a genetic mechanism prevailed. The most promising hypothesis to explain these meiotic abnormalities was a meiotic/mitotic mutation. The consequences of a mutation affecting DNA topoisomerase II, or the regulation of DNA topoisomerase II, corresponded well to the cytological characteristics of the meiotic abnormalities in the JD stock of N. suturalis. Assuming such a mutation, a model was developed to estimate the mutant allele frequency in the JD stock. The estimated mutant allele frequency range was 0.38 to 0.62. With this mutant allele frequency range and survival data of the JD stock and Wild derived progeny, an Average Fitness range of the JD stock of N. suturalis was calculated at 0.44 to 0.63.

TI  - A study on the ecology of katle, Neolissochilus hexagonolepis (McClelland), in a Nepalese reservoir and river
SP  - 343
AB  - A study on feeding, age, growth and reproductive biology of katle, Neolissochilus hexagonolepis, was conducted in the newly created Indrasarobar Reservoir and in the Tadi River in Nepal during January, 1988, to December, 1990. The objective was to assess katle's adaptability from a riverine to a lacustrine environment. Monthly samples of katle were collected. Volumetric gut content analysis revealed katle's euryphagous nature. Animal matter, plant matter and detritus and soil constituted 21.8, 68.8 and 9.4% respectively of the gut contents of fish from the river, and 29.0, 56.0 and 15.0% in the reservoir. One annual peak of feeding intensity was observed in both systems, as well as seasonal variation in diet composition. The contribution of plant food increased with the size of the fish. The gut length of katle was allometrically related to its total length in both habitats, more strongly in the reservoir population. This appears to be a major adaptation to the reservoir in the feeding ecology of katle. Age determinations showed that one annulus was formed in the bony parts of katle annually. Oxytetracycline marking confirmed the validity of ages derived from pectoral fin rays. Females attained a larger size than males. The annual length increment was high for the first four years of life and declined after maturity. Growth data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth model. The estimated maximum lengths L$\sb{\infty}$ for females (73 cm for the reservoir and 45 cm for the river) were higher than those for males (41 and 26 cm). The K values were higher in males (0.195 yr$\sp{-1}$ for the river and 0.135 yr$\sp{-1}$ for the reservoir) than in females (0.089 and 0.120 yr$\sp{-1}$). A positive correlation was observed between the average area of the reservoir during the warm months (April to October) and annual length increments in reservoir katle of specified age. Radio telemetry studies of female katle revealed their upstream pre-spawning migration. Quantitative studies on the gonadal maturation cycle revealed that katle are partial spawners of low fecundity. This study has shown that katle is a euryphagous, slow growing, long living and multiply spawning hill stream cyprinid that has adapted well to the lacustrine environment of the Indrasarobar Reservoir.

TI  - Genetics of sex ratio and other life history traits in the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch)
SP  - 155
AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, is a very costly pest of more than 150 agriculturally important plant species. It is characterized by a high intrinsic rate of increase and rapid evolution of resistance to pesticides. Sex ratio is an important life history trait which affects population dynamics, intrinsic rate of increase, dispersal, colonization ability and speed by which this important pest species responds to environmental changes. This study has shown progeny sex ratio to be entirely under maternal control; sires did not affect their progeny sex ratio. A slight sire effect on early fecundity was observed, but mixed results were obtained, with only one of two replicates attaining statistical significance. Sex ratio regulation was shown to be moderately heritable, with heritabilities ranging between 0.48-0.61. Thus sex ratio had sufficient additive genetic variance to respond to either natural or artificial selection. Sex ratio regulation was also shown to effect both means and variances, responding to changes in the environment. When temperatures were elevated, mean progeny sex ratio decreased, resulting in a larger proportion of males within the progeny set; sex ratio variance increased. It was believed that females at high temperature increased the number of haploid recombinant genotypes exposed to selection, in the form of hemizygous males, thus increasing the rate of response to selection in suboptimal conditions. Evidence presented herein suggested that environmental sensitivity, or phenotypic plasticity, of sex ratio was also heritable. The heritability of progeny sex ratio was found to increase in response to elevated temperatures, thus exposing more additive genetic variance to selective forces.

TI  - Studies in biological control of the pepper-tree psyllid, Calophya rubra (Blanchard), in the San Francisco Bay Area
SP  - 130
AB  - Studies were carried out on the three-species system resulting from the introduction of the exotic ornamental tree Schinus molle L., the accidental arrival of the pestiferous psyllid Calophya rubra (Blanchard) and the importation of the parasitoid Tamarixia sp. nov. as a biological control agent. The goal of these studies was to describe the impacts both of the psyllid on the tree and of the parasitoid on the psyllid. Neither a survey of owners of mature urban pepper-trees nor an exclosure experiment with younger trees demonstrated any continuous negative impact of the psyllid on the tree. Rather, both methods revealed the same seasonal pattern consisting of a period of noticeable winter damage followed by a period in which damage was not detectable. Intensive censusing of plant parts, psyllids and parasitoids suggested that the insect populations reflected the yearly cycle of the tree, but with pronounced time-lags. Neither the psyllid nor the parasitoid showed a strong density-dependent response to changes in the availability of its food source. Pest density peaked in November and reached a low point in May, while percent parasitism peaked in March, August and December and reached a low in June. Laboratory measurements showed that the lower temperature threshold for the tree (11 C) was below that of the insects (13 C). At 23 C, generation time for the parasitoid was shorter (26 d) than that of the psyllid (49 d), but the psyllid appeared to have higher fecundity. Innate capacity for increase therefore was similar in the two species. The results of these studies suggest that, in the San Francisco Bay Area, seasonal environmental fluctuation keeps the parasitoid from having a great impact on the psyllid, but at the same time, it keeps the psyllid from having a great impact on the tree. This occurs because neither insect's population is able to keep pace with the maximum growth of its food source.

TI  - Thermal Evolution In Drosophila Melanogaster
SP  - 1
AB  - The experiments reported in this thesis examined the effects of laboratory thermal selection on a range of characters in two sets of three replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster, maintained at 16.5°C and 25°C for over four years.The duration of developmental stages in males and females from both selection regimes was greater when reared at 16.5oC than when reared at 25oC. An evolutionary response of development times to temperature was also evident. Times to pupariation of 25oC selected larvae were longer than those of 16.5oC selected larvae, when reared at 16.5oC or 25oC. Times to adult eclosion were longer for 25oC selected lines compared to 16.5oC selected lines, when both were reared at 16.5oC, but the situation was reversed at 25oC. Pre-adult survival was higher in selected lines when they were reared at their own selection temperature. This is clear evidence of rapid thermal evolution and adaptation in the selected lines.Larval growth patterns were also examined. Larvae from both selection regimes reached a higher weight, and took almost twice as long to develop, when reared at 16.5oC rather than 25oC. At both growth temperatures, 16.5oC selected larvae had higher mean weights at almost all sampling intervals in comparison to 25oC selected larvae. Starvation experiments showed that larvae from the thermally selected lines had higher critical weights for pupariation when reared at the temperature at which they had been selected compared to larvae from the other selection regime reared at the same temperature. Results suggested that 16.5oC selected lines may be allocating more nutrients to growth as opposed to somatic maintenance.

TI  - Form, function and energetics of the early life history of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)
SP  - 277
AB  - The physiological energetics of the early life history of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua were investigated in laboratory studies for two genetically discrete populations (Newfoundland and Scotian Shelf), by integrating information from the fields of ecology, physiology and functional morphology. Laboratory studies were designed to simulate temperatures that eggs and larvae of different stocks experience in the ocean. Functional morphological landmarks important to feeding and respiration were derived from specimens treated by clearing and staining, histology, and scanning electron microscopy. These landmarks defined 12 developmental stages at two temperatures, 5$\sp\circ$C and 10$\sp\circ$C, from hatching to metamorphosis, in larval cod. Results showed that staging is a more accurate way of determining developmental state than days post-hatch or degree days. Staging of specific structures such as the jaw and alimentary canal illustrated that variation in structural complexity may be influenced by intrinsic (genetic) factors and/or extrinsic (environmental) factors. Detailed anatomical and functional analysis revealed that while the yolk-sac serves as a food resource, primary skeletal structures and mechanisms for feeding are simple and non-integrated and respiration is cutaneous. As ontogeny progresses, requirements for exogenous food are met by the development of new skeletal elements, ligaments and muscles. Together these changes allow increases in jaw coordination and suction pressure generation necessary for prey capture and eventually for branchial respiration. Landmarks and developmental stages were also used to mark major life history transitions in energy acquisition. At these transitions, changes occur in the allocation of finite energy resources between growth and activity metabolism. In addition, the energy allocated to growth and activity metabolism differed between populations. Larvae from the Newfoundland population were more cost-effective in conditions that reflected their native environment; these larvae appeared to be physiologically 'cold-adapted'. In contrast, larvae from the Scotian Shelf population appeared to be 'warm-adapted' but spent more energy on activity metabolism and less on growth at all temperatures. This suggests that the physiological energetics underlying the dynamics of production and survivorship are different between cod populations in Canada.

AB  - On the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia ponds utilising seawater drawn from wells have an average salinity of 43 parts per mil. and temperatures ranging from 23-33 degrees C. The present study has demonstrated that yields of up to 4.3 tonnes ha-1 of the Indian white shrimp Penaeus indicus at 20 g size may be obtained in these ponds. P. indicus was isolated from local stocks (Gizan) and has now been cultured through several generations at the Fish Farming Centre. Present work has determined that the optimal salinity for larval culture is 30 parts per mil. and for nursery culture 25-30 parts per mil. The best stage for transfer from nursery to growout pond (43 parts per mil.) is about PL25. Comparison with biological data for P. indicus cultured elsewhere indicates that Red Sea populations may be preadapted to tolerate high salinities. The potential for artificial feeds to replace live feeds in P. indicus larval culture from Z1 to PL1 and PL5 using microencapsulated feeds, Nippai and Frippak has been investigated. Results reveal that 50% replacement with Nippai and Frippak is possible giving comparable growth to the control, but poorer survival. Also comparative growth trials were conducted with post larval P. indicus (PL5-PL30) spawned from Red Sea stock and cultured through larval stages on five feeds (Chaetoceros, Tetraselmis and Artemia). Post larvae were reared on commercial feeds: Taiwanese, Nippai, Frippak and 4 formulated feeds based on locally available ingredients at 28-30 degrees C and at 30 parts per mil. and 42 parts per mil. salinities. Feeding trials at 42 parts per mil. produced poor survival, but at 30 parts per mil. all treatments gave over 50% survival to PL25, at which stage shrimp are ready for stocking in growout ponds. Although the Taiwanese feed produced the overall fastest growth, it was not significantly better (P>0.05) than two locally formulated diets (FFC1,4) or Frippak. Survival rates of over 60% where achieved on all diets with the exception of Nippai and Taiwanese feeds. Yields were significantly higher (P<0.05) on one of the locally prepared diets (FFC1) than Taiwanese and Nippai, and Taiwanese than Nippai. All diets yielded significantly more shrimp biomass at 30 parts per mil. than 42 parts per mil. (P>0.05). The relative costs of imported and locally produced diets are discussed and it is concluded that it is possible to produce cost-effective nursery diets in Saudi Arabia. A growout feeding study for P. indicus juvenile utilising 4 locally formulated diets compared with a Taiwanese diet revealed no significant difference (P. >0.05) in survival nor in growth or yield amongst all diets. However growth was slow due to low pH and high ammonia levels. Finally shrimp density production trials at 20, 40,60 and 80m-2 during winter and summer were conducted in cages placed in a rubber lined pond. For all densities; yields were significantly higher in summer than winter with an overall average of 3.41 plus or minus 1.5 tonnes and 4.04 plus or minus 2.36 tonnes 180 days-1 for winter and summer respectively. Yield at 80m-2 was highest but was not different from yield at 60m-2. Based on average harvested size and market price the density of 60m-2 was regarded suitable for growout culture.

TI  - Specialists and generalists in changing environments: The evolution of thermal sensitivity
SP  - 187
AB  - Temporal variation in the physical environment limits the ability of animals to perform fitness-enhancing activities, such as growth, mating, and oviposition. The organism's sensitivity to these environmental changes can be described by a performance curve, a plot of performance against an environmental variable. I address two questions in the evolution of performance curves. First, what is the optimal performance curve for a given pattern of environmental variation? Second, how does the genetic variation for the performance curve evolve? I use the thermal sensitivity of insect locomotion as a model system to develop theory to address these questions, and to empirically examine the key assumptions of the models. I developed optimality and quantitative genetic models of the evolution of the performance curve. The models measure fitness as fecundity or mating success, and examine what phenotypes are favored under different combinations of cyclic within-(WG) and among-generation (AG) environmental variation. WG variation tends to reduce the fitness differences among phenotypes, and AG variation alone favors broader performance curves. In combination, WG and AG variation interact to allow the evolution of specialists, with narrow performance curves, even in the most variable environments. Increasing the amplitude of fluctuations in the environment helps maintain genetic variation in the performance curve. The rate of performance curve evolution, however, is much slower than anticipated. Non-linear performance curves and reaction norms impose functional constraints that limit the efficacy of selection in moving a population towards its fitness optimum, thereby slowing the rate of evolution. The key assumption in these models is a trade-off between maximum performance rate and the breadth of performance. This "jack-of-all-trades is master of none" constraint has rarely been tested. I quantified the trade-off at both the genetic and phenotypic levels in the parasitic wasp, Aphidius ervi, and at the phenotypic level in Drosophila melanogaster. Strong evidence for the "jack-of-all-trades" was found at the phenotypic level in both species, and genetic trade-offs were found in male A. ervi. Parental and developmental temperature effects on the adult locomotory performance curves in Drosophila were also examined; developmental temperatures have the greatest effect on adult performance.

TI  - Life history and evolutionary adaptation of Pacific salmon and its application in management
SP  - 135
AB  - An approach to understanding and managing anadromous salmon, steelhead, and sea-run cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus spp.) based on life history and evolutionary adaptive capacities of species and stocks is presented. Species, stocks, and local populations are viewed as systems that are continuously adapting to changing environmental conditions. They have the potential capacity to evolve in different ways in different environments through both life history and evolutionary adaptation. Habitat organization forms a template for genus, species, stock, and local population life history organization. Harvesting, habitat alteration resulting from land use practices and other human activities can alter the organization and adaptive capacities of species and stocks, and thus their long term persistence. The adaptive capacity of Oncorhynchus relative to its habitat and management environment is examined at the species, stock, and local population levels. Life history characteristics of representative stocks and local populations are analyzed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DECORANA). Fresh water migration distance and latitude are used to "explain" ordination patterns of Oncorhynchus species in the North Pacific Basin. Fresh water migration difficulty and mean annual runoff are used to interpret life history patterns of Columbia Basin chinook salmon stocks. Upstream migration difficulty and fall water temperatures are used to explain the ordination patterns of local populations of Willamette spring chinook salmon. Fishery management practices are examined in terms of their impacts on the organization and adaptive capacity of species, stocks, and local populations of Oncorhynchus. Management generalizations and guidelines derived from the life history theory are applied to management of Willamette spring chinook salmon. Maintaining habitat changes in the Willamette Basin within the historic range of fluctuations will tend to maximize co-organization of local populations. Management activities should provide relatively constant habitat and fishery conditions for natural selection processes to "organize" life history traits over a period of at least a few generations. Fisheries should selectively harvest local populations that show a high degree of realization of their adaptive capacity. By focusing instead on maximizing the co-organization of stocks, their habitat and fishery environments, and protecting the adaptive capacities of stocks, we will go a long way toward providing long-term sustainability for social communities dependent on fisheries.

TI  - Empirical and theoretical investigations of Colorado potato beetle adaptation to insecticides
SP  - 166
AB  - Computer simulation and field studies were conducted to better understand the process of insecticide selection and insecticide resistance evolution in Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). A simulation model (REPO--Resistance Evolution in Pest Organisms), which is specifically relevant to Colorado potato beetle on potato, was developed to predict the rate of resistance development given various genetic, biological and management conditions. REPO is different from other resistance management models in that it is temperature-driven, considers age-specific selection, describes the pattern of immigration of adults colonists, and uses survivorship functions to describe dynamic relationships among genotypes during insecticide selection. Foremost among ecological and management factors influencing the rate of adaptation in REPO were the arrival period of colonizing beetles, timing of insecticide applications, action thresholds, and age-specific selection. Fitness studies were conducted in the field using permethrin-resistant, susceptible and hybrid strains of Colorado potato beetle. Survivorship results indicated that there is significant selection against susceptible genotypes during all larval stages and the adult stage. In another set of experiments, viability of 1-d-old larvae and fecundity and viability of adults were estimated when beetles were placed on foliage at various intervals (2, 5, 8, and 13 d) after permethrin application. Selection against susceptible 1-d-old larvae was strongest when placement was 2 d after application and selection diminished on subsequent placement dates but remained significant for the duration of the experiment. When selection was intense (on early placement dates) most survivors of the hybrid strain were males, which is consistent with the reported sex-linkage of this trait in Colorado potato beetle. Differences were not detected in survivorship and fecundity of adults of the three strains placed on plants at various intervals after insecticide application. Using information on the population genetics of permethrin from the field studies discussed above, another simulation model, REPO-PERM, was developed specifically to study resistance development to permethrin in Colorado potato beetle. Model explorations indicated that sex-linked traits respond to directional selection faster than autosomal traits, and that position of individuals in the plant canopy can influence selection intensity and the rate of adaptation. Model predictions for rates of adaptation to permethrin under conditions typical of Virginia and North Carolina are consistent with documented development of resistance in these areas.

TI  - Use of a self-fertilizing hermaphroditic fish, Rivulus marmoratus, as an animal model for life history and ecotoxicological studies
SP  - 182
AB  - The mangrove-dwelling fish, Rivulus marmoratus, is the only vertebrate known to be a naturally synchronous, internally self-fertilizing hermaphrodite. Despite its unique reproductive mode which makes it produce nearly homozygous offspring with very little genetic variation, R. marmoratus have been reported to have a high strain composition in the field. In the first part of my study, I conducted experiments to: (1) demonstrate the degree to which phenotypic plasticity responds to environmental variation, and (2) explain the existence of numerous strains in the field. I studied both growth and reproduction among five strains of R. marmoratus for two consecutive generations. I varied temperature, salinity and food ration to simulate natural abiotic and biotic conditions in the first generation study and focused on the effects of parental food level in the second generation study. All three environmental factors and several interactions among them had significant effects on overall growth and reproduction. There was a significant parental effect on growth and reproduction of their offspring (the second generation). I estimated the net reproductive rate, R and found that each strain had different fitness values in different environments and no strain had the highest fitness estimate across all the environments. These results illustrate the considerable degree to which abiotic and biotic factors may interact to determine the phenotypic expression of traits and, ultimately, to affect the fitness of the strain. This feature and genetic variation among strains may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an extremely variable and stressful environment. To evaluate Rivulus marmoratus as a possible animal model for ecotoxicological studies, in the second part of my study, I conducted: (1) 96h LC$\sb{50}$ tests of Cd toxicity, (2) interstrain variation test, and (3) 96h LC$\sb{50}$ tests of each of the three heavy metals, Cd, Cu and Zn, for both Rivulus marmoratus and Fundulus heteroclitus, a standard bioassay fish. I concluded that R. marmoratus, with its easy husbandry in the laboratory, the high repeatability in acute metal tests, especially within each strain, and similarity in toxicological response by two species have made it a very promising species for bioassay studies.

TI  - Behavioral thermoregulation of the water snake Nerodia rhombifera
SP  - 97
AB  - Temperature directly affects physiological performance and indirectly influences individual fitness. Ectotherms predominantly use behavior to regulate their body temperature (T$\sb{\rm b}$). Behavioral thermoregulation can thus maximize individual fitness by enhancing reproductive success, food gathering and processing, and predator avoidance. Different physiological processes may have different thermal optima. Consequently, preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ may shift as a result of pregnancy, feeding, diel or seasonal cycles, sex, body size, molting, etc. Temperature selection of diamondback water snakes (Nerodia rhombifera) was measured in thigmothermal gradients with a 30 gauge copper-constantan thermocouple placed in the cloaca. Gravid snakes were identified with ultra-sound scanning. Snakes were acclimatized to certain photoperiods and temperatures for more than 2 weeks before experimental use. Pregnancy had significant impacts on thermoregulation. Gravid snakes spent longer times at higher temperatures and had a higher mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ than nongravid or postparturition females. The diel cycle of T$\sb{\rm b}$ in gravid animal was abolished when compared with the diel cycle of nongravid and postparturition snakes. Gravid snakes thermoregulate more precisely than nongravid and postparturition individuals. Satiated snakes were left in the gradient for six days; I found no significant postprandial thermophily. However, thermoregulatory precision varied among the six days of testing and was most precise during the first day (24-48 hours after feeding). In summer, shortened photoperiod did not influence the mean T$\sb{\rm b}$ but did reduce the amplitude of the diel cycle. On the contrary, decreased acclimation temperature lowered mean preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ but the amplitude of the daily rhythm remained unchanged. Paradoxical combinations of photoperiod and temperature (e.g., short day length and low temperature in summer) did not alter overall T$\sb{\rm b}$ but did influence the amplitude of the daily cycle. Season had a significant influence on preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$. More precise thermoregulation was observed during scotophase than during photophase in summer with normal acclimatization (longer daylength, higher temperature). Photoperiod had no effect on thermoregulatory precision but lower temperature reduced precision. No difference in preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$ or thermoregulatory precision was observed between sexes. Neither male nor female snakes had correlations between body size and preferred T$\sb{\rm b}$. During ecdysis, snakes did not select a significantly different T$\sb{\rm b}$ from non-shedding individuals.

TI  - Remote sensing and ecosystem simulation modeling of the intermountain sagebrush-steppe, with implications for global climate change
SP  - 114
AB  - Three papers are presented that focus on remote sensing and ecosystem simulation modeling of the Intermountain Northwest sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. The first utilizes Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data to derive seasonal greenness indices of three predominant vegetation communities in south-central Washington, U.S.A. Temporal signatures were statistically separated, and used to create a supervised classification for the three communities by integrating Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices over the growing season. The integrated classification scheme accuracy was 75% when compared to 53 ground-truthed sites, but was less accurate (62%) when applied to a more topographically variable region. The second paper develops a logic for treating the intermountain sagebrush-steppe as a mosaic of distinct, hydrologically partitioned vegetation communities, and identifies some critical ecophysiological considerations for process modeling of arid ecosystems. Soil water and nutrient dynamics of an ecosystem process model were modified to simulate productivity and seasonal water use patterns in Artemisia, Agropyron, and Bromus communities for the same south-central Washington study site. 60 year simulations maintained steady state vegetation productivity while predicting soil moisture content for 56 dates in 1992 with R$\sp2$ values ranging from 0.93 to 0.98. In the third paper, the model was used to derive projections of the response of the ecosystem to natural and general circulation model (GCM)-predicted climate variability. Simulations predicted the adaptability of a less productive, invasive grass community (Bromus) to climate change, while a native sagebrush (Artemisia) community does not survive the increased temperatures of the GCM climates. High humidity deficits and greater maintenance respiration costs associated with increased temperatures limit the ability of the sagebrush community to support a relatively high biomass, and substantial increases in soil water storage and subsurface outflow occur as the vegetation senesces.

TI  - Development of genetic transformation methods for the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acari: Phytoseiidae)
SP  - 111
AB  - The goal of this thesis was to develop a method for introducing heterologous DNA sequences into the genome of the predatory mite Metaseiulus occidentalis (Phytoseiidae). Phytoseiid mites are important biological control agents in numerous crops. Development of a generic DNA delivery system, independent of species-specific vectors, may be widely useful among the members of this important family. The first chapter provides an introduction to biological control, the Phytoseiidae and an overview of the current status of genetic transformation of arthropods. The chapter provides an understanding of the place phytoseiids have occupied in agriculture as well as an overview of previous research on these predators. The overview of genetic transformation of arthropods provides a context for the thesis. Chapter two describes a method for transient transformation of larval phytoseiid mites. I also provide evidence that the Drosophila heat shock70 promoter (hsp70) functions in two species of phytoseiids, M. occidentalis and Amblyseius finlandicus. Additionally, the Escherichia coli $\beta$-galactosidase gene (lacZ) is useful for expression assays in these two species. In Chapter three, the DNA delivery system, maternal microinjection, was developed. The plasmid pJKP2, containing the Drosophila hsp70/E. coli lacZ fusion, was injected into gravid M. occidentalis females. Plasmid sequences in the progeny of injected females were revealed by $\beta$-galactosidase activity. Hemi-nested PCR revealed plasmid sequences in the sixth generation after microinjections. Although Southern blot analysis is required to confirm the chromosomal location of the plasmid sequences, the evidence strongly suggests the mites were stably transformed. Maternal microinjection may provide a generic DNA delivery system for phytoseiids and may also be useful in other arthropods. Chapter 4 examines the persistence of microinjected DNA in M. occidentalis females. I also investigated, in both M. occidentalis and A. finlandicus, its transmission to eggs deposited after microinjection. The presence of plasmid sequences was determined by hemi-nested PCR. Microinjected DNA persists in M. occidentalis females for more than 24 hours. In the A. finlandicus study, the plasmid sequences are found in 1-25 eggs deposited after microinjection. The results suggest maternal microinjection is an efficient method for introducing foreign DNA into predatory mites.

TI  - Phenology of Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), and development of springtime migrant source populations
SP  - 219
AB  - Oviposition among laboratory-reared Empoasca fabae under various photoperiods and temperatures was recorded for 40 d of adulthood. Short daylengths decreased the proportion of females ovipositing, increased the preoviposition period, and decreased the rate of oviposition. The photoperiodic response is evidence of diapause induction. Late instar E. fabae collections from New York were field-reared for a heat-unit accumulation sufficient for reproductive maturation under non-diapause inducing conditions. The percent females becoming reproductively mature declined to $<$50% after mid-July.<p> Overwintering females collected 15 Jan. 1991 had no mature oocytes. In the laboratory, short daylengths and low temperatures helped maintain this state. Most females (65%) collected in late February had mature oocytes. It is inferred that diapause was broken in field populations between mid-January and late February. Winter field surveys revealed diapausing adults on a variety of primarily exotic herbaceous legumes in areas near the Gulf Coast, and on native evergreens, especially pines, almost throughout the southern pine region. E. fabae caged on branches of Rb-enhanced loblolly pine contained high Rb levels, suggesting that pines may be used for food. Surveys of pines and legumes in 1992 indicated diapause was broken in mid-February, when E. fabae moved to leguminous hosts for oviposition. Spring generations were also produced on many deciduous trees. These results indicate that E. fabae is well-adapted to native conditions in temperate North America, and suggest that its phenology includes a return migration to overwintering areas. Populations presumed to be Empoasca fabae were collected from various host plants and locations, then electrophoretically assayed for 12 enzyme loci. No genetic differentiation between populations was evident. Diagnostic alleles were found to distinguish E. fabae from E. erigeron, E. cf. perlonga and E. kraemeri. In laboratory and field studies, E. fabae development time between different springtime leguminous host species varied only slightly. Predictions of five published temperature dependant models of development were generally within 10% of the true mean. In the field, model accuracy varied only slightly with different sources of temperature data. Any of three models are recommended for use with temperature data from standard weather stations for predicting mean development time of migrant source populations.

TI  - Lizard reproductive ecology: Sex determination and parental investment
SP  - 212
AB  - Two modes of sex determination occur in lizards: genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Within each of these two major modes, there are many different variants, or mechanisms. Male heterogamety, female heterogamety, multiple sex chromosome systems, and homomorphic sex chromosome systems are all types of GSD found in lizards. Two patterns of TSD have been reported. Less than 50 lizard species have been investigated, but there is considerable diversity in the sex-determining mechanisms reported thus far. Apparently, TSD (and/or GSD) has evolved multiple times within a given taxon. Presently, both GSD and TSD are found in the Agamidae, Eublepharidae, and Gekkonidae, and possibly in the Iguanidae and Lacertidae as well. Only GSD has been reported for the Scincidae and Teiidae. Correlations within the Eublepharidae (Coleonyx, Eublepharis, Hemitheconyx) suggest an adaptive explanation for the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms; a shift from male-larger dimorphism to female-larger (or no sexual size-dimorphism) is accompanied by a shift in sex-determining mode. These shifts are in agreement with similar correlations observed in turtles. Differential growth between animals from different incubation temperatures has been proposed as one mechanism by which TSD might be selectively advantageous over GSD. Growth studies conducted on two members of the Eublepharidae (Coleonyx variegatus and Hemitheconyx caudicinctus) indicate that in these species, TSD may offer differential advantages to the sexes that GSD cannot provide. Factors leading to evolutionary shifts in sex-determining mode may also lead to parental determination of offspring sex ratio. In Anolis carolinensis, larger mothers produced a higher proportion of males than smaller mothers. Larger mothers also produced larger eggs, and thus larger offspring. Consequently, the average size of male hatchlings was greater than that of female hatchlings. Because bigger males mate more frequently than do smaller males in this polygynous species, larger male hatchlings should have a selective mating advantage, assuming that large hatchling males attain larger size more quickly than small males. We believe this to be the first evidence of parental control of offspring sex ratio in lizards.

TI  - Factors influencing selfing and outcrossing in the hermaphrodite, bulinus truncatus
SP  - 1
AB  - Phally, a genital dimorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine factors maintaining outcrossing within an animal species in the presence or recombination. Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilise, but aphallics cannot donate sperm because they do not develop a functional penis and prostate. This thesis investigates proximate and ultimate factors maintaining euphally within populations of aphallics in the African freshwater snail, Bulinus truncatus (Audouin). Laboratory and field data suggest that parasite pressure due to trematode infection plays a role in maintaining the potential for outcrossing in B. truncatus. Chapter 1 provides a phylogenetic analysis of gastropod taxa where loss of male outcrossing ability has been reported. Such taxa are rare and occur near the tips of the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that aphally is an unstable trait with limited evolutionary potential. Male outcrossing ability has been lost at least 13 times. Sister-taxa comparisons reveal no significant association between aphally and body size, habitat, distribution or ploidy level. Chapter 2 reports estimates of the heritability of phally in a laboratory population of B. truncatus from northern Nigeria. Contrary to previous investigations of B. truncatus, results here provide no evidence of a heritable component and strong evidence of an environmental component to phally determination. Chapter 3 demonstrates that phally was largely determined by temperature during egg and hatchling stages in two laboratory populations, with warmer temperatures favouring the loss of male outcrossing ability. Chapter 4 provides evidence that temperature during phally development influenced phally determination in natural populations of B. trunctus in northern Nigeria. By drawing an analogy with adaptive arguments for the maintenance of environmental sex determination, I suggest that temperature determination of phally will be favoured by selection if temperature predicts whether future conditions will favour outcrossing more accurately than current conditions. Chapter 5 evaluates field evidence for alternative ecological hypotheses that might explain the maintenance of outcrossing. A significant correlation between prevalence of trematode infection and proportion of euphallics across populations suggests that parasite pressure may generate selection for euphally, as predicted by hypotheses which stress the role of antagonistic coevolution in the maintenance of outcrossing.(D174516)

TI  - The physiology, biochemistry and toxicity of the marine dinoflagellate Prorocentrum hoffmannianum Faust (Pyrrophyta), and its role in seafood-borne human diseases
SP  - 142
AB  - The probable ciguatera causing dinoflagellate Prorocentrum hoffmannianum (SIU 364 & 882a) was examined in a series of culture experiments to optimize growth and toxin production. The results from this study suggest that P. hoffmannianum growth in culture can be stimulated by careful selection of culture medium. A comparison of eight culture media revealed that maximal growth (0.20 division$\cdot$day$\sp{-1}$) was achieved in h/2 enriched natural seawater medium with the addition of 0.903 ppm ammonium. Significant variation in growth and concentrations of the major intracellular macromolecules during acclimation indicate that acclimation has a profound effect on overall cell fitness. Based on pre- and post-acclimated reproduction rates, P. hoffmannianum cells appeared to acclimate to new environments after about one generation regardless of temperature or light intensity. In addition, significant variation in growth and potency over seven light (250 to 5000 lux) and three temperature regimes (22, 25 and 29$\sp\circ$C) shows that P. hoffmannianum cells have the ability to adjust to a wide range of environmental conditions. Consequently, growth and/or potency can be increased by complete acclimation of the cells to a given set of environmental conditions. Further examination of the changes in cell physiology and potency in P. hoffmannianum during one complete growth cycle revealed significant variation in total intracellular protein, carbohydrate, lipid, pigment and toxin content. The patterns of toxin synthesis for a fast-acting toxin(s) (FAT) and okadaic acid (OA) were similar to those of other cellular constituents, although toxin production showed the best correlation with lipid biosynthesis (r = 0.90). Maximal toxin content was found in late log to early stationary phase. Toxin synthesis was arrested along with the other primary metabolites in stationary phase. The discovery of two potent toxins in P. hoffmannianum cells (i.e. FAT and OA), an abundant primary producer in ciguatera-endemic regions of the world, suggests that P. hoffmannianum is a major contributor of toxins to the ciguatera syndrome in humans.

TI  - Ecology and comparative demography of the lizard Sceloporus grammicus: Life history of an altitudinal generalists on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico
SP  - 127
AB  - Population studies on the high altitude lizard Sceloporus grammicus were conducted using mark-recapture methods on two study sites located at 3,700 m elevation (low altitude site) and 4,400 m elevation (high altitude site), on the eastern slope of the Iztaccihuatl Volcano, Puebla, Mexico, over a four year period to assess differences in thermal biology, growth rates, and demographic characteristics. Regardless of contrasting differences in environmental conditions between study sites, individual lizards maintained similar active body temperatures, growth rates, and population parameters. Active body temperatures at both study sites were approximately 32$\sp\circ$C. However, individual lizards at the low elevation site showed a greater resistance to high temperatures than individual lizards at the high elevation site. Acclimation to higher environmental temperatures at the low elevation site may explain the greater heat tolerance. Females in both populations grew slower and attained asymptotic sizes earlier in life than males (0.0025 mm per day and 49.7 mm snout-vent length for females vs 0.0027 mm per day and 53.2 mm snout-vent length for males). Growth rates of neonates were between 0.10 and 0.15 mm per day in both sexes and sites. Differential cost of thermoregulatory behavior, and differences in the number of predators and competitors between study sites are possible explanations for similar growth rates at both sites. Individual lizards at both study sites attained maturity at about 14-15 months of age. Females body size at this age was about 39-40 mm at both study sites. Females produced a single litter per year and litter size depended on female body size. Females at low elevation produced an average 3.64 $\pm$ 0.10 young per litter and at high altitude 3.31 $\pm$ 0.129 young per litter. Survivorship was slightly greater at the low elevation site, however, average survivorship for all years of data combined was not significantly different between study sites. Two different predation indices, percentage of broken tails and flushing distance, were greater at the low elevation site than at the high elevation site. Biotic factors reflected in higher syntopic competitors and higher predation indices appear to be responsible for population regulation at the low elevation site. Abiotic selective factors, especially low temperatures and shorter growing seasons, probably regulate population size at the high elevation site.

TI  - Physiological, population, and genetic responses of an aquatic insect (Isonychia bicolor) to chronic mercury pollution
SP  - 157
AB  - Responses to sublethal concentrations of mercury were determined and compared for several populations of the mayfly, Isonychia bicolor from sites on two mercury polluted rivers in Virginia (USA). Results from laboratory respiration experiments indicated that small nymphs were more sensitive to mercury than larger nymphs, and that sensitivity increased with temperature. In addition, mayfly nymphs from polluted sites on the less contaminated South River were found to be more resistant to sublethal doses of inorganic mercury than nymphs from a reference site as indicated by smaller changes in respiration following exposure. Results of preexposure treatments suggested a genetic basis for the observed tolerance. No evidence of tolerance was observed in nymphs from the more contaminated Holston River. Field surveys revealed no significant differences in age structure, growth, or survival between populations at reference and polluted sites on the South River. However, growth and survival of nymphs from the polluted site on the Holston River were significantly slower than at the reference site during the summer. In fact, shortly after the summer generation hatched, nymphal density at contaminated sites declined to zero. This apparent local extinction may have been due to increased toxicity of mercury at warmer temperatures. Results of reciprocal transplant experiments conducted at sites on the South River suggested that population differences in maintenance costs observed in short-term laboratory experiments, may have been reflected by population differences in fecundity in long-term field experiments. When nymphs from the reference site on South River were transplanted and allowed to develop at a contaminated site, lower fecundities were observed than for the native population. No population differences in fecundities were observed on the Holston River. The relationship between allozyme genotype to survival of I. bicolor nymphs to acute mercury exposure was also tested. The probability of survival and individual times to death (TTD) were found to be significantly different among genotypes at the Glucose Phosphate Isomerase (GPI) locus. This was true at both summer and winter temperatures and for populations from two separate, unpolluted streams. However, genotypes identified as sensitive and tolerant in these experiments showed no consistent relationship with environmental mercury levels in polluted rivers. Therefore, the use of allozyme variants as a biomarker to assess evolutionary change in populations due to mercury pollution may be impractical in freshwater systems.

TI  - Colorado potato beetle populations in eastern North Carolina: Insecticide resistance detection and seasonal history
SP  - 176
AB  - Results from a residual bioassay procedure for monitoring insecticide resistance in populations of Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), for the purposes of predicting control failures, were related to insecticide efficacy in North Carolina potato, Solanum tuberosum L., fields in 1989 and 1990. A binomial classification, where each bioassay unit was classified as resistant or susceptible by visual inspection, provided a rapid and accurate method of predicting mean mortality in the bioassay. The proportion of units in a sample classified as resistant was the criterion used to predict the likelihood of a control failure. In 1991, this approach was validated, and additional tests revealed that a higher bioassay concentration would more reliably and easily predict the likelihood of a control failure. The utility of our approach to evaluating resistance monitoring data and a two concentration bioassay strategy are discussed. Further analysis of bioassay data from 1987 to 1990 studies revealed significant correlations between mean bioassay mortalities for different insecticides which were concluded to be cross-resistance between insecticides within the same insecticide class (carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) and multiple resistance between insecticides from different classes. Studies of the seasonal history of Colorado potato beetle populations in eastern North Carolina were conducted from 1989 to 1991. Emergence of overwintered adults and population trends were related to heat unit accumulation. Beetle and host plant densities were low throughout the summer after potato harvest. First generation adults fed potato plants oviposited and were more active than tuber fed adults which never oviposited. Adult overwintering survivorship varied by food source: potato plants (66 to 70%), tubers (0 to 14.3%), and no food (0 to 8.3%). Intensive sampling of commercial potato fields in 1990 and 1991 indicated that adult colonization and oviposition patterns varied with crop rotation but that infestations began at field edges and progressed inward. Management of potato beetle populations is discussed in light of these findings.

TI  - Thermal and spatial ecology of a northern population of snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina
SP  - 134
AB  - Temperature selection and space use by free-ranging snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in Algonquin Park was studied over four years using radiotelemetry. The mean temperature experienced by turtles during the annual activity period (May-August) was 22.3$\sp\circ$C, and they utilized only 12.7% of opportunities to maintain body temperatures at or above preferred body temperature (PBT). Recently fed turtles did not bask nor did they select warmer temperatures than nonfed turtles. Fed turtles characteristically retired to shallow water and buried in the substrate for up to 48 hours after eating. While their eggs were forming, female turtles did not select warmer temperatures than nor bask as often as males. The annual pattern of space use was divided into three components based on seasonal differences in resource requirements: hibernacula, reproduction-related resource area (RRA) and food-related resource area (FRA). Seasonal differences in activity and space use were observed between males and females. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Factors affecting the rotational use of insecticides for the management of resistance in mosquitoes
SP  - 1
AB  - The rotation of the use of chemically unrelated insecticides has been advocated to delay the build up of resistance. To examine this concept in the laboratory, Anopheles albimanus and Culex guinquefasciatus were subjected to two kinds of rotational selection which may be referred to as short term pre-planned rotation and "opportunistic" rotation. No difference was observed between these two methods in term of the time for each resistance level to reach 5Q%. The effectiveness of selection for resistance depends on the protection conferred by resistance genes and this was tested by laboratory releases of the DDT resistant and susceptible homozygotes and heterozygotes of An. gambiae into DDT sprayed and unsprayed miniature huts. All the genotypes were killed with freshly applied DDT but survivors were observed from month 2, 3 and 5 onwards for RR, RS and SS genotypes, respectively. Persistence of DDT on the sprayed wall and roof of the mud hut was studied by bioassays and biochemical assays on scrapings from the wall and roof. Linkage between resistance genes could effect the rotational use of insecticides. No linkage was found between propoxur and dieldrin resistance genes by combining bioassay and biochemical methods. As a preparation for a field studies in Malaysian field collected Aedes aegypti and Culex guinguefasciatus larvae were selected with temephos and Bti. Cx guinguefasciatus responded to temephos selection but Ae. aegypti did not respond to temephos and neither species responded to Bti selection. ~ Caged adults were exposed to thermal fogging in the field. The partially resistant Cx guinguefasciatus strain hardly survived any better than susceptible strains. Resistant and susceptible larvae were exposed to water samples from containers which had been treated with temephos sand granules. 100% mortality was obtained for all the strains up to week 6. Resistant Culex started to survive at week 7 but susceptibles did not do so until week ten. The prospects for the various proposed strategies for resistance management are discussed.

TI  - The rickettsia-like organisms of Glossina spp
SP  - 1
AB  - The rickettsia-like organisms (RLO) of tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) have been isolated and cultured in vitro from haemocytes of seven species and sub-species of tsetse. The symbionts have been identified by morphological, biochemical and pathological studies as members of the genus Wolbachiae , of the order Rickettsiales . The organisms are shown to be immunologically distinct from the midgut mycetome bacteroids, (symbiotes) of tsetse. Differences in protein composition have been detected between RLO from different subspecies and species of tsetse. These differences are not detectable by DNA restriction enzyme analysis and three specific DNA probes have been produced to identify unambigously RLO in tsetse tissues. RLO which are inherited through the egg cytoplasm have been associated with susceptibility to midgut infection with trypanosomes which is also cytoplasmically inherited in tsetse. Studies of RLO frequency indicate large differences occur between species which are reflected in the vectorial capacity of teneral flies. Increased susceptibility to trypanosome infection in a selected line of G. m. morsitans is shown to be a teneral phenomenon. RLO are shown to produce chitinase which digests chitin, the products of which are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D+ glucosamine. Both of these carbohydrates are shown to increase the susceptibility of teneral and previously fed tsetse by inhibiting the trypanocidal midgut lectin produced in flies in response to a blood-meal. Antibiotic and temperature treatments were used to reduce the numbers of RLO in flies. Decrease in RLO numbers was accompanied by a loss of susceptibility to trypanosome infection in teneral flies suggesting a causal relationship. The relative advantages and disadvantages of RLO infection of tsetse are discussed and a mechanism is suggested for the role of RLO in tsetse susceptibility to trypanosome infection.

TI  - Interaction of dwarfing genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and their adaptation to high temperature
SP  - 1
AB  - Four Pakistan semi-dwarf sping varieties Blue Silver, Faisalabad, Barani and Kohinoor were crossed with four selection lines from the cross Falchetto X Mexicani (32-6-5-8, 36-17-17, 147-12 and 149-1-5). GA3 insensitivity tests demonstrated that the spring varieties Blue Silver and Faisalabad carry Rht2Rht2, Kohinoor Rht1Rht1 semi-dwarf genes from Norin-10 and Barani Rht1SRht1S from Saitama-27. The semi-winter lines 32-6-5-8 and 36-17-17 carry Rht1Rht1, 147-12 was heterozygous for Rht1rht1 and 149-1-5 is a double dwarf line with Rht1Rht1 and Rht8Rht8. All the semi-winter lines were homozygous for the D2D2 grass dwarf gene except 147-12 which was heterozygous. All the spring varieties used in this investigation did not carry grass dwarf genes except Barani which carries a potent D1 gene. Vernalization and photoperiod studies demonstrated that all the Pakistan varieties are spring genotypes and some are insensitive to day length. In the F3 yield trial conducted in a high temperature greenhouse environment (> 26oC) the spring parent varieties were not significantly different and had the lowest yield, the semi-winter F3 hybrid lines were ranked as intermediate and the semi-winter parent lines gave the highest yield per plant due to an increased number of spikes. Tip sterility was observed in the semi-winter line 147-12 and was severe in same progeny in all the Faisalabad crosses except 32 X Faisalabad. The tip sterility was due to an interaction between certain genotypes and temperatures above 26oC. Greenhouse studies of the F4 hybrid lines and their parents have shown that temperatures maintained above 24oC compared to lower temperatures (16-26oC) reduced the yield and its components of all the genotypes but the semi-winter double dwarfs (Rht1Rht2) were particularly susceptible. The semi-dwarf gene Rht1 probably had an additive interaction with grass dwarf genes (D1D2) reducing the vigour and height of grass dwarf plants. The F3 grass dwarf lines selected from crosses between Barani and four semi-winter lines were not significantly different for yield and yield components when grown at 26oC probably due to the very low yield potential of the environment. Genotype X environment interaction studies of four spring varieties and semi-winter parent lines were conducted in high temperature environments at Close House 1988 and 1989, Rajshahi (Bangladesh) 1989 and 1990, and Faisalabad (Pakistan) 1989.

TI  - Physiological characterization of lactic acid bacteria. Malolactic fermentation in Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 220
SP  - 182
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in winemaking because they are responsible for malo-lactic fermentation (MLF). MLF is the decarboxylation of L-malic acid to L-lactic acid and CO$\sb2$; this process produces an increase of environmental pH. After alcoholic fermentation LAB can proliferate to carry out MLF. pH, temperature, CO$\sb2$, ethanol and SO$\sb2$ are the main parameters that affect the growth of LAB in wine. The influence of the four first parameters on the growth of six selected LAB strains isolated from musts and wines have been studied. Both strains belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum species were the most resistant to adverse conditions of pH, temperature and ethanol. Growth of L. plantarum CECT 220 was inhibited by increasing percentages of CO$\sb2$ in the incubation atmosphere. Both strains belonging to L. plantarum species and the wild strain belonging to Leuconostoc oenos species were the most resistant strains to high percentages of ethanol (up to 14% v/v). The growth of the heterofermentative species, Lactobacillus brevis and L. oenos was enhanced by increasing the percentage of CO$\sb2$ in the incubation atmosphere. MLF produces neither energy nor redox potential itself. Thus, the role of this process in LAB metabolism is still poorly understood. Since MLF increases external pH, it seems to be involved in protecting cells from deleterious effects of acidic environments. MLF is also involved in the maintenance of a higher pH gradient that provides an energetic advantage to the cell, enhancing cell viability at acidic pH values when L-malic acid is degraded. Energy production from L-malate degradation by L. plantarum CECT 220 seems to be related to the ability to degrade lactate by this microorganism. L. plantarum CECT 220 is able to generate a pH gradient at pH 3.0 both in presence of L-malate or glucose and this gradient is not dissipated by DCCD. This could suggest that at very acidic pH values, pH gradient could be established by a secondary unknown mechanism.

TI  - Sexual maturation and smoltification in Baltic salmon (Salmo salar): Alternative life histories in male parr
SP  - 30
AB  - The thesis deals with the interactions between growth, early sexual maturation, and smoltification in salmon (Salmo salar) male parr. Methods. Individual tagging techniques (PIT-tags, Carlin-tags), implantation of androgens, radioimmunoassay, castration, manipulation of food ration and temperature, seawater challenge test, registration of migratory behaviour, and river releases of individually tagged fish. Main results. The probability for maturation among 1+ male parr was positively related to the size at the end of the first summer. Maturing males grew slower than immatures after the onset of gonadal growth. The androgens testosterone (T) and 11-ketoandrostenedione (OA) had a seasonal effect on growth. From late June onwards, androgens depressed growth in immature fish. In contrast, the effect was positive in spring and early summer. The aromatizable androgen T, but not OA, stimulated gonadal growth in 1+ male parr. During the smoltification period previously mature males split into two groups, one which developed seawater adaptability (SWA) comparable to immature fish whereas the other did not. The latter group had higher gonadosomatic index than the former. Androgens inhibited both seawater adaptability and downstream migratory behaviour in immature fish. Spring-time castration of mature males did not improve seawater adaptability. Thermal treatment of previously mature male parr during winter-spring increased SWA and migratory capacity and decreased their propensity for sexual rematuration after transfer to net pens. Previously mature males released in the river had lower adult recapture rate than immature fish. The adult recapture rates were highest for fish released two weeks before the time of optimum SWA. I suggest that previously mature males have to chose between sexual rematuration and smoltification in spring, and that the decision is affected by body size and the conditions for growth over winter prior to smoltification. In hatcheries the incidence of sexual maturation a among male parr may be minimized by restricted feeding during spring and early summer. Furthermore, the proportion of smolting previously mature males may be enhanced by rearing them over winter in elevated water temperature.

TI  - Genetic studies on the Escherichia coli NusA transcription elongation factor
SP  - 127
AB  - The E. coli nusA gene product, NusA, which is known to influence transcription elongation, is essential for both bacterial viability and growth of lambdoid phages. NusA is relatively large protein which binds to RNA and RNA polymerase. The experiments described in this thesis were undertaken to investigate further the role of NusA in cellular function and in the growth of bacteriophage lambda. The E. coli conditionally lethal nusA10 cold-sensitive allele was cloned and sequenced. Changes from nusA$\sp+$ were observed at nucleotides 311 and 634. Functional studies showed that both nucleotide changes are necessary for the cold-sensitive phenotype, although bacteria with the change at nucleotide 634 grow more slowly at 30$\sp\circ$C than do the nusA$\sp+$ controls. The change at nucleotide 634 has a slight effect on the growth of some lambda derivatives. Revisions were made to the published DNA sequences of both the E. coli and the S. typhimurium nusA genes. A region of the E. coli NusA protein that can support bacteriophage lambda's N mediated antitermination reaction was defined by the construction of a hybrid S. typhimurium-E. coli nusA gene. The NusA protein is implicated as playing a role in plasmid stability by the observation of pUC18's instability in a nusA10 mutant. A chromosomal suppressor of this instability phenotype was selected and the responsible mutation was mapped to the 3 minute region of the E. coli chromosome. The suppressor mutation is recessive to wild-type. A gene was selected from a Bacillus subtilis DNA library that suppresses the E. coli nusA10 cold-sensitive mutant's lethality at 30$\sp\circ$C. The isolated suppressor gene is not the B. subtilis nusA gene. The deduced protein encoded by the B. subtilis gene does, however, show a large percentage amino acid sequence identity (56%) to the deduced protein sequence from a previously identified open reading frame in E. coli, orfE. The E. coli orfE gene does not suppress the lethal effects of the E. coli nusA10 mutation at 30$\sp\circ$C. Neither the B. subtilis orfE gene nor the E. coli orfE gene provides an essential function for vegatative growth, or in the case of B. subtilis, a function required for sporulation.

TI  - Winter survival strategy of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) in the upper Mississippi River
SP  - 166
AB  - An annual winter and early spring peak in numbers of impinged freshwater drum at Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station on Pool 14 of the Mississippi River has been observed. Most of the impinged fish, drawn in with cooling water from the main channel border, were less than 160 mm total length. Prior to impingement most fish were dead or moribund. Those that were still alive were incapacitated, i.e. weak and disoriented, and unable to resist even the slowest currents. Sampling in channel habitat revealed several fish species, including freshwater drum, drifting down river. Laboratory studies strongly indicated that exposure of small freshwater drum to temperatures at or near freezing caused incapacitation. Other potential causes including energy store depletion and disease were not related to incapacitation. Field studies confirmed that water at 0$\sp\circ$C was present in channel habitat for extended periods during winter. Lentic riverine habitats, e.g. sloughs, exhibited thermal stratification with water as warm as 5$\sp\circ$C available to fish. Heat stored in the substrate was believed to be the primary source of the higher temperatures in lentic habitats. Large numbers of small, healthy freshwater drum were found in the thermal refuges provided by sloughs. However, dissolved oxygen concentrations in some sloughs fell below those required by many fish species, while concentrations in the main channel remained high. Other measures of water quality were not adverse to fish. Two mechanisms could account for the presence of freshwater drum in the drift of the channels. First, dissolved oxygen depletion could force fish from the warmer sloughs into the 0$\sp\circ$C water of the channel. Second, colder water of the channels inundated some sloughs in late winter and early spring as ice and snow melt increased pool levels. Fish requiring the thermal refuges of the sloughs could be incapacitated and carried to the channel by the resulting current. The occurrence of several other fish species in the drift suggests that intolerance of winter channel conditions may not be limited to freshwater drum, which is recognized as a eurythermal species. If other species cannot survive exposure to 0$\sp\circ$C, the freshwater drum serves as a model for adaptation to riverine winter conditions through temperature-related habitat selection.

TI  - Physiological and behavioral consequences of reptilian life in the slow lane: Ecology of beaded lizards and rattlesnakes
SP  - 181
AB  - Although reptiles are well known for their low energy requirements and high efficiencies of biomass conversion, few studies have addressed the ecology and energetics of species with very low activity levels. I investigated the ecology and energetics of two such reptilian groups: helodermatid lizards, and viperid snakes. I radiotracked Mexican beaded lizards and three rattlesnake species in their natural environments to determine their activity patterns, the time and energy they invest in activity, home ranges, thermal biology, habitat and other resource use, and behavior. I measured metabolic rates in the laboratory to determine rates of energy use. Beaded lizards had a mean home range of 21.6 ha, an activity peak at 1800 hrs and traveled, on average, 25.3 km during approximately 121 h of surface activity over the year. They had very low metabolic rates during rest. However, helodermatids had maximal rates of oxygen consumption that were among the highest of any lizard measured, a trait that may be adaptive during their intensive male-male agonistic behaviors. Males had significantly higher capacities for aerobic activity than did females. Heloderma horridum can fulfill its annual maintenance energy requirements with a quantity of prey equivalent to approximately 1.4 times its body mass. Rattlesnakes had a mean home range size of 4.6 hectares and traveled, on average, 12.4 km over approximately 95 hours of annual surface activity. Rattlesnakes spent considerable time inactive on the surface, whereas Heloderma spent the vast majority of their time resting in shelters. Heloderma and Crotalus had similar body temperature preferences for activity (around 30 C). Like Heloderma, Crotalus had very low rates of metabolism during rest. A 300-g rattlesnake had a standard metabolic rate only 40% that of other squamate reptiles of similar mass, and could fulfill its yearly maintenance energy requirements with a prey quantity equivalent to 0.93 $\times$ its body mass, which could be met with 2-3 large meals. After feeding, free-ranging rattlesnakes exhibited thermophilic responses that varied, in part, due to their reclusive behavior, and thermal constraints in the environment. The temperatures selected for digesting and activity are apparently similar in rattlesnakes.

TI  - Regulation of migration and migratory strategy of autographa gamma
SP  - 1
AB  - This study investigates the environmental and genetic regulation of migration in the noctuid moth Autographa gamma (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). This is a common migrant species which is distributed throughout the palaearctic. Individuals make regular, seasonal migrations into areas at more northerly latitudes where they are unable to breed continuously. Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and after one, two or three generations, offspring of the spring migrants return to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East. Evidence for this long-distance movement is reviewed and light-trap records from a number of countries are presented. Migration usually occurs pre-reproductively and so the length of the adult pre-reproductive period (PRP) is a measure of the potential time available for migration. The length of the PRP varies from 1-11 days. Individuals reared in outdoor cages in Bangor in autumn had longer PRPs than individuals reared outside in summer. Laboratory studies showed that PRPs were extended at low temperatures and under short photoperiods. Access to sugar solution also influenced the length of the PRP. Evidence for genetic regulation of the PRP was obtained from full-sib correlations and selection experiments. Two selected lines were established, on the basis of female PRP, for early and late reproduction. After two generations, the PRP distributions of the two lines were significantly different. The mode of inheritance of the PRP was investigated by sib-analysis experiments and parent-offspring regressions. X-linked genes were shown to have the greatest influence on PRP, although there were also autosomal influences. Geographic variation in the PRP was shown in samples from Britain, Morocco, Germany and Sweden. There was some evidence of a genetic cline, with individuals at higher latitudes having longer PRPs. Data obtained from 17 families showed significant genotype-environment interactions, with certain families being more sensitive to photoperiodic cues in the control of the PRP. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the evolution of migration in A. gamma.

TI  - The viability of energy plantations in Thailand: an energy system approach using alternative conversion pathways
SP  - 243
AB  - Since the oil crisis in the mid 1970s and the recognition of impending fuelwood shortages in many developing countries, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of renewable energy sources such as biomass from energy plantations. As there has been considerable speculation regarding the economic attractiveness of energy plantations in developing countries, the objective of this thesis is to develop an approach to assess the viability of a hypothetical energy plantation in Northeast Thailand within a framework encompassing the price structure of alternative fuels. An integrated energy system approach has been developed for this project. The approach is based on the premise that the value of plantation biomass is not only based on the inherent properties of the feedstock but also on the efficiency and cost configurations of the energy conversion systems in which it is utilized. The approach encompasses a free standing plantation simulation model and an array of energy conversion technologies considered appropriate for a developing country. The energy conversion models used in the analysis account for the cost and heat content of alternative fuels and the scale, efficiency, cost configurations and fuel requirements of the conversion systems. The integrated approach permitted observations to be made of the extent prices of traditional and modern fuels affect the viability of energy plantations. When the value of plantation biomass was based on the price of fuelwood used for household cooking, the return on the plantation was unattractive. This finding illustrates a classic common property resource problem when the price of fuelwood from natural forests does not reflect the cost of growing wood or an impending fuelwood scarcity. The highest internal rate of return on equity capital for an industrial end-use was 15.2% obtained from plantation biomass used for electric power generation. Findings from the project suggest that energy plantations could be a valuable component of a long term strategy to develop socially acceptable renewable energy projects in Thailand.

TI  - LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE REGULATION OF MIGRATION IN THE COTTON BOLLWORM, HELIOTHIS ARMIGERA (HB.) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
SP  - 284
AB  - This study investigated two life-history traits of importance in the regulation of migration by Heliothis armigera (Hb.)--the pre-reproductive period (PRP) and flight. The first phase of this study involved improving the existing culture technique so that different geographical strains of H. armigera could be kept indefinitely and with confidence. Progress was achieved by containing the spread of disease, improving larval nutrition and increasing the mating success of H. armigera in the laboratory. Migration is thought to occur pre-reproductively in the Noctuidae. The PRP, therefore, represents the time window in which migration can take place. H. armigera has been considered previously to be a facultative migrant and therefore abiotic and biotic factors were investigated for their influence on the PRP. Neither high temperatures ($>$30$\sp\circ$C) nor high vapour-pressure deficits ($>$23 mm. Hg.) acted to lengthen the PRP. Access to a source of sugar solution (10% w./v.), however, was found to have a marked influence on the PRP. The PRP distributions of Indian and Malawian female H. armigera were compared and found to be significantly different. A sib-analysis experiment confirmed the genetic influence on the female PRP and showed the mode of inheritance to be X linked. Male H. armigera were also found to have a range in PRPs, the distribution of which was not significantly different to that of their female siblings. A selection experiment was carried out on the basis of female PRP only, to produce both an early and a late-maturing line of females. After just two generations of selection the PRP distributions of the males in the early and late-maturing lines were significantly different, with the divergence occurring in the same direction as for females. This result suggested that the same group of X-linked genes controls the rate of reproductive maturation in both males and females. The flight ability of both Indian and Malawian H. armigera was assessed using a tethered-flight system. Flight ability conformed to the typical pattern of the 'oogenesis-flight syndrome' with immature moths flying significantly more than either mature or mated moths. The heritability of tethered flight was investigated for Malawian H. armigera and the results were consistent with autosomal inheritance (h$\sp2\sb{(\rm Total\ Flying\ Time)}$ = 0.39 $\pm$ 0.083). The ability of the tethered-flight apparatus to identify migratory-flight behaviour by H. armigera is discussed. The results of this study are considered in relation to the evolution of migration in H. armigera.

TI  - Predation and diel vertical migration in zooplankton
SP  - 129
AB  - Of the several hypotheses put forth to explain the adaptive significance of diel vertical migration (DVM) in zooplankton, predator evasion is perhaps the most common. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis remains elusive. This dissertation probes the predator evasion hypothesis, as well as alternatives, by combining a series of field and experimental studies. Results from four field studies are presented. First, variable DVM in the copepod Calanus pacificus in Dabob Bay, Washington is shown to be statistically significantly related only to the abundance of planktivorous fish, and not to any of several other environmental parameters (i.e., degree of thermal stratification, phytoplankton stock, and copepod egg production rate). Second, variable DVM in Acartia hudsonica in Jakles Lagoon (San Juan Island, Washington) is likewise shown to be statistically significantly related to only predator abundance, and not to either secchi disk depth or degree of thermal stratification. Third, the strength of reverse DVM in the copepod Pseudocalanus newmani in Dabob Bay is shown to be statistically significantly related to the potential predation intensity of invertebrate predators, with an occasional role for planktivorous fish. Fourth, variable DVM behavior in adult female Euchaeta elongata is related to differential susceptibility to planktivorous fish: nonovigerous females enter the surface layer only under the cover of darkness, whereas the more susceptible ovigerous females almost never do so, remaining at depth both day and night. These four field studies marshal evidence that support one hypothesis, to the exclusion of alternatives, for the adaptive significance of DVM in zooplankton: predator evasion. In an effort to go beyond the correlative approach inherent in such field studies, a series of experimental predator-prey manipulations in large in situ enclosures were undertaken. These experiments provide unambiguous evidence that DVM in A. hudsonica is an evasive response to its naturally occurring predator, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Furthermore, this response is shown to result from individual copepods exercising phenotypic plasticity in their migration behavior, and not from a population-genetic level response to selective predation. These responses are likely elicited by visual cues or mechanical stimuli, rather than by chemical cues.

TI  - Effects of dehydration on ratings of perceived exertion at the lactate and ventilatory thresholds
SP  - 104
AB  - Depletion of body water leads to a reduction in physical performance capacity. It has been hypothesized that alterations in anaerobic function, thermoregulation, or perception of effort may be responsible. Mean ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) at the lactate threshold (LT) and ventilatory threshold (VT) have been reported to be relatively constant. Whether or not RPE at LT and VT are altered by dehydration is not known. The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of varying levels of dehydration on RPE at LT and VT. Nine male subjects completed three progressive cycling tests under three hydration conditions. Two days prior to each test subjects exercised in a warm (38$\sp\circ$C) environment for 1.5 hours on both days. Food and fluid intake was controlled to achieve either a 0%, 3%, or 6% loss in body weight. During each test, ventilation (Ve), oxygen uptake (VO2), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HR) and rectal temperature (Tr); plasma concentrations of hemoglobin (Hb), free-fatty acids, (FFA), glucose (Glu) and glycerol (Gly); blood lactate concentration (La); and hematocrit (Hct) were measured. LT was determined by computer from plots of log lactate to log VO2. VT was determined visually from plots of Ve/VO2 and Ve/VCO2. The significance of mean differences among dehydration conditions for responses at selected submaximal exercise intensities, and at the LT and VT was determined using a repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc tests. During submaximal exercise, at intensities between 40 and 80% of VO2max, RPE, VO2, RER, Ve, HR, La, FFA, Gly, Hct and plasma volume change were not significantly different among treatments. Significant differences were observed in (Hb) between the 0%- and both 3%- and 6%- dehydration conditions. Dehydration of 6% caused a significant increase in Glu compared to the 3%- and 0%- dehydration conditions. A significant difference in Tr was observed between the 0%- and 6%- dehydration conditions. Dehydration did not significantly alter LT or VT, or the cardiorespiratory, metabolic and perceptual responses at LT or VT. It was concluded that up to 6% dehydration does not alter ratings of perceived exertion, lactate threshold or ventilatory threshold, and the rating of perceived exertion at lactate threshold or ventilatory threshold.

TI  - Quantitative genetic analyses of the photoresponse in the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus
SP  - 112
AB  - Species living in temperate and arctic regions are faced with seasonal changes in the environment, such as temperature and food availability. Many of these species are photoperiodic. The short-day (e.g., 9 hours of light per day) response of the Djungarian hamster, Phodopus sungorus, is usually characterized by weight loss, molt to a white pelage, gonadal regression, increased thermogenesis and daily torpor. However, not all hamsters respond to short-day photoperiod; preliminary studies suggested that there was genetic influence on photoresponsiveness (see Lynch et al (1989) J. Comp. Physiol. A 164:475). This study confirms that photoresponsiveness is a heritable character in the Djungarian hamster. Both parent-offspring regression and replicated bidirectional selection on a photoresponse index (PI = body weight loss (in grams) + 2 x molt index after 12 weeks of short-day exposure) indicated a significant additive genetic component of phenotypic variance in photoresponsiveness (b$\sb{\rm op}$ = 17% in females, 46% in males; R/S (high lines) = 39% in females, 36% in males; R/S (low lines) = 37% in both females and males). Significant heritabilities were estimated by parent-offspring regression for other measures of photoresponse (i.e., body weight loss and molt index after 12 weeks in short-day photoperiod, and threshold for responsiveness (as measured by PI and molt index)). Four generations of selection on PI significantly altered the percentage of responsive individuals relative to nonselected control hamsters (89.6% responsive in high lines, 77.5% in control lines and 55.1% in low lines); however, analysis of variance indicated that neither the degree nor the timing of the response was significantly changed by selection. Analysis of variance in the control lines also indicated that the number of responsive parents does not influence the degree of response in responsive offspring, although it does affect the percentage of responsive offspring (27.9%, 66.7% and 77.2% with 0, 1 or 2 responsive parents, respectively). Although the threshold for photoresponsiveness appears to be related to at least two aspects of the circadian system (free-running period and phase angle to lights-off), the degree of response does not correlate with either of these circadian characters. Therefore, it appears that the underlying threshold for the photoresponse is genetically and physiologically independent of degree of response.

TI  - Ultrametamorphism and anatexis of the continental crust: An experimental and theoretical study
SP  - 281
AB  - The generation of silica-rich magmas by anatexis of metamorphic rocks in the continental crust constitutes an imprecise boundary between metamorphism and igneous activity. This diffuse boundary spans the transition between different modes of mass and energy transfer in the crust and can cause profound changes in the mechanical behaviour and chemical constitution of the continental crust. I have pursued two complementary approaches, with the goal of fostering our quantitative understanding of the chemical and physical aspects of crustal anatexis. The first approach is an experimental investigation of the compositional controls on melt productivity from metapelitic rocks and of the effects of thermodynamic intensive variables on the compositions of melts and coexisting mineral phases. The other approach is a theoretical study of the relationships between the thermal structure and evolution of the crust, metamorphism and anatexis. Numerical simulations of thermal regimes during orogenesis show that anatexis is the expected end product of Barrovian metamorphism in thickened continental crust. Experimental results demonstrate that bulk composition of the source material is the overriding factor controlling the amount of H$\sb2$O-undersaturated melt formed at the temperatures (850 to 950$\sp\circ$C) that can normally be attained in continental crust subject to tectonic thickening. Melts formed in this temperature interval have a restricted compositional range and are notably silica-rich and felsic (68-73 wt.% SiO$\sb2$; MgO + FeO* + TiO$\sb2$ less than 3 wt.%). Melt production by dehydration-melting is maximized from protoliths whose modes coincide with the stoichiometric coefficients of the melting reactions, because generation of low-temperature granitoid liquids requires both quartzo-feldspathic components and H$\sb2$O (from hydrous minerals). Anatectic melts coexist in my experimental products with mafic and aluminous restitic mineral assemblages, which accommodate the excess refractory components present in the protolith. Pressure has a limited effect on melt fraction and composition, but affects the composition of biotite and the nature of the predominant ferromagnesian phases in restitic assemblages. My results show that anatexis can lead to internal differentiation of the continental crust, by generating a felsic and alkali-rich fusible fraction and a mafic and alumina-rich refractory fraction.

TI  - Physical and genetic analysis of the Bacillus subtilis (natto) fertility plasmid pLS20
SP  - 134
AB  - The 64.2-kilobase Bacillus subtilis (natto) plasmid pLS20 encodes functions required for conjugal transmission of plasmid DNA among a variety of Bacillus species. Localization of the transfer region on this plasmid was accomplished via the generation of transposon insertions and subsequent deletion analysis. Utilization of the temperature-sensitive transposition selection vector pTV1 allowed the isolation of a collection of pLS20::Tn917 derivatives. Insertion of Tn917 outside of the 10.8-kb BglII fragment of pLS20 did not affect the transfer abilities of the host cells harboring these plasmid mutants. Insertion of the transposon within the 10.8-kb BglII fragment led to the identification of two distinct regions of pLS20 involved in plasmid-mediated DNA exchange. Insertions into one portion of the 10.8-kb BglII fragment abolished the ability of pLS20 to transfer itself but did not affect the plasmid's ability to mobilize the tetracycline resistance plasmid pBC16. Mutants with insertions in another region of this fragment were almost completely transfer-deficient. Certain of the transposon-tagged derivatives, namely pLS20.3 and pLS20.4, incurred specific deletion following growth of host organisms for several generations in the presence of inhibitory levels of erythromycin. Deletion analyses revealed that loss of ca 15 kb of DNA encompassing of 10.8-kb BglII fragment results in total loss of conjugal transfer ability. Confirmation that this 10.8-kb BglII fragment contained all the DNA sequences necessary for conjugal DNA transfer came from cloning the fragment in the B. subtilis cloning vector pBD64. B. subtilis transformants carrying the pBD64 containing the cloned fragment were able to transfer the recombinant plasmid by conjugation at frequencies comparable to those obtained with B. subtilis donors carrying nondefective pLS20 or pLS20::Tn917 plasmids. The same region of pLS20 that is involved in transfer functions was also found to be involved in the suppression of motility of host organisms. Cells harboring pLS20 or the non-defective transposon-tagged derivatives appeared non-motile on 0.4% agar plates, and electron photomicrographs revealed the absence of flagella. However, cells cured of the plasmid or cells harboring the transfer-defective deletion derivatives pLS20.3$\Delta$1 and pLS20.4$\Delta$1 were flagellated and motile.

TI  - Factors influencing consumer potato storability in the warm tropics
SP  - 151
AB  - This study was done to determine the feasibility of and explore ways to store consumer potatoes in the warm tropics and reduce storage losses to acceptable levels. The research was done during 2 years, 1988 and 1989, at the mid-elevation jungle research station of the International Potatoe Center located at San Ramon (800 m elevation), Peru. Pathogen induced rotting is the major cause of loss during storage in the warm tropics. Studies were done to evaluate the storage potential of clones adapted to the warm tropics and determine if any significant relationship existed between storage potential and rotting response to Erwinia and Fusarium spp. when inoculated separately and simultaneously. Finding a suitable relationship would simplify screening in breeding programs to identify progeny with good storage potential. Some of the more suitable clones that were identified for storage in the warm tropics were Desiree, Kufri Jyoti, Serrana, LT-5 and B71 240.2. A significant relationship between storage potential and rotting induced by inoculation was only obtained when the Erwinia and Fusarium spp. were inoculated simultaneously. Since rapid wound healing is essential to reduce pathogen invasion and rotting, the rapidity of wound healing was evaluated. Thirteen of 15 test clones showed over a 90% reduction in F. solani induced dry rot after only 6 days at 25 C. Thus, this evaluation is probably not sufficiently sensitive to differentiate clones in their storage potential. Delaying harvest for 8 days after vine senescence to allow skin setting was slightly beneficial during the dry season but was detrimental during the wet season. A hazard of delaying harvest is the possibility of increased potato tuber moth (PTM) infestation. Removing visibly diseased, insect infested and damaged tubers before storage was very effective in reducing storage losses due to rotting and PTM infestation. Dipping potatoes in solutions of sodium hypochlorite and thiabendazole was very detrimental. However, dusting with thiabendazole just after harvest and dusting with chloro-isopropyl-phenyl-carbamate (CIPC) after 4 weeks was beneficial. CIPC did not reduce sprouting but completely controlled PTM infestation. This research has shown that it is possible to store potatoes in the warm tropics using the proper clones and procedures.

TI  - Petrology and geochemistry of mid-Pleistocene lavas from Seguam Island, central Aleutian Islands, Alaska: Implications for the chemical and physical evolution of oceanic island arc magmatic centers
SP  - 188
AB  - Theoretical, field, and laboratory investigations herein examine the origin and evolution of mid-Pleistocene magmas erupted from the central Aleutian volcanic center of Seguam Island. Thermal modeling demonstrates that repeated magma ascent and heating of the lithosphere is a dynamic process, which over the lifetime of a volcanic center may alter the crystallization and hybridization history of successive eruptive products. Superimposed on this thermal and chemical evolution, intra-arc extension has modified the thermal and mechanical properties of the central Aleutian lithosphere. K-Ar dates verify that voluminous tholeiitic basalt and basaltic andesite and subordinate andesite and dacite lavas erupted 1.07 to 0.07 Ma. Mineralogic evidence for closed-system equilibrium crystallization, low abundances of K2O, Na2O, Rb, Ba, Sr, and LREE, and uniform but anomalously high 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/ 204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, and 208Pb/ 204Pb ratios and remarkably low 143Nd/144Nd ratios indicate that Seguam basalt is unlike other Aleutian basalts. Seguam's geochemical uniqueness corresponds to its unusual position atop strongly extended arc crust. Extended and presumably hotter lithosphere allowed basaltic magmas to crystallize under closed-system equilibrium conditions at ca. 1200°C and <8 kb and to erupt readily at Seguam. Extensive plag+cpx+mt+/-ol+/-opx fractionation at 1200-1000°C and 1-4 kb produced the evolved lavas. In contrast, basalts from adjacent volcanic centers on unextended and presumably cooler lithosphere crystallized under disequilibrium conditions, at higher pressures, assimilated lower crustal and upper mantle rocks, and rarely erupted. The source of central Aleutian basalts may reside in the mantle wedge or subducted crust. Seguam basalt compositions cannot be derived by eclogite melting, but are consistent with partial melting of depleted peridotite plus a small fraction of subducted sediment. Along arc variations in the composition of the mantle wedge (proportion of fertile/depleted peridotite) or the subducted crust (fracture zone peridotite beneath Seguam, eclogite beneath Adak and Atka) may explain geochemical differences between these centers. Superimposed on this potential source variability are contrasting styles of magma ascent, i.e. open vs. closed system evolution, which may be facilitated by differing degrees of intra arc extension.

TI  - Growth of Larval and Juvenile Newts
SP  - 237
AB  - In smooth newts (Triturus vulgaris), adult body size is determined by mainly by growth during the pre-maturity stages. Adult body size is frequently related to reproductive success and hence fitness. This project examined factors affecting growth during the prematurity stages. Chapter 2 reviews the literature on the effects of adult body size on reproductive success in urodeles with particular reference to newts of the Triturus genus. This review identifies the need to experimentally test and further quantify body size effects. Two such studies are reported in Chapter 3. Chapter 3 examines the relationship between female body size and fecundity in female smooth newts and also examines short-term mating capacity in males. Female body size is strongly related to fecundity but there is only a weak relationship between male body size and the number of spermatophores deposited. Chapter 4 describes the pattern of growth of newt larvae (T. alpestris, T. cristatus and T. vulgaris) grown in the laboratory. Variation in larval period explains most of the body size variation at transformation. Chapters 5, 6 and 7 report studies investigating the effects of temperature, food availability, larval density, maternal effects, population effects and timing of oviposition on the growth of T. vittatus and T. vulgaris larvae in the laboratory and semi-natural conditions. Chapter 8 investigates growth during the eft stages of T. cristatus and T. vulgaris. The rank ordering of body sizes of individuals at transformation is preserved during the eft stage in T. vulgaris and T. cristatus, and to adulthood in T. cristatus. Variability between growth strategies of individual newts may have been naturally selected as a response to larval life in a variable and unpredictable environment.

TI  - Genotype-environment interaction study on sesame (Sesamum indicum L.)
SP  - 175
AB  - Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is a tropical oilseed found growing in the mid-altitude ($<$1700 m.a.s.l.) regions of Ethiopia. Recently, there has been an attempt by settler farmers from the Ethiopian plateau to expand sesame cultivation in the low altitude areas ($<$800 m.a.s.l.). A genotype-environment interaction study on sesame lines developed through progeny selection originating from a bulk of landraces was carried out at six environments in Ethiopia. The environments selected were believed to provide a wide variation in temperature (altitude), moisture and soil. The objective of the study was, therefore, to select a line or lines widely adaptable over these environments for variables seed yield, oil and protein content as well as fatty acid composition. Two statistical methods, namely, the regression model and the procedural approach of superiority measure were used to estimate line adaptability. Several lines were identified which were adapted over the six environments while others were specifically adapted to low- or high-yielding environments. Lines showing wide adaptation for one variable were not always widely adapted for others. In addition, the two parametric statistics used to analyze the data did not always agree for each variable.

TI  - Population and behavioral ecology of the dragonfly Sympetrum danae (Sulzer) (Odonata:Libellulidae)
SP  - 213
AB  - This study describes the population and behavioral ecology of a non-territorial dragonfly and explains behavioral variation by means of biotic and abiotic characteristics of the individual's environment. Data were collected by means of capture-recapture techniques and observations under natural conditions and in a field-cage. S. danae adults emerged asynchronically between in July-August. The population density peaked mid-August. The larger individuals emerged first, dispersed more when immature, and lived longer than the smaller ones. Matures showed a high tendency to disperse at an age of 25-30 days. Males and females showed significant differences in activity patterns: in males time and place were adjusted to the likelihood of encountering receptive mates, while females showed a pattern that resulted in a maximal male avoidance. 77% of the pair-formation occurred away from the water and before noon. The other pairs were formed at the pond around noon. Copulation lasted 15-20 min and shortened with time, temperature and the copulation sequence number for the male. Males removed 44-87% of the sperm from the female sperm-storage organs by means of their specialized penis, yielding 95% fertilization precedence. This explained the high degree of post-copulatory guarding: oviposition always started immediately upon copulation, and invariably started in tandem position. Tandem duration lasted longer at higher male densities. Oviposition sites with Sphagnum were preferred for oviposition. At high temperatures North oriented sites were chosen, while at low temperatures selected sites were South oriented. During oviposition frogs killed 10-14% of all females and only 3% of the males in tandem pairs. Pairs were attracted by one another and post-tandem females showed a high degree of site-fidelity. This was interpreted as an adaptation that reduced frog-predation. Mating success was not randomly distributed on a lifetime scale, nor on a daily scale. Males showed a higher variance than females. Larger males were more active and aggressive, and got more matings. No trade-off in terms of a shorter lifespan existed. Female mating success was limited by egg-production and depended mainly on lifespan. In both sexes the relative presence of the own sex reduced the mating probability.

TI  - Factors influencing photoperiodic control of egg diapause in Aedes albopictus (Skuse)
SP  - 157
AB  - In August of 1985, an infestation of Aedes albopictus, an oriental mosquito, was first found in Harris Co., Texas. The mosquito has since spread throughout the southern states as well as extending north to Chicago and Baltimore. The mode of introduction of this Stegomyia mosquito into the United States was through scrap tire shipments from ports in temperate Asia. Sensitivity to photoperiod was determined for temperate strains of Ae. albopictus. When females of temperate Ae. albopictus are exposed to short day lengths, they lay eggs that fail to hatch. Strains of Ae. albopictus from the tropics and subtropics, do not demonstrate sensitivity to photoperiods. All of 17 strains from the U.S. showed photoperiod-induced diapause; The Critical Photoperiod (CP) ranged between 13 and 14 hours of light. These strains were collected at latitude 26$\sp\circ$N through 42$\sp\circ$N; they showed a definite, albeit poorly defined, cline with regards to photoperiod. A more sharply defined cline is evident in Ae. albopictus strains from Japan. High temperatures (28$\sp\circ$-30$\sp\circ$C) overrode sensitivity to photoperiod for all strains examined. Diet caused a shift in CP. The CP was lengthened by 15 minutes when adults were starved as larvae. Aedes albopictus populations from Brazil (like populations from tropical Asia), are not photosensitive; they are biologically distinct from temperate populations. However, an hypothesis is proposed for a temperate origin for these populations. Response to laboratory selection for nondiapause in the TOKYO strain was fast and occurred within 5 generations. Aedes albopictus strains successfully overwintered in northern Indiana in the winters of 1986-88. Overwintering success is enhanced by photoperiod-induced dormancy and prolonged cold-conditioning. This has serious implications for the northward expansion of Ae. albopictus. A north-south cline in cold-hardiness is also suggested among populations in the U.S. An hypothesis is presented for diapause induction in Ae. albopictus. Data from transfer studies suggest that the accumulation of a 'product' produced by adults in short photoperiod ultimately induces diapause.

TI  - Pilot plant treatment of urban wastewater with macrophytes: Biochemical study and mathematical modeling
SP  - 427
AB  - The main objective of this study is to improve the quality of stabilization pond effluents through the use of macrophytes, especially with respect to the content of suspended solids. The experimental facility consisted of three channels operating in parallel which received raw wastewater coming from Cartagena (Spain). The macrophyte species selected initially for this study were Phragmites communis Trin and Lemna gibba L. The third channel was used as a control and was thus maintained as a microphyte wastewater pond throughout the experiments. The evolution of the wastewater in the pilot plant was monitored through the measurement of 21 parameters. The productivity and composition of the macrophytes have also been studied. A unidimensional simulation model of the resulting artificial wetland has been developed. The model consists of thermal and biochemical submodels. Mass balances were written for every one of the parameters, as well as an energy balance for the temperature calculations. Every balance involved diffusion, advection and transformation processes. The resulting system of non-linear, partial differential equations has been solved numerically using a finite differences scheme. The simulation model predicts the influence of several meteorological variables, as well as the composition of the influent, on the evolution over time of macrophytes, microphytes, zooplankton, bacterial biomass, COD, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and detrital mass. The agreement between computed and experimental data has been satisfactory. The results obtained in this study allow us to conclude that wastewater treatment with Pragmites communis is an efficient method that significantly reduces the effluent content in suspended solids. Other positive aspects of this system are the potential use of the biomass and the ecological value of biotope regeneration.

SP  - 444
AB  - Presented is a comprehensive review of the Fertility Capability Classification System encompassing the components of the system, their criteria, and management statements. The focus and intent of each component is stated and pertinent literature is reviewed to justify the criteria used to define each component. Several revisions or refinements of the original criteria are presented. New components are proposed including the R$\sp-$ subsurface type indicating the presence of a root restricting layer within 50 cm of the surface that can be ripped and produces a greater rooting depth. Proposed condition modifiers include the d$\sp{+}$ modifier separating the aridic (torric) soil moisture regime from the d modifier now indicating presence of an ustic or xeric regime; i$\sp{+}$ modifier indicating potential toxic levels of reduced iron in soils that are flooded for long duration; i$\sp{-}$ modifier separating high P fixing soils (due to high crystalline iron mineral presence) that have had their P fixing property ameliorated through large P applications; n$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing ESP values of between 6 and 15; x$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing moderate to high P fixing soils that do not qualify as having an i or x modifier; s$\sp{-}$ modifier recognizing EC values of between 2 and 4 dsm$\sp{-1}$; t modifier separating temerate region soils from those in the tropics; and the t$\sp{+}$ modifier separating those soils that have perennial cold temperatures that prohibit crop production. Management statements have been provided for these new components and additional statements have been included for existing components. Statements have also been added that are to be generated for the classified soil that serve to define the parameters querried by and therefore the scope of the system. Lastly, tables have been created stating the general adaptability of selected crops, and tropical and subtropical tree and pasture species to selected FCC parameters.

TI  - HOMEOVISCOUS ADAPTATION TO TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE: A BIOPHYSICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL STUDY (TEMPERATURE ADAPTATIONS, PRESSURE ADAPTATIONS, BIOPHYSICAL STUDY)
SP  - 226
AB  - Animals have invaded habitats with widely varying conditions of temperature, pressure, salinity, pH etc. Underlying the survival and "fitness" of animals in potentially hostile environments are a suite of physiological adaptations which allow vital physiological processes to proceed where they would otherwise fail. Two main groups of animal can be classified according to the strategies used to maintain "normal" physiological and biochemical function in the face of environmental change: (1) Regulators--maintain a constant internal environment of temperature, pressure, osmotic pressure etc. (2) Conformers--are unable to regulate their internal environment and therefore external conditions act directly at the cellular level (1,2). These animals adapt to their external environment by adapting cellular processes to function under variable conditions. This is manifested in two ways, firstly, by modifying the ability of animals to withstand the lethal effects of temperature extremes (resistance adaptation), and secondly, by adaptive strategies in response to normal environmental fluctuations (capacity adaptation). Adaptive responses occur over at least two distinct time scales: (1) Evolutionary adaptation occurs over many generations whereby the survival and reproduction of individuals possessing favourable characteristics for a particular environment is greater, resulting in favourable genetic characteristics being retained. (2) Seasonal responses or "acclimatisations", are restricted to the lifetime of an individual in response to natural environmental fluctuations. The adaptive state is reversible depending upon the circumstances but is not passed on through generations. The mechanism underlying the adaptive process is, however, inherited. Acclimation refers to the process by which an organism is subjected, in the laboratory, to a single aspect of environmental stress without the associated changes in other environmental conditions experienced in natural surroundings (3). In principle, the same problems apply to adaptation over both time scales, and often the same solutions are apparent. In certain instances, the genotypic adaptive responses may outweigh acclimatisation such that different species can evolve into habitats that no single species can acclimatise to. For example, active arctic species have developed specific peptide and glycopeptide "antifreezes" to prevent ice formation in body fluids (4), while those species remaining dormant in the cold have developed the ability to tolerate extracellular ice formation in order to prevent its formation intra-cellularly.

TI  - Evolutionary consequences of limited dispersal and environment heterogeneity in Tigriopus californicus life histories
SP  - 120
AB  - The consequences of population structure and environmental heterogeneity on the evolution of life-history traits depends on several ecological and genetic conditions which I explore in the philopatric marine copepod Tigriopus californicus (Crustacea, Harpacticoida). This benthic species is restricted to tidepools that vary over a wide range of salinity. At Bodega Bay, California, the habitat is subdivided at several spatial scales between which dispersal is unlikely: between rock outcrops along the open coast, and between an open coast site and a protected site. Pools at the open coast site exhibit the widest spatial and temporal variation, and often dry completely. In contrast, a pool on one open coast outcrop is continuously fed by freshwater from seepage, and does not evaporate. Similarly, pools at the protected site are located on level rock shelves, and frequently receive oceanic water during most high tides. Patterns of phenotypic variation in nature between rock outcrops of the open coast showed differentiation in only one of three life-history traits. Common garden lab experiments indicated little genetic differentiation, and that most life-history variation was explained by plasticity in response to laboratory-controlled temperature and salinity. However, between the protected and open coast sites, there was life-history differentiation in nature; but the genetic component of variation in the lab was distributed among families, not site of origin. Phenotypic plasticity can evolve in fine-grained, spatially heterogeneous or temporally variable environments. One outcrop at the open coast site is characterized by high and variable pool salinities; the other outcrop and the protected site are not. These salinity differences have a selective impact; they increase juvenile mortality, age of first reproduction, and interclutch interval. The similarity of allozyme frequencies among the populations from different outcrops at the open coast site suggested that plasticity may have evolved because dispersal occurs over selectively different environments. However, dispersal does not occur between protected and open coast sites, and the protected site is temporally constant compared to the open coast site; these conditions should favor genetic divergence. A quantitative genetic analysis of life-history traits of the protected-site population suggests that divergence may be limited by genetic constraints on the response to selection. Although genetic correlations among traits are consistent with a proposed fitness model for this selective environment, the analysis suggests that the heritable proportion of phenotypic variation in nature may prevent response to all but the most severe selective differences, hence the lack of divergence.

TI  - Genetic and environmental correlates of shape variation in the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea
SP  - 77
AB  - It is often proposed that the shape of animals evolves as a correlated response to selection on life history traits such as whole body growth and differentiation rates. This scenario is certainly true for shape variation that is an allometric consequence of body size variation, because body size is determined by growth and differentiation rates. However, we are aware of few examples in which development rate variation is correlated with body size-independent shape variation. In this study on the green treefrog, Hyla cinerea, we test whether that fraction of the variance in tibiofibula length and head width that is left after removing snout vent length as a covariate is correlated with either genetically or environmentally based variation in development rates. Size-adjusted tibiofibula length and head width at metamorphosis are both positively genetically correlated with larval period length. Thus, relative limb and head proportions in adult treefrogs could evolve as a correlated response to selection on a larval life history trait. Neither larval growth rate nor juvenile growth rate is significantly genetically correlated with the morphological traits. The two size-adjusted morphological traits are strongly genetically correlated with each other, a situation which could either hinder or accelerate their joint evolution, depending on the directions of selection. The growth rate of larvae raised under different food levels and temperatures had no effect on their size-adjusted head width or tibiofibula length at metamorphosis. The food-controlled rate at which small juveniles became large ones also had no influence on their shape. However, the head width versus snout vent length relationship among metamorphs has a shallower slope than the same relationship within growing juveniles. Thus, size at metamorphosis alone controls head width at a given larger body size. To our knowledge, we are the first to identify this difference in allometries as a potential source of size-independent shape variation in adult frogs.

TI  - Genetic and environmental effects on sex determination in Gammarus duebeni (Crustacea, amphipoda)
SP  - 1
AB  - Gammarus duebeni Liljeborg is a brackish water shrimp with a photoperiodically mediated sex determining mechanism (environmental sex determination). There is adaptive variation in sex determination in this species in response to changes in the population dynamics; in seasonal northern populations environmental sex determination is adaptive but in non-seasonal southern populations environmental sex determination is inferred to be non-adaptive. The reportedly bimodal dynamics of a southern population of G. duebeni at Totton Marsh, Southampton are investigated. Contrary to expectations the life cycle is annual and growth and reproduction are almost but not completely continuous. Fluctuations in the adult sex ratio are due to the production of males and females at different times of the year: males early in the season, females later. Photoperiod determines the sex of animals from Totton Marsh in the laboratory: more males are produced under longday than under shortday conditions. However, this cannot solely account for the pattern of sex differential production in the field where males are produced in excess in the shortdays of winter. A potential role for temperature is discussed. Response to photoperiod in these southern animals is predictably less as a consequence of the longer breeding season than in northern populations. In addition, no critical threshold is identified at Totton Marsh; the proportion of males increases gradually with the length of the photophase. Data from other Gammarus duebeni populations provide evidence to suggest there is an association between the degree of environmental sex determination and the length of the breeding season. Males have to be born early so that they are larger than the females they pair with. Mate choice experiments on size controlled males and females confirm previous reports that males benefit more from large size than females and indicate large male size is maintained through both natural and sexual selection. Response to photoperiod is highly variable. Heritability estimates using parent/offspring regressions and sib analysis indicate that there is a substantial genetic component to sex ratio control. A polyfactorial system is proposed. A functional model for the genetic basis of environmental sex determination in Gammarus duebeni is presented. This model accounts for the adaptability and flexibility of the trait in this species. It has applications to other species with environmental sex determination and suggests comparisons with the mechanisms of diapause.(D78175)

TI  - Investigations related to genetic sexing in the Mediterranean fruit fly ceratitis capitata (wied.) aimed at increasing the economic viability of the sterile insect technique
SP  - 1
AB  - The medfly Ceratitis capitata (Wied.) is a notorious pest, especially of stone and citrus fruits, which infests the warmer areas of every continent and incurs enormous expense annually. Traditionally control has been by insecticides; more recently the sterile insect technique (SIT) has been used and the application of potentially environmentally damaging insecticides has been reduced. An important area of research in connection with SIT is `genetic sexing', the production of males for sterilization in the absence of females. This study investigated three aspects of genetic sexing. (i) The effect on sex ratio of incorporating the amino acid threonine into the larval medium. No consistently significant effect of threonine on either sex ratio or mortality was observed at the levels used (0 g l-1-10 g l-1). The consistency of the medium, however, was found to have a small but significant effect on sex ratio. (ii) Selection for increased expression of the temperature-sensitive meiotic drive factor (MP) in isofemale lines derived from strain A425 which showed holandrically inherited sex ratio distortion in favour of males. Selection combined with appropriate temperature treatment led to an increase in the expression of MP and the establishment of strain H1 which showed a fluctuating equilibrium at 32% females. The presence in males of X chromosomes sensitive to the driving Y was not found to compromise fitness. The most sensitive X chromosomes to date are those of strain H1, isolated in this study. (iii) Effect of parental age on sex ratio in two isofemale lines derived from strain A425. This was assessed by dividing single-pair progenies into age bands corresponding to the order in which eggs were laid. Although there was variation in sex ratio between families, there was no statistical evidence that sex ratio was influenced by the age of the parents and there was no optimum parental age for producing highly distorted lines.

TI  - The evolution of growth rate in Sceloporus lizards: Environmental, behavioral, maternal, and genetic aspects
SP  - 1
AB  - I use comparative and experimental analysis to examine the causes of geographic variation in life history attributes of hatchling Sceloporus lizards. Mean clutch size among populations of Sceloporus occidentalis increased to the north (7 vs. 12 eggs/clutch; California vs Washington), whereas egg size decreased (0.65 g vs. 0.40 g). Among populations at different latitudes, egg incubation time was positively correlated with egg size, and juvenile growth rate was negatively correlated with hatchling size. In Chapter 1, I analyze latitudinal and elevational patterns of egg life history characteristics among populations of Sceloporus occidentalis and experimentally manipulate egg size and hatchling size by removing yolk from eggs. Experimentally reduced eggs demonstrated (i) that some of the latitudinal differences in egg incubation were due to egg size and (ii) that some of the differences in juvenile growth rate between high- and low-elevation populations in California were due to egg size, but that some were due to genetic differences in growth. (iii) In contrast, differences in growth rate among populations at different latitudes were largely due to genetic differences in growth rate and not egg size. In Chapters 2 and 3, I examine the contribution of thermal environment and thermal preference to variation in growth rate in Sceloporus hatchlings. I reared hatchlings from a northern and southern population of S. occidentalis in a cycling thermal regime in one of three experimental treatments differing in access to radiant heat. I also measured the thermal preference of each individual. Growth rate varied positively with duration of access to radiant heat. Within treatments, individual growth rate was positively correlated with preferred body temperature. Moreover, the difference in growth rate between northern and southern populations was due in part to evolved differences in thermal preference between populations--northern populations which grew more slowly had a lower thermal preference. Variation in thermal preference was associated with family membership, suggesting that thermal preference has a genetic basis. A laboratory study compared growth rate between two congeners from the same latitude, but different elevation in southern California (Sceloporus occidentalis (low elevation) and S. graciosus (high elevation).

TI  - Life histories, interspecific competition and regional distribution of three rockpool Daphnia species
SP  - 32
AB  - This dissertation is a study of the factors responsible for the regional distributions and dynamics of three coexisting Daphnia species in a patchy rockpool environment. It is focused mainly on the effects of interspecific competition. A combination of laboratory studies, long-term outdoor experiments and longterm observational studies has been used. According to life-table studies in the laboratory D. pulex (de Geer) and D. magna (Straus) were more 'r-selected' than D. longispina (O. F. Muller), which showed life history traits customarily believed to be evolutionary responses to size-selective predation on larger individuals. Laboratory experiments showed relative competitive abilities in the species to vary with food density and temperature. The large D. magna was the better competitor under high-food conditions and at 15$\sp\circ$C, while the other small species were superior under low-food conditions at 20$\sp\circ$C. Interspecific competition was studied in artificial rockpools for 4 years. Analysis of population dynamics and reproductive indices showed that interspecific competition was intense during substantial parts of the year. Rates of extinction were higher in three-species than in two-species experiments. Extinction rates also decreased with increasing water volume. Nonetheless, coexistence of two competing species for 4 years was the rule. A review of competition experiments between cladocerans showed that none of the following hypotheses for competitive dominance among zooplankton had general support: the size-efficiency hypothesis, the r-max hypothesis, the 'low-food efficiency' hypothesis, and the hypothesis that small species are superior competitors. Single factors such as body size could not be used as general predictors of exploitative competitive ability. Many experiments showed varying outcomes under different environmental conditions, suggesting that the paradox of the plankton is a reality in many zooplankton communities. Distributions of Daphnia spp. in rockpools in two areas on the west and one area of the east coast of Sweden were influenced by several factors, e.g. salinity, interspecific competition, unpredictable desiccation events, and most probably also predation.

TI  - Repression of transposable element activity in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 102
AB  - The regulation of transposable P element activity was examined in an M$\sp\prime$ strain of Drosophila melanogaster. This strain, called B 13, varied considerably in its ability to repress P element activity in hybrid offspring. Repression ability was evaluated by crossing B13 females to males from the $\pi\sb2$ strain and determining the degree of gonadal dysgenic (GD) sterility in their hybrid daughters. This measure of repression potential was found to be highly correlated with repression of P transposase activity. Forty inbred lines were derived from the B13 strain by 20 generations of sib mating. These lines varied from high to low repression potential, with an overall distribution similar to the base stock. Most of these lines retained considerable within-line variation which may have been caused in part by P transposase activity during inbreeding. A more detailed study of twelve inbred lines provided evidence that both maternal and zygotic effects contributed to the repression of GD sterility in hybrid females. The maternal inheritance of repression potential through two generations was demonstrated in six lines, indicating the involvement of cytoplasmic repression factors; however, in the remaining six lines these factors were not detectable. Molecular analyses demonstrated that most of the P elements in the twelve inbred lines were nonautonomous; there were estimated to be only 2 to 4 potentially complete elements out of at least 30 elements per genome. Few differences in P element composition were detected among lines with high, intermediate or low repression potential. Therefore, the large differences in repression ability may have been brought about by small changes in the number or location of repressor-producing P elements.

TI  - Ecology of the San Jose Scale, Quadraspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock) (Homoptera:Diaspididae), and its Encarsia perniciosi (Howard) (Hymenoptera:Aphelinidae) parasitoid in North Carolina orchards
SP  - 173
AB  - Of the ten parasitoid species collected at an unsprayed experimental apple orchard in 1986 and 1987, and a sprayed commercial peach orchard in 1987, two species, Coccophagoides murtfeldtae (Howard) and Encarsia sp. were attracted to black traps significantly more than to other colors. Aphytis diaspidis (Howard) was attracted to yellow and black traps in significantly greater numbers than white at both orchards in 1987. Significantly greater numbers of E. perniciosi (Howard) were attracted to the combination of trap color plus San Jose scale (SJS) pheromone baited traps than to colored traps without pheromone indicating that SJS pheromone is a kairomone for the parasitoid. Data from constant temperature studies of E. perniciosi development were utilized to develop linear degree-day (DD) and nonlinear models of parasitoid development. Development from egg to adult stage with a five-temperature linear model for E. perniciosi reared in male and female hosts combined required 648 DD$\sb{-0.2}$, while 362 DD$\sb{9.9}$ were required with a three-temperature linear model. Simulations based on the linear and nonlinear models were validated by comparison with peaks of adult parasitoid activity in three orchards during 1986 and 1987. Data from constant temperature studies of SJS development were utilized to develop linear (DD) and nonlinear models of scale development. A three-temperature (555 DD$\sb{10.3}$) and a five-temperature (714 DD$\sb{7.8}$) linear model were developed to model SJS development from crawler to crawler and male to male, and a four-temperature (330 DD$\sb{9.4}$) linear model was developed to model development of SJS through the embryonic period. The models were most accurate at simulating the first generation male flight peak when the overwintering male peak was used as biofix, second generation crawlers when a first generation crawler peak was used as biofix, and the first generation crawlers using overwintering male peaks as a biofix. The inaccuracy of the models to simulate first-generation crawler peaks for the two orchard-year combinations is thought to be due to the coexistence of crawlers of the Forbes scale, Quadraspidiotus forbesi (Johnson), along with SJS crawlers. The ability of these models to forecast SJS phenological events in the F$\sb1$ and F$\sb2$ generations for accurate timing of postbloom applications of insecticide is discussed.

TI  - LABORATORY STUDIES ON THE REGULATION OF MIGRATION IN THE ORIENTAL ARMYWORM, MYTHIMNA SEPARATA (WALKER) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
SP  - 254
AB  - The present study investigated two major aspects of adult life of the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata, --pre-calling period and flight--in relation to the insect's migration. Pre-calling period (emergence to first release of pheromone) of females of M. separata showed clear diurnal periodicity. They initiated their calling behaviour only in the second half of the scotophase. Onset of calling was correlated with the physiological progress of ovary maturation. Substantial variation in pre-calling period was observed. Two lines were established in a selection experiment by inbreeding in the first generation of selection--an early-caller (EC) line calling on nights 2-4 (mode values) and a late-caller (LC) line calling on nights 6-9. Reciprocal crosses were carried out in the 6th generation and the results provide evidence of a sex-linked major gene effect so that the onset of calling in female offspring is determined by genes inherited from their male parent. Data from field-collected samples showed that moths which were the offspring of seasonal immigrants into northern areas had a higher proportion of late-callers than those from further south. Pre-calling period was extended at low temperatures and by decreasing photoperiod from the pre-pupal stage to adult emergence. Some EC, but no LC females were able to achieve oocyte maturation without feeding. Estimation of heritability of tethered flight duration (flight ability) by offspring-parent regression showed that only male offspring had a significant regression with their parents, which indicated the possible existence of sex-linkage or sex-limitation of this trait. Female moths from the EC line flew significantly less than those from the LC line on night 4 when the teneral stage is supposed to be over, although no such difference was found with males. Flight ability was reduced in females which had called compared with others of equivalent age which had not, showing a clear 'oogenesis-flight syndrome'. The effects of larval phase on adult life were investigated. Neither flight ability nor lipid reserves were affected by larval density. However, larval phase did show a significant effect, though small, on pre-calling period (female from gregaria larvae called later). (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

TI  - Inter- and intraspecific variation in introduced and native parasites (Hymenoptera:Aphidiidae) of the pea aphid in North America: Life history traits, thermal coefficients and morphology
SP  - 1
AB  - This study was a first attempt to investigate, a posteriori, the possible reasons for the continent-wide decline of Aphidius smithi Sharma & Subba Rao, an introduced parasite of the pea aphid in North America. Two hypotheses, among many possible, were tested. First, because A. smithi was established with small founder population, it was hypothesized that the resulting genetic impoverishment may have precluded its long-term establishment. To test this, divergence levels in quantitative characters among three populations each of two introduced species, A. smithi and Aphidius ervi Haliday, were compared with each other and with those among three populations of a native species, Praon pequodorum Viereck, to detect any evidence of random genetic drift. Second, because A. ervi rapidly became the dominant species of the pea aphid subsequent to the decline of A. smithi, the possibility of displacement due to difference in life history traits was tested. Intraspecific studies indicated that the divergence level between populations of the two introduced species did not consistently differ from each other. But the distance between any two populations of the introduced species was consistently greater than that between corresponding populations of the native species in both life history and morphological traits, suggesting drift of alleles affecting these two characters. The results suggest the possibility of drift of other alleles which may have also contributed to the decline of A. smithi. The drift does not appear to have affected the establishment of A. ervi, probably because of larger and more diverse founder populations. In addition, A. ervi appears to possess a "general purpose" genotype as evidenced by its predominance of the parasite guild of aphids infesting alfalfa in a wide range of climates. Both these factors may have enabled it to overcome any deleterious effects on adaptation of random genetic drift. Interspecific comparison of life history traits indicated that A. smithi is superior, or at least at no obvious disadvantage, relative to A. ervi, Aphidius pisivorus Smith or P. pequodorum. It had a higher fecundity, a shorter developmental time and generally performed better than any of the above species under the experimental conditions. This suggests that differential reproductive capacity and thermal coefficients did not contribute significantly to the decline of A. smithi. The protocol for the introduction, and the dynamics of the pea aphid parasites in North America, suggest a strong need for pre- and post-release studies on introduced biological control agents.

TI  - Kp element regulation of p-m hybrid dysgenesis in drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 1
AB  - Hybrid dysgenesis is the term given to a series of related germline abnormalities observed in the progeny of crosses between certain strains of Drosophila melanogaster. These abnormalities include temperature sensitive gonadal sterility, illicit male recombination, chromosomal rearrangements and increased mutation. The most intensely studied system of hybrid dysgenesis in this species, the P-M system, is caused by the mobilisation of members of the P family of transposable elements. However, P elements are not usually mobilised within strains due to the existence of a repression system termed the P cytotype. Cytotype involves a complex interaction between chromosomal P elements and the cytoplasm, and is inherited maternally.Analysis of the P elements in natural populations has shown that the P family is heterogeneous, consisting of conserved, autonomous elements and non-autonomous deletion derivatives. One particular deletion derivative, the KP element, is present in high copy number in D. melanogaster strains of diverse geographic origins and in this respect appears to be unique, other deletion derivatives generally being present in one or a few copies per genome. One strain which contains KP elements has been shown to possess intermediate levels of P regulation which, unlike P cytotype, is inherited chromosomally.I have engaged in a molecular and phenotypic analysis of natural populations and laboratory strains to test the possibility that KP elements are responsible for the chromosomally inherited regulation seen in strains which contain these elements.I conducted a survey of British D. melanogaster populations and have confirmed the generality of previous work. First, all British populations contain the KP element in high copy number, and secondly they exhibit intermediate levels of P regulation which is transmitted through both sexes.I have looked at the effect of chromosomes carrying KP elements on the evolution of lines where active P elements have been artificially introduced and have shown that a single chromosome can repress the phenotypic effects of P element movement. This repression is inherited chromosomally and the copy number of the KP element increased in lines which possessed this repression.Using the same experimental design I have analysed the effect of a single KP element on the evolution of such lines. Those lines initially containing one KP element show little evidence of P element movement after 10 to 12 generations. The repression observed in lines with KP elements is inherited through both sexes and Southern analysis of these lines shows that during the evolution of this repression the copy number of the KP element increased at least 20 fold. Control lines, without KP elements, developed the P cytotype. This result is fully consistent with a KP element model of P regulation but inconsistent with other currently available models.Returning to the analysis of natural populations I have concentrated on Q strains. Q strains appear to be neutral in the P-M system in that they possess strong regulation but are not capable of inducing the most extreme traits of hybrid dysgenesis. American Q strains are known to possess the P cytotype mode of regulation, but many Q strains contain multiple copies of the KP element. This implies that all Q strains do not possess P cytotype and I have analysed the inheritance of P regulation in Q strains to test this. Extensive qualitative variation exists in the inheritance patterns; all Q strains with KP elements inherit some, or all, of their P regulation chromosomally whereas three out of four Q strains studied which lack KP elements inherit their regulation entirely maternally.These results, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the KP element is responsible for a second system of P regulation which is distinct from P cytotype. Thus, the geographical distribution of the KP element can be explained by natural selection favouring this element d

TI  - The life-history strategies of two species of stream-dwelling freshwater snails
SP  - 1
AB  - The objectives of this study were to observe the life-cycles of freshwater snails from different populations and use the results to test a prediction of the Sibly-Calow (1985) life-history model; that where conditions for juvenile growth are good, the animal should produce smaller offspring. Two species of snail were studied, five populations of Theodoxus fluviatilis and seven populations of Ancylus fluviatilis, between 1984 and 1986. Theodoxus was found to have a biennial semelparous life cycle in all cases. The life cycle of Ancylus was also semelparous, but the number of generations per year varied between site and year and was related quite strongly to temperature. The Sibly-Calow model assumes a negative relationship between fecundity and hatchling size. However a positive correlation was found between fecundity and offspring size in both species when comparing different populations. This rules out a straightforward application of the model to data derived from different populations. Theodoxus hatchling size varied significantly between sites and a negative trend was found between hatchling size and juvenile growth rates in accordance with the naive predictions of the Sibly-Calow model. In Ancylus significant differences were found in egg-capsule size, number of hatchlings per capsule and hatchling size between sites and years. A negative trend was apparent between hatchling size and growth rate from dif_erent populations. Comparisons between different generations of Ancylus were made in a small chalk stream with a dense population of Ancylus that went through five generations during the study. No relationship was found between fecundity and hatchling size or hatchling size and juvenile growth rate. However a significant positive correlation was found between hatchling size and parental growth rate. These results contradict the predictions of the Sibly-Calow model. The relationship of log10 snail length against log10 body weight and log10 shell weight was also investigated. The regression coefficients for both body and shell weight were constant within a species. The body weight intercepts varied significantly between sites and seasons for Ancylus, although no consistent pattern emerged, but not for Theodoxus. Little variation was found in the intercepts for shell weight in either species.

TI  - The impact of hydrocarbon pollution on meiobenthic production within an estuarine mud-flat
SP  - 1
AB  - This thesis describes the effect on the production ecology of the meio-fauna resulting from the discharge of effluents by British Petroleum subsidiaries, onto the mud-flats at Kuineil in the Firth of Forth. The effluents contain hydrocarbons, and other organic and inorganic chemicals, and exert a high B.O.D. and C.O.D. loading on the surrounding mud-flats.Three stations were selected for routine meiofaunal sampling, at approximately the same tidal level, between MTL and MHWS. Analysis of the physico-chemical qualities of the sediments showed a gradient in sediment aliphatic hydrocarbon concentrations, and in the depth of the Redox Potential Discontinuity from station A (most polluted) to station C (least polluted). The sediments at stations A and C were poorly-sorted muds, and that at station B a poorly-soited muddy-sand. A sinusoidal model was fitted to observed water temperature data in order to correct laboratory derived growth rates to field temperatures.Routine sampling for meiofauna, was conducted on fourteen occasions from April 1984 to April 1985, using 5.5cm2 sawn off syringes. Eight samples were then pooled and a sub-sample of appropriate size taken using a low cost sub-sampling device described. This technique was shown to give higher precision in determining mean abundances than from single cores, for a given expenditure of effort.Nematode body masses were estimated using species specific predictive regression equations relating maximum body width to volume. The relative precision and cost, of alternative methods of determining nematode body mass from geometric figures was investigated.Laboratory culture of the dominant meiobenthic copepods was conducted in order to identify the naupliar stages. The gross morphology of the nau-plii of Stenhelia palustris, Amphiascoides limicola, Platychelipus littoral is, Nannopus palustris, Mesochra lilljeborgi and Microarthridion fallax is described. The Belehradek function D = a.(T-a)b relating development times D (nauplius to nauplius) to temperature T, was fitted to availablegrowth data for M. lilljeborgi (D = 132O.(T - 2)-l-0&), and A. limicola {D = 334.(T -3)-°&7g). The predicted generation times for M. lilljeborgi are longer than literature values, suggesting that culture conditions may be limiting.A simple developmental model assuming constant proportional increase in mass at each moult except for egg/Nl and N6/C1, has been developed in order to predict the masses of the developmental stages of the common species of harpacticoid copepods, from literature values for adult and egg weights. The model was validated by fitting to literature data.A marked seasonality was observed in the abundance of virtually all species at all stations. At the most polluted station (station A) there is a severe depression of the abundance of both nematodes and copepods in late summer and early winter. At the station receiving intermediate pollutant loadings (station B) densities are enhanced during the early summer period. Despite the seasonality, Detrended Correspondence analysis (ordination) reveals that the principal source of variation in the species composition is explained by the spatial axis. Station B was faunistically more similar to station A than to station C. This pattern was not revealed by trends in species richness. Shannon- Wiener diversity and Pielou evenness. The ordination identified Diplolaimella ocellata and Monhystera disjuncta as characteristic of station A. D. ocellata attained very high dominance at this station in late summer. Tripyloides spp., Hypodontolaimus balticus, Daptonema spp., Mesochra lilljeborgi, Platychelipus littoralis attained their maximum abundance at station B; and Ptycholaimellus ponti-cus, Sabatieria pulchra, Atrochromadora microlaima, Sphaerolaimus spp., Stenhelia palustris and Amphiascoides limicola at station C.Production figures were derived for the dominant nematode species using P/B ratios of 8.4 (Warwick and

TI  - Yield stability in cowpea as influenced by five drought resistance mechanisms
SP  - 152
AB  - Cowpeas, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp., are considered relatively drought resistant as compared to other grain crops, yet substantial seed yield reductions in response to drought stress, especially during reproductive development, are commonly observed. Among the many mechanisms studied in grain crops, 5 drought adaptive or resistance mechanisms have been hypothesized to play key roles in maintaining seed yield in grain legumes under drought including, earliness of reproductive development, greater partitioning of dry matter to developing seeds, longer pod-filling period, longer duration of viable (green) canopy during pod-filling, and maintenance of moderate to high levels of N$\sb2$ fixation during late pod-filling. The purpose of this investigation was to identify high-yielding cowpea genotypes with superior seed yield stability under both dryland and irrigated conditions, and to determine whether genotypes which expressed superior seed yield stability utilized one or more of the 5 drought-adaptive mechanisms associated with leguminous species. Field experiments were conducted using either 20 or 14 genetically diverse, indeterminate, cowpea genotypes under both dryland and irrigated conditions. Intraspecific variability for maintenance of seed yield potential during drought was observed. Genotypes identified as drought resistant initiated reproductive growth earlier, and partitioned larger quantities of dry matter earlier and more rapidly than drought-sensitive genotypes, but the duration of the pod-filling period was similar in all genotypes. Furthermore, resistant genotypes produced smaller green and total canopy areas as compared to susceptible genotypes, but maintained a higher percentage of green leaf area late in the pod-filling period. Moderate drought stress was sufficient to inhibit N$\sb2$ fixation activity in all genotypes. Separate greenhouse experiments were conducted in two successive years to determine whether 2 F$\sb7$ lines, produced by repeatedly selecting for differential maintenance of larger green canopy area, expressed higher pod yield under warm, dry conditions as compared to plants which displayed normal leaf senescence. Nonsignificant differences between selected and normally senescing genotypes suggested that maintenance of green canopy did not improve pod yield response in any treatment combination.

TI  - EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE LIFE CYCLE OF MELOIDOGYNE CHITWOODI RACES 1 AND 2 AND M. HAPLA ON RUSSET BURBANK POTATO
SP  - 81
AB  - Meloidogyne chitwoodi race 1 (MC1) had a wider optimal temperature range for penetration of Russet Burbank potato roots than M. chitwoodi race 2 (MC2) or M. hapla (MH). MC1 penetrated roots best at 18, 24 and 30 C; MC2 at 24 and 30 C; and MH at 30 C. The minimum temperature for penetration by MC1 and MC2 appears to be between 3 and 6 C. Penetration by MH was variable at 6 C. MC1 took 93, 54, 39 and 42 days or 651, 702, 741 and 1,050 degree days (DD); MC2 95, 59, 39 and 39 days or 665, 767, 741 and 975 DD; and MH 106, 72, 44 and 35 days or 212, 576, 616 and 700 DD to complete their life cycles (second stage juvenile (J2) to J2), respectively, at 12, 18, 24 and 30 C. None were able to complete their life cycles at 6 C in 115 days. MC2 had a wider temperature range for development to females than MC1 or MH. Optimum temperature for reproduction at the end of the first generation for MC races was between 12-24 C and for MH 30 C. Embryonic development for free eggs of MC1 and MC2 required 55, 24 and 13 days at 12, 18 and 24 C, respectively, and MH 60, 26 and 15 days. None were able to complete embryogenesis at 6 C. A higher percentage of MC1 and MC2 eggs hatched at 12 to 24 C than MH, and vice versa at 30 C. The optimum for hatch appeared to be 18 and 24 C for all three nematodes. Similar results were obtained with egg masses, except that the MC races appeared to hatch at 6 and 30 C. Based on a 180 day growing season, MC1 and MH were able to complete approximately 3.2 and 2.8 generations, respectively, on Russet Burbank potato in field microplots.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF WAVE ACTION ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE INTERTIDAL SNAIL NUCELLA LAPILLUS
SP  - 211
AB  - Nucella lapillus is a widely distributed intertidal gastropod that exhibits remarkable variability in morphology, physiology and life history traits among populations differentially exposed to wave action. This work explores the ecological and evolutionary factors responsible for generating this variation. I quantified patterns of life history variation among populations. Exposed shore individuals grew slower, terminated growth at a smaller size, suffered higher mortality rates primarily in the larger size classes, became sexually mature at a smaller size, produced more but smaller offspring and devoted more energy to reproduction. Juvenile and adult whelks reciprocally transplanted between an exposed and protected shore or reared on specific diets in the laboratory indicated that depressed growth on exposed coasts reflects reduced foraging time imposed by high wave energies. Nucella lapillus on wave swept shores produced a larger foot and required a greater force to dislodge. The difference in tenacity was strictly a function of pedal surface area. Pedal surface area did not differ among populations as hatchlings emerged from egg capsules or when reared in the laboratory suggesting variation between morphs does not represent genetic differentiation. Both exposed and protected morphs reared intertidally produced a larger foot than those from the laboratory suggesting that foot morphology is plastic. A reciprocal transplant experiment confirmed this notion, but revealed an asymmetry in the plasticity that parallel a possible asymmetry in the risks of acclimating to a temporally unpredictable environmental cue. Shell color of N. lapillus also varied with wave exposure. Populations on protected shores were monomorphically white while those on more exposed coasts were highly polymorphic and varied from predominantly brown to predominantly white. I conducted a series of experiments that demonstrated (1) physiological stress during periods of tidal emersion were greater on protected shores, (2) under similar natural conditions brown morphs heated up faster, attained higher temperatures, desiccated more rapidly and suffered greater mortality, and (3) shell color did not influence mortality on the exposed shore or in shaded microhabitats on the protected shore, but brown morphs suffered much greater mortality in sunny microhabitats on the protected shore. Therefore, interpopulation variation in shell color is in part a response to a selective gradient in physiological stress. Selection for crypsis by visually hunting predators did not appear to play a prominent role.

TI  - Aspects of the ecology of lizards of the genus Liolaemus in the central Chilean cordillera
SP  - 161
AB  - The ecology of ten species of iguanid lizards in the genus Liolaemus was studied on three elevational transects in the central Chilean Andes, from 1500m-3000m el, to determine the causal factors setting distribution limits. Detailed data on thermal biology and parasite influences are presented here, as well as some information on the effects of microhabitat availabilities, congeneric competitors, and other factors. The lack of association between lizard thermal tolerance and elevation suggests that these temperature relationships do not set distributional limits within the elevations of the study transects. Some physical factors do influence the thermal biology of Liolaemus. Body mass determined thermal inertia, influencing rates of cooling and heating. Non mass-related differences in heating rates existed among the species: species at higher elevations heated more slowly. Larger body size and its consequent thermal inertia in part determine diel activity periods, with smaller individuals active earlier and larger individuals active later. The cooler temperatures at higher elevations did not produce interspecific differences in body temperature, but most high elevation species showed an intraspecific decrease in body temperature with elevation. Species differed in mean field body temperatures, but the range of means (33$\sp\circ$C to 35.5$\sp\circ$C) was slight and there was no relationship of mean field body temperature to either elevational distribution or microhabitat selected. Some thermal factors that the lizards experience (e.g., higher body temperatures of the darkly colored male L. nigroviridis) may result from the interplay of biophysical effects with other forces, such as sexual selection effects of social structure. Reproductive consequences of broadened activity periods on gestation appear to influence activity patterns. Some species of lizard selected microhabitats which increased length of activity times, choosing in the evenings rock substrates which held heat after air temperatures dropped. Thermal relationships appear to set upper limits on egg-laying species that cannot successfully reproduce at high elevations, where only live bearing species are found. There is no evidence of malarial infestation of the lizards, ticks are almost absent, and mites do not increase at the distributional limits of the lizards. Thus, these parasites apparently play no role in setting lizard distributional limits. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)

TI  - Investigation of the financial viability of a combined power with district heating scheme for Sheffield
SP  - 1
AB  - The City of Sheffield was one of the nine lead cities investigated by the consultants W.S. Atkins on behalf of the Government to assess the feasibility of combined heat and power with district heating, CHP/DH. In July 1982 the results of the study were published by W.S. Atkins in their `CHP/DH Feasibility Programme: Stage, 1, Summary Report and Recommendations for the Department of Energy'. The case for a combined heat and power with district heating scheme for Sheffield was found to be marginal, with a real internal rate of return (I.R.R.) of 4.8%, compared with an internal rate of return of 5% or over, which the Government requires for Nationalised Industries investment.Sheffield City Council decided to make further investigations in order to improve the profitability of their scheme. This report forms part of that work, being an investigation into its financial analysis.The W.S. Atkins financial analysis was examined manually and then reproduced in a computer program. The results were in adequate agreement with those of W.S. Atkins.This program was then used to perform a sensitivity analysis on the scheme which included variations not considered by W.S. Atkins in their reports. The variables considered listed in decreasing order of effect were fuel prices, discount rate, start-up date of scheme, scheme length, lifespan of capital items, D.H.S. labour and rates costs.The financial profitability of the scheme was especially sensitive to changes in fuel prices. An increase of only 20% in fuel prices resulted in an increase in the I.R.R. of 38% over the base case value. Changes in fuel prices could prove the deciding factor in the success or otherwise of the scheme. As fuel prices rise in the future when fuel resources become less readily available and of restricted use, the case for a CHP/DH scheme will substantially increase.In Scandinavia similar schemes are thought of as low risk investments, but in the United Kingdom the investment is required to come from the private sector where it is considered to be of high risk and low profitability.The different criteria for investment in electricity generation in nationalised industry to that for investment in CHP/DH for cities can result in a misallocation of resources which can only be corrected by government policy.

TI  - DIFFERENTIAL PREDATION UPON EMBRYOS AND LARVAE OF TEMPERATE PACIFIC ECHINODERMS
SP  - 1
AB  - A fundamental premise of benthic marine invertebrate life history theory asserts that energetic costs associated with lecithotropic and brooding modes of development are offset by decreased rates of mortality during periods of embryo and larval development. These energetic tradeoffs are presumably the basis for the evolution of dichotomous modes of development among several invertebrate taxa, and they provide the foundation for an inverse correlation between fecundity and offspring survivorship. In this thesis, I describe a series of experimental observations to test the hypothesis that rates of embryo and larval mortality are inversely correlated with initial egg size and mode of development. Tests of hypotheses rely primarily upon comparisons made in the laboratory among echinoderm larvae from the Pacific Northwest. The life history patterns and differential susceptibility of planktotrophic and lecithotrophic larvae to predation by carnivorous zooplankton support the size-mortality hypothesis, although stage-specific differences in embryo and larval susceptibility were found to vary substantially among species with planktotrophic and lecithotrophic modes of development. Microcosm feeding experiments demonstrate stage-specific differences in the susceptibility of echinoderm embryos and larvae to predation by carnivorous zooplankton. The occurrence of similar stage-specific susceptibility curves among phyletically divergent types of echinoderm larvae, and among different types of predatory zooplankton, allow predator-prey interactions to be assessed at a functional-group level that recognizes five distinct patterns of larval susceptibility. The fixed shapes of stage-specific susceptibility curves at various temperatures suggests that cumulative losses of embryos and larvae to predation are directly related to rates of larval development in nearshore waters. Ontogenetic changes in the behavior of echinopluteus larvae can be an effective deterrent to predation by brachyuran zoeae. In contrast, the swimming behavior of asteroid larvae increased their probability of capture by two species of benthic suspension feeders. These investigations highlight the importance of larval behavior at low Reynolds numbers. Differences in the field distribution of juvenile asteroids, coupled with information from zooplankton tows and laboratory feeding and substratum selection experiments, support the hypothesis that communities of benthic suspension-feeders can influence the survivorship of echinoderm larvae during settlement.

TI  - The biology of larval and juvenile Nephrops norvegicus (L.) in the Firth of Clyde
SP  - 540
AB  - In Scotland over the past 30 years the Nephrops fishery has expanded and is now the largest in Europe with landings in 1986 valued at over £29m. Much of the species biology is poorly understood, especially the early life history. The biology of larval and juvenile Nephrops is the subject of this thesis and the work reported has been conducted on Nephrops within the Firth of Clyde. Because Nephrops incubate their eggs externally (on their pleopods) they suffer progressive egg loss. Creels were set to capture ovigerous females incubating eggs at various stages of development to provide fecundity data and egg samples for a study of the biochemical changes associated with embryonic development. During the incubation period mean egg loss was estimated as 18 percent . Almost a fifth of the population were judged to have suffered additional egg loss, probably at the moment of spawning. Estimation of the mean number of eggs hatched per female per year took such losses into account and involved the use of length frequency information and a maturity ogive. The best estimate of the fecundity range was 985 - 1115 eggs hatched per female, which includes an allowance for the proportion of the population that may be biennial spawners. Lipids are the principal energy reserve utilized during embryonic development and full development requires 6 - 7 joules per egg. Most energy is expended during the later stages of development and is associated with a rapid uptake of water and salts. An aquaculture facility was developed and newly hatched larvae were reared under different culture conditions. Survival was found to be better in isolation compared to mass rearing conditions and initial periods of starvation in excess of 1 - 2 days led to an increase in mortality. Larvae were reared over a temperature range of 8 - 20 C and relationships were derived between temperature and the rate of larval development for each zoeal stage. The development time increased for successive zoeal stages at each temperature and 16 C seemed to be the overall optimum temperature for development. A larval survey programme was conducted in the Lower Firth of Clyde (L.F.C.) to investigate temporal and spatial changes in larval abundance. The larval abundance data were used in conjunction with the temperature information obtained in the laboratory study to obtain a seasonal production estimate for the 1st zoeal stage of 177 x 108 larvae within the 876 square kilometres sampling area. This value, when used in conjunction with the mean number of eggs hatched per female per year, gave an estimate of 15.87 x 106 to 17.97 x 106 females for the L.F.C. spawning stock. Information on the vertical distribution of Nephrops zoeae was obtained over two 24h cycles, one coincided with a spring and the other with a neap tidal period. The distribution of the larvae was related to several environmental variables and compared with the light and pressure responses demonstrated under controlled laboratory conditions, 1st, 2nd and early 3rd stage zoeae demonstrated positive phototaxis and high barokinesis. No dramatic diel changes were detected in the vertical distribution of the larvae. Most remained between 6 to 38m depth during daylight hours. A limited nocturnal ascent resulted in peak larval abundance shifting from 16 to 5m depth. Shortly after dawn the larvae descended to their daytime distribution. Depth regulation is probably achieved by light and pressure sensitivity and may be influenced by the position of the pycnocline. During the 3rd zoeal stage the light response changed from photopositive to photonegative and Nephrops may first come into contact with the sea bed towards the end of this stage. Substratum selection and settlement behaviour experiments were conducted with early postlarval stages and these suggested that the 1st postlarval stage is a transitional form between the planktonic and benthic environments.

TI  - Studies on the pollution ecology of the freshwater isopod asellus aquaticus
SP  - 1
AB  - A comparative study of five populations of the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus was carried out between 1983-1985. Four sites were geographically close and one more distant; they differed in their water quality. Each sampling station exhibited different water quality from the others. At the five stations investigations were made of selected physicochemical parameters: oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity, hardness, phosphate, chloride; levels of zinc, copper, lead and cadmium in the water were also estimated. Changes in the invertebrate fauna and Asellus populations were monitored monthly. For Asellus the sex ratio, life cycle, fecundity, relationships between body size and body weight, body length and the number of flagellar articles in the antennae, body size of ovigerous females and egg number (including the marsupial stages of development) were examined in detail. It was found that population structure varied significantly between clean, moderate and polluted stations even though some of them were geographically close. Significant differences were found between the stations regarding the population density, species diversity and the relationship between body size/dry weight, body size/egg number, body size/number of flagellar articles in the antennae. For example, asellids from clean stations usually had a body size and dry weight greater than the asellids from polluted or moderately polluted stations. The number of flagellar articles increased markedly at the maturity moult. Leading on from the field study which showed that water quality has a significant effect on the biology of A. aquaticus, laboratory experiments were carried out over a relatively long period to assess the effects of various environmental parameters, i.e. zinc, conductivity, temperature and light regimes on the life history, growth, fecundity and survival. Long-term (12 months) exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of zinc were found to slow the life cycle down and decrease fecundity and body weight. Tissue analysis revealed heavy body burdens of zinc. Exposure to low and high levels of conductivity also slowed down the life cycle and decreased fecundity and body weight. The optimum conductivity appeared to be 750<IMG WIDTH=8 HEIGHT=14 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/mu.gif">S, whilst the optimum temperature was 13oC. Surprisingly the light regime also affected body size, larger individuals resulting in the 16h dark/8h light experiments. In addition, the effect of additional heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd) were selected for short period experiments on the survival of Asellus aquaticus. Juveniles were found to be more sensitive than adults to all factors. The effect of predation by Gammarus tigrinus on Asellus aquaticus was also examined. In order to determine whether or not the structure of the exoskeleton of A. aquaticus was being affected by water quality, this structure was examined using steroscan electron microscopy. Plaques were found on the surface of asellids from long-term zinc experiments which may help to explain the survival of asellids despite their apparent high burden of zinc. (D73079/87)

TI  - GENETIC VARIATION IN THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON LIFE HISTORY TRAITS AND ADAPTATION TO THERMALLY HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS BY TROPICAL MILKWEED BUGS (ONCOPELTUS) (GENOTYPE-BY-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION, FASCIATUS)
SP  - 163
AB  - Strains of the Large Milkweed Bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus), descended from two Costa Rican populations in habitats with distinctively different thermal regimes show differences in life-history traits when they are reared in the same constant conditions. They also differ in the effects of temperature differences on six of eight life-history traits studied. The traits contribute to all of the major components of fitness (survival, fecundity, and rate of development). When considered in light of the effects of these differences on the intrinsic rate of increase (r) at different temperatures, the results indicate that local adaptation has occurred, even though the same life-history traits (e.g., high fecundity) are favored by natural selection across all thermal habitats in this colonizing species. The results suggest that different genotypes confer the favored traits in different environments. Strains of a closely-related species, Oncopeltus cingulifer, from the same sites show no evidence of overall life-history adaptation to local temperatures. In contrast to the widely-distributed O. fasciatus, O. cingulifer is an exclusively tropical species. It is argued that O. cingulifer lacks genetic variation that is sufficiently organized to permit rapid adaptation to cool habitats. When families of sisters (full-sibs) of O. fasciatus are divided and reared at two different temperatures, the families differ in their life-history responses to temperature differences. The finding of statistically significant family-by-temperature interactions indicates that the species harbors genetic variation for "temperature specialists." There is no evidence of an adaptive acclimation response to rearing temperature in O. fasciatus. The results are discussed in terms of a simple solution to the paradox of high heritabilities for life-history traits in natural populations in spite of strong uniformly directional selection on these traits. If different alleles at some loci confer the favored traits in different environments, then local adaptation will result in genetically-based life-history variation across environments. Gene flow between habitats could preserve genetic variation affecting life-history characters within populations.

TI  - EFFECTS OF SELECTED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND CHEMICAL ECOLOGY OF PLANT TRICHOMES ON TOMATO SUITABILITY FOR KEIFERIA LYCOPERSICELLA (WALSINGHAM)
SP  - 106
AB  - Tomato pinworm (TPW), Keiferia lycopersicella (Walsingham), growth and survival were studied at selected temperatures from 11-41(DEGREES)C. Developmental time from egg to adult ranged from 118.4 days at 14(DEGREES)C to 18.6 days at 35(DEGREES)C. Lower thermal thresholds were determined by extrapolation from linear regression lines for egg and larval stages. Pupal development was not linear and no lower threshold was estimated. TPW survival and development were also studied on three selected maturity stages of tomato foliage and fruit. Delayed larval development, higher mortality, and reduced leaf consumption by TPW were observed on two wild tomatoes, Lycopersicon hirsutum (LA 361) and L. hirsutum f. glabratum (PI 134417), when compared with the commercial variety, L. esculentum cv. VFN 7718. The exudate of type VI trichomes of these wild accessions provided significant antibiotic effects against neonate larvae of TPW. Basal cells of type VI trichomes and other epidermal cells as well as most of the palisade mesophyll cells of PI 134417 were not consumed by TPW larvae. Similar results were not evident for LA 361 and VFN 7718. Two normal odd-chained keones, 2-undecanone and 2-tridecanone, and one unknown sesquiterpene, comprised approximately 95% of the contents of a gland of PI 134417. In a closely related species, LA 361, two unknown insecticidal sesquiterpenes accounted for 6% of the gland contents. Additionally, small amounts of one unknown monoterpene and another unknown sesquiterpene were found in type VI glands of VFN 7718. Bioassays comparing the gland exudate and isooctane extracts of glands to neonate larvae of TPW and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) indicated that: (1) 2-tridecanone and 2-undecanone were the major insecticidal compounds in PI 134417, (2) the two unknown sesquiterpenes in LA 361 were acutely toxic to both species and, (3) gland contents in the VFN 7718 provided only a physical barrier to TPW and were not detrimental to S. exigua. In topical bioassay of synthetic 2-tridecanone and 2-undecanone (3:1) demonstrated potentiation. Concentrations of these chemicals decreased as trichomes aged. Quantities of insecticidal chemicals and density of type VI trichomes varied with plant age and location within plants.

TI  - LIFE HISTORY STUDIES OF THE PINE SCALE, CHIONASPIS HETEROPHYLLAE COOLEY, AND THE PINE NEEDLE SCALE, CHIONASPIS PINIFOLIAE (FITCH) (ILLINOIS, INDIANA, KENTUCKY, MICHIGAN)
SP  - 289
AB  - Life histories of the Pine Scale, Chionaspis heterophyllae Cooley, and the Pine Needle Scale, C. pinifoliae (Fitch) (Homoptera:Diaspididae), were determined on separate plantings of Scots Pine, Pinus sylvestris. Although both species were bivoltine and overwintered primarily as eggs, a portion of the population for each species completed a partial third generation, overwintering as mated adult females. C. heterophyllae general seasonal development and summer crawler emergence preceeded that of C. pinifoliae. Blooming of Spiraea x vanhouttei and pollen release of P. sylvestris coincided with spring crawler activity, while Cotinus coggygria and Campsis radicans were blooming as summer crawlers emerged. Accumulation of 250-270 heat units (base 50 F) had occurred before crawlers emerged in the spring and 1330-1470 heat units accumulated prior to summer emergence. C. pinifoliae settled preferentially on the concave needle surface on P. sylvestris, whereas C. heterophyllae settled on concave and convex surfaces. The male:female ratio was 40:60 for C. pinifoliae and 25:75 for C. heterophyllae. Fecundity estimates of first (ca. 25 eggs/female) and second (ca. 55 eggs/female) generation were the same for both scale species. Natural enemies were listed with estimates of percent predation or parasitism and pertinent biological observations. National host ranges and geographic distributions were recorded. A new host record for C. heterophyllae was Picea abies and new state records of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Michigan were discussed. Prepupal, pupal and adult male descriptions for C. heterophyllae and C. pinifoliae were made studying materials from several areas of the United States. Scales were determined to be in two distinct morphological groups, C. pinifoliae males being larger than those of C. heterophyllae. Adult males of both species were smaller when feeding on Pinus mugo than when on P. sylvestris. Presence of individuals with 8-segmented antennae and absence of wingless males distinguished C. heterophyllae and C. pinifoliae from other described Chionaspis species.

TI  - CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF THE FILBERT APHID, MYZOCALLIS CORYLI (GOETZE) (HOMOPTERA: APHIDIDAE) IN WESTERN OREGON
SP  - 144
AB  - A classical biological control project was undertaken against the filbert aphid, Myzocallis coryli (Goetze), in western Oregon. Hazelnut orchards in Spain, France, and Italy were searched for natural enemies of the aphid, and a parasitic wasp, Trioxys pallidus Haliday, was imported, quarantined, mass-reared, and released in Oregon orchards. The wasp successfully attacks and completes its development on the Oregon race of the filbert aphid. A greenhouse culture of the parasitoid has been maintained continuously for over 50 generations, and approximately 30,000 adult wasps have been released in the Willamette Valley. Overwintering survival has been documented in at least eight different locations. In three commercial orchards, the parasitoids reduced aphid populations by 26-32%. The newly imported biotype of T. pallidus attacking the filbert aphid was compared with the previously established biotype attacking the walnut aphid. The two races are morphologically indistinguishable, and were shown to freely hybridize in reciprocal crosses, producing viable, fertile offspring. However, the races showed distinct differences in host suitability, with the newly imported biotype having greater reproductive success on filbert aphids than the previously established (walnut) biotype. Bionomics of both M. coryli and T. pallidus were studied in the laboratory. Data indicate a higher developmental threshold for overwintering parasitoid pupae (7.4(DEGREES)C.) than for overwintering aphid eggs (3.3(DEGREES)C.). Based on a common threshold of 6.0(DEGREES)C., thermal requirements for time-to-adult are ca. 240 and 265 degree days for summer generations of aphids and parasitoids, respectively. Diapause termination in aphids is more strongly influenced by winter chilling than is diapause termination in parasitoids.

TI  - BIONOMICS OF MANTISPA VIRIDIS WALKER (NEUROPTERA: MANTISPIDAE) (SPIDERS, REARING, DISTRIBUTION)
SP  - 106
AB  - Field and laboratory studies were conducted from 1982 through 1986 in the Clemson area of South Carolina to investigate the biology of Mantispa viridis Walker (Neuroptera: Mantispidae). These studies documented the developmental biology of this species from egg to adult, female egg production, adult mating behavior and survival, spider host associations, adult and immature seasonal cycles, and overwintering stages. In addition, laboratory procedures and techniques were developed to rear and maintain colonies of this and two other mantispid species, M. pulchella (Banks) and M. interrupta Say. Development from egg to adult averaged 33.2 d under laboratory conditions of 25(DEGREES)C, 80% RH, and 16L:8D photoperiod. Both fresh and freezer-stored eggs of 27 spider species distributed in 14 families proved nutritionally adequate to rear M. viridis from the first instar to adult. Mated, laboratory-reared females (n = 3) produced an average of 59.3 (+OR-) 3.8 egg clutches during their lifetime, with 23 (+OR-) 3.2 of these containing fertile eggs. Egg production of mated females decreased when fertile eggs were no longer produced, but this lower fecundity level remained higher than that of unmated females. Male M. viridis possess two pairs of eversible glands located in the third and fourth abdominal segments. These are everted during the precopulatory mating sequence and appear to be related to pheromone production. Adults (n = 28) reared from spider egg sacs and maintained under laboratory conditions lived for an average of 156 (+OR-) 8.1 d. Field-collected immatures of M. viridis were associated with 21 spider genera representing 13 families. The majority of the species host records (n = 23) were from the spider superfamilies Araneoidea and Clubionoidea. Immatures of M. viridis were associated with egg sacs of nine spider species on more than one occasion. Two of these, Metepeira labyrinthea (Hentz) and Agelenopsis sp. accounted for 63% of the total (n = 125) M. viridis associations. Field studies from 1982 through 1986 showed that all immature stages of M. viridis can overwinter, but that adults die during the first prolonged period of subfreezing temperatures. Immatures overwinter within the egg sac of their spider host and develop to the adult during the spring months. These individuals produced the first M. viridis generation for the year, which is followed by at least two others each season.

TI  - THE FIRST CELL CYCLE REORGANIZATION AT THE PERIPHERY OF FERTILIZED XENOPUS EGGS
SP  - 175
AB  - Specification of the amphibian dorso-ventral axis takes place in the period between fertilization and first cleavage when the grey crescent forms. In the course of grey crescent formation, the egg reorganizes its periphery by a movement for which conflicting descriptions have been given. The primary goal of this study was to reinvestigate the case of Xenopus eggs by imprinting one kind of fluorescent dye pattern (nile blue) onto the subcortical cytoplasm and another kind (fluorescein-lectin) onto the egg surface. When the egg surface is held fixed by embedding the egg in gelatin, two movements of the subcortical cytoplasm are observable during the first cell cycle: an overall rotation over an arc of $30\sp\circ$ of the subcortical cytoplasm relative to the egg surface, and, superimposed on the rotation, a convergence of the animal subcortical cytoplasm around the sperm entry point. In normal unembedded eggs, when the egg surface is free to move, it is the cortex that rotates $30\sp\circ$ relative to the subcortical cytoplasm, which remains stationary (except for the contraction in the animal hemisphere). The direction of rotation in the egg predicts the location of the embryonic axis better than does the site of sperm entry. I thus suggest that rotation, not convergence, specifies the embryo's prospective axis. I also give evidence that the important axis-specifying events are taking place in the vegetal hemisphere. A pharmacological study demonstrates the need for polymerized tubulin in movement generation. The need for actin filaments is still unclear. Using nonlethal treatments (UV irradiation, egg tilting, and cold) to artificially control the extent of rotation, I demonstrated an overall correlation, although quite variable, between the extent of movement in the vegetal hemisphere and the completeness of axial development. In all cases, no complete axis develops from an egg which underwent no rotation at all. Thus, rotation in the egg constitutes a cue, but does not generate precise instructions for subsequent development. If eggs are treated with ${\rm D\sb2 O}$ around time 0.3, rotation is reduced in extent. Yet, "hyperdorsal development" often follows. It is possible that ${\rm D\sb2 O}$ acts directly on the step cued by rotation.

It often occupies freshwaters with above average levels of conductivity. The ecology of Gammarus tigrinus from three sites at Attenborough Gravel Pits and from two sites at Brinsley (North Nottinghamshire) was studied from February 1983 to May 1984 and from July 1984 to July 1985 respectively. All five sites had above normal levels of conductivity, particularly those at Brinsley which were polluted by coal mining effluent. Initially densities of G. tigrinus were high at Attenborough but declined dramatically towards the end of 1983 for an unknown reason. At the five sites monthly measurements were made of water conductivity, temperature, oxygen, pH and heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper and cadmium). Monthly samples of Gammarus tigrinus were examined to assess the sex ratio, the ratio of various post-marsupial stages, the relation between body length and dry weight, the size classes and the number of articles on the antenna. It was found that the population structure varied significantly between the sites which exhibited different water quality. Breeding was found to start earlier in the year at Attenborough when compared with Brinsley; however, at all sites two generations per year were found. Significant differences were found between the sites with regard to population density and the relationship between body length and body dry weight. Gammarids of similar body length were found to be of a much lower dry weight at sites with abnormal water conductivity. In order to assess the extent of disappearance of G. tigrinus at Attenborough an extensive survey was undertaken of the gravel pits system. This revealed a very high diversity of species even in the waters of low quality indicating that other species had not been similarly affected. G. tigrinus was originally recorded from western and central England and a geographical survey in Nottinghamshire was undertaken to assess its spread eastwards. This indicated that the species is continuing to move across the country via rivers and canals. As water quality had been shown to have a significant effect on the biology of Gammarus tigrinus, laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the effects of total water quality, conductivity, temperature, pH and selected heavy metals on the survival, growth, respiration and osmoregulation of G. tigrinus. In some experiments comparison was made with another amphipod, Crangonyx pseudogracilis. All the experiments showed that increased conductivity, temperature and heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper, cadmium) affected the biology of these two species and may be involved in controlling their distribution. Food preference experiments showed that there was no relationship between the disappearance of G. tigrinus and the food sources in Attenborough. The effects of water quality and geographical location on the enzyme patterns of amphipods is currently a topical problem. The last section of this thesis describes results obtained by electrophoresis for a number of enzymes in Gammarus tigrinus collected from three sites of different water quality to see if differences could be detected. Comparisons were made with Crangonyx pseudogracilis and Gammarus pulex. (D71665/87)

TI  - Ecology and reproductive biology of acanthodactylus schmidti in central arabia
SP  - 1
AB  - The ecology and reproductive biology of Acanthodactylus schmidti (lacertidae) in Central Arabia north of Riyadh was studied from 1983 to 1985. The ecology of Acanthodactylus boskianus was also studied as a comparison during the same period. Growth of both species, survival and the morphological adaptations to the desert environment were examined. Home range size of both species was estimated in the study area. Home range size of male A. schmidti was four times that of the female's home range during spring. The male A. boskianus home range was about two times greater than that of the females. Utilization of home range and the social interactions of invdividuals of both species was investigated. Home range overlap, burrowing behaviour and burrow structure was also examined in the field. Male A. schmidti were observed to defend their home range against other males during spring. Activity and thermal ecology of both species was studied during winter and spring. Emergence behaviour, basking behaviour, daily and seasonal activity was studied and analysed. Both species were active throughout the year. However, it was found that during winter, activity was unimodal, which contrasted with the bimodal pattern during spring. The winter mean eccritic body temperature was 33.0 and 34.1oC for A. schmidti and A. boskianus respectively, and 36oC, 35.3oC during spring. A. schmidti was found to thermoregulate more effectively than A. boskianus during both winter and spring. Selected body temperature and critical minimum of both species were studied and measured in the laboratory. The reproductive biology of A. schmidti was studied in some detail. The reproductive season commenced in November and continued throughout May and was found to coincide with the rainy season of the area. Young lizards were observed between February and mid-June. This suggests the presence of multiple clutches (possibly 2-3) during the reproduction season. It was concluded that multiple clutches were an important adaptation for lizards in such an unpredictable desert environment. Reproductive behaviour, male and female reproductive cycle, and fat body cycle also were studied. Finally, the general ecology and conservation of Arabian desert reptiles is discussed and suggestions for management of desert reptile communities are suggested. (D73648/87)

TI  - Technical change and electricity generation and supply in great britain 1960-1980: with special reference to the evaluation of schemes for the combined production of electricity and heat
SP  - 1
AB  - In interaction with the wider society and economy, technology and technological change can have major geographical impacts. One spatially significant technology was studied: the thermal production of electricity in Great Britain since c.1960. Analysis of the development and use of the dominant form of the technology, condensing generation, in the UK on an integrated, centralised public electricity supply system revealed that this was not a technically inevitable process but was influenced by the specific economic, social and behavioural context. A competing technology where useful heat is derived from generating plant as well as electricity has been widely used by industry, producing a less centralised pattern based on smaller turbines than the grid. Its lesser and declining importance is explained primarily by its economic viability for users. This is argued not to imply that CHP has abstractly inferior economics, because of differences between the criteria used by private industry to assess it and those used by the CEGB for condensing generation. Simulation exercises showed that, if analysed as a public sector investment, it was economically and technically viable to generate more electricity from CHP than currently. A variety of possible reductions in primary fuel use as a result of the higher thermal efficiency of CHP were estimated. The lack of public sector investment in CHP was explained in terms of the relative timing of the availability of fuel and technology and rapid growth of electricity demand, the CEGB's interpretation of the statutary definition of its role and the conflict produced with wider energy policy by the increased oil and decreased coal consumption produced by many CHP options. Theoretically, the analysis suggests that the spatial impact of technology cannot be analysed independently of the process of production and selection of technology from available alternatives. Technological change is argued not to be explicable in terms of simple mono-casual models that are widely used but to depend upon the interaction of social, technical, economic and behavioural factors.

TI  - Environmental and genetic factors regulating the breeding season of the vole
SP  - 1
AB  - Photoperiod appeared to be the primary environmental factor regulating the rate of sexual maturation of field voles: long photoperiods promoted sexual development and short photoperiods caused gonadal inhibition. The testes of males placed in long photoperiods had a higher number of luteinizing hormone receptors than those of males placed in short photoperiods. The testosterone content was higher amongst males from long photoperiods than amongst those from short photoperiods, although testosterone concentrations did not differ. The effects of three other environmental factors were studied: The presence of a mature male vole increased the rate of sexual maturation of weanling females, probably through the effects of a pheromone produced by the male. There was some indication that the presence of a mature male decreased the rate of sexual maturation of weanling males. The protein content of the diet had little effect on the reproductive state of males or females, unless reduced to 4% , when growth was retarded and sexual maturation imhibited. Ambient temperature had no effect on the sexual development of female voles, and a slight, and varying, effect on the reproductive state of males. In general, the effect of each environmental factor appeared to be separate, a combination of factors producing additive, and not interactive, effects. The genotype of the vole influenced the rate of sexual maturation of the animals in long and short photoperiods. Effects of genotype were shown in two instances: Laboratory stock male and female field voles grew and matured sexually at a faster rate than the F1 generation of wild-caught animals (Wild F1) in long and short photoperiods. The testes of laboratory stock males had a higher testosterone content and concentration than those of Wild F1 males, from the age of 21<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif">1 days. Selecting amongst the F1 generation of wild-caught animals for greater or lesser degrees of sexual development in a short photoperiod gave rise, in the next generation, to two distinct lines of voles, differing in their rates of sexual maturation and of growth in long and short photoperiods.

TI  - Aspects of reproduction and behaviour in the lizard (Chalcides ocellatus)
SP  - 1
AB  - The skink Chalcides ocellatus Forskal (1775) was used to study aspects of reproduction in vivaparous lizards. A technique of cardiac puncture was developed to obtain repeated samples from individuals. Hormone levels were determined using RIA giving a range of 0 to 34.9 ng ml-1 oestrone and 0 to 40.44 mg ml-1 progesterone. The anaesthetic ketamine hydrochloride was tested and used at a dose of 70 mg kg-1. Laparoscopy was developed for sex determination. In a thermal gradient the skinks maintained a mean body temperature of 30.62<IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.03oC. The mean body temperature of a pregnant lizard (34.04 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.19oC) was significantly higher (p***) than in non-pregnant females (30.43 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 2.09oC) and males (27.79 <IMG WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=20 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/maths/pm.gif"> 0.76oC). There is a large inter and intra-individual variation in temperature selection, and apparent seasonal and physiological effects. No correlation was found in females between any thermoregulatory parameter and reproductive hormone levels. Ovulation could be inferred from hormone changes. Mating occurred irrespective of almost any stage of follicular development. Repeat copulation seems to be necessary for successful conception. True gestation length is 40-50 days, the discrepancy is unresolvable due to sperm storage. The effects of environmental factors on reproductive activity were studied in controlled laboratory conditions, using A) constant 31oC, 14L:10D; B) constant 31oC 8L:16D; C) fluctuating seasonal conditions. Temperature appears to be the permissive factor, lizards from group A breeding nearly all year round, whilst B and C were limited to summer. The reduction in photoperiod by two hours postponed breeding by two months in group B. However, this could be attributed to their more recent exposure to natural cues. Superovulation trials failed to give reliable results. Reproductive behaviours have been observed, and found to be similar to other scincids. Sperm storage occurs in the deep clefts of the ciliated epithelium in the lower part of the oviduct. A short SEM study of the hemipenes has shown them to be a simple conical shape with little surface ornamentation. Some embryological details are described.

TI  - BIOLOGY OF IMMATURE CULICOIDES VARIIPENNIS SSP. AUSTRALIS (COQ.) (DIPTERA: CERATOPOGONIDAE) AT SALTVILLE, VA (VIRGINIA)
SP  - 126
AB  - The larval and pupal biology of a unique population of Culicoides variipennis inhabiting the brine ponds of Saltville, VA was studied. Developmental threshold temperatures ((DEGREES)C) and thermal constants ((DEGREES)days) for larvae and pupae were 9.6(DEGREES)C and 387(DEGREES)days (larval stage) and 9.6(DEGREES)C and 30(DEGREES)days (pupal stage) respectively. Accumulated heat units recorded in the field ranged from 366-376(DEGREES)days between successive generations in the summer. Heat accumulations required for completion of immature development of C. variipennis were found to be much greater (831(DEGREES)days) for the overwintering generation. During the summar, larval/pupal distribution within the littoral zone of a brine pond was confined to the surface cm of mud at or near the shoreline. Insects overwintered farther offshore, mostly as 3rd instars. In early March, most larvae had molted to 4th instars and migrated above shoreline to pupate. Adult emergence occurred in April. Three summer generations were documented for 1983-1984 at Saltville. Life tables and survivorship curves were calculated for the overwintering generation and the first summer generations for 1983 and 1984. For the overwintering generation, there was a relatively constant mortality rate between successive age-classes (Type II survivorship curve). During the summer, there was relatively little mortality between successive larval age-classes but a dramatic increase in mortality was evident at the pupal stage (Type I survivorship curve). Late instar larvae were found to migrate from the shoreline onto the exposed mudflats to pupate, thus becoming vulnerable to predation by ants and carabid beetles. Excellent survival rates of the larvae during the summer was attributed to habitat stability, the paucity of predators and parasites and abundant microfloral content (i.e. food) of the pond water. Intra-specific competition for food resources appeared to be alleviated somewhat by partitioning of those resources on a diurnal cycle.

TI  - TEMPERATURE HETEROGENEITY AND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN LIFE HISTORY PATTERNS OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER (PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, METABOLIC RATE, FITNESS)
SP  - 284
AB  - A crucial problem in evolutionary biology is the development of a general theory for the evolution of adaptive life histories in environments that differ in degree of fluctuation and predictability of sequential conditions. Resolution of this problem requires examination of the phenotypic and genetic structure of life history components in populations that differ in environmental heterogeneity. I examined variation in viability, development time, age-specific fecundity, longevity and rate of metabolism for populations of Drosophila melanogaster from sites representing three points on the stable-fluctuating continuum for temperature variation. The observed differences in population means, phenotypic and genetic correlation structure, and phenotypic plasticity indicate that different selective pressures operate in stable as opposed to fluctuating environments. Flies from the thermally stable population were characteristically highly sensitive to environmental change and displayed many attributes of a K-selected population. The ecologically marginal site engendered more r-selected life history patterns. The flies showed marked plasticity in response to an environmental shift from 22(DEGREES) to 25(DEGREES)C, but were homeostatic in response to warmer temperatures. Flies from variable environments exhibited higher rates of metabolism. These data suggest that in variable environments, responsiveness to conditions conducive to reproductive success may be at a selective premium, while in more stable regimes specialist genotypes with lower reproductive rates may be favored. Potential differences in mode and timing of selective action are discussed. Phenotypic correlation structure was markedly different for the three populations and appeared to reflect temperature specific constraints. Tradeoffs between early and late life components were especially severe at low temperatures, but the form of the cost differed by population. The presence of considerable genetic variability for early life traits could not be explained by the variable pleiotropy hypothesis, since genetic correlation structure did not show the expected negative relationships between early and late life traits. The marked changes in genetic variance-covariance structure with minor shifts in environmental temperature suggest that current quantitative genetic models of life history evolution will not be adequate for heterogeneous environments. Other approaches to resolving the life history dilemma are addressed.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION AND ECOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA EUSEIUS SPECIES (ACARI: PHYTOSEIIDAE) (COMPETITION, PREFERENCE)
SP  - 127
AB  - Morphological and ecological variation among Euseius hibisci (Chant) populations in California was noted by other workers and in preliminary studies. The studies reported here were performed to determine the number of Euseius species in California and to characterize some biological differences between them. Measurements of dorsal shield and leg setae distinguished three morphologically distinct forms which were cultured on the laboratory. Crossing studies demonstrated varying degrees of reproductive isolation between them. Geographically disjunct populations of the same morphological forms proved reproductively compatible. Two additional species were recognized as occurring in California with E. hibisci: E. tularensis Congdon and E. quetzali McMurtry. Extensive collections revealed differences in species distributions. E. hibisci occurred on citrus and avocado in coastal regions from Santa Barbara, California through Oaxaca, Mexico. In sympatry with E. tularensis it was usually confined to avocado. E. tularensis predominated on citrus in the interior valleys of central and southern California. E. quetzali was collected on native Quercus and Rubus. Its geographic range included those of the other two species and extended beyond them to northern coastal areas and higher elevations. Weather record analysis showed that climatic conditions differ between the ranges of E. tularensis and E. hibisci. E. tularensis occurs in areas with greater temperature extremes. Possible factors responsible for host plant specificity were examined. Survival and oviposition tests on different leaf substrates and substrate preference experiments were performed. These tests demonstrated differences in oviposition rates and substrate selectivity in response to leaves of different species. The possible role of interspecific competition as a determinant of distribution was examined. A replacement series experiment suggested that the two species are mutually antagonistic at high densities. At lower densities interaction did not affect oviposition rate. Prey selectivity was studied in E. tularensis by observation of responses to potential food items. Consumption:contact ratio was highest for pollen, followed by citrus thrips, pacific spider mite, citrus red mite, and Euseius hibisci larvae. Periodic sampling from undisturbed native shrubs indicated that E. tularensis occurred at higher densities on Heteromeles arbutifolia M. Roem than on Rhus laurina Nutt. Citrus thrips densities were much higher on R. laurina.

TI  - Predation of infaunal bivalves by Carcinus maenas (L.) in the Burry Inlet, South Wales
SP  - 311
AB  - Laboratory experiments and field studies in the Burry Inlet were designed to investigate the impact of crab predation on population of burrowing bivalves. Sampling of Carcinus maenas in the Inlet indicated that significant numbers of adult crabs move on to the sand banks at every flood tide for all but the coldest months of the year, but it proved difficult to estimate actual numbers. Settlement of first stage crabs occurs in July. These young crabs live in nursery areas near HWNT until about one year old. Stomach contents analysis demonstrated that large C. maenas feed mainly on infaunal bivalves. The priority food varied from one season to another and between juveniles and adults. Laboratory experiments were conducted on the predatory behaviour of the crab, on four infaunal bivalve species. Methods used by crabs to open the bivalve shells are described and shown to be related to shell strength. For any given crab size, there was an optimal prey size where the prey value was at a maximum. Other experiments showed that crabs selected prey of a size close to the predicted optim\im both for Cerasto- derma edule and Macoma balthica even when they were buried in the sand. Burrowing behaviour of both M. balthica and Scrobicularia plana was found to significantly reduce crab predation, but it had little effect in the case of the shallow burrower C. edule. Crabs preyed heavily on those bivalves that occurred close to the sand surface. When crabs were offered similar sized, small specimens of three species of bivalves buried in sand, they actively selected cockles. Protection of small cockles from various predators by the use of cages in the field decreased their mortality. It was concluded that crabs must be considered serious predators of first and second summer cockles.

TI  - FACTORS AFFECTING VOLTINISM IN THE TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLY, PAPILIO GLAUCUS L. (HOST SELECTION, MICROHABITAT, DEVELOPMENTAL THRESHOLD TEMPERATURE)
SP  - 126
AB  - Caterpillars of the tiger swallowtail butterfly, (Papilio glaucus), feed on more than 13 families of plants. They show considerable differences in growth rate and efficiency on the various host plants. Larval growth can be modelled by determining a developmental threshold temperature (T(,o)) at which growth can begin and calculating the number of growth degree hours above this threshold necessary to complete development. In the Flanders, New Jersey area, the tiger swallowtail is bivoltine although there are rarely sufficient growth degree hours to support two broods. A method for calculating leaf surface area of host trees was devised and all host plants in the study area were measured to determine the availability of resources. Females selected the host species which afforded their offspring the maximum growth rate and not that which was most abundant. In addition to host selection, females selected microhabits which benefitted eggs and larvae. Over 69% of the observed eggs had been oviposited on the western and southern sides of trees. Animals with these exposures developed significantly faster than would be predicted from laboratory tests without radiation. Over 97% of the eggs found were at heights between 0.5 and 2.5m. Larvae placed at 5m had significantly lower body temperatures than those at 1m due to increases in wind and convective cooling at greater heights. Larvae use silk to curl the leaf on which they rest to act as a parabolic reflector and help shield the larvae from cooling breezes. Univoltine tiger swallowtails from Ithaca, New York, have a T(,o) of 11.7(DEGREES)C. In the New Jersey population the T(,o) is 9.4(DEGREES)C. This lower T(,o) permits New Jersey populations to develop 9.23% faster. The combination of behavioral and physiological adaptations by the tiger swallowtail butterfly increases the probability of successfully completing development in this part of its range.

TI  - BIONOMICS OF TETRANYCHUS CINNABARINUS (BOISDUVAL) (ACARI: TETRANYCHIDAE) ON COTTON
SP  - 96
AB  - Laboratory and field research during 1982 and 1983 was conducted to better understand the biology of Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval) and its role in the cotton agroecosystem of the Imperial Valley, California. To determine the effect of temperature and/or humidity on the species character of dorsal strial lobes, mites of the Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval)-T. urticae Koch complex were reared at two temperature and humidity regimes for 10 generations. Measurements indicate that the dorsal strial lobe densities vary with changes in temperature and/or humidity. Citrus thrips (Scirtothrips citri (Moulton)) were found in large numbers during sampling of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. 'Deltapine 61') in the Imperial Valley. Because citrus thrips had not been previously reported in cotton, and because another thrips species had recently been found to be an important spider mite predator in cotton, a study was conducted to determine if S. citri could develop on cotton and/or mite eggs. Tests showed that development could occur on cotton leaves alone or on mite eggs alone, however, S. citri is probably a minor predator with little impact on spider mite field populations. The effects of five pesticides on the within-plant distribution as well as the spatial dispersion of T. cinnabarinus (Boisduval) were examined in a 2-year field study in cotton in the Imperial Valley. The within-plant distribution of the mites on mainstem node leaves was not significantly affected by the pesticides. Throughout the season, mainstem node leaf 5 consistently had one of the highest densities of mites. The linear regression of log variance against log mean provided a better fit to the data than did the linear regression of mean crowding on the mean. The former regression was used as a basis for a sampling plan designed to estimate population densities of T. cinnabarinus with fixed levels of precision. Several dispersion and regression indices were calculated for populations of female T. cinnabarinus (Boisduval). Cx, Ip and m/m as well as the slopes from the regressions all indicated that the population was slightly aggregated. The variance/mean ratio may be less reliable than previously thought.

TI  - GENETIC STUDIES IN POECILIA AND TILAPIA
SP  - 416
AB  - Genetic variability in five strains of the guppy (Poecilia recticulata) has been assayed electrophoretically at 22 to 25 structural gene loci coding for 19 enzyme systems. The levels of polymorphism (0.158-0.263) and heterozygosities (0.078-0.125) obtained for the strains indicate that they are as variable as any other fish species, though guppies are in general thought of as inbred due to continued and close mating in domestication. Genetical effects of thermal selection have been assayed in two single strains and four hybrid strains of the guppy. The selections continued for 3 to 6 generations in different strains with two temperature-time regimes (44$\sp\circ$C for 8 minutes and 43$\sp\circ$C for 8.5 minutes). The effects of selection on 4 or 5 polymorphic loci were examined and some consistent significant differences in allele frequencies were obtained between the control and the selected lines, though in some of the strains the alleles affected by selection were not consistent. However, the results obtained indicate that such polymorphic loci are closely linked with loci which play an adaptive role in temperature stress. An attempt was made to induce sex-linked mutants in Tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) involving eggs fertilized with sperm in vitro treated with a chemical mutagen, MMS. A few aberrant phenotypes were obtained by such treatment in the hybrid (O. mossambicus x O. niloticus). No evidence of a genetic basis for any of these phenotypes was obtained. MMS treatment of sperm in O. niloticus show dominant lethality. Chromosome manipulation involving the production of triploid and gynogenesis were carried out in O. niloticus. The results suggest that though triploidy can be induced relatively easily, the gynogenetic technique needs more work to be done on the optimization of UV-irradiation dose. A comparative growth trial between diploid and triploid fish together with comparisons on various body parameters suggest that triploids in this species are largely inferior to the diploids. Gynogenetic techniques were resorted to as an inbreeding method to uncover any recessive mutation in females produced by in vitro fertilization with sperm treated with MMS and while no mutations of any sort were found, the all-female nature of the gynogenetic progeny is a confirmation that the females in this species are homogametic.

TI  - SEASONAL, ANNUAL, AND INTERSPECIFIC CORRELATES OF THERMAL ACCLIMATION IN PLETHODONTID SALAMANDERS (CRITICAL MAXIMA, MINIMA, METABOLISM)
SP  - 163
AB  - In this study, the thermal acclimation of critical thermal minima (CTMin) and maxima (CTMax) were examined annually and seasonally in several species of plethodontid salamanders. The factors were considered relative to constant and cycling (thermoperiod) temperature regimes (Chapt. 1) and time courses of acclimation (Chapt. 3). Thermal hardening of CTMax and CTMin were also considered (Chapt. 2). Finally, seasonal and annual correlates were considered in the constant temperature and thermoperiod acclimation of metabolism in Desmognathus quadramaculatus (Chapt. 4). Various species demonstrated the ability to undergo thermal acclimation of both CTMax and CTMin at different constant temperatures. The former seems to be well correlated with the ecogeographic distributions of these species, whereas the latter showed little interspecific variation. These animals showed an ability to acclimate to a thermoperiod by adjusting their CTMax and CTMin appropriately. These responses were best developed in highly terrestrial species such as Plethodon jordani and P. cinereus. Annual and seasonal differences existed among the CTMax and CTMin, but these did not fit any obvious adaptive patterns. Hardening was, at best, poorly developed in the species studied here. In D. monticola, this phenomenon was highly body size dependent for both the CTMax and CTMin. The time courses of CTMax and CTMin acclimation paralleled the interspecific trends reported in Chapter 1. The magnitude of acclimation was considerably greater for the CTMin than the CTMax. These responses were fairly stable annually, and the CTMin acclimation was altered seasonally in a manner corresponding to ecological constraints. Thermal acclimation of metabolism in D. quadramaculatus differed considerably between constant temperatures and a thermoperiod. The temperature sensitivity for the latter was considerably reduced. There was no undercompensation at low acclimation temperatures, and metabolism proved to be highly stable on an annual basis. Some seasonal lability of metabolism was observed. The temperature acclimation responses of these amphibians presumably influence their ecological success. In particular, the ability to selectively adjust their temperature tolerances and metabolic rates to cyclic temperature regimes may be crucial for their exploitation of the environment in light of considerable thermal variability.

TI  - POPULATION ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY OF THE MOLE SALAMANDER AMBYSTOMA TALPOIDEUM (EGG SIZE, CLUTCH, MASS)
SP  - 151
AB  - The population ecology of Ambystoma talpoideum was studied at five breeding sites varying in the probability of drying. Terrestrial drift fences with pitfall traps were used to monitor migration of adults and metamorphosing juveniles. Breeding migrations "en masse" occurred in November, December, or January. Total number of breeding adults was correlated with cumulative rainfall during the time of immigration. Sex ratio of immigrating adults at the beginning of the breeding season was significantly biased towards males whereas at the end of the season it was biased towards females. Emigration of adults from the breeding sites occurred each March. Emigration of metamorphosing juveniles took place as early as May and continued until the breeding site dried. In semi-permanent breeding sites most larvae did not metamorphose but remained in the ponds and matured sexually. One-year old terrestrial morphs had larger snout-vent lengths than 1-yr old paedmorphs but were smaller in body mass. Body mass and snout-vent length increased with age in both morphs. Clutch mass, number of ova, and diameter of ova increased with snout-vent length. After removing the effects of snout-vent with an analysis of covariance, only the diameter of ova and the resultant clutch mass increased with age. One-year old terrestrial morphs produced more ova than 1-yr old paedomorphs. Reproductive investment, as shown by the relationship between clutch size and egg size, increased with age. In replicated artificial ponds simulating permanent and temporary breeding ponds the water level in the drying treatment decreased during the experimental period with no apparent differences in water chemistry parameters between treatments and only a slight change in water temperature. Quality of the growth environment for larvae and survivorship was the same among experimental treatments. Frequency of metamorphosis was different between water level treatments and between population treatments. Frequency of paedomorphosis was different between population treatments but not between water level treatments. Population differences in the frequency of metamorphosis and paedomorphosis presumably represent genetic differences resulting from the different selective regimes individuals encounter among breeding sites varying in permanency.

TI  - BIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF TETRANYCHUS CINNABARINUS AND TYPHLODROMUS OCCIDENTALIS (ACARINA: PHYTOSEIIDAE) AT THREE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE REGIMES
SP  - 120
AB  - Temperature effects on the biology of Tetranychus cinnabarinus (Boisduval) and Typhlodromus occidentalis (Nesbitt) (Acarina: Phytoseiidae) were studied in the laboratory. Temperature had a definite effect on the developmental time, longevity and survival of adult females, and duration and rate of oviposition in both T. occidentalis and T. cinnabarinus. Increases in temperature significantly decrease developmental time, pre-oviposition periods, oviposition duration and rate, and the longevity and survival rates of both adult females. However, the daily consumption rate of T. occidentalis protonymph, deutonymph and adult gravid female increased significantly with an increase in temperature. Mean generation times decreased for both mites with an increase in temperature. The intrinsic rate of natural increase rose with each temperature increase. However, the r(,m) of T. occidentalis was less than that for T. cinnabarinus at all temperature regimes, and it decreased from the 26.6(DEGREES) C regime to the 30.5(DEGREES) C regime. Of the three temperatures studied, 22.7(DEGREES), 26.6(DEGREES), and 3.5(DEGREES) C, 22.7(DEGREES) C proved to be the optimum for the predator to maintain control over the prey.

TI  - EFFECTS OF REPEATING AND SWITCHING THREE LARVAL DIETS FOR FOUR GENERATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CORN EARWORM, HELIOTHIS ZEA (BODDIE) (LEPIDOPTERA: NOCTUIDAE)
SP  - 152
AB  - This study was conducted under laboratory conditions to determine the effects of repeating and switching three larval diets from one generation to the next on the development of the corn earworm, Heliothis zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The larval diets used were an alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., meal-based artificial diet, frozen corn, Zea mays L., kernels, and green tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum P. Miller, fruits. Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, larvae were individually transferred to small (29.5 ml) plastic cups. Forty larvae were established on each diet and kept in the rearing chamber at 27 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C temperature, (TURNEQ)65% relative humidity, and 16L:8D photoperiod for the first generation. Diet switching started with the second generation, resulting in nine possible combinations. This procedure was continued in the third generation, providing all 27 possible diet sequences. In the fourth generation, larvae were kept on their parents' larval diet. In the second experiment, the procedure for the first and second generations was the same as that in the first experiment. However, third generation larvae were reared on their parents' larval diet. Diets were switched in the fourth generation resulting in 27 possible diet sequences. The cups were checked daily for larval mortality and pupation. Two cages, each with three females and six males, were set up from each diet for egg deposition. Twenty-five eggs were randomly selected from those oviposited on each of the second, third, and fourth days of oviposition to determine the hatching percentage and duration of the egg stage. The variables measured were as follows: duration of the larval and pupal stages, four-day pupal weights, larval and pupal survival percentages, duration of the preoviposition period, mean number of eggs per female, duration of the egg stage, and egg hatching percentage. From this information the duration of a generation (egg to egg) and the potential daily biomass production per female were calculated. Growth and development of the corn earworm were affected by the different larval diets. Feeding on tomato fruits resulted in significantly longer larval stage durations, lower pupal weights, higher larval mortality rates, lower numbers of eggs per female, longer generation time, and lower biomass production. Feeding on the artificial diet or corn kernels had the opposite effects on the above mentioned variables. . . . (Author's abstract exceeds stipulated maximum length.

TI  - THE RIIA, RIIB, AND 32 CISTRONS OF BACTERIOPHAGE T4: GENE EXPRESSION AND INTERACTIONS WITH BACTERIAL MUTANTS
SP  - 194
AB  - Suppressors of the bacteriophage T4 rIIB toxic polypeptide encoded by the rIIB frameshift mutation FC238 were investigated. I found suppressors that eliminate the toxic polypeptide by creating new translational termination codons, that diminish the toxicity of the polypeptide by altering the amino acid sequence of the toxic protein, that alter the rIIA protein so as to influence toxicity, and that diminish the amount of toxic polypeptide by reducing the quantity of gene expression from the rIIB (FC238) gene. I propose that the toxicity of the FC238 polypeptide derives from its peculiar, bipartite structure and high membrane avidity. Suppressors that detoxify the FC238 polypeptide by missense probably disturb the bipartite structure and/or the affinity for the membrane. Mutants of Escherichia coli B (called TabR) that restrict the growth of bacteriophage T4 rII mutants at high temperature were isolated. I selected pseudorevertants of rII deletion mutants that grow on TabR at high temperature; tk (thymidine kinase) is a component of one class of these pseudorevertants. T4 strains harboring mutations in genes 12, 16, 25, 34, 36, 45, and 63 were also specifically restricted on TabR strains at high temperature. A model for the mechanism by which TabR strains might exert their restriction is presented. Gene 32 of bacteriophage T4 codes for a single-stranded DNA binding protein. I have isolated mutants of E. coli (called Tab32) that specifically restrict the growth of gene 32 missense mutants and allow normal growth of T4('+). During infections of Tab32 with 32tsL171, large amounts of DNA are synthesized and late proteins are made, but very few progeny phage are produced. At least two bacterial mutations are necessary for the restrictive phenotype; these mutations have been mapped to about min 41 and min 64. The Tab32 strains have been used to isolate and characterize about 30 new gene 32 mutants. The characterization (described in Chapter IV) has included analysis of DNA synthesis, fidelity of replication, capacity to repair damaged DNA, and ability to autoregulate the synthesis of gene 32 protein. Based on these results, the role of the gene 32 protein in T4 replication is discussed.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF LOW TEMPERATURE ON THE SURVIVAL, REPRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF APHID VECTORS OF POTATO VIRUS DISEASES IN SCOTLAND. (VOLUMES I AND II)
SP  - 400
AB  - Because of the importance of the winter survival of potato aphids to the spread of potato virus diseases, investigations were made into the effects of low temperature on the survival, reproduction and development of clones of potato aphids from Scotland, where there is a large acreage of seed potatoes. The categorisation of these clones of Myzus persicae and Aulacorthum solani provided information on the abundance and distribution in Scotland of populations with various annual cycles and levels of organophosphorus (OP) resistance. Clones of M. persicae and A. solani were exposed to various low temperature regimes (all with a 16-hr photoperiod) in an attempt to relate their low temperature survival, reproduction and development to their origins, annual cycles or OP resistance. Acclimation in which individuals were reared for one month at 10$\sp\circ$C before exposure to 5$\sp\circ$C, affected the two species differently. When reared for a second generation at 5$\sp\circ$C both species had less efficient nymphal development and M. persicae also had less efficient adult reproduction compared with the first generation at this temperature. At sub-zero temperature, A. solani proved to be less able to survive than M. persicae. A temperature of $-15\sp\circ$C for one hour appeared to be near the limit of survival for both species, and this was supported by the supercooling points determined as $-17.17\sp\circ$C and $-14.85\sp\circ$C for M. persicae and A. solani respectively. In addition to the low temperature studies, observations were made on the recovery of clones at 20$\sp\circ$C after exposure to $-10\sp\circ$C, and also over three generations at 20$\sp\circ$C, after rearing at 5$\sp\circ$C. During the low temperature and recovery experiments, morphometric parameters and alate production were monitored. Scottish field studies carried out over two years provided information on the temperatures experienced by potato aphids in the field. All stages of M. persicae, A. solani and Macrosiphum euphorbiae were found overwintering on brassica and weed hosts. Temperature recordings, however, indicated that the winter hosts only provided shelter for the aphids, when they themselves were in a highly sheltered position, such as a glasshouse or covered frame.

TI  - EVALUATIONS OF GENETIC CONTROL, SELECTION PROCEDURES AND RESPONSES TO SELECTION FOR IMPROVED EMERGENCE OF COMPACT CUCUMBERS
SP  - 137
AB  - The compact plant type in cucumbers is of interest for high-density, mechanically-harvested plantings. Although compact, cpcp, plants generally exhibit very poor emergence, considerable variability for emergence characteristics was evident within a heterogeneous compact population. Reciprocal crosses were utilized to determine that this variation is controlled by broad-sense maternal effects and is not influenced significantly by the genotype of the embryo. Reciprocal differences were not found in the open-pollinated F(,2) generation, indicating that they were not cytoplasmically inherited. The heritability of the maternal influences on emergence percentage was estimated as .26 (+OR-) .12, based upon parent-offspring regression. Numerous seed harvesting aand handling parameters were investigated to determine if they appreciably influenced emergence percentage. The dramatic effects and interactions between fruit maturity, fermentation duration, seed storage time and emergence temperature indicated that failure to carefully control any of these factors could seriously affect the ability to discriminate genetic differences in emergence evaluations. Thirty-five sets of compact and vining F(,4) "isolines" were developed by single-seed descent and evaluated in two environments for a number of characteristics affected by the compact locus. Although all characteristics exhibited continuous variation and most exhibited moderately high heritabilities within each plant type, the correspondence between compact and vining "isogenic" lines was very low for many traits. This indicated that trait performances of vining inbreds would be of little value in selecting desirable genetic backgrounds for the compact genotype. Instead, selection to overcome undesirable effects of the compact locus would be best achieved within populations of cpcp genotypes. Three cycles of mass selection for emergence percentage were conducted between open-pollinated maternal seedlots within a heterogeneous compact population. Selection cycles were evaluated in several seed production and emergence environments. A highly-significant linear response to selection was observed with an average gain of 4.4% emergence/cycle. Although production and emergence environments exhibited large and significant effects, selection response was consistent across all environments. Correlated responses to selection were observed for fruit length/diameter ratio, seed weight, percent "normal" seeds, emergence rate and emergence uniformity.

TI  - AN EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE GENETIC BASIS OF LIFE HISTORY VARIATION IN MESOCYCLOPS EDAX (CRUSTACEA: COPEPODA) (FLORIDA, MICHIGAN)
SP  - 111
AB  - The main intent of this study was to examine the genetic basis of life history variation in populations of the freshwater copepod Mesocyclops edax. Field collections revealed considerable variation in the fitness components body size, clutch size and egg size in populations inhabiting lakes of different seasonalities (Lake Thonotosassa, Florida and Douglas Lake, Michigan). Rearing both populations through two generations under common laboratory conditions revealed whether differences in maturation time, body size and clutch size had a genetic basis, while using a range of environments (15, 25 and 30(DEGREES)C) allowed assessment of genotype-environment interactions. An additional population from each locale was reared at 25(DEGREES)C to assess local variation. Heritability analyses provided estimates of the additive genetic variance present in several life history traits, from which speculations were made regarding the nature and intensity of the selective regimes. In situ culture of the Thonotosassa population provided estimates of means and variances of several traits under near natural conditions, as well as insight into sources of natural mortality. Overall, Thonotosassa individuals matured more rapidly, and exhibited larger body sizes and clutch sizes than did Douglas individuals when reared at the three experimental temperatures. Only body size exhibited a genotype-environment interaction: Thonotosassa females exhibited a proportionately greater decrease in body size from 25 to 30(DEGREES)C relative to Douglas individuals. Some local variation was evident at both locales. Considerable additive genetic variance was revealed in female and male body sizes of the Thonotosassa population, and in female and male maturation times in the Douglas population. Female maturation time and clutch size in the Thonotosassa population, and female body size and clutch size in the Douglas population exhibited, low additive genetic variance. This study documents genetic differentiation among populations with respect to several life history traits. The possible roles of temperature, food level, and predation in molding copepod life histories are discussed.

TI  - GEOGRAPHICAL ADAPTATIONS AND SEASONAL TIME MEASUREMENT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN CORN BORER, DIATRAEA GRANDIOSELLA DYAR (LEPIDOPTERA: PYRALIDAE) (MEXICO, MISSOURI)
SP  - 160
AB  - Geographical adaptations and seasonal time measurement of the southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) obtained from south-central Mexico (ca. 19(DEGREES)N latitude) and southeast Missouri (ca. 37(DEGREES)N latitude) were examined. The mature larval diapause of both populations was programmed by daylength and temperature. The critical daylength for diapause induction was 13 hrs light/day for the Mexican population and 15 hrs light/day for the Missouri population at 20(DEGREES) to 30(DEGREES)C. Diapause induction was a function of the phase relation between thermoperiod (20(DEGREES)/30(DEGREES)C) and photoperiod. A high incidence of diapause of the Missouri population occurred under a thermoperiod and continuous darkness up 16 hrs warm phase per 24 hrs. The diapause response of the Missouri population, observed under symmetrical and asymmetrical skeleton photoperiods, showed that photoperiodic time measurement was very sensitive to temperature. Larvae of the Mexican population displayed a less intense diapause than did those of the Missouri population. Diapause development of larvae of the Mexican and Missouri populations was accelerated at daylengths of > 13 hrs and > 15 hrs, respectively, at 25(DEGREES) and 30(DEGREES)C. The rate of diapause development of the Mexican population was unaffected by chilling at 10(DEGREES)C, whereas that for the Missouri population continued at a low rate at 10(DEGREES)C. Diapausing larvae of the Mexican population showed high mortality below 5(DEGREES)C, whereas those of the Missouri population showed limited coldhardening at 0(DEGREES)C. Under moist conditions at 23(DEGREES)C LD 12 hr:12 hr, diapausing larvae of the Mexican population underwent stationary ecdyses more frequently than did those of the Missouri population. The insect's phenology in Mexico was predicted based on photoperiodic and climatic data. A diapause strain was obtained by selecting D. grandiosella from Mexico for four generations at 25(DEGREES)C LD 12 hr:12 hr. A diapause-free strain of D. grandiosella from Missouri was selected over 12 generations at 30(DEGREES)C LD 14 hr:10 hr. Adults of D. grandiosella from Mexico and Missouri were crossed to examine the genetics of the diapause response.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF A SOUTHERN PINE CONEWORM (DIORYCTRIA AMATELLA)-EGG PARASITOID (TRICHOGRAMMA MINUTUM) PRODUCTION SYSTEM UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS (FLORIDA)
SP  - 325
AB  - The southern pine coneworm, Dioryctria amatella (Hulst), is the most important insect affecting slash pine seed orchards in northern Florida. Biological control using the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma minutum Riley, is considered here. A prototype system to produce the egg parasitoid in eggs of the coneworm is proposed and studied through system analysis. A conceptual model was developed for the production system. Two main subsystems were identified: SPC and Tm for the coneworm and the parasitoid, respectively; then each one was subdivided into age classes. Population processes were identified, described, and then interconnected to obtain the conceptual model. Delay associated with development in each age class was accounted for by a delay network of specified order. These networks are formed by stores and developmental inertia processes, and the order is given by the number of stores and inertias used in the network. Continuous-dynamic mathematical models, in the form of systems of first order differential equations, were derived from the conceptual model using delay networks of various orders (first-, third-, tenth-, and twentieth-order). Parameters of the models were estimated from experiments at different constant temperatures: development times, threshold temperatures, survival, sex ratio, oviposition rates, and parasitism rate. Optimal reproductive parameters occurred at 27(DEGREES)C; therefore, this temperature was selected for operation of the system and collection of data to evaluate the performance of subsystems. The tenth-order delay network gave a close approximation to developmental delay in both subsystems. Operation of the SPC-Tm production system was analyzed through computer simulations. Control of the daily transfer of SPC-eggs and harvest of parasitized eggs was imposed to maintain nearly constant coneworm and parasitoid populations compatible with specified daily harvest of parasitoid eggs. Surplus coneworm eggs were transferred to the Tm-subsystem for reproduction. Harvesting of parasitized eggs was initiated 30 days after initiation of host egg-transfer, and the optimal harvesting level of parasitized eggs was 98.5%. The model developed here is a useful tool for predicting system behavior and analysis of management strategies for the SPC-Tm production system.

TI  - Genetic Variation and Non-Visual Selection in the Land Snail Arianta arbustorum (L.)
SP  - 389
AB  - A general study of non visual selection in Arianta arbustorum has been undertaken. The behavioural responses of the brown and yellow morphs In different habitats in the field were studied using spots of a paint which fades in sunlight. There was shown to be a clear difference between morphs: the paint on the yellow-shelled individuals faded more than that on the brown shelled ones. Some observations have been made on the diurnal activity of these morphs at an open site at Hall Green near Millers Dale, Derbyshire. There is very strong tendency for the yellow morph to be more active than the brown during the afternoon and, this difference may be responsible for the difference in fading between the two morphs. Non-visual selection by a number of selective agents (adaptation temperature, relative humidity, environmental temperature, and the time of acclimatization) is the cause of the behavioural, physiological and ecological differences between the two shell colour morphs A. arbustorum. These were found in a series of laboratory experiments. The details of those differences were determined largely by studying the response of the two morphs to microclimatic conditions by measuring nocturnal activity (N.A) food consumption (F.C), assimilation efficiency (A.E) oxygen consumption (O.C.) and mortality rate (M.R). The species is very responsive to changes in the physical conditions. Change in adaptation temperature resulted in highly significant differences in response in three out of five physiological parameters: N.A, F.C & O.C. There is also a very strong effect of relative humidity in four out of five cases N.A, F.C, A.E and M.R. Environmental temperature has highly significant effects in the two cases studied: O.C. and M.R. Acclimatization to these several microclimatic conditions also showed a general trend in the three cases used: N.A, F.C and A.E. The experiments summarized above were carried out in order that comparisons between the performances of the brown and yellow morphs could be made. The brown morph consumes' a nearly significantly higher amount of food than the yellow morph at cold adaptation temperature, 5°C, whereas the yellow morph shows significantly higher A.E and O.C. than the brown morph at this temperature. The yellow morph also shows a significantly higher O.C. and lower M.R than the brown morph at 14°C. It also shows a nearly significantly higher rate of F.C. and significantly higher O.C. than the brown one at 20°C. The yellow morph is more active at night and shows a higher rate of A.E and O.C. than the brown morph at the high humidity (98% At high temperatures the yellow morph has higher rate of O.C than the brown morph. Similar results were obtained, from M.R. data. The yellow morph shows a significantly lower M.R than the brown one at 29°C. The results are discussed in the light of maintenance of the polymorphism in this species. A biotelemetrlc technique was used to measure differences in temperature of free-living Helix aspersa. It was also used to study the effects sunshine and shade on heat exchange between indviduals with shells painted black or white. A stepwise multiple linear regression computer program was used to interpret the relationship between the weight loss of three species of helicid snails and a set of variables.

AB  - Mature female grasshoppers display a highly specialized oviposition behavior that is based upon both structural and functional adaptations. Using rhythmic movements of the ovipositor appendages they dig holes in the ground, 3X the length of the abdomen, for egg deposition. The functional anatomy of the ovipositor, which is driven by ten pairs of muscles, and the electromyographic activity underlying digging, are described for the grasshopper Schistocerca americana. The ovipositor is controlled by the caudal-most ganglion of the central nervous system. Severing the ventral nerve cord rostral to this ganglion results in ovipositor movements that continue for as long as the animal survives. The electromyographic activity recorded is comparable to that of the intact animal. Furthermore, the rhythmic output is retained when all sensory input is removed by ablation, showing that oviposition digging is driven by a central pattern generator that is located in the terminal abdominal ganglion. Pattern generation for oviposition digging was found to be exclusively interneuronal because its timing could not be reset by current injections into motoneurons. The pattern generator delivers rhythmic depolarizing waves to motoneurons, generating bursts of impulses alternating with silent periods during each cycle of approximately 5 s. duration. There appears to be inhibitory control of the motor pattern by rostral neural centers. Not only is severing the nerve cord always followed by appearance of the patterned bursts but also electrical stimulation of the cut end suppresses it, presumably by mimicking the activity of descending input. Intracellular recording showed that motoneurons are hyperpolarized during electrical stimulation of the nerve cord. A temporary cold block applied to the nerve cord to block conduction was followed by appearance of oviposition activity, reversibly. Severing the nerve cord of larval grasshoppers also elicited patterned bursts of neural activity similar to those of oviposition as recorded from developing ovipositor muscles. No movements were associated with the electrical activity. Likewise, severing the nerve cord of young adults before the onset of sexual maturity was followed by patterned activity resembling oviposition in ovipositor motoneurons. This neural activity failed to produce ovipositor movements. Only at maturity do the ovipositor muscles show mechanical activity.

TI  - THE INHERITANCE OF LATE-BREAKING PARTIAL MALE FERTILITY IN THE INBRED MINN. A632 IN PR CYTOPLASM
SP  - 94
AB  - When backcrossed into C cytoplasm many maize inbreds exhibit a late-breaking partially male fertile phenotype. The inbred Minn. A632 typically exhibits this phenotype. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inheritance of late-breaking partial fertility in A632 in C cytoplasm. A study of the effects of growing temperature on the expression of late-breaking partial fertility was also performed. Lines of A632-Pr were obtained after 15 backcrosses of A632 into Pr cytoplasm. Pr is a member of the C group of cytoplasms. The inheritance of late-breaking fertility was studied in two ways. First, selections were made for fully male sterile lines and highly male sterile lines of A632-Pr. After 8 cycles of selection comparisons were made among selected lines and with their progenitors for degree of fertility. Differences among selected lines were observed. Improvement in the percent of male sterile plants in the population was achieved through selection. 8% of the plants in the original population was fully male sterile while 91% of the selected population was male sterile. Selection for high fertility was not successful. A heritability for fertility vs. sterility of 86% was calculated using parent offspring regression. Second, crosses were made between selected A632 lines and W182BN-Pr, a highly male sterile line, and between male fertile and sterile selections of A632-Pr. Segregation patterns in the F(,1), F(,2), Bc(,1), Bc(,2) populations were observed. It was found that late-breaking partial fertility is polygenically inherited, one of the few known examples of a cytoplasmic trait being modified by nuclear polygenes. It was observed that A632 lines were heterogeneous and heterozygous after 15 generations of backcrossing and selection. The effects of growing temperature on late-breaking fertility were studied using growth chambers; days 29(DEGREES)C, nights 18(DEGREES)C or 10(DEGREES)C. Sterile and fertile selections of A632-Pr were grown under both night temperatures. All plants were more fertile when grown in cooler nights. Thus, late-breaking partial fertility in A632 may be modified either environmentally or genetically.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A CULTURE SYSTEM SUITABLE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF GULF KILLIFISH (FUNDULUS GRANDIS BAIRD AND GIRARD) FOR LIVE BAIT IN THE THERMAL EFFLUENT OF A POWER PLANT
SP  - 155
AB  - Investigations concerning spawning, hatching and grow-out of Fundulus grandis were conducted in 0.1-ha brackish water ponds in Texas. Studies focused on developing economical feeds, increasing production through improved management techniques and evaluation of economic feasibility. Eggs collected on spawning mats were hatched and fry stocked in grow-out ponds when they average .5 g. The bimodal spawning cycle extended from February to October and highest egg production was in late March-early April and late August-early September. In ponds, spawning activity did not increase at lunar syzygy but spawning readiness increased especially among wild fish. Increasing the ratio of females to males among brood fish resulted in increased egg production. Harvested eggs per 0:1-ha pond for 1M:1F (male:female), 1M:2F and 1M:3F sex ratios were 31,648, 36,546 and 41,817, respectively. Egg to fry survival averaged 76%. Embryonic development and larval survival in the laboratory were not affected by salinities from 10-30 ppt. Newly hatched larvae acclimated to 23 C could withstand prolonged exposure to temperatures up to 38 C. Acclimation and test salinities had a significant effect on the response to elevated temperatures. In ponds stockes at 200,000 0.5 g fry/ha, marketable size (3.15 g and 63.7 mm TL) was reached in 70 days when either trout feed, minnow feed or a 1:1 mixture of cottonseed meal and wheat shorts at 5% of body weight daily were fed. Lack of a significant difference in growth (P (LESSTHEQ) 0.05) between fish fed trout feed and the 1:1 mix possibly indicated the importance of natural food in pond production. Survival averaged 85.5% with 1.91 found conversion ratio and 538.8 kg/ha production. Fish obtained from Alabama did not perform as well as Texas fish in egg production, fry survival and growth to a marketable size, indicating either detrimental effects resulting from lower spawning salinities or poor adaptability to local conditions. Economic profit, break-even analysis and net present value were used to evaluate economic feasibility of a commercial operation. Based on a stocking rate of 400,000/ha, 85% survival of stocked fry and two crops per year, substantial returns were predicted for a 24 hectare (60 acre) facility.

TI  - ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF 5-BROMOURACIL-TOLERANT MUTANTS OF E. COLI
SP  - 1
AB  - 5-Bromouracil, an analog of thymine, which occurs only in DNA, has been very successfully used in many studies of thymine metabolism and DNA structure and function. However, previous studies using this compound with prokaryotic strains have been restricted to short periods of growth because the strains used have died after two to three generations of growth in the presence of this compound. The mutants described here are capable of prolonged growth (10 to 20 generations) in the presence of 5-bromouracil, although they still require some thymine for survival. The mutants were isolated on solid media containing thymine and 5-bromouracil. After 5 to 7 days of incubation, the mutants were purified and initially characterized by determining their plating efficiencies on solid medium containing various concentrations of thymine plus 5-bromouracil. Three classes of mutants were identified in this way. The mutants of Class I are only slightly tolerant, and were not studied further. Class II mutants are of intermediate tolerance and Class III mutants are the most tolerant. When the mutants were characterized in liquid media, long periods of growth (10 generations) were required in order to detect differences in response to various concentrations of thymine plus 5-bromouracil. The 5-bromouracil tolerance characteristic does not affect mutability, UV sensitivity, thymineless death, or temperature sensitivity. DNA incorporation studies show that the mutant strains are able to distinguish between thymine and 5-bromouracil, while the parental strain is not; this preference is at least partly mediated by alterations in the K(,m) and V(,max) of thymine and 5-bromouracil transport. Class II mutants contain one genetic marker for 5-bromouracil tolerance, while Class III mutants contain two, one the same as in Class II mutants. Both are insertions, the one that is unique to Class III mutants probably being a tandem duplication of the deo through trpR region of the E. coli genetic map. These strains should prove useful in studies of various facets of thymine and DNA metabolism. It should now be possible to study the long-term effects on metabolism of altered protein-DNA binding in vivo corresponding to previous in vitro studies, and to determine those functions for which 5-bromouracil is not an adequate substitute for thymine in prokaryotes, since prokaryotes seem to require at least a small amount of thymine for survival.

SP  - 208
AB  - During this study, captive and wild-caught spiders, Tegenaria domestica, were tested for their responses to various environmental factors that might affect web-site selection. These included temperature, humidity, air currents, light, vibrations, substrata, electrical and magnetic fields, gravitational cues, and atmospheric pressure. The spiders were subjected to choice trails during which they had an opportunity to build a web funnel under various environmental conditions. Temperature, humidity, air currents, light, substrata, and gravity were found to affect the spiders' web locations. Sexual differences were found for response to sound and spider silk cues. Extensive records were kept on the growth in terms of carapace length, weight, and instar duration on over 400 captive spiders. Additionally, comparisons were made between the growth and size of female and male juveniles and adults. Dates of first cocoon, clutch intervals, numbers of eggs per cocoon, and numbers of cocoons were recorded for adult females. Experiments were conducted on the outcome of encounters between pairs of adults confined in cages with only one web funnel per cage. The data gathered from the choice trials and the life history records will be a foundation for field and laboratory experiments on survival, reproductive success, influence of the environment on growth, and species density correlations with environmental variables.

TI  - PREDICTING BIOLOGICAL EVENTS IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE PECAN NUT CASEBEARER USING A DEGREE DAY MODEL
SP  - 210
AB  - A degree day model for predicting overwintering and 1st summer generation pecan nut casebearer (pnc), Acrobasis nuxvorella Neunzig (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), activity was developed. The starting date and base temperature resulting in the most accurate predictions was determined at College Station, Texas using temperature records from Climatological Data (1918-1923) and field data from Bilsing (1926, 1927) in 1918-1923. Model predictions were compared to the mean calendar date of activity, the model using temperature records from hygrothermographs and the model using a sine curve modification. The model was verified at Shreveport, Louisiana and Brownwood, Texas using pnc black light trap catch data (Calcote, unpublished data). Start dates were observed to vary while base temperature exhibited little variation. An average number of 2.72 frost free days (ffd) were required for a 1 day change in the start day. The model was generalized using ffd and tested on data obtained from the literature. Results of application of the model on a real time basis were determined using start dates based on ffd and linearly interpolated temperature normals when actual daily temperature records were unobtainable. While several clusters had 2 eggs, they were seldom oviposited on the same nut. Oviposition occurred on the tip of the pistil and the calyx lobes only. Insufficient evidence was obtained to reject the null hypothesis that nut entry by the 1st summer generation pnc and physiological drop were independent. Nut entry occurred over ca. 1200 degree days at College Station, Texas in 1980 and 1981. The average number of nuts destroyed/cluster by the 1st summer generation pnc ranged from 1.72-2.55 and the average number of nuts undamaged/cluster ranged from 0.52-3.1. Significant differences in cluster size and nut position in relation to nut infestation were not obtained. The 1st summer generation pnc prefered to enter the proximal end of the nut adjacent to the peduncle. Overwintering generation male pnc moths emerged and were caught prior to females; however there was little difference due to sex. The observed sex ratio for overwintering generation pnc moths approximated a 1:1 ratio (males to females).

TI  - FUNCTION AND ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF ESTERASE 6 ALLOZYMES IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER REPRODUCTION
SP  - 181
AB  - Reproductive functions of the seminal fluid enzyme esterase 6 in Drosophila melanogaster are examined with attention to the adaptive significance of widespread genetic variation at this enzyme's structural locus. Ejaculate esterase 6 aids in sperm use by females, increasing the rate of sperm release from storage organs. Progeny production following single matings does not differ in response to this sperm use effect, due to the high degree of sperm redundancy. However, females remate sooner when receiving esterase 6 from males, causing significantly lower reproductive fitness for these males. This earlier remating is a direct consequence of different levels of sperm storage in the female's ventral receptacle, probably due to a neurally-mediated response by females to sperm motility. Esterase 6 variant males do not differ in sperm competitive abilities when mating with inseminated females, although variants at other loci do have strong effects on sperm competition. D. melanogaster males do not displace sperm when copulating with an inseminated female, suggesting that their fitness is related to direct competitive function of the sperm. Reproduction at low temperature is reduced and altered in form from that at optimal temperature. In this environment, esterase 6 contributes significantly to increased productivity of matings, probably through its action to increase sperm motility. In an experiment designed to test for effects of the single locus variants on quantitative traits in relation to background genetic variation, the common fast and slow allozymic forms of esterase 6 significantly affected mating speeds. In this experiment, the esterase 6 enzyme activity did not differ for fast and slow allozymes, although additive and sex-linked variation at other loci did affect esterase 6 production. Gene frequencies for esterase 6 and alcohol dehydrogenase were differently selected by temperatures in caged populations, constant with predictions from the studies of low temperature reproduction for esterase 6 and with other evidence for alcohol dehydrogenase. As well, significant sex differences and Hardy-Weinberg deviations were also found for esterase 6, but not alcohol hydrogenase, gene frequencies. These results together suggest that maintenance of esterase 6 polymorphisms in natural populations of Drosophila are due to a complex form of sexual selection.

TI  - VARIATIONS IN THE LIFE HISTORY STRATEGY OF DAPHNIA PULEX ALONG A LATITUDINAL GRADIENT
SP  - 73
AB  - Observations of life history strategies of populations of a species along a latitudinal gradient allows comparisons of organisms with similar morphological, physiological, and genetic constraints but adapted to different environments. Four predictive models for life history characteristics of the cladoceran Daphnia pulex along a latitudinal gradient were tested. These models were based on temperature physiology, the size-selectivity of predation, and deterministic and stochastic life history theory. Two clones of cladocerans were isolated from animals collected at Frobisher Bay (63(DEGREES)48'N), Churchill (58(DEGREES)40'N), and Windsor (42(DEGREES)19'N), Canada, and at Lincoln, Nebraska (40(DEGREES)49'N). After acclimation newborn individuals were isolated and reared in environmental chambers which simulated arctic (24:0 LD, 14(DEGREES)C) or temperate (14:10 LD, 18(DEGREES)C) conditions of photoperiod and temperature. Each pair of clones was found to have a unique suite of life history characteristics. The arctic clones took longer to mature and had few, small broods of large offspring; the temperate clones took less time to mature and had many broods of small offspring. Arctic clones appeared to be sensitive to the difference in photoperiod in the two simulations, producing only resting eggs in the temperate simulation. The particular suite of traits remained the same in both environments for all sets of clones which suggests that there is a genetic component to the life history strategy of Daphnia. The stochastic model was least accurate in predicting the life history characteristics observed. The other models predict similar traits so that the observed suite of traits could be the result of interactions between many factors including temperature physiology, the effects of size-selective predation, and density dependent/independent mortality factors (the deterministic model).

TI  - THE EFFECT OF THE FREQUENCY OF A SPECIES IN COMPETITION ON THE EVOLUTION OF INTERSPECIES COMPETITIVE ABILITY: AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST WITH DROSOPHILA WILLISTONI AND D. PSEUDOOBSCURA
SP  - 79
AB  - In this study two separate experiments on competition between laboratory populations of Drosophila willistoni and D. pseudoobscura were designed to: (i)determine the temperature range over which the two species would coexist in mixed-species culture and (ii)test the predictions of a hypothesis on the evolution of interspecies competitive ability proposed by Pimentel, Feinberg, Wood and Hayes (1965). The first experiment was a preliminary experiment which determined the temperature conditions to be used in the latter experiment. In the preliminary experiment it was found that at the highest temperature tested (25(DEGREES)C) the tropical species, D. willistoni, competitively excludes the temperate zone species, D. pseudoobscura. At the lowest temperature (18(DEGREES)C) the converse is observed, and at several intermediate temperatures (19-22(DEGREES)C) the two species coexist. The second experiment was designed to test the hypothesis proposed by Pimental et al. (1965) which predicts that natural selection will increase the interspecific competitive ability of a species which occurs at a low frequency in competition. The hypothesis also predicts that selection generally will not improve the interspecific competitive ability of a competitor which is maintained at a high frequency. The authors proposed that such evolutionary changes in competitive ability would promote the coexistence of interspecific competitors. In order to test this hypothesis Drosophila willistoni adults were maintained at fixed frequencies of 20, 50 and 80 percent in competition with D. pseudoobscura. These selection conditions were maintained for 84 weeks (approximately 30 generations). In these cultures genetic changes in competitive ability could occur within the willistoni populations in response to competition with pseudoobscura. Control cultures in which willistoni was maintained at a fixed density in single-species culture were also kept over the 84-week period of selection. At the end of the selection period tests were completed to measure genetic changes in the interspecies competitive ability of each of the willistoni selection lines. In these tests the survivorship of the adults and the total number of progeny produced over a five-week period was measured for each willistoni line when placed in mixed-species culture with pseudoobscura. The results of the tests show that evolution has proceeded in the opposite direction of that predicted by the hypothesis of Pimental et. al. Those selection lines which were maintained at frequencies of 50 and 20 percent willistoni have evolved a lower competitive ability than the 80 percent lines. The competitive ability of the control cultures is also higher than the 50 and 20 percent lines. It is proposed that interspecific competition with pseudoobscura may have been relatively unimportant in determining the observed evolutionary changes. Selection may have acted to reduce the deleterious effects of intraspecific competition between genotypes within the willistoni populations maintained at the highest levels of crowding. The results of past studies which have examined the evolution of interspecies competitive ability in laboratory populations of insects are discussed. These past results and those of the present study indicate that it is unlikely that the evolutionary increase of the competitive ability of a rare competitor would be a consistent mechanism for promoting the coexistence of interspecific competitors.

TI  - THE ROLE OF TRANSOVARIAL TRANSMISSION IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS IN CALIFORNIA
SP  - 137
AB  - Female Aedes melanimon from California infected either parenterally or orally transmitted California encephalitis (CE) virus transovarially. Transmission rates for females collected in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys were similar, 20 and 18%, respectively, and transmission was equal to progeny of both sexes. Vertical transmission was relatively inefficient when females were infected orally with a low viral dose, and more efficient with large viral doses. Rates were indistinguishable when females were infected orally with a high viral dose or by intrathoracic inoculation. Vertical transmission rates ranged from 9 to 29% in Aedes dorsalis inoculated with CE viral strains isolated from Ae. melanimon collected in California. The month or year of viral isolation had no effect on the efficiency of vertical transmission. However, a viral strain isolated from Inyo County was less efficiently transmitted than strains from the Sacramento Valley, and strains from the San Joaquin Valley were intermediate in efficiency. In one experiment, a temperature sensitive mutant of CE virus was transmitted vertically to adult progeny when they were reared at 18C, but not when reared at 27C. Larvae were infected at both temperatures. In later experiments, there tended to be a reverse effect, with higher infection rates in adults reared at higher temperatures. Aedes melanimon eggs retained infectious virus for at least 8 months, even when repeatedly frozen and thawed. Infection rates were similar in eggs hatched 3 weeks or 8 months after oviposition. Embryos survived best when eggs were stored at 4C, however, storage temperature had no effect on infection rates in surviving embryos. Infection with CE virus did not affect survival of embryos, larvae, or adults, but infected larvae pupated later than uninfected larvae. All infected females, from whom 10 or more progeny were examined, transmitted virus transovarially. Three subpopulations of Ae. dorsalis developed vertical transmission rates over 90%. Infected progeny in these subpopulations transmitted virus at similar rates through 5 generations. Female Ae. dorsalis transovarially infected through 5 consecutive generations transmitted virus by bite. California group viruses are probably mosquito viruses maintained in nature in subpopulations of the vector with highly efficient veritcal transmission. Transovarially infected females infect vertebrates by bite, and there may be little need for an amplification of the vector viral prevalence by a mosquito-vertebrate cycle.

TI  - DIALLEL ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE TO SELECTION FOR LOW TEMPERATURE SPROUTING ABILITY IN TOMATO POPULATIONS
SP  - 63
AB  - Parental, F(,1), and F(,2) families of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) derived from a 6 x 6 diallel were evaluated for low temperature sprouting ability in laboratory and field environments to determine the mode of inheritance of low temperature sprouting ability, to assess the reliability of laboratory tests in predicting field emergence, and to characterize the response to selection. The diallel analysis of variation among parental and F(,1) or F(,2) families indicated that differences attributable to additive, dominance, maternal, and residual effects were fairly consistent over laboratory and field experiments. Additive effects were the most important source of variation in both laboratory and field experiments, accounting for 46% to 85% of the total variation among families. Dominance effects specific to parents or hybrid families were significant in all laboratory experiments but accounted for less than 12% of the total variation among families. Maternal effects were the second largest source of variation among F(,1) families (28%) and among F(,2) families in the field experiments (8% and 18%), but accounted for less than 3% of the family variation in the F(,2) laboratory experiments. Pearson product-moment correlations between F(,2) laboratory experiments (0.84, 0.87, and 0.94) were higher than between field experiments (0.56). Laboratory and field correlations were also higher than between field experiments. The lowest correlations were observed between F(,1) and F(,2) experiments. Response to selection in field and laboratory environments for low temperature sprouting ability in parental and F(,2) families was evaluated. Treatment sum of squares due to variation among parental and F(,3) progeny selections was partitioned into average effects, and into linear and quadratic responses to selection. Average variation due to parents was significant in laboratory and field selections, but linear and quadratic responses were not, indicating no response to selection among the parents. Means of parents and F(,3) progeny were not significantly different from each other in either field or laboratory selections. Average linear and quadratic effects in field and laboratory F(,3) progeny selections were significant. General (GCA) and specific (SCA) effects were significant for average sprouting time of F(,3) progeny selections in both field and laboratory. GCA effects in laboratory and SCA effects in laboratory and field selections for linear response were also significant. Response to selection was generally greater in crosses between cold (CT) and non-cold type (NCT) sprouting parents, but exceptions to this trend were observed in some NCT x NCT progeny. Results of this research indicate that low temperature sprouting ability is polygenic, primarily additive, and determined by recessive genes; initial selections for ability to sprout at low temperature may be made more efficiently in laboratory evaluations in controlled environment chambers, but final selections should be conducted in the field over several planting dates; F(,3) progeny selections showed significant linear and quadratic responses to selection, and maximum response was generally observed in F(,3) progeny derived from crosses between CT and NCT parents.

TI  - THE CONTROL AND IMPACT OF LYGUS LINEOLARIS (P. DE B.) ON FIRST-YEAR PEACH SCION STOCK IN MISSOURI
SP  - 156
AB  - Insecticide trials were conducted with systemic insecticides to control tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris (P. de B.)) damage on first-year peach scion stock at Stark Bro's Orchards and Nurseries in Louisiana, Missouri. Metasystox('(REGTM))-R 2E, Cygon('(REGTM)) 2E Furadan('(REGTM)) 4F, Temik('(REGTM)) 10-G, and Vydate('(REGTM)) L were tested. The 1979 data showed that one soil-incorporated application of aldicarb at the lowest recommended rate, 560 g a.i./linear km, significantly reduced damage to apical meristems for ten weeks. The other compounds were applied as foliar sprays and were ineffective. Bioassay tests with Lygus lineolaris and the convergent ladybeetle, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, demonstrated that soil applications of aldicarb resulted in the translocation of some aldicarb and/or its metabolites into the exudate of peach leaf nectaries. Mortality of H. convergens was lower with the higher aldicarb rates, suggesting a feeding inhibition response. Chemical analyses of the exudate revealed the presence of seven carbohydrates, 18 amino acids and seven fatty acids. Previous researchers' work on the development of Lygus lineolaris at different temperature regimes was analyzed to determine base developmental thresholds for the egg and all numphal stadia. Centigrade degree days (CDD) were calculated using a sine wave accumulation method with a 10(DEGREES)C base temperature. Using published laboratory results, the CDD between generations, in the laboratory tests, ranged from 532 to 709 CDD at constant temperatures. Analyses of sweep net data accumulated during the three year study showed that the CDD between peaks of the late (fourth + fifth nymphal stadia) instars of the second and third generations in 1977 and 1978 Louisiana, Missouri, ranged from 512 to 724 CDD. Analysis of population frequency polygons and degree day data indicated three generations per year with a partial fourth generation. Analysis of weekly damage ratings showed plant bug damage was severest from mid-June to mid-July with slight variations. Damage coincided with the peak abundance date of the first generation adults and continued until the appearance of the early second generation adults. In terms of CDD, significant damage ((LESSTHEQ) 10% of meristems stunted) during the three years, began at 185 to 247 CDD after the first generation of late instars reached peak abundance.

TI  - BIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON CULEX PIPIENS L. AND CULEX RESTUANS THEO. (DIPTERA, CULICIDAE) IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO
SP  - 1
AB  - Culex pipiens and C. restuans had three generations per year in southern Ontario. Eggs for the first generation of each species were laid from mid-May to early June, the second generation from early June to mid-July and the third generation from mid-July to early August. The third generation of C. pipiens and the second of C. restuans were usually the largest. Oviposition by each species was greatest within two hours of sunset with a secondary peak at sunrise. No oviposition occurred between four hours after sunrise and sunset. Decanoic acid was not an effective ovipositional attractant for these species. Overwintered females of C. pipiens and C. restuans produced ca. 185 eggs per blood meal. This was significantly lower than that of the summer generations (C. pipiens ca. 315, C. restuans ca. 220). This may have been due to a change in physiology associated with winter survival. Egg production per blood meal by each species declined in late summer possibly due to an ageing of the reproductively active portion of the populations or development of larvae under high densities. Temperature during ovarian development did not affect the number of eggs produced per blood meal. However, the development of larvae of C. pipiens under crowded conditions did reduce egg production. Ovarian development by C. pipiens was correlated positively with air temperature. The rate of embryonic development of each species was similar and was correlated positively with temperature. The rate of development of larvae plus pupae of each species was also correlated positively with temperature but correlated negatively with larval density. Water temperature was more important than larval density in determining the developmental rate of C. pipiens. However, the opposite was true with C. restuans. Survival of larvae and pupae of each species depended on larval density and not water temperature. Survival of each species was similar; however, the development rate of C. restuans was slower than that of C. pipiens when raised at high densities. Diapausing C. pipiens and C. restuans had ratios of follicle:germarium length of less than 2.0:1.0. Culex pipiens began to enter diapause in early July with more than 90 per cent in diapause by mid-August. Onset of diapause in C. restuans was also in early July with greater than 80 per cent in diapause by late July. The induction of diapause was an important factor influencing the number of generations per year and the size of the third generation in each species. The incidence of diapause in C. pipiens was increased when larvae were raised at low water temperatures or high larval densities. Diapausing female C. pipiens entered overwintering sites in Guelph from mid-September to mid-October. Greater than 95 per cent mortality occurred in most sites. Ovarioles of diapausing females did not develop from the diapause to the nondiapause state by the end of overwintering. Surviving females left their overwintering sites at approximately the time of the soil temperature inversion. Based on biological and epidemiological factors the most efficient control procedure to reduce the possibility of an outbreak of Saint Louis encephalitis is larval control from late May through July.

TI  - BIONOMICS OF ATAENIUS SPRETULUS (COLEOPTERA: SCARABAEIDAE) ON SOUTHERN OHIO GOLF COURSES
SP  - 178
AB  - The black turfgrass ataenius, Ataenius spretulus (Haldeman) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is an important pest of golf course greens, tees, and fairways in Hamilton and Clermont Counties, Ohio. Eggs average 0.75 x 0.52 mm and are deposited in clusters of 11-12 in the thatch and thatch-soil interface. Head capsule widths of larvae average 0.5 mm for first instars, 0.83 mm for second instars, and 1.3 mm for third instars. Mature larvae are ca. 8.5 mm long and possess teges of 40-45 hamate setae on their rasters. The root-feeding larvae have caused wilt or death of host turf-grasses, Poa annua L., Agrostis species and Poa pratensis L. Pupae average 4.7 x 2.5 mm and occupy cells excavated 1-8 cm deep in the soil. There are two generations per year in southern Ohio. Oviposition periods began in May and July. First generation adults emerged in late June-early July; second generation emergence occurred in August. The sex ratio in samples was ca. 1:1, but favored females slightly. The dispersion pattern of infestations in sampling sites best conformed to a highly contagious or logarithmic distribution for all age classes. Second generation adults overwintered after copulating (89.7% of females inseminated), exhibiting a survival rate of 93 (+OR-) 3%. Winter is passed beneath duff and in soil at the tree line of wooded areas in and surrounding golf courses. Males and females survived winter with equal success. Population density of overwintering beetles reached 264/929 cm('2). A day degree system of predicting A. spretulus activity and development in the field was based on a flight activity threshold of 13(DEGREES)C. Seasonal life history of the insect was also correlated to plant phenology. Oviposition of first generation eggs occurred after 100-150 day degrees when Spiraea vanhouttei (Briot) Zabel and Aesculus hippacastanum L. reached full bloom and Robinia pseudoacacia L. began to blossom. Appearance of second generation eggs occurred after 650-710 day degrees when Hibiscus syriacus L. began to blossom. Generation periods of 60-70 days were observed in the field, where soil temperatures approached or exceeded 30(DEGREES)C. The time from adult eclosion to oviposition was ca. 20 days. Laboratory-reared A. spretulus required ca. 53 days to develop (oviposition to adult eclosion) at 23 (+OR-) 2(DEGREES)C and 68 (+OR-) 12% R.H. The time from adult eclosion to oviposition was ca. 20 days. Survivorship of reared insects averaged 17%. Incidence of milky disease at sampling sites ranged from < 1% in May and June to 29% in October.

TI  - ENRICHMENT FOR TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE MUTANTS IN TETRAHYMENA THERMOPHILA
SP  - 1
AB  - Two techniques for the enrichment of ts mutants in Tetrahymena thermophila have been developed. These are the first ts mutants enrichments to be characterized in Tetrahymena. Enrichment was obtained by treatment with BUdR and black light (BL). Parameters were determined for the preferential killing by BL irradiation of cells that had incorporated BUdR. As BL alone was found to be toxic to cells irradiated in growth medium, the cells were washed into a non-nutrient buffer prior to irradiation. Mutants defective in division at a restrictive temperature were isolated both from mutagenized cultures that had undergone BUdR/BL treatment and from mutagenized cultures that had no such treatment. The number of ts mutants that stopped division within several cell generations was increased five to six times after BUdR/BL treatment; those that stopped within one cell generation after the temperature shift were enriched even more. A mutant that immediately stopped macromolecular synthesis and cell division upon being placed at the restrictive temperature was approximately 1000-fold more resistant to BUdR/BL treatment than wild-type. A technique was developed for quickly screening a large number of ts mutants for those that stopped DNA replication but not RNA (or protein) synthesis. All ts mutants isolated that stopped DNA replication at the restrictive temperature also stopped RNA and protein synthesis. The second enrichment for ts mutants was that obtained by 8-hydroxy-quinoline (Hq) treatment. The effects of the chelating agent Hq on wild-type and mutant T. thermophila were examined in the hope that certain types of ts mutants show increased resistance to this drug. In wild-type, cell division, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis were completely and nonselectively inhibited by 5 (mu)g/ml Hq. This inhibition was reversible after 6 h of Hq treatment. At concentrations above 20 (mu)g/ml, a 10,000-fold decrease in survival was seen after 2 h in the drug. Mutants that were unable to divide at the restrictive temperature but which continued macromolecular synthesis were found to be resistant to Hq treatment. Under certain conditions more than a 1000-fold difference in survival was seen between this class of mutant and the wild-type strain. The effect of Hq on three other classes of ts mutants was also examined. Five strains (tdr-1 through tdr-5) defective in the phosphorylation of TdR and BUdR were independently isolated after they survived BUdR/BL treatment or toxic amounts of BUdR alone. All alleles code for unconditionally defective gene products except the tdr-3 which codes for a ts function unable to phosphorylate TdR or BUdR at 38(DEGREES) but able to phosphorylate these compounds at 29(DEGREES). The effects of FUdR and methotrexate on Tetrahymena were examined. A low concentration of FUdR coordinately inhibited all macromolecular synthesis. A mutant (tdr-1) unable to phosphorylate TdR and, presumably, FUdR was more resistant than wild-type to FUdR and FU when grown in defined medium with Urd as the sole pyrimidine but not when grown in a complex medium containing TdR. A mutant (fur-1) was isolated that was resistant to FU and FudR in the complex medium but not in defined medium. These and other results imply two modes of inhibition by FU and FUdR in Tetrahymena The effects of MTX on cell division under different conditions are discussed. No preferential inhibition of RNA, DNA or protein synthesis was observed in wild-type or tdr strains when MTX was added to cells growing in a complex medium. Two mutants resistant to MTX have been isolated (mex-1, mex-2).

TI  - LIFE SYSTEM OF STEGASTA BOSQUEELLA (CHAMBERS) ON PEANUTS IN OKLAHOMA
SP  - 86
AB  - Scope of Study. The rednecked peanutworm, Stegasta bosqueella (Chambers) is the most common lepidopterous insect pest on peanuts, Arachis hypogaea L. in Oklahoma. It can cause considerable defoliation and stunting of plants when population densities are high. The purpose of this investigation was to develop life tables in order to follow the development of this insect in the field and determine the impact of larval feeding on peanuts. Eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults were reared in the laboratory at constant temperatures to establish developmental thresholds and thermal requirements for development. Field sampling for larvae, pupae, and adults was conducted in order to construct life tables of this insect. Artificial and actual rednecked peanutworm damage was inflicted on field grown peanuts to ascertain the plant response to foliar damage. Findings and Conclusions. Eggs, larvae, and pupae had developmental thresholds of 11.7(DEGREES)C, 11.0(DEGREES)C, and 12.2(DEGREES)C, respectively. The mean C(DEGREES) day accumulations required for completion of life stages were: 66.5 - egg, 156.0 - larva (to prepupa), 25.1 - prepupa, and 94.2 - pupa. None of the life stages completed development at 12.8 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C. There were no significant differences (P = 0.05) between the degree day accumulations required for completion of life stages at 18.3 (+OR-) 1, 23.9 (+OR-) 1, and 29.4 (+OR-) 1(DEGREES)C. The total generation time for S. bosqueella was calculated to be approximately 440(DEGREES)C days. Life table studies of S. bosqueella indicated that 3 generations a year occur in Oklahoma. Larval numbers were very great at times (over 3 million/hectare) and typically reached maximum numbers in the second generation. Twelve parasitic species were recovered from this host, the most numerous being Orgilus modicus Mues., Chelonus (Microchelonus) sp., and Invreia spp. Disappearance was the major cause of S. bosqueella mortality and appeared to be a combination of biological and climatic factors. Peanut plant response to foliar damage varied with the type of damage inflicted. Although simulated rednecked peanutworm damage appeared very similar to actual damage caused by larval feeding, the plant response was not the same. Artificially damaged plants produced significantly fewer (P = 0.05) pegs, nuts, and terminals and reduced weight of leaves than plants damaged by larval feeding. However, peanutworm damaged plants produced significantly shorter stems as compared to artificially damaged or undamaged plants. Peanut leaflets demonstrate the ability to compensate for damage as they enlarge from terminals. Damage to very small leaflets (area < 150 mm('2)) results in much more compensation than the same extent of damage to larger leaflets (150 - 450 mm('2)). Feeding of S. bosqueella through the larval stage results in a mean reduction in mature leaf area of 3993 mm('2) (ca. 4 leaflets)/individual. The potential for economic damage to peanuts from foliar feeding of the rednecked peanutworm appears to be minimal except for the period of time when plants are 50 - 90 days of age.

TI  - DEMOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES FOR SMALL HUMAN POPULATIONS: AN EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL COMMUNITIES FROM EARLY CONNECTICUT, 1633-1849
SP  - 222
AB  - The potential of demographic research within the field of anthropology is just beginning to be realized. The application of classical demographic models will further anthropological understanding of evolutionary change at the population level. The main emphasis of this dissertation was to examine the applicability of several demographic methods to the study of small human populations. Four diversified settlements of early Connecticut were chosen as research areas. This pre-1850 analysis focused on the towns of Windsor, Litchfield, Mansfield, and New London. The research strategy also observed the relationship between historical and biological change in a community. Population size, density, and change were shown to be useful demographic measures. New London registered the highest growth rate, largest population density, and lowest dependency ratio. Fertility trends were measured through both vital and census records. Vital records yielded birth totals that were fairly accurate before 1820, and very underregistered after then. Crude and refined rates based on vital data were inaccurate due to underregistration. Fertility rates based on census records were very useful, and showed that fertility had declined during the first half of the nineteenth century. Early Connecticut's peak birth season was February to April, and consistent for the four towns. The adverse effect of summer heat on infants and the agriculturalist's yearly work cycle seem related to this pattern. Marriage results were also drawn from vital records. Registration was very poor prior to 1821, but due to new registration laws, fairly accurate after then. Litchfield had the most marriages, and coupled with its low fertility, had the smallest mean family sizes. Marriage age was found to be consistent between the four towns, but somewhat higher for the male population. Marriage distances were similar for the towns, especially considering the differences in outside contact. Marriages were highest in October through December, probably resulting from harvest and Christian holiday celebrations. Mortality data were derived from both vital records and gravestones. Gravestones were found to be the most reliable indicator of past mortality, especially in the very young populations. August through September was the highest period of mortality, probably relating to the influence of gastrointestinal illnesses killing proportionately more people during these months. Several indices were used to measure the biological conditions of the four towns. Reproductive potential and biological state were lowest in New London. Mansfield had the lowest depletion of potential fertility. Selection intensity was highest in New London, and lowest in Windsor and Litchfield. An inverse relationship was noted for the indices of biological state and selection intensity. Index of life expectancy results showed New London had gained the greatest mean lifetime of the towns from 1750-1799 to 1800-1849. It was suggested that New London's earlier discrepancies in infant mortality had been overcome, and thus the existing life expectancy differences had decreased. The decline in autumnal diseases, due to improved living conditions, was a major force in the mortality decline. The use of indices that measure biological change in a population was felt to be very helpful to the consideration of cause and effect relationships in human biology. The future of anthropological demography rests upon the continued use and refinement of the techniques of classical demography and population genetics. Only through the continued applications of these methods will come a better understanding of the mechanism of human biological change.

TI  - Structural and spectroscopic studies of lysozyme
SP  - 1
AB  - The characterisation of productive enzyme-substrate complexes stabilised by sub-zero enzymologic methods in the crystalline state is considered for application of electron spin resonance (ESR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) methods. To this end model compounds are investigated as substrate analogues of lysozyme by x-ray diffraction and magnetic resonance methods. Aromatic-linked mixed disaccharides corresponding in chemical structure to Î²(aryl)-4-0-(2-deoxy-2-acetamido- D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucopyranoside are synthesised as substrate analogues of lysozyme to serve as phosphorescent triplet state spectroscopic probes. The stereochemistry and molecular structure of Î²(1-naphthyl)-D-glucopyranoside- 2',3',4',6'-tetra-0-acetate is determined by application of direct methods of structure determination and crystallographic least-squares refinement. The detailed molecular structure of this carbohydrate derivative is compared to that of other glucopyranosides, and the compatibility of the incorporation of the molecular structure of the naphthyl-glucopyranoside moiety only into aromatic-linked mixed disaccharide compounds for purposes of a triplet state spectroscopic probe of lysozyme action is tested by molecular model building studies. ESR and optical detection of magnetic resonance techniques are employed to evaluate the electronic structure of the phosphorescent substrate analogue of lysozyme. incorporation of the structural unit of the Î²(1-naphthyl)-D-glucopyranoside chromophore into a variety of hydrophobic and hydroxylic environments causes readily detectable alterations in the zero-field splitting parameters of the phosphorescent triplet state of the naphthyl group. The zero-field splitting parameters and transitions of the naphthyl-glucopyranoside in these environments are readily distinguishable from those of the expected hydrolysis product Î±-naphthol. These results indicate that the triplet state properties of phosphorescent aromatic groups are sufficiently sensitive to environmental influences and can be employed as direct spectroscopic probes of enzyme action when suitably incorporated into synthetic substrate analogues. The spin-label inhibitor of lysozyme Î²(2,2,6,6- tetramethyl-4-piperidinol-1-N-oxyl)-D-(2-deoxy-2-acetamido-glucopyranoside) is also synthesised as a spectroscopic probe of the active site. ESR and x-ray diffraction studies of single crystals of tetragonal hen egg white lysozyme show that the spin-label is bound in the enzyme crystal. The principal axis corresponding to the gzz-direction is identified by ESR. Application of ENDOR to this orientation results in three types of ENDOR lines arising from interaction of the nitroxide group with nearby hydrogen nuclei. This interaction is analysed in terms of an anisotropic dipole-dipole mechanism. interpretation of the ENDOR spectrum suggests that (i) a protein residue is within 3.7 Ã… of the nitroxide nucleus along the molecular z-axis of the nitroxide group and (ii) the nitroxide group is substantially exposed to the solvent channel or surface of the enzyme. The three-dimensional structure of the spin-label complex is determined by difference Fourier methods. The spin-label binds anomalously across subsites C and B of the lysozyme molecule in a configuration apparently stabilised by binding of the acetamido group in the specificity site in subsite C and by hydrophobic interactions between the methyl groups of the spin-label and Tryp-62 of the enzyme. The structural features of the complex determined by diffraction methods confirm the interpretation of the ENDOR spectrum. Furthermore, the ENDOR results indicate that specific proton sites can be detected in the active site regions of crystalline enzymes as a sensitive means to dilineate stereochemical configurations and structural binding relationships. Since an enzymatically active form of crystalline lysozyme is prerequisite to further spectroscopic and structural study, the catalytic activity of crystalline human lysozyme is assessed. With use of a p-nitrophenyl-linked mixed disaccharide derivative, human lysozyme in orthorhombic crystals is demonstrated to be enzymatically active only when the crystals are equilibrated with a mixed cosolvent medium containing 2-methyl-pentan-2,4-diol. These solvent conditions have negligible effects on the crystal structure and are suitable for preserving the crystal structure at cryogenic temperatures at which ESR and ENDOR techniques must be generally applied. To evaluate conditions appropriate for assaying the enzymatic activity of crystalline enzymes, the catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes is analysed mathematically as a function of the diffusion of substrate into crystals and of the kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction in solution. Relationships are derived to demonstrate that crystal dimensions control the influence of diffusion in measuring the catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes and that the critical dimension for onset of rate-limiting diffusion can be predicted on the basis of measurable kinetic parameters of the enzyme reaction in solution and the invariant diffusion coefficient of the substrate. The catalytic efficiency of crystalline enzymes reported hitherto in the literature is analysed on the basis of these mathematical relationships. Except for the case of papain, it is concluded that the results of all other studies are reported for conditions of rate-limiting diffusion of substrate and are consequently inconclusive in comparing the catalytic activity of the enzyme in crystalline and solution states. In addition, the appropriate chemical conditions are determined for generation and stabilisation of oxymyoglobin in single crystals with use of ferrous D(+)-tartrate in alkaline ammonium sulphate solutions under conditions suitable for high resolution x-ray structural studies.

TI  - The Biology and Population Dynamics of Phyllonorycter oxycanthae (Frey) (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) on Hawthorn
SP  - 234
AB  - The biology and population dynamics of the Gracillariid moth Phylloalacter oxvacanthae (Frey) were studied on a small hedgerow of hawthorn (Crataequs mongyna Jacq.) at Bollington, Cheshire. All the leaf mining species on the study hedge were identified, some aspects of their biology studied and their times of appearance recorded. Phyllonorycter oxyacanthae is bivoltine with a facultative diapause about in winter. In spring, the adults start to emerge about the second week of May. Summer adults start to emerge about the first week of July. In both generations, emergence occurs over a period of two to three weeks. Mating appears to provide the main stimulus for oviposition. Nourishment is not essential for oviposition to commence and it does not seem to improve fecundity or increase the life span of a female significantly. The females start to oviposit about two to three days after emergence. Eggs are laid singly on the undersurfaces of hawthorn leaves, a few millimetres away from a main vein. The larvae are led miners feeding on liquid nutriment in the spongy mesophyll tissue in the first three stages and on the palisade tissue in the next two stages. The first instar mine commences as a flat, linear sub-epidermal track which develops into a blotch mine (stigmatonome) when the larvae begin to feed radially. The third instar larva like the two preceding instar larvae has a dorsoventrally flattened body and forwardly directed mouth parts, which are adaptations for living in e flat mine. At the third moult the larva undergoes a remarkable morphological change accompanied by changes in feeding habits and a change in the form of the mine. The fourth instar larva has a cylindrical body, downwardly directed mouth parts, feeds on palisade tissue and converts the blotch mine into a tent mine (ptychonome). The fifth instar larva resembles the fourth. Pupation takes place within the mine which is lined with silk, partly by the fourth instar larva but mainly by the fifth. Frame particles are pushed to a corner of the mine and sealed off from the future pupal chamber with silk by the fifth instar larva just prior to pupation. When the adult is ready to emerge, the pupa "pecks" a hole in the mine floor using its pointed, heavily sclerotized frons and anchoring itself with the cremastral hooks, pushes itself halfway out of the mine. A split occurs on the vertex along the epicranial suture and it forks and continues backwards laterally upto the end of the mesothorax. The imago emerges leaving the pupal case protruding through the hole in the mine floor. The first generation adults emerge from pupae that have overwintered in mines in the leaf litter. The second generation adults emerge in the mid summer from mines in leaves still attached to the bushes. Parasitism and "host predatism" by parasitic Hymenoptera were the main causes of mortality in the immature stages of the first generation. Two species of chalcid wasps of the family Eulophidae, Enaxama atoms (Walker) and Syrapiesisseliceicornis (Nees), were the major parasites of the three generations studied. Other parasites recorded were Pniealio Realinicornis Cirros ilus vittatus (Walker), Ehusocharis laomedon (Walker), Chrysocharis neohereus (Walker) (all Eulophidae), Diadegma nana (Gravenhoita) (Ichneumonidae) andpaanIfles circumperintus (Nees) (Braconidae). Forficula auricularia (C) (Dermaptera) was identified as a predator of the late instars of P. oxyacanthae; it was present on the bushes in spring and summer and also in the leaf litter in winter. Parasites also cause heavy mortality in the second generation. In the winter of 1973, mortality factors operating in the leaf litter took a heavy toll of pupae which had escaped parasitism and predation on the bushes. The centipede Lithobius duboscqui Brolemann was identified as a predator of pupae of P. oxyacanthae and its parasite Enaysma atys, in the litter. It seems likely that some overwintering pupae of P. oxyacanthae fail to enter diapause and are killed by sub-zero temperatures. The population size of the two spring generations studied was much smaller than that of the summer generation. The adult moths appear to be weak fliers and no migratory tendencies were observed during the period of study. Only short flights about the hedge were seen, but it is possible that the moths are dispersed more widely in windy conditions.

AB  - Populations of the lime aphid, Eucallipterus tiliae. L. were monitored weekly on five lime trees in Glasgow in 1970 and 1971 and the weight of alate virginoparae present on the trees and their reproductive rate recorded. Results for the same trees in I969 are also included. In addition, traps were erected in 1971 to catch aphids falling from three of the trees and flying from one of them. The amount of movement of aphids between leaves on all five trees was recorded daily in 1971. Populations were also studied on six saplings, caged individually in an insectary such that no immigration could take place from a population and all emigration could be measured. These populations were monitored and alate virginoparae weighed weekly. The caged populations mimicked the field populations, thus the results from the caged populations together with results from laboratory experiments were used to determine the causes of changes in numbers of the lime aphid in the field, and the importance of intra-specific mechanisms in the regulation of these populations. Fluctuations in aphid numbers are the result of changes in the balance of losses from, and income into the populations. Analysis showed that alate loss by flight from a population, contributed most to the total 'mortality' the amount and direction of change in alate loss and total mortality being similar. Alate flight was density dependent and was mainly a response to the density present at the time of flight and was the result of mutual interaction due to intra-specific competition for space and possibly food. The number of nymphs that fell off the trees was however proportional to density. The income into a population is determined by the number of alate virginoparae left on a tree after the density dependent flight response, and also on the reproductive rate of those that are left. The reproductive rate and the length of the pre-reproductive delay of an alate virginoparae ace determined mainly by its weight, which is dependent on the density of aphids present during its development and during the development of previous generations. Reproduction also increased with temperature, but this effect was minor when compared with the effect of weight in determining the number of nymphs produced. The effect of density on weight is the result of intra-specific competition for food which appears to create a nutrient drain and thus a reduction in the amount of food available per individual, and also intra-specific competition for space which leads to a reduction in the time spent feeding. The density experienced during their development also appears to affect the weight of adult oviparae and through this the number of eggs they produce. Once small aphids have been produced as the result of high densities, it would take several generations under favourable conditions for aphids to regain a large size. In years when the number of fundatrices is high, populations attain an early high peak and then decline rapidly only recovering later if predators are absent (as in the caged populations). When few fundatrices are present, the populations remain low only attaining a small peak late in the season. Markedly fewer eggs per fundatrix are produced in a year when the number of fundatrices is high than when they are low, thus few fundatrices are present in a year following one in which many fundatrices were present. This is an overcompensated density dependent response which,after a disturbance,would result in the population fluctuating with decreasing amplitude from year to year. The overcompensated response is the result of the effect of intraspecific competition on the weight, and thus the reproduction of alate virginoparae and the egg production of oviparae, and also on the percentage of alates that leave the population. The presence of predators can result in an even more overcompensated response since they further reduce the production of oviparae in years when the number of fundatrices is high. Regulation of populations of E.tiliae thus appears to be mainly effected through intra-specific mechanisms.

TI  - The biology of capitella capitata (fabricius) and a review of the genus capitella blainville
SP  - 1
AB  - The thesis is concerned with the biology of Capitella capitata in British waters and the validity of the genus Capitella throughout the world. Material from Europe, America and Australia has been examined and an extensive review of the literature on the taxonomy of Capitella has been made. As a result the generic description has been modified to include the genus Capitellides. The description of C. capitata has been widened to account for variations between populations and the subspecies C. capitata ovincola and C. capitata tripartita have been elevated to specific level. An ecological study of some British populations has been made and it is shown that while C. capitata will occur under a wide range of conditions, it is predominant where other polychaetes are less common. The life history has been investigated and it has been shown to reproduce in Britain throughout the year. Two larval types have been found. The effects of various ecological factors have been studied in the laboratory. Both adults and larvae were found to be resistant to conditions of low salinity and, especially, low oxygen tension. The species is, however, very sensitive to increases in temperature. The feeding biology has been studied and an estimate of the available organic content in the substrate made. The relationship of the species to polluted conditions is discussed. In conclusion it is noted that C. capitata owes its worldwide distribution to its adaptability allowing it to penetrate a variety of habitats. This same lack of specialisation, however, makes it unsuccessful as a competitor with species more narrowly adapted to particular sets of environmental conditions.

TI  - The energetics of colpidium campylum stokes with a note on the vertical distribution of ciliophera in the mud of loch leven, kinross
SP  - 1
AB  - The energetics of, the holotrich ciliate Colpidium campylum fed on the bacterium Moraxella sp. at 10°C, 15°C and 20°C were investigated. The parameter used for ascertaining growth. was the volume of protoplasm produced measured by means of a Coulter Counter with a mean cell volume converter attachment. Growth and consumption were measured in relation to food availability as indicated by the ratio of bacteria: protozoan. Mean cell volume variation and reproduction were also measured in relation to food availability and energy consumed. Protozoan and bacterial material were harvested by centrifugation and freeze-dried for dried weight determinations and calorimetry studies. The energy content of Colpidium and its food source was determined with a Phillipson microbomb calorimeter. Respiration was measured in a Warburg respirometer. Oxygen uptake in relation to population density and cell size was considered as well as the production of information concerning the heat lost during respiration for incorporation into energy budgets. Energy budgets of. two types were constructed: a 24-hour energy budget for an individual and the life-span or generation energy budget for an individual. Gross growth efficiencies, net growth efficiencies and assimilation efficiencies were considered in detail. In addition to laboratory work the vertical distribution of Ciliophora in the mud of Loch Leven, Kinross, Scotland, was also considered; three sites, two shallow and one deep, being sampled with a core sampler over a 12 month period.

TI  - Some aspects of the effect of temperature on the respiratory and cardiac activities of the Cichlid Teleost Tilapia mossambica
SP  - 204
AB  - The importance of the cichlid teleost Tilapia mossambica as a protein source, coupled with its remarkable adaptability, has resulted in its introduction into many water systems throughout the tropical, sub-tropical and even temperate regions of the world. However, its successful exploitation of these waters is dependent very largely upon the value of minimum temperatures and their duration. For e.g. Long et al (1961) has drawn attention to the tremendous mortalities of T. mossambica that occur in shallow water bodies during the precipitous temperature decreases that accompany the winter monsoons in Vietnam and other eastern countries, even at temperatures as high as 14 or 16°C. Coehe (1967) does not recommend stocking with T. mossambica where temperatures are not above 14°C all the time. Ailanson et al (1962) conclude, after an experimental study, that low temperatures (13°C or lower) in South African highveld dams in winter are certainly an important factor in the extensive mortalities of T. mossambica that have been reported from these dams. Jubb (1961) also reports that this species is often killed during a severe winter in Rhodesia.

TI  - The effects of temperature on certain life stages of Simuliidae (Diptera)
SP  - 190
AB  - The present study considers, on a systematic basis, the relationship between the development and altitudinal distribution Prosimulium hirtipes (Fries) larvae and the thermal sums to which the larvae are exposed during their developmental period. It will be shown that development of these larvae is very closely related to the thermal sum and that the completion of development occurs at a later date at the higher altitudes. The altitudinal distribution of P. hirtipes larvae in the stream is compared with those of the larvae of other black-fly species present in the stream during the period of study and an attempt is made to give an explanation for their different altitudinal distributions. An attempt has also been made to explain the absence of P. hirtipes from the stream during the period of higher water temperatures during the Summer months, while other species of larvae are present at the same altitudes, and are able to complete Summer generations. The study has, for convenience, been divided into two sections, Section 1 dealing with the field studies, and with the larval temperature-mortality experiments,and Section 2 describes laboratory experiments investigating the relationship between air temperature and the activity of the adult flies of Simulium ornatum Meig. This study was carried out from Summer 1956 to Summer 1957.

TI  - The Life-History of the Potato Tuber Moth Gnorimoschema operculell (Zeller) and Its Control in Storage
SP  - 80
AB  - The life history of the potato tuber moth Gnorimoschema operculella (Zell.) and its chemical control in storage have been studied in the present investigation. The period required for the development of one generation was found to vary inversely with temperature. In winter the period was found to vary between fifty and fifty-nine days, while in summer it varied between twenty-four and thirty-three days. The optimum temperature for reproduction and egglaying was found to be about 28 to 29°c. Under the prevailing weather conditions in Lebanon there is a possibility of having more than 7 to 8 generations a year. For the control of the moth in storage three contact insecticides, DDT, Sevin and Lindane, have been used as water dilutions at two concentrations each, in which the empty b~gs of potatoes were impregnated. The treatments have been replicated three times. The three insecticides showed equal effectiveness in fully controlling all the moths, which resulted in 100 per cent protection of stored tubers.

TI  - Biology of wheat -stem maggot Meromyza americana Fitch in relation to the preference for different cereals especially wheat varieties in Kansas
SP  - 74
AB  - The wheat-stem maggot Meromyza americana Fitch (Dipt. - Chloropidae) is a well known and widely distributed insect pest in North America injuring wheat, barley, rye and a great range of grasses. In several oviposition tests is the greenhouse it could be proved that preference during oviposition was involved. The soft wheat variety Harvest Queen was repeatedly the least preferred variety, whereas the hard wheat varieties Ponca, Pawnee and Comanche were attractive and Red Chief and Cheyenne took an intermediate position. Balbo rye was not very attractive. The two barley varieties Reno and Dictoo carried only a few eggs. On the oat varieties Cherokee, Kanota and Mo.0–250 no oviposition could be observed at all. The range of preference in the wheat varieties mentioned above was changed when the flats were exposed to different light sources involving the colors yellow, red and blue. No evidence of adverse effects on the developing larvae could be demonstrated in the wheat varieties involved in the tests. In a date-variety-test in the greenhouse it was demonstrated that oviposition is also influenced by the growth stage of the host plants, since in three out of six varieties the more advanced plants got twice as many eggs as the later plants. It is suggested that the range of wavelength of the light reflected from the host plant and the stage of growth may act separately, or together, or in turn, probably with additional unknown factors to cause preference during oviposition. The presence of inflated femora in the adults of M. americana would suggest a great leaping ability similar to that known in flea beetles. However, leaping only occurs over distances of a few millimeters. In flies, the wings of which were cut off, leaving does not occur. The swollen femora together with the curved tibiae were demonstrated to provide an efficient mechanism for cleaning and stretching the wings. The flight is strongly limited to temperatures above 13°C. The possibility of rearing M. americana in the greenhouse continuously over several generations is positively discussed. Attention is focused upon the question whether M. americana might transmit western wheat streak mosaic, since abundance of adults in early sown wheat and its activity, as for instance the feeding on honey-dew of aphids and on guttation water, makes it highly suspicious in this regard.
