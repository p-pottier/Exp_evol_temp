TI  - The genetic basis of thermal reaction norm evolution in lab and natural phage populations
VL  - 4

AB  - Two major goals of laboratory evolution experiments are to integrate from genotype to phenotype to fitness, and to understand the genetic basis of adaptation in natural populations. Here we demonstrate that both goals are possible by re-examining the outcome of a previous laboratory evolution experiment in which the bacteriophage G4 was adapted to high temperatures. We quantified the evolutionary changes in the thermal reaction norms - the curves that describe the effect of temperature on the growth rate of the phages - and decomposed the changes into modes of biological interest. Our analysis indicated that changes in optimal temperature accounted for almost half of the evolutionary changes in thermal reaction norm shape, and made the largest contribution toward adaptation at high temperatures. Genome sequencing allowed us to associate reaction norm shape changes with particular nucleotide mutations, and several of the identified mutations were found to be polymorphic in natural populations. Growth rate measures of natural phage that differed at a site that contributed substantially to adaptation in the lab indicated that this mutation also underlies thermal reaction norm shape variation in nature. In combination, our results suggest that laboratory evolution experiments may successfully predict the genetic bases of evolutionary responses to temperature in nature. The implications of this work for viral evolution arise from the fact that shifts in the thermal optimum are characterized by tradeoffs in performance between high and low temperatures. Optimum shifts, if characteristic of viral adaptation to novel temperatures, would ensure the success of vaccine development strategies that adapt viruses to low temperatures in an attempt to reduce virulence at higher (body) temperatures. © 2006 Knies et al.

AB  - Rising temperatures associated with global warming present a challenge to the fate of many aquatic organisms. Although rapid evolutionary response to temperature-mediated selection may allow local persistence of populations under global warming, and therefore is a key aspect of evolutionary biology, solid proof of its occurrence is rare. In this study, we tested for genetic adaptation to an increase in temperature in the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone species in freshwater systems, by performing a thermal selection experiment under laboratory conditions followed by the quantification of microevolutionary responses to temperature for both life-history traits as well as for intraspecific competitive strength. After three months of selection, we found a microevolutionary response to temperature in performance, but only in one of two culling regimes, highlighting the importance of population dynamics in driving microevolutionary change within populations. Furthermore, there was an evolutionary increase in thermal plasticity in performance. The results of the competition experiment were in agreement with predictions based on performance as quantified in the life table experiment and illustrate that microevolution within a short time frame has the ability to influence the outcome of intraspecific competition. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Temperature affects everything that an organism does. Although we have an increasingly sophisticated understanding of evolutionary adaptation to temperature at the molecular level for some cellular processes, we still know little about evolutionary temperature adaptation in gene expression, cell-cycle control or growth, all of which influence organism performance and fitness. Recent studies have shown that the physiological costs of evolutionary temperature adaptation vary with body temperature. Here, I argue that this macroecological pattern has powerful consequences for life-history theory, and probably also for food-web dynamics, biological diversity and biotic response to climate change. The relationships among evolution, temperature and ecology are multivariate, hierarchical and complex making evolutionary physiology at the macroecological scale an exciting and challenging agenda for the next decade.

TI  - Experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster: Interaction of temperature and food quality selection regimes
VL  - 57
IS  - 8
SP  - 1829-1836
AB  - In Drosophila, both the phenotypic and evolutionary effect of temperature on adult size involves alterations to larval resource processing and affects other life-history traits, that is, development time but most notably, larval survival. Therefore, thermal evolution of adult body size might not be independent of simultaneous adaptation of larval traits to resource availability. Using experimental evolution lines adapted to high and low temperatures at different levels of food, we show that selection pressures interact in shaping larval resource processing. Evolution on poor food invariably leads to lower resource acquisition suggesting a cost to feeding behavior. However, following low temperature selection, lower resource acquisition led to a higher adult body size, probably by more efficient allocation to growth. In contrast, following high temperature selection, low resource acquisition benefited larval survival, possibly by reducing feeding-associated costs. We show that evolved differences to larval resource processing provide a possible proximate mechanism to variation in a suite of correlated life-history traits during adaptation to different climates. The implication for natural populations is that in nature, thermal evolution drives populations to opposite ends of an adult size versus larval survival trade-off by altering resource processing, if resource availability is limited.

VL  - 13

AB  - Although several studies suggest the occurrence of microevolutionary responses that may allow local persistence of populations under global warming, rigorous experimental proof is lacking. Here, we combined the realism and rigid, replicated experimental design of a large-scale mesocosm study where populations of the zooplankter Simocephalus vetulus were exposed for 1 year to different global warming scenarios with a life table experiment under laboratory conditions at three temperatures that eliminated confounding, nongenetic factors. Our results provide solid proof for a rapid microevolutionary response to global warming in both survival and the subcomponents of individual performance (age at reproduction and number of offspring), which may allow populations of S. vetulus to persist locally under predicted scenarios of global warming. Such microevolutionary responses may buffer changes in community structure under global warming and help explain the outcome of previous mesocosm studies finding only marginal effects of global warming at the community level. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 82

SP  - 45-76
AB  - A series of laboratory selection experiments on Drosophila melanogaster over the past two decades has provided insights into the specifics of life-history tradeoffs in the species and greatly refined our understanding of how ecology and genetics interact in life-history evolution. Much of what has been learnt from these studies about the subtlety of the microevolutionary process also has significant implications for experimental design and inference in organismal biology beyond life-history evolution, as well as for studies of evolution in the wild. Here we review work on the ecology and evolution of life-histories in laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, emphasizing how environmental effects on life-history-related traits can influence evolutionary change. We discuss life-history tradeoffs -many unexpected - revealed by selection experiments, and also highlight recent work that underscores the importance to life-history evolution of cross-generation and cross-life-stage effects and interactions, sexual antagonism and sexual dimorphism, population dynamics, and the possible role of biological clocks in timing life-history events. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of typical selection experiments, and how these limitations might be transcended in the future by a combination of more elaborate and realistic selection experiments, developmental evolutionary biology, and the emerging discipline of phenomics.

VL  - 57
IS  - 4
SP  - 932-936
AB  - We examined the evolutionary response of wing area (a trait highly correlated with other measures of body size) to relative humidity (RH), temperature, and their interaction in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines that had been allowed to evolve at low or high humidity at 18degreesC or at 25degreesC. We found that after 20 weeks of selection (5-10 generations), low RH lines had significantly greater wing areas than high RH lines in both sexes. This evolutionary response may have resulted from selection of larger flies with a smaller surface area for water loss relative to their weight, or as a correlated response to selection on some other unidentified trait. There were no evolutionary effects of temperature on wing area or cell density. This may have been due to the short duration of the selection experiment, and/or counteracting selection pressures on body size at warm temperature.

AB  - Three replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were cultured at each of two temperatures (16.5 degrees C and 25 degrees C) in population cages for 4 yr. The lifespans of both sexes and the fecundity and fertility of the females were then measured at both experimental temperatures. The characters showed evidence of adaptation; flies of both sexes from each selection regime showed higher longevity, and females showed higher fecundity and fertility, than flies from the other selection regime when they were tested at the experimental temperature at which they had evolved. Calculation of intrinsic rates of increase under different assumptions about the rate of population increase showed that the difference between the lines from the two selection regimes became less the higher the rate of population increase, because the lines were more similar in early adulthood than they were later. Despite the increased adaptation of the low-temperature lines to the low temperature, like the high temperature lines they produced progeny at a higher rate at the higher temperature. The lines may have independently evolved adaptations to their respective thermal regimes during the experiment, or there may have been a trade-off between adaptation to the two temperatures, or mutation pressure may have lowered adaptation to the temperature that the flies no longer encountered.

AB  - Laboratory selection experiments play a prominent role in understanding organismal adaptation. Although bacteria are not yet commonly used for such experiments, they are well suited for analyses of both the organismic and the genetic basis of adaptation. Bacteria can be maintained in large populations while occupying limited laboratory space, have short generation times, are well characterized physiologically, biochemically, and genetically, and are readily frozen and revived from the freezer. In addition, the genomes of many species are completely sequenced and knowledge of gene function is unparalleled. Here we review general aspects of selection experiments, the history of using selection experiments in combination with thermal biology and genomics, and highlight findings from six lines of Escherichia coli adapted to high temperature (41.5 degrees C), including changes in organismal fitness, physiological performance, gene complement and gene expression. Our results are an example of the powerful insights that can be discovered by combining the tools and analyses of many biological disciplines including genomics, evolutionary biology, genetics, and evolutionary physiology.

AB  - We measured metabolic rates of adult male Drosophila melanogaster allowed to evolve in the laboratory at 18 and 25 degrees C and compared these with measurements of metabolic rates of flies collected along a latitudinal gradient in Australia. Metabolic rates of flies that had evolved in the laboratory at low temperature were 5-7% higher than those of flies allowed to evolve at high temperature. Metabolic rates of field collected increased with latitude when measured at 18 degrees C but not at higher temperature (25 degrees C) and were about 9% greater in high latitude (similar to 41'00) flies than low latitude (16'53) flies. Metabolic rate was strongly influenced by measurement temperature; estimated Q(10)s ranged from 1.79 to 2.5 for measurements made at 18 and 25 degrees C. Metabolic rate scaled isometrically with body mass; the estimated slope of a In-in regression of metabolic rate and body mass was 1.03 +/- 0.1. We used our measures of metabolic rate and activity to estimate the minimum cost of transport (MCOT) while walking. The estimates of MCOT have high standard errors (lab, 34.30 +/- 14.2 mi O(2)/g/km; and field, 38.0 +/- 17.0 mi O(2)/g/km); however, they differ by only 3-9% from predicted values based on allometric relationships reported in the literature.

AB  - Measurements of shoulder height, body length, hind-foot length, and total body mass were collected from 309 Hokkaido sika deer (Cervus nippon? yesoensis Heude, 1884) (115 males and 194 females) and analyzed statistically for sexual dimorphism and seasonal body mass fluctuations. The von Bertalanffy equation was fitted to the growth curves that resulted. Asymptotic shoulder height, body length, and hind-foot length were 106.2, 112.6, and 57.9 cm in males and 94.8, 103.9, and 49.4 cm in females, respectively. Total body mass showed distinct seasonal fluctuations, ranging between 102.8 and 151.0 kg in adult males and 68.0 and 99.8 kg in adult females. Male/female ratios in shoulder height, body length, hind-foot length, and total mass were 1.12, 1.08, 1.07, and 1.51, respectively. These results indicate that the Hokkaido sika deer is one of the largest subspecies, at least in skeleton size. A larger body and longer hind foot would seem to be evolutionary adaptations to Hokkaido's cold, snowy environment.

VL  - 130

AB  - Body mass is undoubtedly central to the overall adaptive profile of any organism. Despite this, very little is known of what forces drive evolutionary changes in body mass and, consequently, shape patterns of body mass distribution exhibited by animal radiations. The search for factors that may influence evolutionary processes in general frequently focuses on environmental parameters such as climate change or interspecific competition. With respect to body mass, there is also the suggestion that evolutionary lineages may follow an inherent trend toward increased body mass, known as Cope's rule. The present paper investigates whether overall directional trends of body mass change, or correlations between patterns of body mass evolution and environmental factors have influenced the evolution of body mass in plesiadapiforms and primates. Analyses of the global fossil record of plesiadapiforms and primates suggest that the former did indeed follow an overall trend toward increased body mass compatible with the predictions of Cope's rule. In contrast, neither primates as a whole, nor a number of individual primate radiations (Adapiformes, Omomyiformes, and Anthropoidea), show any indication of overall directional patterns of body mass change. No correlations of primate body mass change with either the latitudinal distribution of fossil species, or with estimates of global temperature trends, were found. There is evidence, however, that direct competition between omomyiforms and adapiforms (the two main primate radiations known from the Paleogene) influenced processes of body mass evolution in omomyiforms. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Here we report the evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity and diapause initiation between field and laboratory populations that were separated for more than 35 yr (&gt;240 laboratory generations) and that are descendants from the same field populations in central North Carolina. At intermediate rearing temperatures (20°-25°C), mean body size was significantly larger and development time significantly faster in the laboratory than in the field populations. At higher temperatures (30°-35°C), these mean differences between populations were reduced or eliminated, and larval survival at 35°C was significantly lower in the laboratory population than in the field population. F1 crosses had survival and development time to wandering similar to the field population times at both 25° and 35°C; body mass at wandering for F 1 crosses was intermediate compared with that of the field and laboratory populations. Comparisons with earlier field and laboratory studies suggest evolutionary reductions in thermal tolerance and performance at high temperatures in the laboratory population. The critical photoperiod initiating diapause in field populations in North Carolina did not change detectably between the 1960s and 2005. In contrast, the laboratory population has evolved a reduced tendency to diapause under short-day conditions, relative to the field population. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

SP  - 155-164
AB  - The level of HSP70 expression induced by a non-lethal high temperature was examined in lines selected for increased thermal resistance and in corresponding control lines of Drosophila buzzatii, in order to test if selection for high temperature resistance leads to an increased level of HSP70 expression. The lines used were selected for up to 64 generations either as adults or through all larval stages. In adult selection lines, hard selection was implemented every second generation after mild heat hardening. In larval selection lines, larvae were exposed each generation to laboratory "natural" selection. Generally lines selected as adults showed a higher HSP70 expression than did controls, both in third instar larvae and in adults. A strong negative response to selection of HSP70 expression was found in all lines that were selected at cycling temperatures during larval development. The: results suggests that a trade off between heat resistance in form of HSP70 expression and fecundity/fertility lire responsible For the level of HSP70 expression. The effect of the different methods of selection on HSP70 expression suggests that heat resistance constitutes more than one trait.

VL  - 80
IS  - 6
SP  - 847-851
AB  - We have carried out two equivalent selection experiments to increase and decrease heat shock resistance of Drosophila subobscura adults, using an indirect selection method that avoids excessive consanguinity. Heat shock was 33±0.5 °C at saturation humidity. Control lines showed a rapid change of the physiological trait as a consequence of laboratory culture conditions, expressed as a decrease both in heat shock resistance and in the initial population variability for heat shock resistance. Thus, this reduction of variability seems to consist in the loss of those combinations of genes that confer high resistance to heat shock. After eight generations of selection, the selected lines were differentiated from their respective control lines, and the selection response obtained was similar in "resistant" and "sensitive" lines. Differences in survival of progeny of reciprocal crosses between selected lines suggest that inheritance of heat resistance may depend in part on the origin of egg cytoplasm. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 8

AB  - The duration of Drosophila melanogaster larval and pupal periods was measured in laboratory thermal lines and in populations collected along a latitudinal transect in eastern Australia. In replicated laboratory lines kept for 9 years at 16.5° C or 25° C the duration of larval development had continued to diverge compared with 4 and 5 years previously, with more rapid larval development, and hence reduced total duration of pre‐adult development, in the low temperature lines at both experimental temperatures. After 4 years of separate evolution, lines derived from the 25° C lines and subsequently cultured at 29° C showed no evidence of significant divergence in the duration of any part of the pre‐adult period. The geographic populations showed a decrease in the duration of larval development, and hence of the total pre‐adult period, with increasing latitude. In both laboratory and field populations, evolution at lower temperature was associated with more rapid larval development to a larger adult body size, the opposite genetic correlation between these traits to that found within a single temperature. The indications are that lower temperatures may be permissive of more efficient growth in D. melanogaster. It will be important to discover if evolution in response to temperature induces similar correlations in other ectotherms. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - 1. Little evolutionary change may occur at species borders since the cost of accommodating environmental stresses is high. Extreme examples of such stasis include cave animals in stable stressed environments and 'living fossils' in widely fluctuating stressed environments. 2. Variability from the molecular to the organismic level tends to be high under extreme stress. At the developmental level, the fitness of such variants may be low. This means that much developmental variability in natural populations may have little evolutionary significance. 3. Rapid evolutionary change of morphological traits is most likely to be based upon genes acting late in a developmental pathway under conditions which are ecologically and energetically permissive. 4. Although some increases in resistance to temperature extremes have been recorded in laboratory selection experiments, major extensions of extremes in natural populations appear difficult to achieve. The energetic costs of surviving extremes at species borders implies that the evolution of major developmental and morphological shifts is more likely to be a feature of populations of more equable habitats. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - We measured the egg size of six geographic populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from Florida (30 degreesN) to Ontario (49 degreesN). Populations from northern latitudes produced larger eggs than populations from southern latitudes. Egg size increased with increasing latitude more rapidly when larvae were reared under low rather than high density. One southern (30 degreesN) and one northern (49 degreesN) population of W. smithii that persisted through 10 generations of selection for increased persistence under conditions of chronic thermal- and nutrient-limiting stress (conditions similar to southern rather than northern habitats) produced smaller eggs more rapidly than unselected control lines. However, there were no differences in lifetime fecundity or fertility between control and selected lines. Thus, laboratory evolution in an environment representative of extreme southern latitudes caused evolutionary changes consistent with geographic patterns of egg size. These results implicate temperature as a selective factor influencing the geographic variation of egg size in W. smithii, and demonstrate a novel trade-off in reproductive allocation between egg size and egg maturation time.

TI  - Thermal adaptation in Drosophila serrata under conditions linked to its southern border: Unexpected patterns from laboratory selection suggest limited evolutionary potential
VL  - 82
IS  - 3
SP  - 179-189
AB  - To investigate the ability of Drosophila serrata to adapt to thermal conditions over winter at the species southern border, replicate lines from three source locations were held as discrete generations over three years at either 19degreesC (40 generations) or temperatures fluctuating between 7degreesC and 18degreesC (20 generations). Populations in the fluctuating environment were maintained either with an adult 0degreesC cold shock or without a shock. These conditions were expected to result in temperature-specific directional selection for increased viability and productivity under both temperature regimes, and reduced development time under the fluctuating-temperature regime. Selection responses of all lines were tested under both temperature regimes after controlling for carry-over effects by rearing lines in these environments for two generations. When tested in the 19degreesC environment, lines evolving at 19degreesC showed a faster development time and a lower productivity relative to the other lines, while cold shock reduced development time and productivity of all lines. When tested in the fluctuating environment, productivity of the 7-18degreesC lines selected with a cold shock was relatively lower than that of lines selected without a shock, but this pattern was not observed in the other populations. Viability and body size as measured by wing length were not altered by selection or cold shock, although there were consistent effects of source population on wing length. These results provide little evidence for temperature-specific adaptation in D. serrata-although the lines had diverged for some traits, these changes were not consistent with a priori predictions. In particular, there was no evidence for life-history changes reflecting adaptation to winter conditions at the southern border. The potential for D. serrata to adapt to winter conditions may therefore be limited.

AB  - TEMPERATURE is an important environmental factor affecting all organisms1,2, and there is ample evidence from comparative physiology that species1,3 and even conspecific populations4,5 can adapt genetically to different temperature regimes. But the effect of these adaptations on fitness and the rapidity of their evolution is unknown, as is the extent to which they depend on pre-existing genetic variation rather than new mutations. We have begun a study of the evolutionary adaptation of Escherichia coli to different temperature regimes, taking advantage of the large population sizes and short generation times in experiments on this bacterial species6-10. We report significant improvement in temperature-specific fitness of lines maintained at 42 °C for 200 generations (about one month). These changes in fitness are due to selection on de novo mutations and show that some biological systems can evolve rapidly in response to changes in environmental factors such as temperature. © 1990 Nature Publishing Group.

AB  - Polyphenisms are evolved adaptations in which a genome produces discrete alternative phenotypes in different environments. In this study, the genetic basis of the evolution of a polyphenism by genetic accommodation was investigated. A polyphenic strain and a monophenic strain of Manduca sexta (L.) were crossed and the F1 offspring and backcross progeny were analysed. The larval colour polyphenism was found to be regulated by one sex-linked gene of major effect and many smaller effect modifier genes. The finding shows that the mechanism of genetic accommodation relies on genetic changes that are consistent with the current view of the genetic basis of adaptive evolution. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 164

SP  - E115-E129
AB  - Heritable phenotypic traits under significant and consistent directional selection often fail to show the expected evolutionary response. A potential explanation for this contradiction is that because environmental conditions change constantly, environmental change can mask an evolutionary response to selection. We combined an "animal model" analysis with 36 years of data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major) to explore selection on and evolution of a morphological trait: body mass at fledging. We found significant heritability of this trait, but despite consistent positive directional selection on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component of body mass, the population mean phenotypic value declined rather than increased over time. However, the mean breeding value for body mass at fledging increased over time, presumably in response to selection. We show that the divergence between the response to selection observed at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by a change in environmental conditions over time, that is, related both to increased spring temperature before breeding and elevated population density. Our results support the suggestion that measuring phenotypes may not always give a reliable impression of evolutionary trajectories and that understanding patterns of phenotypic evolution in nature requires an understanding of how the environment has itself changed.

TI  - Life-history consequences of adaptation to larval nutritional stress in drosophila
VL  - 63
IS  - 9
SP  - 2389-2401
AB  - Many animal species face periods of chronic nutritional stress during which the individuals must continue to develop, grow, and/or reproduce despite low quantity or quality of food. Here, we use experimental evolution to study adaptation to such chronic nutritional stress in six replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for the ability to survive and develop within a limited time on a very poor larval food. In unselected control populations, this poor food resulted in 20% lower egg-to-adult viability, 70% longer egg-to-adult development, and 50% lower adult body weight (compared to the standard food on which the flies were normally maintained). The evolutionary changes associated with adaptation to the poor food were assayed by comparing the selected and control lines in a common environment for different traits after 29-64 generations of selection. The selected populations evolved improved egg-to-adult viability and faster development on poor food. Even though the adult dry weight of selected flies when raised on the poor food was lower than that of controls, their average larval growth rate was higher. No differences in proportional pupal lipid content were observed. When raised on the standard food, the selected flies showed the same egg-to-adult viability and the same resistance to larval heat and cold shock as the controls and a slightly shorter developmental time. However, despite only 4% shorter development time, the adults of selected populations raised on the standard food were 13% smaller and showed 20% lower early-life fecundity than the controls, with no differences in life span. The selected flies also turned out less tolerant to adult malnutrition. Thus, fruit flies have the genetic potential to adapt to poor larval food, with no detectable loss of larval performance on the standard food. However, adaptation to larval nutritional stress is associated with trade-offs with adult fitness components, including adult tolerance to nutritional stress. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Here, we report a detailed analysis of changes in gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster selected for ecologically relevant environmental stress resistance traits. We analysed females from seven replicated selection regimes and one control regime using whole genome gene expression arrays. When compared with gene expression profiles of control lines, we were able to detect consistent selection responses at the transcript level in each specific selection regime and also found a group of differentially expressed genes that were changed among all selected lines. Replicated selection lines showed similar changes in gene expression (compared with controls) and thus showed that 10 generations of artificial selection give a clear signal with respect to the resulting gene expression profile. The changes in gene expression in lines selected for increased longevity, desiccation and starvation resistance, respectively, showed high similarities. Cold resistance-selected lines showed little differentiation from controls. Different methods of heat selection (heat survival, heat knock down and constant 30°C) showed little similarity verifying that different mechanisms are involved in high temperature adaptation. For most individual selection regimes, and in the comparison of all selected lines and controls, the gene expression changes were exclusively in one direction, although the different selection regimes varied in the direction of response. The responses to selection restricted to individual selection regimes can be interpreted as stress specific, whereas the response shared among all selected lines can be considered as a general stress response. Here, we identified genes belonging to both types of responses to selection for stress resistance. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Evidence of independent climatic selection for desiccation and starvation tolerance in Indian tropical populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 2
IS  - 5
SP  - 685-699
AB  - On the Indian subcontinent, geographical populations (8.0 degrees to 33.0 degrees) of Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate opposite latitudinal dines for desiccation (r = 0.83) and starvation (r = -0.88). Desiccation tolerance is significantly and positively correlated with body size and abdominal pigmentation, whereas starvation is negatively correlated with body size and life-history characteristics. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance show a substantial direct effect of body size for both traits. For the Indian geographical populations, both latitudinal and altitudinal variations can explain the observed divergence of these two traits of ecological significance. Regression analysis of climatic variables (i.e. T-max, T-min and T-average), which are not significantly correlated with latitude, are positively and significantly associated with starvation and can explain trait variability (R-2 = 0.78-0.88). In contrast, T-CV (R-2 = 0.65), rainfall and precipitation (R-2 = 0.32) are significantly but positively associated with desiccation tolerance. The observed negative correlation between climatically selected starvation and desiccation in Indian geographical populations is not in line with the correlated selection response of these traits on the basis of laboratory selection experiments. For south Indian tropical populations, higher starvation tolerance might be selected because of temperature variables (T-max, T-min and T-average), higher metabolic stress in relation to smaller body size, greater competition and involve a trade-off for life-history traits. In contrast, significantly higher desiccation tolerance in subtropical (northern) populations might be selected because of T-CV, rainfall and precipitation, which reflect seasonal variations. Desiccation and starvation tolerance are independent traits that reveal rapid evolutionary trends in tropical and subtropical climates.

AB  - Objective: To test for an effect of isomorphy on development rate under different experimental thermal environments. Methods: In three different thermal environments, we studied the following characters as response variables during development: metabolic rate, body mass, and body length. We used as our study model the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare during the first 14 weeks of development. Conclusions: Our results suggest that although metabolic rate and body mass may depend on the internal state of individuals, body length may present an isomorphic response. This would be evidence that a non-adaptive interpretation could explain developmental patterns and thus highlight the importance of avoiding the frequent use of unsupported adaptive explanations in evolutionary ecology. © 2009 Francisco Bozinovic.

VL  - 51
IS  - 1
SP  - 36-44
AB  - Acclimation refers to reversible, nongenetic changes in phenotype that are induced by specific environmental conditions. Acclimation is generally assumed to improve function in the environment that induces it (the beneficial acclimation hypothesis). In this study, we experimentally tested this assumption by measuring relative fitness of the bacterium Escherichia coli acclimated to different thermal environments. The beneficial acclimation hypothesis predicts that bacteria acclimated to the temperature of competition should have greater fitness than do bacteria acclimated to any other temperature. The benefit predicted by the hypothesis was found in only seven of 12 comparisons; in the other comparisons, either no statistically demonstrable benefit was observed or a detrimental effect of acclimation was demonstrated. For example, in a lineage evolutionarily adapted to 37 degrees C, bacteria acclimated to 37 degrees C have a higher fitness at 32 degrees C than do bacteria acclimated to 32 degrees C, a result exactly contrary to prediction; acclimation to 27 degrees C or 40 degrees C prior to competition at those temperatures confers no benefit over 37 degrees C acclimated forms. Consequently, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis must be rejected as a general prediction of the inevitable result of phenotypic adjustments associated with new environments. However, the hypothesis is supported in many instances when the acclimation and competition temperatures coincide with the historical temperature at which the bacterial populations have evolved. For example, when the evolutionary temperature of the population was 37 degrees C, bacteria acclimated to 37 degrees C had superior fitness at 37 degrees C to those acclimated to 32 degrees C; similarly, bacteria evolutionarily adapted to 32 degrees C had a higher fitness during competition at 32 degrees C than they did when acclimated to 37 degrees C. The more surprising results are that when the bacteria are acclimated to their historical evolutionary temperature, they are frequently competitively superior even at other temperatures. For example, bacteria that have evolved at either 20 degrees C or 32 degrees C and are acclimated to their respective evolutionary temperatures have a greater fitness at 37 degrees C than when they are acclimated to 37 degrees C. Thus, acclimation to evolutionary temperature may, as a correlated consequence, enhance performance not only in the evolutionary environment, but also in a variety of other thermal environments.

AB  - We report life history characteristics for 4 recently established populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Mosquitofish from thermally stable habitats, Bonham and Garrett, were characterized by maturity at large sizes, high fat reserves, and large embryos. In contrast, females from a thermally unstable habitat, Wabuska, matured at small sizes and had low fat reserves and small embryos. Females from Parker, a site with no appreciable thermal input, matured at intermediate sizes and had low fat reserves as well as large embryos. These populations shared a common ancestor in 1937; therefore, these results suggest either phenotypic plasticity, or rapid evolution.

TI  - Thermal sensitivity of Drosophila melanogaster: Evolutionary responses of adults and eggs to laboratory natural selection at different temperatures
VL  - 70
IS  - 4
SP  - 403-414
AB  - We compared aspects of the thermal sensitivity of replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had been evolving by laboratory natural selection at three selection temperatures: 16.5 degrees C (10+ yr), 25 degrees C (9+ yr), or 29 degrees C (4+ yr). The 16.5 degrees C and 25 degrees C lines are known to have diverged in fitness at 16.5 degrees C versus 25 degrees C and also in heat tolerance. We designed new experiments to explore further possible shifts in thermal sensitivity of these lines. The optimal temperature for walking speed of adults was positively related to selection temperature, but differences among lines in thermal sensitivity of walking speed were small. Performance breadth was inversely related to selection temperature. Tolerance of adults to an acute heat shock was also positively related to selection temperature, but tolerance to a cold shock was not. Thus, fitness at moderately high temperatures is genetically coupled with tolerance of extreme high (but not of low) temperature. Knock-down temperature and walking speed at high temperature, however, were independent of selection temperature. In contrast to adults, eggs from different lines had similar heat and cold tolerance. Thus, long-term natural selection has led to divergence in thermal sensitivity of some (but not of all) traits and may have had more of an impact on adults than on eggs. Attempts to predict evolutionary states in nature are, however, complicated because of the observed genetic correlations and the simple selection scheme.

TI  - Overwintering in Drosophila melanogaster: Outdoor field cage experiments on clinal and laboratory selected populations help to elucidate traits under selection
VL  - 16
IS  - 4
SP  - 614-623
AB  - Insects can adapt to temperate environments by increasing levels of resistance to cold conditions over winter and/or altering reproductive patterns to focus reproduction in favourable conditions. In temperate areas, Drosophila melanogaster persists over winter at the adult stage. A previous experiment, conducted with flies kept in outdoor population cages in the temperate winter, indicated that temperate populations produced more eggs than did tropical populations following an abrupt increase in reproduction in late winter. In contrast, the tropical populations produced more eggs prior to the increase. Both patterns resulted in a higher net number of surviving offspring for temperate populations. Here we again examine the clinal pattern in reproduction using outdoor cages, this time held under tropical winter conditions. In this environment, surprisingly, egg production was higher and on average earlier in populations originating from temperate areas. However, mortality rates also increased with latitude of origin, and the relationship of lifetime egg production to latitude should therefore be measured. To test the role of altered pattern of egg production per se in the reproductive advantage of temperate populations in the temperate winter, we tested the performance of laboratory lines selected for altered reproductive patterns, under temperate winter conditions. Lines selected for high early fecundity exhibited this characteristic in the field cages and lines selected for late reproduction exhibited a relatively high fecundity in spring. The timing of the abrupt increase in egg production was identical in these sets of lines and occurred at the same time in recently collected populations, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the switch. These findings suggest that changes in early and late reproduction per se determine adaptation to temperate winter conditions, and illustrate how laboratory selection lines can be used to understand traits underlying adaptive shifts in field performance.

TI  - Beyond the '3/4-power law': Variation in the intra- and interspecific scaling of metabolic rate in animals
VL  - 80
IS  - 4
SP  - 611-662
AB  - In this review I show that the '3/4-power scaling law' of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R = aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b &lt; 1); Type II: linear, isometric (b = 1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b = 1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b &lt; 1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b &gt; 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b &lt; 1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e. growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis' focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species. Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

VL  - 274

SP  - 771-778
AB  - Artificially selected lines are widely used to investigate the genetic basis of quantitative traits and make inferences about evolutionary trajectories. Yet, the relevance of selected traits to field fitness is rarely tested. Here, we assess the relevance of thermal stress resistance artificially selected in the laboratory to one component of field fitness by investigating the likelihood of adult Drosophila melanogaster reaching food bait under different temperatures. Lines resistant to heat reached the bait more often than controls under hot and cold conditions, but less often at intermediate temperatures, suggesting a fitness cost of increased heat resistance but not at temperature extremes. Cold-resistant lines were more common at baits than controls under cold as well as hot field conditions, and there was no cost at intermediate temperatures. One of the replicate heat-resistant lines was caught less often than the others under hot conditions. Direct and correlated patterns of responses in laboratory tests did not fully predict the low performance of the heat selected lines at intermediate temperatures, nor the high performance of the cold selected lines under hot conditions. Therefore, lines selected artificially not only behaved partly as expected based on laboratory assays but also evolved patterns only evident in the field releases. © 2006 The Royal Society.

TI  - Phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation of a model bacterial system to stressful thermal environments
VL  - 83
SP  - 135-154
AB  - We studied both phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation to various thermal environments using the bacterium Escherichia coli as an experimental model system. We determined that 42 degrees C was stressful to a bacterial clone adapted to 37 degrees C, based on reductions in both absolute and competitive fitness, as well as induction of a heat stress response. This clone was also used to found replicated populations that were propagated for thousands of generations under several different thermal regimes, including 42 degrees C. Evolutionary adaptation of the populations to 42 degrees C resulted in an increase in both absolute and relative fitness at that temperature, measured respectively as an increase in the number of descendants (and their biovolume) and in competitive ability relative to the ancestral clone. The replicated experimental lineages achieved their evolutionary improvement by several distinct pathways, which produced differential preadaptation to a non-stressful nutrient environment. Adaptation to this stressful temperature entailed neither a change in the ancestral thermal niche nor any pronounced trade-offs in fitness within the thermal niche, contrary to a priori predictions. This study system was several important advantages for evaluating hypotheses concerning the effects of stress on phenotypic and evolutionary adaptation, including the ability to obtain lineages that have evolved in controlled and defined environments, to make direct measurements of fitness and to quantify the degree of stress imposed by different environments.

AB  - We examine genotype-environment interactions by using lines of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana artificially selected for differences in egg size in a full factorial design with two developmental and two oviposition temperatures. In accordance with the tempera tu re-size rule, egg size and pupal mass increased by 4-5 and 8%, respectively, at lower temperatures. Genotype-environment interactions for both traits suggest that plasticity is largely independent of the trait value, and that there is potential for evolutionary change. These findings cast further doubt on the notion that temperature-mediated plasticity might be purely a physiological constraint. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Initial bioreactor studies probing the hydrolysis of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by immobilized wild-type dehalogenase isolated from Rhodococcus rhodochrous demonstrated, however, that productivity was too low to realize a commercially viable process. A strategy to increase enzyme performance was undertaken to increase the reaction temperature, however it was determined that the wild-type enzyme was not stable for long periods of time at elevated temperatures. The accelerated laboratory evolution technique of Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis (GSSM((TM))) was used to create a clonal enzyme library comprising all single site sequence variants of the Rhodococcus enzyme. Using high throughput screening techniques and rapid kinetics assays, this library was probed for improvements in thermostability and for the ability of the enzyme to undergo a fully reversible cycle of thermal denaturation-renaturation. Eight single site mutants were discovered that had considerable effects on these aspects of the dehalogenase phenotype. Compared to the parental dehalogenase (t(1/2) = It minutes at 55 degreesC) single site variants have half-lives ranging from 300 minutes to 2700 minutes. Combinations of these mutations dramatically improved the half-life demonstrating the enhancing effects of mutational additivity. Combining five of the mutations into a single protein (Dhla5) improved the half-life to 29,000 min and a combination of all eight single-site mutations (Dhla8) increased the half-life by another factor of ten. Thus, the final Was protein was 30,000 times more stable than the parent molecule as measured by its ability to refold after denaturation at high temperature. Kinetic analysis showed that the improvement in thermal stability associated with Dhla5 did not negatively affect the rate of catalysis at ambient temperature, and allowed a significant increase in rate with no deactivation at 55 degreesC. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that mutational combinations in both Dhla5 and Dhla8 led to an 8 degreesC increase in T-m and substantiated that partial reversibility (Dhla5) and full reversibility of Dhla8. Thermal denaturation of Was was fully reversible upon scanning up to 90 degreesC. Bioreactor studies showed that improved thermal stability of Dhla5 and Was correlated qualitatively with increased productivity when haloalkane hydrolysis was conducted using immobilized forms of these evolved enzymes under high temperature conditions.

AB  - Direct and correlated responses in selection for heat-shock resistance in adult and in larval Drosophila buzzatii were studied. Two lines were artificially selected for higher survival to heat stress as adults, and two other lines were reared under a fluctuating thermal environment as larvae, 35 degrees C for 6 h and 25 degrees C for 18 h, to ''naturally'' select for higher resistance as larvae. The latter two lines were duplicated after nine generations to yield additional lines to be ''naturally'' selected as larvae at a higher temperature, 38.2 degrees C for 6 h. Control lines were maintained separately for the adult and larval selection lines. A significant direct response to selection was found for the adult selection lines. However, larvae of these adult selection lines were no more heat resistant than were larvae of the control lines. One of the two larval selection lines increased significantly in heat resistance as larvae. However adult heat resistance was similar for lines selected as larvae and the corresponding control lines maintained at 25 degrees C. Changes in developmental time accompanied changes in survival after stress in both sets of lines selected for increased heat resistance.

SP  - 271-277
AB  - We investigated the effects of melatonin (MEL) and chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the thermal selection and metabolic rate of the bullsnake, Pituophis melanoleucus. Adult snakes were acclimatized for 5 weeks to a constant temperature of 25 ± 1°C (range) and an L12:D12 photoperiod; photophase was centered on 1200 hr CST and began at 0600 hr. Temperatures selected by snakes in response to intraperitoneal (IP) injections of saline (control), MEL (5 mg kg-1 body mass), and CPZ (25 mg kg-1 body mass), a melatonin antimetabolite, were measured in a linear thermal gradient over a 36-hr experimental period. Using a repeated measures design, we showed that mean preferred body temperature (T(b)) of snakes when receiving either MEL (19.6°C, SE = 1.86, n = 11) or CPZ (15.7°C, SE = 1.12, n = 11) differed significantly from the preferred T(b) of animals receiving control injections of saline solution (24.1°C, SE = 1.90, n = 11). Changes in metabolic rate were determined with closed system respirometry to measure oxygen consumption before and 3 hr after treatments of: 1) non-injected control, 2) injected- saline control, 3) MEL (5 mg kg-1 body mass), and 4) CPZ (25 mg kg-1 body mass). Static samples of oxygen consumption before and after treatments showed that MEL and CPZ had no significant effect upon the resting metabolic rate (RMR) 3 hr after injection. A multiple comparisons test of the among- treatment differences indicated that there were no statistically significant changes in RMR (F = 0.975; df = 3,27; P = 0.419). However, the difference between before and after mean RMR for the CPZ experiment was almost significant (W = 35; df = 9; P = 0.084), and may be biologically meaningful. Both exogenous and endogenous MEL may play a role in behavioral and physiological thermoregulation of vertebrates and also may influence metabolic rate.

AB  - Four general approaches to the study of evolutionary physiology-phylogenetically-based comparisons, genetic analyses and manipulations, phcnotypic plasticity and manipulation, and selection studies-are outlined and discussed. We provide an example of the latter, the application of laboratory selection experiments to the study of a general issue in environmental adaptation, differences in adaptive patterns of generalists and specialists. A clone of the bacterium Eschcrichia coli that had evolved in a constant environment of 37°C was replicated into 6 populations and allowed to reproduce for 2,000 generations in a variable thermal environment alternating between 32 and 42°C. As predicted by theory, fitness and efficiency of resource use increased in this new environment, as did stress resistance. Contrary to predictions, however, fitness and efficiency in the constant ancestral environment of 37°C did not decrease, nor did thermal niche breadth or phenotypic plasticity increase. Selection experiments can thus provide a valuable approach to testing hypotheses and assumptions about the evolution of functional characters.

AB  - 1. Thermoregulatory behavior of fed and fasted desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii) acclimated to summer- [16 light (L):8 dark (D), ambient temperature (T-a) = 26.5 degrees C] and winter-like (8L-:16D, T-a = 10 degrees C) conditions was studied. Body temperature (T-b), selected temperature and activity were measured in hamsters placed in a thermal gradient system for 48 h. 2. Acclimation to winter-like days led to the decrease in body mass by 14% and in body temperature by 1 degrees C. On the contrary, selected T-a was higher by about 3 degrees C than in summer-like acclimated hamsters. Fasting affected only temperatures selected by night in winter-like acclimated hamsters. 3. Winter-like acclimation led to physiological changes, which may facilitate surviving long winter season. In the face of food shortage, behavioral thermoregulation may markedly reduce the energetic cost of normothermy. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature in teleost fish
VL  - 68
IS  - 5
SP  - 893-905
AB  - 1. We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40 degrees C. 2. Resting metabolic rate (R-b; mmol oxygen gas h(-1)) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by R-b = aM(b), where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0.79 (SE 0.11). The general equation for all teleost fish was 1nR(b) = 0.80(1nM)- 5.43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30 degrees C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0 degrees C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was 1nR(b) = 15.7-5.02.T-1, where T is absolute temperature (10(3) x K). 4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q(10) = 1.83 over the range 0-30 degrees C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q(10) = 2.40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.

TI  - Innovation and evolution at the edge: Origins and fates of gastropods with a labral tooth
VL  - 72
IS  - 4
SP  - 461-508
AB  - I combined data from the taxonomy, phylogeny, functional morphology, biogeography, and fossil record of gastropods to probe the origins, distribution, and fates of predatory gastropod clades characterized by the presence of a labral tooth, a downwardly projecting tooth or spine formed at the edge of the outer lip of the shell. A labral tooth occurs in at least 608 species, of which 251 are Recent. Studies of the type and position of the labral tooth, along with other characters, indicate that the labral tooth has evolved independently at least 58 times, beginning in the Campanian epoch of the late Cretaceous. The labral tooth plays a more or less active part in predation on relatively large prey animals that are protected by a hard skeleton. In the Recent fauna, tooth-bearing species are overwhelmingly warm-temperate to tropical in distribution (240 of 251 species; 96%). Within Muricidae (excluding Coralliophilinae), however, there is no discernible latitudinal gradient in the number of tooth-bearing species relative to total regional diversity. First appearances of clades with a labral tooth are overwhelmingly concentrated in the late Oligocene to Pleistocene interval, with the largest number appearing during the early Miocene (12 clades). The temporal pattern differs significantly from that expected on the basis of the number of faunas available per time interval, and is therefore not an artifact of sampling or fossil preservation. The most consistent factor associated with, and permitting the repeated evolution of, the labral tooth is high planktonic primary productivity. Two factors may account for the link between primary productivity and the evolution of labral teeth: (1) the general economic opportunity afforded by ready availability of an access to nutrients, and (2) the greater abundance and sizes range of available suspension-feeding prey animals. Incumbency - the presence of already well-adapted species - often controls evolutionary opportunity. The complementary distributions of major tooth-bearing clades in many parts of the world point to the role of well-adapted incumbents in limiting the adaptive exploration by other clades that could in principle evolve a labral tooth. The elimination of incumbents by extinction, however, does not provide opportunities for other clades to fill the adaptive void. © 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

VL  - 91

SP  - 485-488
AB  - Tail autotomy in lizards is an adaptive strategy that has evolved to reduce the risk of predation. Since tail loss reduces body mass and moving ability - which in turn are expected to influence thermal balance - there is potential for a trade-off between tail autotomy and thermoregulation. To test this hypothesis, we studied a common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) population at high latitude, inhabiting a high-cost thermal environment. Z. vivipara is a small, non-territorial lizard known as a very accurate thermoregulator. We made two predictions: (1) the reduced body weight due to tail loss results in faster heating rate (a benefit), and (2) the reduction in locomotor ability after tail loss induces a shift to the use of thermally poorer microhabitats (a cost), thus decreasing the field body temperatures of active lizards. We did not find any effect of tail loss on heating rate in laboratory experiments conducted under different thermal conditions. Likewise, no significant relationship between tail condition and field body temperatures, or between tail condition and thermal microhabitat use, were detected. Thus, our results suggest that tail autotomy does not influence the accuracy of thermoregulation in small-bodied lizards. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

TI  - Plastic and genetic variation in wing loading as a function of temperature within and among parallel clines in Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 44
IS  - 6
SP  - 461-470
AB  - Drosophila subobscura is a European (EU) species that was introduced into South America (SA) approximately 25 years ago. Previous studies have found rapid clinal evolution in wing size and in chromosome inversion frequency in the SA colonists, and these clines parallel those found among the ancestral EU populations. Here we examine thermoplastic changes in wing length in flies reared at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C from 10 populations on each continent. Wings are plastically largest in flies reared at 15 degrees C (the coldest temperature) and genetically largest from populations that experience cooler temperatures on both continents. We hypothesize that flies living in cold temperatures benefit from reduced wing loading: ectotherms with cold muscles generate less power per wing beat, and hence larger wings and/or a smaller mass would facilitate fight. We develop a simple null model, based on isometric growth, to test our hypothesis. We find that both EU and SA flies exhibit adaptive plasticity in wing loading: flies reared at 15 degrees C generally have lower wing loadings than do flies reared at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Clinal patterns, however, are strikingly different. The ancestral EU populations show adaptive clinal variation at rearing a temperature of 15 degrees C: flies from cool climates have lower wing loadings. In the colonizing populations from SA, however, we cannot reject the null model: wing loading increases with decreasing clinal temperatures. Our data suggest that selective factors other than flight have favored the rapid evolution of large overall size at low environmental temperatures. However, selection for increased flight ability in such environments may secondarily favor reduced body mass.

AB  - A component of metabolic scaling theory has worked towards understanding the influence of metabolism over the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Specific models within this 'metabolic theory of biodiversity' (MTB) have addressed temperature gradients in speciation rate and species richness, but the scope of MTB has been questioned because of empirical departures from model predictions. In this study, we first show that a generalized MTB is not inconsistent with empirical patterns and subsequently implement an eco-evolutionary MTB which has thus far only been discussed qualitatively. More specifically, we combine a functional trait (body mass) approach and an environmental gradient (temperature) with a dynamic eco-evolutionary model that builds on the current MTB. Our approach uniquely accounts for feedbacks between ecological interactions (size-dependent competition and predation) and evolutionary rates (speciation and extinction). We investigate a simple example in which temperature influences mutation rate, and show that this single effect leads to dynamic temperature gradients in macroevolutionary rates and community structure. Early in community evolution, temperature strongly influences speciation and both speciation and extinction strongly influence species richness. Through time, niche structure evolves, speciation and extinction rates fall, and species richness becomes increasingly independent of temperature. However, significant temperature-richness gradients may persist within emergent functional (trophic) groups, especially when niche breadths are wide. Thus, there is a strong signal of both history and ecological interactions on patterns of species richness across temperature gradients. More generally, the successful implementation of an eco-evolutionary MTB opens the perspective that a process-based MTB can continue to emerge through further development of metabolic models that are explicit in terms of functional traits and environmental gradients. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

TI  - Rapid population divergence in thermal reaction norms for an invading species: Breaking the temperature-size rule
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
SP  - 892-900
AB  - The temperature-size rule is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in which higher temperature during development results in a smaller adult body size (i.e. a thermal reaction norm with negative slope). Examples and exceptions to the rule are known in multiple groups of organisms, but rapid population differentiation in the temperature-size rule has not been explored. Here we examine the genetic and parental contributions to population differentiation in thermal reaction norms for size, development time and survival in the Cabbage White Butterfly Pieris rapae, for two geographical populations that have likely diverged within the past 150 years. We used split-sibship experiments with two temperature treatments (warm and cool) for P. rapae from Chapel Hill, NC, and from Seattle, WA. Mixed-effect model analyses demonstrate significant genetic differences between NC and WA populations for adult size and for thermal reaction norms for size. Mean adult mass was 12-24% greater in NC than in WA populations for both temperature treatments; mean size was unaffected or decreased with temperature (the temperature-size rule) for the WA population, but size increased with temperature for the NC population. Our study shows that the temperature-size rule and related thermal reaction norms can evolve rapidly within species in natural field conditions. Rapid evolutionary divergence argues against the existence of a simple, general mechanistic constraint as the underlying cause of the temperature-size rule. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - The interaction of multiple environmental stressors affects adaptation to a novel habitat in the natterjack toad Bufo calamita
VL  - 22
IS  - 11
SP  - 2267-2277
AB  - The potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions is a key area of interest for evolutionary biology. However, the role of multiple selection pressures on adaptive responses has rarely been investigated in natural populations. In Sweden, the natterjack toad Bufo calamita inhabits two separate distribution areas, one in southernmost Sweden and one on the west coast. We characterized the larval habitat in terms of pond size and salinity in the two areas, and found that the western populations are more affected by both desiccation risk and pond salinity than the southern populations. In a common garden experiment manipulating salinity and temperature, we found that toads from the west coast populations were locally adapted to shorter pond duration as indicated by their higher development and growth rates. However, despite being subjected to higher salinity stress in nature, west coast toads had a poorer performance in saline treatments. We found that survival in the saline treatments in the west coast populations was positively affected by larger body mass and longer larval period. Furthermore, we found negative genetic correlations between body mass and growth rate and their plastic responses to salinity. These results implicate that the occurrence of multiple environmental stressors needs to be accounted for when assessing the adaptive potential of organisms and suggest that genetic correlations may play a role in constraining adaptation of natural populations. © 2009 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Locomotor activity and its plasticity were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for Long and for Short wings at two different temperatures. Flies were tested in a locometer at two different Activity temperatures. Locomotor activity, a physiological character, showed phenotypic plasticity: locomotor activity scores (l.a.s.) were higher at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in all lines. Although at each selection temperature the lines differed significantly in the morphological character wing length, l.a.s.'s were similar in lines with Long and with Short wings per selection temperature. However, a significant difference between selected and unselected control - lines was found. At each selection temperature, plasticity of l.a.s.'s in all lines was similar, except for the Short line selected at 20 degrees C, which showed a higher plasticity. In contrast to earlier experiments no significant correlations between l.a.s. and fresh body weight, and between l.a.s. and wing length were found within each line.

VL  - 19
IS  - 6
SP  - 2006-2021
AB  - Replicated lines of Drosophila subobscura originating from a large outbred stock collected at the estimated Chilean epicentre (Puerto Montt) of the original New World invasion were allowed to evolve under controlled conditions of larval crowding for 3.5 years at three temperature levels (13, 18 and 22°C). Several pre-adult life history traits (development time, survival and competitive ability), adult life history related traits (wing size, wing shape and wing-aspect ratio), and wing size and shape asymmetries were measured at the three temperatures. Cold-adapted (13°C) populations evolved longer development times and showed lower survival at the highest developmental temperature. No divergence for wing size was detected following adaptation to temperature extremes (13 and 22°C), in agreement with earlier observations, but wing shape changes were obvious as a result of both thermal adaptation and development at different temperatures. However, the evolutionary trends observed for the wing-aspect ratio were inconsistent with an adaptive hypothesis. There was some indication that wing shape asymmetry has evolutionarily increased in warm-adapted populations, which suggests that there is additive genetic variation for fluctuating asymmetry and that it can evolve under rapid environmental changes caused by thermal stress. Overall, our results cast strong doubts on the hypothesis that body size itself is the target of selection, and suggest that pre-adult life history traits are more closely related to thermal adaptation. © 2006 The Authors.

AB  - A mathematical model is developed for describing the decomposition and removal of binder from ceramic components formed by injection molding. The model takes into account heat transfer by conduction within the ceramic body, mass transfer by convective flow of gas products, and an Arrhenius dependence of the decomposition rate. The model is solved numerically to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature, reaction rate, concentration, porosity, and pressure. The influences of the thermal and transport properties on the distribution of binder and on the buildup of pressure within the body are examined. When small temperature gradients exist across the body, the binder is removed homogenously, whereas when large temperature gradients are present, the binder is removed as a receding planar front.

TI  - Hsp-90 and the biology of nematodes
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Background. Hsp-90 from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is unique in that it fails to bind to the specific Hsp-90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA). Here we surveyed 24 different free-living or parasitic nematodes with the aim of determining whether C. elegans Hsp-90 was the exception or the norm amongst the nematodes. We combined these data with codon evolution models in an attempt to identify whether hsp-90 from GA-binding and non-binding species has evolved under different evolutionary constraints. Results. We show that GA-binding is associated with life history: free-living nematodes and those parasitic species with free-living larval stages failed to bind GA. In contrast, obligate parasites and those worms in which the free-living stage in the environment is enclosed within a resistant egg, possess a GA-binding Hsp-90. We analysed Hsp-90 sequences from fifteen nematode species to determine whether nematode hsp-90s have undergone adaptive evolution that influences GA-binding. Our data provide evidence of rapid diversifying selection in the evolution of the hsp-90 gene along three separate lineages, and identified a number of residues showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution. However, we were unable to prove that the selection observed is correlated with the ability to bind geldanamycin or not. Conclusion. Hsp-90 is a multi-functional protein and the rapid evolution of the hsp-90 gene presumably correlates with other key cellular functions. Factors other than primary amino acid sequence may influence the ability of Hsp-90 to bind to geldanamycin.

TI  - Repeatability of microenvironment-specific nesting behaviour in a turtle with environmental sex determination
VL  - 62
IS  - 1
SP  - 73-82
AB  - Evolutionary thermal adaptation is increasingly being elucidated in a variety of systems. However, one of the most striking examples, temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in reptiles, has proven stubbornly difficult to decipher. Theoretical models suggest that selection on and heritable variation in thermal sensitivity of embryonic sex determination and maternal behavioural choice of thermal qualities of nest sites control the microevolutionary potential of TSD. To begin addressing this important issue, we conducted a multiyear field study of nesting behaviour in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), which display TSD. We detected a significant field repeatability for overstory vegetation cover around nests at oviposition, a trait that is correlated inversely with nest temperature during embryonic sex determination and positively with offspring sex ratio (percentage of male). Neither clustered nesting nor individual spatial repeatability in nest site choice caused this striking pattern. Instead, females consistently preferred nest environments with particular quantities of overstory vegetation cover. These findings confirm a crucial assumption of models concerning the microevolution and adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. The results also indicate that this system may be able to evolve via long-term maternal nesting behaviour in response to skewed sex ratios caused by environmental perturbations, such as gradual long-term climate change.

AB  - Pseudemydura umbrina is active only during winter and spring when environmental temperatures are relatively low and the ephemeral swamps that it inhabits contain water. We used operative environmental temperature thermometers to define the microclimates available to P. umbrina in its natural habitat during late winter and early spring, and we monitored the use of these microclimates by seven adult tortoises using radio-telemetry. Although air and water temperatures may be as low as 12-14 C during the day, we found that microclimates available to the animals have operative temperatures of up to 35-44 C out of water and 27 C in water. All animals increased in body mass during this study, and females increased in body mass faster than males. Tortoises that spent more time in warm water increased their body mass faster than those that spent more time in cold water. During the cool time of the year, P. umbrina enhances its physiological condition by using warmer microclimates in the range of potential available microclimates.

VL  - 50

SP  - 1182-1192
AB  - The way populations respond to selection can be altered when populations are acclimated prior to selection. To examine this possibility, the responses of replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to selection for increased resistance to cold were compared. Flies were selected without hardening or after they had been hardened by holding them at 4 degrees C for one hour. The selection response in both species was much greater when Hies were not cold-hardened. Cold resistance in both sers of selected lines reached a plateau after a few generations. Surprisingly, continued selection for increased resistance resulted in decreasing levels of resistance. This decrease was no longer evident after selection had been relaxed for a generation, suggesting cross-generation effects. The magnitude of the cross-generation effects increased with additional generations of selection. Cross-generation effects were also detected for fitness components. Relaxing selection for a generation increased fecundity, weight, viability, and development time. Comparisons of relaxed lines and control lines indicated that only fecundity was influenced by selection. Both sets of selected lines had a lower fecundity than control lines. Crosses between control and selected lines and among replicate selected lines indicated that this decrease in fecundity was not associated with inbreeding. The direct and correlated responses to selection for cold resistance can therefore be influenced by acclimation and cross-generation effects.

AB  - Following an environmental change, the course of a population's adaptive evolution may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the degree of marginality of the new environment relative to the organism's potential range, and by genetic factors, including constraints that may have arisen during its past history. Experimental populations of bacteria were used to address these issues in the context of evolutionary adaptation to the thermal environment. Six replicate lines of Escherichia coli (20 degrees C group), founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2000 generations at 20 degrees C, a novel temperature that is very near the lower thermal limit at which it can maintain a stable population size in a daily serial transfer (100-fold dilution) regime. Four additional groups (32/20, 37/20, 42/20, and 32-42/20 degrees C groups) of six lines, each with 2000 generation selection histories at different temperatures (32, 37, 42, and daily alternation of 32 and 42 degrees C), were moved to the same 20 degrees C environment and propagated in parallel to ascertain whether selection histories influence the adaptive response in this novel environment. Adaptation was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the common ancestor in direct competition experiments conducted at 20 degrees C. All five groups showed improvement in relative fitness in this environment; the mean fitness of the 20 degrees C group after 2000 generations increased by about 8%. Selection history had no discernible effect on the rate or final magnitude of the fitness responses of the four groups with different histories after 2000 generations. The correlated fitness responses of the 20 degrees C group were measured across the entire thermal niche. There were significant tradeoffs in fitness at higher temperatures; for example, at 40 degrees C the average fitness of the 20 degrees C group was reduced by almost 20% relative to the common ancestor. We also observed a downward shift of 1-2 degrees C in both the upper and lower thermal niche limits for the 20 degrees C selected group. These observations are contrasted with previous observations of a markedly greater rate of adaptation to growth near the upper thermal limit (42 degrees C) and a lack of trade-off in fitness at lower temperatures for lines adapted to that high temperature. The evolutionary implications of this asymmetry are discussed.

AB  - Lines of the fly Drosophila melanogaster were selected for increased knockdown resistance to heat (39 degrees C) in a long tube. One set of lines was selected following prior heat hardening (1 h at 37 degrees C) and another without hardening, Each set consisted of three replicate selection lines and three unselected controls, Lines were tested for correlated responses to selection, in order to define the nature of knockdown resistance, Selection had a Large effect on knockdown resistance, but selected lines did not differ from controls for knockdown time in small vials, survival, or recovery time following exposure to heat, Selection with and without hardening influenced the hardening response in the long tube, but not in small vial assays of resistance, The hardened selection lines had decreased resistance to ethanol and a reduced dry weight, whereas the non-hardened lines did not show these changes, The same correlated responses were also evident in two generation experiments on unselected flies, Both sets of lines showed a reduction in activity when tested at 37 degrees C, but not at 25 degrees C, These results indicate that different measures of heat resistance are surprisingly unrelated, and suggest that subtle features of the selective environment influence responses and correlated responses to selection.

AB  - Purpose: The present study was assessed to study the restoration of the vascular compartment by rehydration after heat exposure or exercise. Methods: Eight subjects completed four trials in a randomized order: 2.7% dehydration of body mass by passive controlled hyperthermia once with rehydration and once without rehydration during recovery, and 2.7% dehydration of body mass by treadmill exercise once with rehydration and once without rehydration during recovery. An isotonic glucose electrolyte beverage was provided twice during the recovery period for a total volume, which was equivalent to the target value of body mass loss during dehydration procedures. Plasma volume (PV) was measured using Evans Blue dilution technique, and PV changes (DeltaPV) were determined using hematocrit and hemoglobin measurements. Results: PV was better maintained during exercise than during heat exposure, and the difference in DeltaPV between the two patterns of dehydration was maintained during the first 3 h of recovery. Plasma protein seemed to be accountable for the difference in DeltaPV during heat exposure and exercise but not during the 270 min of recovery. Rehydration partly restored body fluid losses, but the plasma compartment was privileged, because 26-30% of the net fluid gain was found in the plasma compartment (about 300 mL). Rehydration restored plasma osmolality and diminished the drive for arginin-vasopressin response. Conclusion: The similar selective retention of water in the plasma compartment might essentially be explained by osmotic factors provided by the beverage. As PV was completely restored by rehydration after exercise and only partly restored after heat exposure, the volume of ingested beverage should be higher after heat exposure to completely restore the plasma compartment.

VL  - 50

SP  - 1205-1218
AB  - We investigated the effects of developmental and parental temperatures on several physiological and morphological traits of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Flies for the parental generation were raised at either low or moderate temperature (18 degrees C or 25 degrees C) and then mated in the four possible sex-by-parental temperature crosses. Their offspring were raised at either 18 degrees C or 25 degrees C and then scored as adults for morphological (dry body mass, wing size, and abdominal melanization [females only]), physiological (knock-down temperature, and thermal dependence of walking speed), and life history (egg size) traits. The experiment was replicated, and the factorial design allows us to determine whether and how paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures (as well as offspring sex) influence the various traits. Sex and developmental temperature had major effects on all traits. Females had larger bodies and wings, higher knock-down temperatures, and slower speeds (but similar shaped performance curves) than males. Development at 25 degrees C (versus at 18 degrees C) increased knock-down temperature, increased maximal speed and thermal performance breadth, decreased the optimal temperature for walking, decreased body mass and wing size, reduced abdominal melanization, and reduced egg size. Parental temperatures influenced a few traits, but the effects were generally small relative to those of sex or developmental temperature. Flies whose mother had been raised at 25 degrees C (versus at 18 degrees C) had slightly higher knock-down temperature and smaller body mass. Flies whose father had been raised at 25 degrees C had relatively longer wings. The effects of paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures sometimes differed in direction. The existence of significant within- and between-generation effects suggests that comparative studies need to standardize thermal environments for at least two generations, that attempts to estimate ''field'' heritabilities may be unreliable for some traits, and that predictions of short-term evolutionary responses to selection will be difficult.

TI  - Climatic selection of starvation and desiccation resistance in populations of some tropical drosophilids
VL  - 37
IS  - 4
SP  - 195-202
AB  - Geographical populations of six Indian tropical drosophilids exhibited significant positive latitudinal correlations for body size (r = 0.92-0.99) and desiccation tolerance (r = 0.86-0.99): and for starvation tolerance there were significant negative correlations (r = -0.93 to -0.99). The extent of starvation as well as desiccation tolerance is significantly higher for species characterized by large body size (Drosophila repleta and Zapriomus indianus) in comparison with other Sophophoran species. For both traits. all the six species demonstrate significantly variable positive slope values for desiccation tolerance and negative slope values for starvation tolerance. Regression analysis of climatic data demonstrated a major role of coefficient of variation of mean monthly temperature (T-CV) and rainfall for higher desiccation tolerance of northern subtropical populations. For south Indian populations of ail six drosophilids, higher starvation tolerance could be selected due to T-min, higher metabolic stress in relation with smaller body size and higher population density and competition under tropical climatic conditions. Thr present data contrast with correlated selection response between these traits on the basis of laboratory selections. However, starvation and desiccation tolerance evolve as independent traits in geographical populations of these six tropical drosophilids; and such traits are significantly correlated with body size although in opposite directions. Furthermore, laboratory selection experiments demonstrated no change in body size whereas, under wild conditions, significant correlated body size changes are evident across populations as well as species. Present data suggest correlated selection pressure on body size and traits conferring resistance to climatic stress.

AB  - Food consumption rate and temperature selection of male and female Uromastyx philbyi were measured during the spring. Mass-specific food consumption rates of this herbivorous desert lizard were lower than those of other lizard species. The exponents of body mass in relation to food consumption were 0.80, 0.78 and 0.69 for male, non-gravid and gravid females, respectively. Gravid females had significantly the lowest mass-specific food consumption rates. Both sexes selected significantly higher mean body temperatures in photophase than in scotophase over the 24-h period. Gravid females chose the highest mean selected body temperatures and spent a longer time at higher temperatures. The adaptive significance of these variations in food consumption rate and temperature selection is discussed. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

TI  - An experimental test of evolutionary trade-offs during temperature adaptation
VL  - 104
SP  - 8649-8654
AB  - We used experimental evolution to test directly the important and commonplace evolutionary hypothesis that adaptation, increased fitness within the selective environment, is accompanied by tradeoff, a loss of fitness in other nonselective environments. Specifically, we determined whether trade-offs at high temperature generally and necessarily accompany genetic adaptation to low temperature. We measured the relative fitness increment of 24 lineages of the bacterium Escherichia coli evolved for 2,000 generations at 20°C and the relative fitness decrement of these lines at 40°C. Trade-offs at the higher temperature were examined for their generality, universality, quantitative relationship, and historical contingency. Considering all 24 lines as a group, a significant decline in fitness was found at 40°C (mean decline = 9.4%), indicating the generality of the trade-off effect. However, in a lineage-by-lineage analysis, only 15 of 24 showed a significant trade-off, and one lineage increased fitness at high temperature. Thus, although general, trade-offs were not universal. Furthermore, there was no quantitative association between the magnitude of adaptive fitness increment at 20°C and fitness decline at 40°C, and no effect of lineages' historical thermal environment on either their improvement at 20°C or the extent of their trade-off at high temperature. We do not yet know the underlying mechanisms responsible for the trade-off, but they are sufficiently prevalent to drive a general effect. However, approximately one-third of the experimental lineages achieved low-temperature adaptation without detectable high-temperature trade-offs; therefore, it cannot be necessary that every change conferring benefit in cold environments has a negative effect on function in warmer environments. © 2007 by the national Academies of sciences.

VL  - 157
IS  - 5
SP  - 570-581
AB  - Negative genetic correlation between performance at different temperatures or temperature-dependent mutations may promote evolution of thermal specialization in ectotherms. The first hypothesis implies that a selective change in performance at one temperature simultaneously results in change in performance at others, while the second implies a delay before observing such indirect responses. Comparison of the direction of evolution among Trichogramma lines selected for improvement of parasitization capacity at low, medium, or high temperatures indicated that a change in performance at one temperature concurrently resulted in opposite changes at distant temperatures. Unexpectedly, selection at high temperatures resulted in a decrease in adult fitness components, while adult performance expressed at cold temperatures simultaneously increased. The relationship between maternal fecundity and offspring fitness components varied across the thermal range. No correlation between these traits was present at cold or medium temperatures, but negative relationships appeared at high temperatures. We show that maternal selection resulting from a conflict between adult and offspring fitness components may have resulted in reversed evolution of the adult traits at the high end of the thermal range. Thus, genetic trade-offs in performance at different temperatures and phenotypic plasticity in maternal selection may constrain evolution of the thermal niche in Trichogramma.

AB  - 1. Male antelope ground squirrels were removed from the field in fall, winter, spring, and summer and separate groups exposed for 50 days each to photoperiods of 16 h (LD 16:8) and 8 h (LD 8:16) and ambient temperature of 23 ‡C. Control samples from the field were obtained at the beginning and end of each of these experiments. A single experiment was conducted with females in winter. 2. At no time of year was there a significant difference (P>0.05) in the mass or condition of reproductive tissues of animals exposed to LD 16:8 and those exposed to LD 8:16. The changes in both long-day and short-day groups during each experiment paralleled the natural seasonal reproductive cycle, with a peak in late winter and early spring. 3. In association with an annual cycle of body mass, A. leucurus showed significant seasonal differences in the tendency to increase body mass and gonadal fat when held in captivity; however these responses were also unaffected by differences in experimental photoperiod. 4. Because the 50-day manipulations of photoperiod did not affect testicular activity at any season, we conclude that the annual gonadal cycle of A. leucurus is under endogenous control. Factors that may have been involved in the evolutionary history of this adaptation are discussed. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - To assess the trade-offs associated with cold and heat tolerance, selection experiments were conducted on the rate of recovery from chill- and heat-coma using Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were treated with cold and heat to induce coma, and those that showed rapid or slow recovery from coma were selected. The lines selected for rapid (or slow) recovery from chill-coma also showed rapid (slow) recovery from heat-coma, although such a correlation was not observed in the lines selected for the rate of recovery from heat-coma. On the other hand, survival after cold was enhanced in both lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from chill-coma, and survival after heat was enhanced in both lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from heat-coma. It was assumed that cold and heat treatments to induce coma caused some damages to flies and those that were tolerant to cold or heat were unintentionally selected in the present coma-based selection. Only a weak trade-off was observed between survival-based cold and heat tolerance. On the other hand, developmental time was prolonged and desiccation resistance, walking speed, and longevity were reduced in the lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from chill- and/or heat-coma, suggesting that these resistance and life-history traits are under trade-offs with cold and/or heat tolerance.

AB  - Microbial evolution experiments offer a powerful approach for coupling changes in complex phenotypes, including fitness and its components, with specific mutations. Here we investigate mutations substituted in 15 lines of Escherichia coli that evolved for 1000 generations under freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) conditions. To investigate the genetic basis of their improvements, we screened many of the lines for mutations involving insertion sequence (IS) elements and identified two genes where multiple lines had similar mutations. Three lines had IS150 insertions in cls, which encodes cardiolipin synthase, and 8 lines had IS150 insertions in the uspA-uspB intergenic region, encoding two universal stress proteins. Another line had an 11-bp deletion mutation in the cls gene. Strain reconstructions and competitions demonstrated that this deletion is beneficial under the FTG regime in its evolved genetic background. Further experiments showed that this cls mutation helps maintain membrane fluidity after freezing and thawing and improves freeze-thaw (FT) survival. Reconstruction of isogenic strains also showed that the IS150 insertions in uspA/B are beneficial under the FTG regime. The evolved insertions reduce uspB transcription and increase both FT survival and recovery, but the physiological mechanism for this fitness improvement remains unknown.

SP  - 313-320
AB  - An artificial selection experiment was conducted for six generations to investigate the responses to selection for cadmium resistance in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa. There was a rapid response to selection. After only one generation of selection, two of the three selection lines had an increased resistance to cadmium, while all three selection lines had an elevated resistance by the next generation. After six generations of selection, fish from the selection lines survived about three times as long as control line fish when exposed to cadmium. Realized heritability for cadmium resistance,was estimated to be 0.50. Cross-resistance to copper was studied in the F-2, F-3, and F-6 generations; fish from the cadmium-resistant lines had a longer survival time than those, from the control lines. Resistance to heat was investigated in the F2, F3, and F. generations; the cadmium-resistant lines had a significantly shorter survival time than the control lines. Our results showed that evolution of resistance to cadmium was rapid, that cross-resistance to copper occurred, and that the evolution of resistance to cadmium was accompanied by a trade-off (fitness costs) as evidenced by the reduced heat tolerance.

AB  - To evaluate the influence of host mass and environmental temperature on the evolution of body size in ticks, a comparative analysis was performed using data from 193 species. Using the 20 possible phylogenetically independent contrasts among tick species, no relationship was found between body size of female ticks and either host mass or temperature. The statistical power of these analyses was low. Within the two most speciose genera of soft ticks, however, separate cross-species analyses revealed a positive and highly significant relationship between female tick size and host mass. Also, within the two most speciose genera of hard ticks, cross-species analyses showed a positive and highly significant relationship between scutum size of female ticks and host mass. The latter correlation is based on measurements of tick body size that are independent of the level of blood engorgement. No effect of temperature was observed in the within-genera analyses. These within-genera trends may be artefacts of unknown phylogenetic relationships. Another explanation, however, is that host body mass may have influenced the evolution of tick body size.

TI  - Predicting the spread of an invasive plant: Combining experiments and ecological niche model
VL  - 31
IS  - 6
SP  - 709-719
AB  - Rapid evolutionary adjustments to novel environments may contribute to the successful spread of invasive species, and can lead to niche shifts making range dynamics unpredictable. These effects might be intensified by artificial selection in the course of breeding efforts, since many successful plant invaders were deliberately introduced and cultivated as ornamentals. We hypothesized that the invasion success of Buddleja davidii, the ornamental butterfly bush, is facilitated by local adaptation to minimum temperatures and thus, exhibits unpredictable range dynamics. To assess the potential effects of adaptive evolution and artificial selection on the spread of B. davidii, we combined a common garden experiment investigating local adaptation to frost, with ecological niche modelling of the species' native and invasive ranges. We expected that populations naturalized in sub-continental climate are less susceptible to frost than populations from oceanic climate, and that the invasive range does not match predictions based on climatic data from the native range. Indeed, we revealed significant variation among invasive B. davidii populations in frost resistance. However, frost hardiness was not related to geographic location or climatic variables of the populations' home site, suggesting that invasive B. davidii populations are not locally adapted to minimum temperatures. This is in line with results of our ecological niche model that did not detect a niche shift between the species' native range in China, and its invasive range in Europe and North America. Furthermore, our niche model showed that the potential invasive range of B. davidii is still not completely occupied. Together with the frost resistance data obtained in our experiment, the results indicate that climatic conditions are currently not limiting the further spread of the species in Europe and North America. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Temperature provides a powerful theme for exploring environmental adaptation at all levels of biological organization, from molecular kinetics to organismal fitness to global biogeography. First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in within-population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature-size rule (increased developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths and smaller thermal safety margins. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 498-507
AB  - 1. Selected body temperatures of female lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, were measured on a photothermal gradient during late pregnancy and again when postpartum, and pregnant females were subjected to one of three fluctuating temperature regimes that simulated body temperatures of (1) pregnant females, (2) postpartum females or (3) allowed normal thermoregulation. 2. Overall, females selected lower body temperatures when pregnant (mean = 32.0 degrees C) than when postpartum (mean = 33.5 degrees C). 3. Females regulated body temperature more precisely when pregnant than when postpartum as judged by their smaller variances in body temperature throughout the day. 4. When pregnant, females selected a lower mean maximum body temperature (mean: pregnant = 32.8 degrees C; postpartum = 34.5 degrees C) than when postpartum, but selected mean minimum body temperatures did not differ. 5. None of the experimental temperature treatments was detrimental to pregnant females. Female body length increased during pregnancy but the rate of increase did not differ among treatments. Moreover, length-adjusted body mass of postpartum females did not differ among treatments. 6. Pregnant females that experienced postpartum body temperatures produced neonates that were smaller in body mass and length than pregnant females that experienced pregnant body temperatures and females that were allowed to thermoregulate. 7. For neonates resulting from the postpartum body temperature treatment, the disparity in the body length, but not mass, was still observed at 9 days of age, although survival and growth of neonates was high and did not differ among treatments. 8. The results demonstrate that pregnant females could maintain higher postpartum body temperatures without compromising their physical condition, but select relatively low body temperatures, presumably to avoid decrements in offspring fitness.

AB  - The effects of cold- and heat hardening on resistance to both low and high temperature stress was examined in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for resistance to either cold or heat. The hardening effect was positive when the hardening was of the same type as the stress in all selection regimes. The effect of cold hardening on survival after heat stress was further examined in the lines selected for cold resistance and corresponding controls. A cross-protection effect (increased heat resistance after cold hardening) was present and this effect was lower in the lines selected for resistance to cold than in the controls. The level of Hsp70 expression induced by a non-lethal cold hardening was examined, showing that cold hardening induced Hsp70 expression. The results suggest that the cross-protection effect is at least partly due to Hsp70 expression induced by cold exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Short-term indirect selection in Drosophila melanogaster for heat-sensitivity and heat resistance resulted in two strains, one heat sensitive and another heat resistant, and correlated responses were found for the rate of heat shock protein synthesis, behavioral patterns (asymmetrical sexual isolation) and fitness components (fecundity, fertility, viability, developmental time), as well as for several enzyme activities (MDH, G-6-PDH, ADH, ACHE). These responses associated with temperature selection may reflect the effects of differential inbreeding depression caused by homozygosity of temperature sensitive mutations with different pleiotropic effects. Selection even of a very short duration can induce significant adaptive and evolutionary changes. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 128

AB  - Twenty generations of divergent selection for abdominal bristle number were carried out starting from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster. All lines were selected with the same proportion (20%) but at two different numbers of selected parents of each sex (5 or 25). A significant response to selection was detected in eight lines (out of 40) and, in most cases, it could be wholly attributed to a single mutation of relatively large effect (0.5-2 phenotypic standard deviations). The ratio of new mutational variance to environmental variance was estimated to be (0.33 ± 0.11) X 10-3. The distribution of mutant effects was asymmetrical, both with respect to bristle number (85% of it was negative) and to fitness (most detected bristle mutations were lethal or semilethal). Moreover, this distribution was leptokurtic, due to the presence of major genes. Gene action on bristles ranged from additive to completely recessive, no epistatic interactions being found. In agreement with theory, larger responses in each direction were achieved by those lines selected at greater effective population sizes. Furthermore, the observed divergence between lines selected in opposite directions was proportional to their effective size, as predicted for mutations of large effect.

VL  - 17

SP  - 877-885
AB  - 1. Locomotor impairment and shift in thermal preferences during gestation have been documented in some lizards, but few studies have investigated their timing. Here, endurance capacity, sprint speed and selected body temperature of gravid females of the viviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara (Jacquin) were measured weekly before and after parturition. 2. Significant temporal variation of endurance and sprint speed was detected. A marked decrease in locomotor abilities occurred 2 weeks before parturition (c. 35% for endurance and 25% for sprint speed). A rapid recovery was observed a few days after parturition for endurance, while sprint speed recovered more slowly. 3. A physical impairment due to body mass was detected for endurance capacity, but not for sprint speed. The recovery of locomotor abilities after parturition was independent of the intensity of reproductive investment. Mass-independent variation in locomotor performances might be explained by physiological consequences of reproduction independent of the physical burden. 4. Females basking under laboratory conditions selected low body temperatures during the final month of gestation (29.8 degreesC +/- 0.12 SE) and a drastic increase occurred in the few days following parturition (33.4 degreesC +/- 0.13 SE). 5. These results call for a more detailed investigation of the mechanisms underlying trade-offs between reproduction, locomotion and thermoregulation in lizards.

VL  - 17

AB  - Rapid climate change is likely to impose strong selection pressures on traits important for fitness, and therefore, microevolution in response to climate-mediated selection is potentially an important mechanism mitigating negative consequences of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often - if not typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Adaptation to temporal variation in environmental conditions is widespread. Whether evolution in a constant environment alters adaptation to temporal variation is relatively unexplored. We examine how constant and diurnally fluctuating temperature conditions affect life-history traits in two populations of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta: a field population that routinely experiences fluctuating temperatures; and a laboratory population (derived from this field population in the 1960s) maintained at a constant temperature for more than 250 generations. Our experiments demonstrate that diurnal fluctuations significantly alter body size and development time in both populations, and confirm that these populations differ in their responses to a mean temperature. However, we found no evidence for population divergence in responses to diurnal temperature fluctuations. We suggest that mean and extreme temperatures may act as more potent selective forces on thermal reaction norms than temperature variation per se. © 2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster were allowed to evolve in population cage culture at 16.5° C or 25° C for five years. Their larval and pupal development times, larval growth rates, larval critical weights for pupariation and pre‐adult survival rates were then measured at both temperatures. Pre‐adult survival showed evidence of adaptation of the lines to their thermal selection regimes, with each set of lines showing superior survival when tested at the temperature at which they had been evolving. Pupal periods were similar for all lines when growing at 16.5° C but, at 25° C, the low temperature lines had the longer pupal periods. Irrespective of experimental temperature, low temperature lines grew faster and had shorter larval development periods than the high temperature lines. Larval critical weights for pupariation were higher in the low temperature lines at the low experimental temperature, and higher in the high temperature lines at the higher experimental temperature. The correlations between these traits induced by thermal evolution were in general different from or opposite to the genetic correlations found within a single temperature.

VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 836-844
AB  - Genetic variation of body size along latitudinal clines is found globally in Drosophila melanogaster, with larger individuals encountered at higher latitudes. Temperature has been implicated as a selective agent for these clines, because the body size of laboratory populations allowed to evolve in culture at lower temperatures is larger. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that larger size is favoured at lower temperature through natural selection on adult males. We measured life-span and age-specific fertility of males from lines of flies artificially selected for body size at two different experimental temperatures. There was an interaction between experimental temperature and body size selection for male fitness; large-line males were fitter than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was greater at the lower experimental temperature. Smaller males did not perform significantly differently from control males at either experimental temperature. The results imply that thermal selection for larger adult males is at least in part responsible for the evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures in this species. The responsible mechanisms require further investigation.

TI  - Body size reaction norms in Drosophila melanogaster: Temporal stability and genetic architecture in a natural population
VL  - 31
IS  - 5
SP  - 491-508
AB  - A natural population of Drosophila melanogaster was sampled twice over a 5-year interval from the same French locality in the same season. Reaction norms of wing and thorax length and wing/thorax ratio, according to growth temperature (12-31 degrees C) were analysed in tell isofemale lines for each sample. Reaction norms were very similar between years, showing not only a remarkable stability of the average size but also of the reactivity to temperature. Wing and thorax length reaction norms were characterized by the co-ordinates of their maxima (MV = maximum value of character; TMV = temperature of maximum value). The wing/thorax ratio, which exhibited a decreasing sigmoid norm, was characterized by the co-ordinates of the inflexion point. Again, these characteristic values were found to be very similar for samples between years. The results were further analysed by pooling the 20 lines into a single data set. Heritability was significantly variable according to temperature, but in a fairly irregular way with lowest values at extreme temperatures. Genetic variance of the three traits exhibited more regular variation with a minimum at intermediate temperatures and maxima at extreme high or low temperatures. Such was also the case of evolvability, i.e. the genetic coefficient of variation. Heritability and evolvability were found to be slightly but negatively correlated, showing that they provide independent biological information. The temporal stability of a natural population over the years suggests some stabilizing selection for both mean body size and plasticity. For laboratory evolution experiments, the natural origin population might be useful as a genetic control over time. (C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.

TI  - Size and temperature in the evolution of fish life histories
VL  - 44
IS  - 6
SP  - 494-497
AB  - Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times, especially individual growth or production rates. By favoring an optimal maturation age and reproductive allocation, natural selection links individual growth to the mortality schedule. A recent model for evolution of life histories for species with indeterminate growth, which includes most fish, successfully predicts the numeric values of two key dimensionless numbers and the allometry of the average reproductive allocation versus maturation size across species. Here we use this new model to predict the relationships of age-at-maturity, adult mortality and reproductive effort to environmental temperature and maturation size across species. Age-at-maturity, adult mortality and the proportion of the body mass given to reproduction per year are predicted to show +/-0.25 power allometries with mass at maturity, and an exponential (Boltzmann) temperature dependence. Temperature is assumed to affect only body size growth, so the temperature linkages of maturation, mortality and reproductive effort are indirect via life history optimization; this is briefly contrasted with the idea that (for example) temperature directly affects mortality.

TI  - Genomewide patterns of substitution in adaptively evolving populations of the RNA bacteriophage MS2
VL  - 181
IS  - 4
SP  - 1535-1544
AB  - Experimental evolution of bacteriophage provides a powerful means of studying the genetics of adaptation, as every substitution contributing to adaptation can be identified and characterized. Here, I use experimental evolution of MS2, an RNA bacteriophage, to study its adaptive response to a novel environment. To this end, three lines of MS2 were adapted to rapid growth and lysis at cold temperature for a minimum of 50 phage generations and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Using this system, I identified adaptive substitutions, monitored changes in frequency of adaptive mutations through the course of the experiment, and measured the effect on phage growth rate of each substitution. All three lines showed a substantial increase in fitness (a two- to threefold increase in growth rate) due to a modest number of substitutions (three to four). The data show some evidence that the substitutions occurring early in the experiment have larger beneficial effects than later ones, in accordance with the expected diminishing returns relationship between the fitness effects of a mutation and its order of substitution. Patterns of molecular evolution seen here - primarily a paucity of hitchhiking mutations - suggest an abundant supply of beneficial mutations in this system. Nevertheless, some beneficial mutations appear to have been lost, possibly due to accumulation of beneficial mutations on other genetic backgrounds, clonal interference, and negatively epistatic interactions with other beneficial mutations.

TI  - Variation in scorpion metabolic rate and rate-temperature relationships: Implications for the fundamental equation of the metabolic theory of ecology
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
SP  - 1602-1612
AB  - The fundamental equation of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) indicates that most of the variation in metabolic rate are a consequence of variation in organismal size and environmental temperature. Although evolution is thought to minimize energy costs of nutrient transport, its effects on metabolic rate via adaptation, acclimatization or acclimation are considered small, and restricted mostly to variation in the scaling constant, b0. This contrasts strongly with many conclusions of evolutionary physiology and life-history theory, making closer examination of the fundamental equation an important task for evolutionary biologists. Here we do so using scorpions as model organisms. First, we investigate the implications for the fundamental equation of metabolic rate variation and its temperature dependence in the scorpion Uroplectes carinatus following laboratory acclimation. During 22 days of acclimation at 25°C metabolic rates declined significantly (from 127.4 to 78.2 μW; P = 0.0001) whereas mean body mass remained constant (367.9-369.1 mg; P = 0.999). In field-fresh scorpions, metabolic rate-temperature (MRT) relationships varied substantially within and among individuals, and therefore had low repeatability values (τ = 0.02) and no significant among-individual variation (P = 0.181). However, acclimation resulted in a decline in within-individual variation of MRT slopes which subsequently revealed significant differences among individuals (P = 0.0031) and resulted in a fourfold increase in repeatability values (τ = 0.08). These results highlight the fact that MRT relationships can show substantial, directional variation within individuals over time. Using a randomization model we demonstrate that the reduction in metabolic rate with acclimation while body mass remains constant causes a decline both in the value of the mass-scaling exponent and the coefficient of determination. Furthermore, interspecific comparisons of activation energy, E, demonstrated significant variation in scorpions (0.09-1.14 eV), with a mean value of 0.77 eV, significantly higher than the 0.6-0.7 eV predicted by the fundamental equation. Our results add to a growing body of work questioning both the theoretical basis and empirical support for the MTE, and suggest that alternative models of metabolic rate variation incorporating explicit consideration of life history evolution deserve further scrutiny. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - Giant boid snake from the Palaeocene neotropics reveals hotter past equatorial temperatures
VL  - 457
IS  - 7230
SP  - 715-717
AB  - The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air-breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures (poikilothermy). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejón Formation (58-60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 m and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake. The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate, and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30-34°C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 based on climate models. Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid-latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejón Formation indicate an anaconda-like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas. ©2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Tc-99m-SnF2 colloid 'LLK': particle size, morphology and leucocyte labelling behaviour
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 191-202
AB  - 99mTc-SnF2 colloid (Radpharm LLK) leucocyte labelling agent is used in whole blood, exploiting phagocytosis. The objectives of this work were to optimize leucocyte labelling in leucocyte-enriched plasma, and to investigate: (i) the effect of temperature and other factors on labelling efficiency; (ii) the selectivity for different leucocyte types; (iii) the viability of the labelled cells and efflux of the radiolabel; and (iv) the physical characteristics of the colloid. Density gradient centrifugation was used to investigate the labelling efficiency, cell selectivity and efflux, Trypan blue to study the viability, and laser scattering, electron microscopy and membrane filtration to investigate particle size and morphology. Particles appeared as loose, coiled, chain-like aggregates of much smaller particles (&lt;0.05 μm). The aggregate diameter ranged from &lt;0.1 to &gt;5 μm and increased with time. The distribution of radioactivity amongst the particle sizes varied widely. The labelling efficiency in leucocyte-rich plasma was enhanced at 37°C compared to room temperature, and by centrifuging during labelling. The selectivity for different leucocyte types varied markedly between batches and blood samples, in some cases showing preference for mononuclear cells and in others for granulocytes. Viability was excellent and comparable with 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO)- labelled cells. A significant fraction of radiolabel, comparable to that observed with 99mTc-HMPAO, was lost from leucocytes during incubation in vitro over 4 h. Thus, 99mTc-SnF2 is a convenient, efficient labelling agent for leucocytes, but shows variable cell selectivity which may be linked to particle size variability, and there is significant efflux of radioactivity from labelled cells. © 2003 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.

TI  - Direct and correlated responses to selection for longevity in Drosophila buzzatii
VL  - 97
IS  - 4
SP  - 738-748
AB  - The possible associations between longevity, early fecundity, and stress-resistance traits were explored using artificial selection on longevity in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Three replicated lines were selected for increased lifespan (L lines) and compared with the respective unselected controls (C lines) after the 14th generation of selection. Mean longevity exhibited a significant response to selection. The baseline mortality tended to decrease in the L lines and a negative correlated response to longevity selection was found for early fecundity. Egg-to-adult developmental time increased in L lines. Longevity selection increased stress resistance for both high and low temperatures, as measured by heat knockdown resistance and chill-coma recovery. Starvation resistance also tended to be higher in L than in C lines. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis of trade-offs between longevity and early fecundity, and also suggest a trade-off association between adult longevity and developmental time. Correlated selection responses were generally consistent with correlations among the traits previously inferred from altitudinal clines for longevity and stress-resistance phenotypes.

TI  - Simultaneous selection on two fitness-related traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana
VL  - 57
IS  - 8
SP  - 1852-1862
AB  - Theory about the role of constraints in evolution is abundant, but few empirical data exist to describe the consequences a bias in phenotypic variation has for micro evolution. Responses to natural selection can be severely hampered by a genetic correlation among a suite of traits. Constraints can be studied using antagonistic selection experiments, that is, two-trait selection in opposition to this correlation. The two traits studied here were development time and wing pattern (eyespot size) in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, both of which have a clear adaptive significance. Rates of response were higher for eyespot size than for development time, but were independent of the concurrent selection (either in the same direction as the correlation or perpendicular to it), Regimes differed in both traits in all directions after I I generations of selection. The uncoupling lines had higher relative responses than the synergistic lines in development time and equal relative responses in eyespot size. The patterns for eyespot size (reaction norms) were consistent across different rearing temperatures. Differences in lines selected for fast and slow development time were more pronounced at lower temperatures, irrespective of the direction of joint wing pattern selection. Furthermore, correlated responses in pupal weight and growth rate were observed; lines selected for a slower development had higher pupal weights, especially at lower temperatures. The response of the uncoupling lines was not hampered by a lack of selectable genetic variation, and the relative response in the development time was larger than expected based on response in the coupled direction and quantitative genetic predictions. This suggests that the structure of the genetic architecture does not constrain the short-term, independent evolution of both wing pattern and development time.

AB  - Within-line family selection was carried out at an optimum (33°C) and two stress temperatures (28°C and 38°C) for increasing egg number laid by virgin females of Tribolium castaneum from the 7th to the 11th day after adult emergence. A control was maintained throughout the experiment. Two replicated lines were selected at each temperature and all selected lines were tested in each of the three environments.Direct and correlated responses to selection in different environment have been analysed in order to study implications of genotype-environment interaction on the selection outcome. Although selection at the optimum environment has been themost effective it did not confer the specialisation needed for performance in stress environments. However, selecting in adverse environments led to a broader range of performance over environments, which in one case (38°C) included the optimum one.The degree of adaptation to adverse environments was mainly determined by the magnitude of the genetic correlation between performances in the adverse and the optimum environments. The evolution of such correlations through selection has also been investigated. © 1976 The Genetical Society of Great Britain. All rights reserved.

VL  - 60

SP  - 232-245
AB  - Salamandra salamandra has an unusual mode of reproduction. Females retain eggs in their oviducts and give birth to aquatic larvae or, in some populations, to fully metamorphosed juveniles. We investigated how variation in the birth size of larvae of five different sibships of S. salamandra affected larval survival, larval growth rates, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis under different food and temperature conditions. Maternal effects, via the effect of larval birth size, attenuated throughout development in all environments but still affected metamorphic traits at lower temperatures. Larval developmental time was negatively correlated with larval birth size and positively correlated with size at metamorphosis. After controlling for the effect of larval birth size, broad-sense heritabilities were obtained for residual values of metamorphic traits, indicating that enough genetic variability exists at lower temperature environments and that responses to selection of metamorphic traits are possible. The size at and the time to metamorphosis were phenotypically and genetically correlated. Since both traits presumably affect fitness, genetic dependence between size and time to metamorphosis may act as a constraint on adaptive evolution through antagonistic pleiotropy. Mass-specific growth, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis were plastic under different temperature and food conditions, but no significant sibship x environment interaction was found for any trait. In addition, significant cross-environment correlation for size at metamorphosis with respect to the food gradient indicates low potential for the adaptive evolution of reaction norms to heterogeneous food environments.

TI  - Experimental evidence for the species character of Calcidiscus leptoporus morphotypes
VL  - 77
IS  - 5
SP  - 825-830
AB  - Culturing experiments of the intermediate morphotype of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Calcidiscus leptoporus, indicate that the size of its coccosphere and of its coccoliths are affected only in a minor way by temperature. The changes observed in clones growing under different temperature and light conditions are within the range defined for this morphotype in the plankton and Holocene sediments. This outcome suggests that the three morphotypes of living C. leptoporus may be reproductively isolated species rather than stages in a life cycle of a single species or ecophenotypic adaptations of a single species with considerable morphological plasticity. Numerous extinct morphotypes of C. leptoporus have been recorded from marine sediments deposited during the last approximately 25 Ma. In the light of our experiments, these may in fact represent genetically distinct species, which experienced rapid evolution.

VL  - 20

SP  - 2056-2066
AB  - The present study extends evidence that Drosophila heat-shock genes are distinctively evolvable because of insertion of transposable elements by examining the genotypic diversity and phenotypic consequences of naturally occurring P element insertions in the proximal promoter regions of two small heat-shock genes. Detailed scrutiny of two populations revealed 16 distinctive P transposable elements collectively segregating in proximal promoters of two small heat-shock genes, Hsp26 and Hsp27. These elements vary in size, orientation and insertion site. Frequencies of P element-containing alleles varied from 5% to 100% in these populations. Two Hsp26 elements chosen for detailed study, RsP26 and D2Pm, reduced or abolished Hsp26 expression respectively. The RsP 26 element increased or did not affect inducible tolerance of high temperature, increased fecundity, but decreased developmental rate. On the other hand, the D2Pm element decreased thermotolerance and fecundity. In lines subjected to experimental evolution, the allelic frequency of the RsP26P element varied considerably, and was at lower frequencies in lines selected for increased longevity and for accelerated development than in controls. Transposable element insertions into small Hsp genes in Drosophila populations can have dramatic fitness consequences, and therefore create variation on which selection can act. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - The energetics of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) flying in captive and wild conditions
VL  - 133
IS  - 2
SP  - 225-237
AB  - Experimental data on the relationship between mean heart rate (f(H)) and mean rate of oxygen consumption (V) over dot O-2 of captive barnacle geese during flights in a wind tunnel are assessed in terms of their capacity to predict the typical (V) over dot O-2 of wild barnacle geese, based on the recordings of their f(H), while undertaking autumn migratory flights between Spitsbergen (78degreesN) and Caerlaverock, Scotland (55degreesN). A significant linear relationship has been demonstrated between the f(H) and simultaneously recorded (V) over dot O-2 of a single barnacle goose (B-B) flying in the wind tunnel (V) over dot O-2 = 1.42 f(H) - 304, r(2)=0.82, P<0.001, N=12 flights). Data recorded from three additional geese (N=4 flights), lay within the 95% prediction intervals of the relationship for goose B-B. When these geese (mean body mass= 2.06 kg, n = 4) were flown in the wind tunnel (WT) without the mask, they had a mean f(H) of 451 +/- 23 beats min(-1), yielding an estimate for (V) over dot O-2 of 336+/-33 ml min(-1). However, f(H) has also been recorded from wild barnacle geese (mean migratory f(H) of 253 beats min(-1)), and substitution of this value into the above calibration equation results in an unrealistically low value for mean migratory (V) over dot O-2 of only 55 ml min(-1). Various factors, such as differences in heart mass, selective tissue perfusion, environmental temperature and flock formation, which might account for some of the difference in f(H) between the captive and wild geese are discussed. Comparison with other WT studies shows that inter-species minimum mass-specific (V) over dot O-2 declines with increasing body mass (M-b; range 0.035-2.8 kg) as 173 M-b(-0224), r(2) =0.848.

TI  - Swift laboratory thermal evolution of wing shape (but not size) in Drosophila subobscura and its relationship with chromosomal inversion polymorphism
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 841-855
AB  - Latitudinal clinal variation in wing size and shape has evolved in North American populations of Drosophila subobscura within about 20 years since colonization. While the size cline is consistent to that found in original European populations (and globally in other Drosophila species), different parts of the wing have evolved on the two continents. This clearly suggests that 'chance and necessity' are simultaneously playing their roles in the process of adaptation. We report here rapid and consistent thermal evolution of wing shape (but not size) that apparently is at odds with that suggestion. Three replicated populations of D. subobscura derived from an outbred stock at Puerto Montt (Chile) were kept at each of three temperatures (13, 18 and 22 degreesC) for 1 year and have diverged for 27 generations at most. We used the methods of geometric morphometrics to study wing shape variation in both females and males from the thermal stocks, and rates of genetic divergence for wing shape were found to be as fast or even faster than those previously estimated for wing size on a continental scale. These shape changes did not follow a neat linear trend with temperature, and are associated with localized shifts of particular landmarks with some differences between sexes. Wing shape variables were found to differ in response to male genetic constitution for polymorphic chromosomal inversions, which strongly suggests that changes in gene arrangement frequencies as a response to temperature underlie the correlated changes in wing shape because of gene-inversion linkage disequilibria. In fact, we also suggest that the shape cline in North America likely predated the size cline and is consistent with the quite different evolutionary rates between inversion and size clines. These findings cast strong doubts on the supposed 'unpredictability' of the geographical cline for wing traits in D. subobscura North American colonizing populations.

AB  - Thermal environments can influence many fitness-related traits including life span. Here, we assess whether longevity in Drosophila melanogaster can experimentally evolve as a correlated response to cold-stress selection, and whether genotype-by-temperature and sex-by-temperature interactions are significant components of variation in life span. Three replicated S lines were cold-stress selected and compared with their respective unselected controls (Clines) in the 16(th) generation of thermal selection. Cold-stress resistance exhibited a substantial direct response to selection, and also showed a significant interaction between sex and type of line. Mean longevity exhibited a significant interaction between adult test temperature (14 and 25 degreesC) and line (with suggestive evidence for increased longevity of S lines when tested at 14 degreesC), but there was no evidence for increased longevity in S lines at normal temperatures (i.e. 25 degreesC). Another temperature-dependent effect was sex-specific, with males being the longer lived sex at 25 degreesC but the less long-lived sex at 14 degreesC. Additionally, we tested in an exploratory way the relationship between longevity and cold-stress resistance by also measuring resistance to a prefreezing temperature before and after one generation of longevity selection at 14 degreesC (selection intensity, i = 1.47 for S lines, and 1.42 for C lines). In this longevity selection, we found that cold-stress resistance increased by about 6% in S lines and 18% in C lines. However, taken together, the results indicate no simple relationship between longevity and cold-stress resistance, with genotype-by-sex interactions in both traits. Temperature dependent interaction in longevity is apparent between S and C lines, and sex-specific variation in mean longevity also depends on temperature.

AB  - Temperature selection in a thermal gradient and the physiological responses to heat exposure were studied in the Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, from Crete. In association with previous indications that the Moorish gecko has a bimodal activity pattern, we found a bimodal temperature selection with modes at 27-28 and 30-32°C. In this respect, it resembles the closely related Israeli gecko, Ptyodactylus guttatus. However, Tarentola is more susceptible to heat exposure and has a moderate thermoregulatory capacity compared to P. guttatus and this is probably related to its reaching more northern latitudes than Ptyodactylus. During heat exposure (up to 40°C) oxygen consumption increased significantly and was not sustained by the moderate increase (Q10 = 1.44) in heart frequency. We found a significantly lower heating rate than cooling rate in Tarentola. This is in accord with allometric predictions for its low body mass and might stem from the high mass-specific evaporative water loss and from the relatively small increment in heart rate during heat exposure which may adaptively retard heat gain from the environment and maximize its activity periods.

TI  - State-dependent energy allocation in the pelagic Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum: Trade-off between winter reserves and buoyancy
VL  - 326
SP  - 269-282
AB  - Icefishes of the perciform suborder Notothenioidei dominate the Antarctic ichthyofauna. These species originated from a benthic ancestor and do not possess a swimbladder. However, some notothenioids have achieved neutral buoyancy through skeletal reductions as well as storage of lipids to reduce body mass relative to seawater. These adaptations enable them to exploit the highly productive pelagic realm. Mobilizing these lipid reserves in periods of critically low food intake may lead to buoyancy problems. Accumulating and conserving these reserves may slow down the development of somatic and reproductive tissues and hence future reproductive output. We constructed a dynamic state variable model to investigate how ingested energy is partitioned over 3 state variables: lipid reserves, structural protein body mass and egg development. Two forms of the model differed in that lipid reserves were either included in or excluded from the total metabolic energy budget of an individual. The model was parameterised for the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, a key species in the pelagic food web of the high Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean. In Pleuragramma, lipids are stored in unique extracellular lipid sacs, which are thought to serve as buoyancy aids and energy reserves. The model predicts optimal habitat selection and an optimal energy allocation strategy by maximizing future reproductive output. The environment is simulated using vertical gradients in water temperature, optical properties, food availability and predation risk. The form of the model that considers lipids as metabolically inactive reserves best replicates field measurements of fat content and yields high values for fitness in Pleuragramma. Uncoupling fat reserves from metabolism, through the development of extracellular lipid sacs, probably represents a key adaptation in the evolution towards a pelagic lifestyle in a fish species with a low scope for activity. © Inter-Research 2006.

AB  - A complete understanding of the role of natural selection in driving evolutionary change requires accurate estimates of the strength of selection acting in the wild. Accordingly, several approaches using a variety of data - including patterns of DNA variability, spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies, and fitness estimates - have been developed to identify and quantify selection on both genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we review these approaches, drawing on both recent and classic examples to illustrate their utility and limitations. We then argue that by combining estimates of selection at multiple levels - from individual mutations to phenotypes-and at multiple timescales - from ecological to evolutionary - with experiments that demonstrate why traits are under selection, we can gain a much more complete picture of the adaptive process. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Geographic dines in ectotherm species including Drosophila melanogaster have been found throughout the world, with genetically larger body size and shorter development time occurring at high latitudes. Temperature is thought to pray a major role in the evolution of this clinal variation. Laboratory thermal selection has effects similar to those seen in geographical clines. Evolution at low temperatures results in more rapid development to larger adult flies. This study investigated the effects of geographical origin and experimental temperature on larval growth efficiency in D. melanogaster. Larvae from populations that had evolved at high latitudes were found to use limited food more efficiently, so that the overall adult body size achieved was larger. Larvae reared at a lower experimental temperature (18 degreesC) used food more efficiently than those reared at a higher temperature (25 degreesC). The increases in growth efficiency found in populations from high latitudes could explain their increased body size and more rapid development.

VL  - 50

SP  - 237-251
AB  - A comparison of the results of 13 generations of directional selection (with control lines) for higher body weight in Drosophila melanogaster in two variable temperature environments (cyclic and random) with those of three constant temperature environments (19., 24·5., and 27.C) is made. Rates of genetic gain obtained in the variable environments were similar to those achieved in constant temperature environments. The ability to buffer against environmental changes, in terms of body weight and some fitness characteristics, was altered by selection for higher body weight but not by the environmental regimes. Lines selected at the presumed optimum temperature (24·5.C) performed best at all temperatures. These results indicate that long-term genetic gain in a quantitative trait through directional selection is probably unaffected in any major way by normal variations in environmental conditions and that selection for overall performance should be carried out in the most favourable environment. © 1983, The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

TI  - Evolutionary adaptation to temperature. I. Fitness responses of Escherichia coli to changes in its thermal environment
VL  - 46
IS  - 1
SP  - 16-30
AB  - We used bacteria to study experimentally the process of genetic adaptation to environmental temperature. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli, founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2,000 generations in 4 different thermal regimes as 4 experimental groups: constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C (thermal specialists), or a daily alternation between 32 and 42-degrees-C (32/42-degrees-C: thermal generalists). The ancestor had previously been propagated at 37-degrees-C for 2,000 generations. Adaptation of the groups to temperature was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the ancestor, as estimated by competition experiments. All four experimental groups showed improved relative fitness in their own thermal environment (direct response of fitness). However, rates of fitness improvement varied greatly among temperature groups. The 42-degrees-C group responded most rapidly and extensively, followed by the 32 and 32/42-degrees-C groups, whose fitness improvements were indistinguishable. The 37-degrees-C group, which experienced the ancestral temperature, had the slowest and least extensive fitness improvement. The correlated fitness responses of each group, again relative to the common ancestor, were measured over the entire experimental range of temperatures. No necessary tradeoff between direct and correlated responses of fitness was apparent: for example, the improved fitness of the 42-degrees-C group at 42-degrees-C was not accompanied by a loss of fitness at 37-degrees-C or 32-degrees-C. However, the direct fitness responses were usually greater than the correlated responses, judged both by comparing direct and correlated responses of a single group at different temperatures and by comparing direct and correlated responses of different groups at a single temperature. These comparisons indicate that the observed adaptation was, in fact, largely temperature specific. Also, the fitness responses of the generalist group across a range of temperatures were less variable than those of the thermal specialist groups considered as whole.

VL  - 142

AB  - We used a clone of the bacterium Escherichia coli previously adapted to 37-degrees to found replicate populations propagated at constant 32-degrees-C, constant 37-degrees-C, constant 42-degrees-C, and a daily alternation between 32-degrees and 42-degrees-C. Several criteria indicate that 42-degrees-C was stressful for the ancestor, while 32-degrees and 37-degrees-C were not. For example, 42-degrees-C was within 1-degrees-C of the limit for extinction, and yield was substantially reduced at this temperature. Adaptation was assayed by competing derived genotypes against their common ancestor at various temperatures. Bacteria adapted much more rapidly to 42-degrees-C than to either lower temperature. Also, bacteria propagated in the alternating environment exhibited greater adaptation to 42-degrees-C than to 32-degrees-C. Adaptation was temperature-specific in all groups, but adaptation to 42-degrees-C entailed little loss of fitness at lower temperatures. Nor did adaptation to 42-degrees-C much extend the upper limit for population persistence, although we isolated more thermotolerant mutants by imposing hard selection. Thus, whereas the stressful 42-degrees-C environment consistently led to more rapid adaptive evolution than did nonstressful regimes, superstressful temperatures caused either extremely rapid adaptive evolution or extinction. Although defining stress in general terms is difficult, one can evaluate specific criteria and test evolutionary hypotheses using appropriate experimental systems.

TI  - Climatic adaptation and hominid evolution: The thermoregulatory imperative
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
SP  - 53-60
AB  - Anthropologists have long recognized the existence among modern humans of geographical variations in body form that parallel climatic gradients, part of more general zoological phenomena commonly referred to as Bergmann's or Allen's “Rules”. These observations have rarely been applied to earlier hominids, in part because fossil skeletons usually are so incomplete that it is difficult to reconstruct body morphology accurately. However, within the past two decades two early hominids have been discovered that preserve enough of the skeleton to allow confident assessment of their body size and shape. Comparison of these specimens—the Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288‐1 (“Lucy”) and the Homo erectus KNM‐WT 15000—with others that are less complete make it evident that the evolution of Homo erectus was accompanied by not only a marked increase in body size, but also a similarly dramatic increase in the linearity of body form. That is, relative to their heights, small australopithecines had very broad bodies, whereas large early Homo had narrow bodies. This difference in body form cannot be explained on the basis of obstetric or biomechanical factors, but is consistent with thermoregulatory constraints on body shape. Specifically, to maintain the same ratio of body surface area to body mass, which is an important thermoregulatory mechanism, increases in height should be accompanied by no change in body breadth, which is exactly what is seen in comparisons of A.L. 288‐1 and KNM‐WT 15000. Conversely, Neandertals living in colder climates had much wider bodies, which are adaptive for heat retention. Differences in limb length proportions between fossil hominids are also consistent with thermoregulatory principles and the geographic variation observed among modern humans. Climatic adaptation during hominid evolution may have wide‐ranging implications, not only with regard to interpreting body morphology, but also in relation to ecological scenarios, population movements, and the evolution of the brain.

TI  - Chemostats Used for Studying Natural Selection and Adaptive Evolution
VL  - 224
SP  - 613
AB  - Chemostats are open systems in which nutrients are continually added at a constant rate and spent medium plus cells removed at the same rate, such that a constant volume is maintained. Thus, they are designed to provide a constant, homogeneous environment in which the cells grow at a constant rate. Chemostats are used in two ways to study evolution. The first approach attempts to characterize natural selection in terms of how selection coefficients change as either the genetics or the environment is changed. Two strains are mixed and the initial selective difference between the strains is measured over the first 50 generations. The second approach follows the course of adaptive evolution of a population in a particular environment. A single initial strain is monitored over hundreds to thousands of generations to determine the evolutionary changes. The advantage of the first approach is that the genetic differences are known and the effects of these differences in various environments can be explored. The advantage of the second approach is that the actual evolutionary trajectory of fitness changes is followed. © 1993

TI  - Temperature-related genetic changes in laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura: Evidence against simple climatic-based explanations for latitudinal clines
VL  - 165
IS  - 2
SP  - 258-273
AB  - Parallel latitudinal clines to the long-standing ones in the original Palearctic populations have independently evolved at different rates for chromosomal polymorphism and body size in South and North American populations of Drosophila subobscura since colonization around 25 years ago. This strongly suggests that (micro) evolutionary changes are largely predictable, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The putative role of temperature per se was investigated by using three sets of populations at each of three temperatures (13degrees, 18degrees, and 22degreesC) spanning much of the tolerable range for this species. We found a lower chromosomal diversity at the warmest temperature; a quick and consistent shift in gene arrangement frequencies in response to temperature; an evolutionary decrease in wing size, mediated by both cell area and cell number, at 18degreesC; no relationship between wing size and those inversions involved in latitudinal clines; and a shortening of the basal length of longitudinal vein IV relative to its total length with increasing standard dose. The trends for chromosomal polymorphism and body size were generally inconsistent from simple climatic-based explanations of worldwide latitudinal patterns. The findings are discussed in the light of available information on D. subobscura and results from earlier thermal selection experiments with various Drosophila species.

VL  - 57

SP  - 193-221
AB  - The present investigation describes the effect of selection and of outbreeding and inbreeding on expression of the ocelli-less mutant, variable for the number of ocelli and head bristles, in Drosophila subobscura. Directional selection, in both outbred and inbred populations, was effective in increasing the mean number of ocelli and bristles almost to the wild-type score of 11 in the upward direction, and decreasing the score to 2 in the downward direction, after which no progress was made. The upward selected inbred lines responded to selection more rapidly than the outbred line; the heritability in the inbred lines was found to be more than twice that in the outbred families. The distribution of phenotypes in the selected populations suggests that the developmental system is such that scores of more than 11 or less than 2 cannot easily be obtained. This bounded nature of the distribution of the phenotypes explains many of the results obtained: in particular, both the variance of the score and the sex difference in score were greatest in populations whose mean score was at the centre of the range, the genetic variance of the score being additive at the centre of the range and epistatic near the bounds. An attempt was made to pass the upper limit of the score of 11 by selecting at a higher temperature; this attempt was unsuccessful because it was found that progress was opposed by natural selection. Repeated bristles, extra ocelli and notches in the head were observed in the selected lines; they are interpreted as the extreme responses to selection due to pleiotropic gene effects. The fitness, as measured by productivity and rate of development in competition with a marker stock, was lower in the inbred than in the outbred populations. The reciprocally selected inbred lines were fitter than the directionally selected lines; there was no corresponding difference in fitness between the various outbred lines. © 1960 Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - The nesting ecology of the Allen Cays rock iguana, Cyclura cychlura inornata in the Bahamas
VL  - 18
SP  - 1-36
AB  - The nesting ecology of the Allen Cays rock iguana was studied on Leaf Cay and Southwest Allen's Cay (= U Cay) in the northern Exuma Islands, Bahamas, during 2001 and 2002. Mating occured in mid-May, and females migrated 30-173 m to potential nest sites in mid to late June. Females often abandoned initial attempts at digging nest burrows, and average time from initiation of the final burrow to completion of a covered nest was six days. At least some females completely buried themselves within the burrow during the final stages of burrow construction and oviposition. Females defended the burrow site during the entire time of construction, and most continued that defense for at least three to four weeks after nest completion. Nests were completed between mid-June and mid-July, but for unknown reasons timing was seven days earlier on U Cay than on Leaf Cay. Nest burrows averaged 149 cur in length and terminal nest chambers usually angled off the main burrow. Depth to the bottom of the egg chamber averaged 28 cm, and was inversely correlated with shadiness of the site, suggesting that females may select depths with preferred temperatures (mean, 31.4 C in this study). Overall, only about one in three females nested each year, although nesting frequency increased with female size such that the largest females usually nest annually. Nest fidelity was common, despite the potential for observer effects; seven of 13 two-year nesters placed nests within 0.7 m of that constructed the previous year. Nesting females averaged 32 cm snout-vent length (SVL) and 1.336 g body mass, and larger, older females nested earlier than smaller, younger ones. Sexual maturity is reached at 26-27 cm SVL, about 750 g body mass, and twelve years of age (nearly twice as old as any previously studied lizard). Longevity of females apparently exceeds 40 years. Clutch size ranged from 1-10 eggs (mean 4.6) and was correlated with female body size and age. Eggs averaged 66 mm in length, 35 mm in width, and 49 g in mass, Egg mass was not correlated with female body size, although egg length was negatively correlated, and egg width was positively correlated with female size. The production of elongate eggs in the smaller females allowed them to invest the same total mass in each egg as a larger female, while being constrained by the limits of the pelvic opening. No trade-off existed between standardized clutch size versus egg size. Relative clutch mass (clutch mass/gravid female body mass X 100) averaged 16.5 and did not vary with female size or age. Hatching apparently occurs in late September and early October after about 80-85 days incubation, with emergence within just a few days. Hatchlings averaged 9.5 cm SVL and 33 g body mass. Survivorship, to emergence was 78.9%, and was inversely correlated with soil moisture. The reproductive ecology of other iguanids (sensu strictu) is reviewed for comparison with that of the Allen Cays rock iguana. Comparisons of these data with those available for other rock iguanas of the genus Cyclura suggest that colonization of smaller islands has produced reductions in adult female body size, clutch size, clutch mass, and relative clutch mass, but no change in egg or hatchling mass. Because this pattern is also demonstrated by a population of Cuban iguanas introduced to a small island only 40 years ago, it may primarily be a proximal response to decreased resource availability and/or physiological processability on small islands rather than an evolved response to reduced predation rates or other factors affecting survivorship.

SP  - 55-61
AB  - The composition of tissue and membrane fatty acids in ectothermic vertebrates is influenced by both temperature acclimation and diets. If such change in body lipid composition and thermal physiology were linked, a diet-induced change in body lipid composition should result in a change in thermal physiology. We therefore investigated whether the selected body temperature of the agamid lizard Amphibolurus nuchalis (body mass 20 g) is influenced by the lipid composition of dietary fatty acids and whether diet-induced changes in thermal physiology are correlated with changes in body lipid composition. The selected body temperature in two groups of lizards was indistinguishable before dietary treatments. The selected body temperature in lizards after 3 weeks on a diet rich in saturated fatty acids rose by 2.1 °C (photophase) and 3.3 °C (scotophase), whereas the body temperature of lizards on a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids fell by 1.5 °C (photophase) and 2.0 °C (scotophase). Significant diet-induced differences were observed in the fatty acid composition of depot fat, liver and muscle. These observations suggest that dietary lipids may influence selection of body temperature in ectotherms via alterations of body lipid composition. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Evidence for a robust sex-specific trade-off between cold resistance and starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 804-810
AB  - In insects changes in lipid metabolism may underlie a trade-off between cold resistance and starvation resistance. To test this we examined correlated responses in independent sets of Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased cold resistance and increased starvation resistance. The starvation lines showed correlated patterns found in other D. melanogaster populations selected for this trait, including higher lipid levels and increased resistance to desiccation, although the selected lines did not show a longer development time as found in some other studies. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, selected lines with increased starvation resistance showed decreased resistance to a cold stress as measured by mortality, whereas selected lines with increased cold resistance showed a decrease in starvation resistance. To counter the possibility of inadvertent selection accounting for these patterns, selected and control lines from both selection regimes were crossed to form mass bred populations, which were left for four generations prior to establishing isofemale lines. By scoring starvation and cold resistance in these lines derived from both sets of selection regimes, we confirmed the negative association between resistance to these stresses in females but not in males. Potential implications of this trade-off for surviving cold conditions when food resources are limiting are discussed. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Direct and correlated effects of selection on flight after exposure to thermal stress in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 128
IS  - 1
SP  - 217-225
AB  - To demonstrate how insects may adapt to ecologically relevant levels of heat stress, we performed artificial selection on the ability of Drosophila melanogaster to fly after an exposure to a high but non-lethal thermal stress. Both tolerance and intolerance to heat stress arose very quickly, as only a few generations of selection were necessary to cause significant separation between high and low lines for heat tolerance. Estimates of heritability based on the lines artificially selected for increased flight ability ranged from 0.024 to 0.052, while estimates of heritability based on the lines selected for the inability to fly after heat stress varied between 0.035 and 0.091. Reciprocal F1 crosses among these lines revealed strong additive effects of one or more autosomes and a weaker X-chromosome effect. This variation apparently affected flight specifically; neither survival to a more extreme stress nor knockdown by high temperature changed between lines selected for high and low heat tolerance as measured by flight ability. As the well-studied heat-shock response is associated with heat tolerance as measured by survival and knockdown, the aspects of the stress physiology that actually affect flight ability remains unknown. © 2006 Springer.

TI  - ON MODELING THE THERMAL EVOLUTION OF THE OCEANIC UPPER-MANTLE - AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COOLING PLATE MODEL
VL  - 99
SP  - 3201-3214
AB  - The plate cooling model for the thermal evolution of the oceanic upper mantle has been widely accepted to explain observed variations of depth to oceanic basement and conductive heat flow with the age of the seafloor. Several estimates of ''best fitting'' plate model parameters, derived from depth, heat flow, and age data, have been proposed, but the viability of the plate model itself has not been rigorously evaluated. We have used published mean depths and depths to basement at Deep Sea Drilling Project/Ocean Drilling Program (DSDP/ODP) drilling sites to test the cooling model based on two criteria: First, viable plate models must have coefficients that are consistent with the slope of the corresponding root t line because the half-space (or root t) subsidence of young seafloor is implicit in the plate model (i.e., the slope of the root t line can be calculated directly from the coefficients of the plate subsidence model). Second, any viable physical model must fit the data with an acceptable degree of systematic misfit; large systematic misfits indicate that the model cannot explain the observations. Fits of half-space (root t) models to depth versus age data for young (< approximately 80 Ma) seafloor indicate basal temperatures in the range 1300 to 1370-degrees-C. Based on the age at which the depths deviate from the root t line, the minimum plate thickness that is compatible with the best fitting half-space models for young seafloor is 120 km. In contrast, all best fitting plate models yield systematically higher temperatures (1450 to 1470-degrees-C) and thinner plates (102-118 km). The plate model can explain the depth to basement at DSDP/ODP drill sites with a satisfactory degree of systematic misfit, but we find that there is no plate cooling model that can explain the variation of the mean depths (derived from the DBDB5 database) with age over the entire range of ages (0 to 165 Ma). Models that ''best fit'' the entire data set have unacceptably large systematic misfits over the entire range of seafloor age, whereas models that minimize the systematic misfit for young seafloor (0 to 81 Ma) fail for older seafloor. The plate model clearly fails to explain the observations. The cooling history of old seafloor is not simply an extension of the cooling history of young seafloor according to a simple plate cooling model. Previous studies have suggested, as an alterative to the plate model, that observed variations of basement depth with age are best explained by the combined effects of a ''normal' half-space cooling process and the dynamic and/or thermal effects of hot spots or mantle plumes. Our results are entirely consistent with the half-space cooling model, and we find that the best reference model for ''normal'' subsidence is d(t) = (2600 +/- 20) m + (345 +/- 3) m (m.y.)-1/2 t1/2. We also find that the heat flow predicted by this half-space model is consistent with the most reliable average heat flow values from the Pacific.

TI  - Thermal games: Frequency-dependent models of thermal adaptation
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
SP  - 510-520
AB  - Most models of thermal adaptation ignore biotic interactions, and those that do consider biotic interactions assume that competitors or predators cannot respond to adaptation by the focal species. Nevertheless, real biotic interactions involve responsive entities, which can be more accurately modelled using evolutionary game theory. We present a two-part analysis of a thermal game between prey and predators. First, we model a game in which prey choose patches on the basis of operative temperature and predation risk, whereas predators choose patches on the basis of prey density. Second, we consider how this thermal game influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology. The solution of the thermal game is an evolutionarily stable Nash equilibrium in which prey divide their time equally among a range of thermal patches while predators bias their hunting efforts toward warmer patches, even though they derive no thermoregulatory benefit from doing so. Furthermore, the optimal range of temperatures selected by prey and predators increases as the lethality of predators increases. This thermal game potentially influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology. When predators are less lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a narrower range of temperatures, resulting in selection for thermal specialization of physiological performance. But when predators are very lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a broad range of temperatures; in this case, prey pay no fitness cost for being thermal generalists. Evolutionary game theory provides a powerful tool for generating hypotheses about the effects of biotic interactions on evolution in heterogeneous environments. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Among eight populations of grayling Thymallus thymallus that shared common ancestors 8-28 generations earlier, mean egg mortality ranged between 1·2 and 59·8%; mortality during yolk sac absorption was low (0·0-8·0%) and mean survival to swim-up was high (90-97%), with two exceptions (20% and 50%). Survival probabilities differed significantly among populations, even after statistically adjusting for size at swim-up and water depth, water velocity, gravel size and temperature. Development time from fertilization to first observed swim-up was significantly different among populations, ranging between 27 to 40 days, or 264 to 280 degree-days. Mean specific growth rates during the first external feeding period varied between 1·2 and 2·0% day-1 among populations. Population-specific growth rates were independent of temperature. Rates of divergence were of the same order as in other salmonid studies showing rapid evolution. The phenotypic differences may be due partly to genetic differentiation among the populations.

VL  - 88

SP  - 453-463
AB  - We maintained pregnant Sphenomorphus indicus under four thermal conditions for the whole gestation period to assess the effects of gestation temperature on offspring phenotypes. Parturition occurred between late June and early August, with females at high body temperatures giving birth earlier than those maintained at low body temperatures. Litter size, litter mass, and postpartum body mass did not differ among treatments, and females with relatively higher fecundity produced smaller offspring. Females gave birth to predominantly female offspring (85.7% of the 14 sexed offspring were females) at 24 degrees C and to predominantly male offspring (76.5% of the 17 sexed offspring were males) at 28 degrees C. Females with the opportunity to regulate body temperature produced a mix of sexes that did not differ from equality. Offspring produced in different treatments differed in head size, hind-limb length, and tympanum length, but not in snout-vent length, tail length, body mass, fore-limb length, and eye length. Offspring produced at 28 degrees C were not only smaller in head size, but also shorter in hind-limb length and tympanum length than those offspring produced at lower temperatures. Offspring produced at 28 degrees C performed more poorly in the racetrack and grew more slowly than offspring produced in the other three treatments. Taken together, our results show that S. indicus might be a temperature-dependent sex determination species and that offspring phenotypes are impaired at high gestation temperatures but maximized at relatively low gestation temperatures.

TI  - Rapid evolution of muscle fibre number in post-glacial populations of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus
VL  - 207
IS  - 25
SP  - 4343-4360
AB  - Thingvallavatn, the largest and one of the oldest lakes in Iceland, contains four morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus. Dwarf benthic (DB), large benthic (LB), planktivorous (PL) and piscivorous (PI) morphs can be distinguished and differ markedly in head morphology, colouration and maximum fork length (FLmax,), reflecting their different resource specialisations within the lake. The four morphs in Thingvallavatn are thought to have been isolated for approximately 10 000 years, since shortly after the end of the last Ice Age. We tested the null hypothesis that the pattern of muscle fibre recruitment was the same in all morphs, reflecting their recent diversification. The cross-sectional areas of fast and slow muscle fibres were measured at 0.7 FL in 46 DB morphs, 23 LB morphs, 24 PL morphs and 22 PI morphs, and the ages of the charr were estimated using sacculus otoliths. In fish larger than 10 g, the maximum fibre diameter scaled with body mass (M-b)(0.18) for both fibre types in all morphs. The number of myonuclei per cm fibre length increased with fibre diameter, but was similar between morphs. On average, at 60 pm diameter, there were 2264 nuclei cm(-1) in slow fibres and 1126 nuclei cm(-1) in fast fibres. The absence of fibres of diameter 4-10 mum was used to determine the FL at which muscle fibre recruitment stopped. Slow fibre number increased with body length in all morphs, scaling with b. In contrast, the recruitment of fast muscle fibres continued until a clearly identifiable FL, corresponding to 18-19 cm in the dwarf morph, 24-26 cm in the pelagic morph, 32-33 cm in the large benthic morph and 34-35 cm in the piscivorous morph. The maximum fast fibre number (FNmax) in the dwarf morph (6.97X 10(4)) was 56.5 % of-that found in the LB and PI morphs combined (1.23X10(5)) (P<0.001). Muscle fibre recruitment continued until a threshold body size and occurred at a range of ages, starting at 4+ years in the DB morph and 7+ years in the LB and PI morphs. Our null hypothesis was therefore rejected for fast muscle and it was concluded that the dwarf condition was associated with a reduction in fibre number. We then investigated whether variations in development temperature associated with different spawning sites and periods were responsible for the observed differences in muscle cellularity between morphs. Embryos from the DB. LB and PL morphs were incubated at temperature regimes simulating cold subterranean spring-fed sites (2.2-3.2degreesC) and the general lakebed (4-7degreesC). Myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) were identified using specific antibodies to Paired box protein 7 (Pax 7), Forkhead box protein K1-alpha (FoxK1-alpha), MyoD and Myf-5. The progeny showed no evidence of developmental plasticity in the numbers of either MPCs or muscle fibres. Juveniles and adult stages of the DB and LB morphs coexist and have a similar diet. We therefore conclude that the reduction in FNmax, in the dwarf morph probably has a genetic basis and that gene networks regulating myotube production are under high selection pressure. To explain these findings we propose that there is an optimal fibre size. and hence number, which varies with maximum body size and reflects a trade-off between diffusional constraints on fibre diameter and the energy costs of maintaining ionic gradients. The predictions of the optimal fibre size hypothesis and its consequences for the adaptive evolution of muscle architecture in fishes are briefly discussed.

VL  - 92
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-43
AB  - The egg parasitoid wasp, Anagrus takeyanus Gordh and Dunbar (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), is one of the few natural enemies of the andromeda lace bug, Stephanitis takeyai Drake and Maa (Heteroptera: Tingidae). Studying this wasp in two habitats, I found that at Kyoto, where the bug alternates its host plants seasonally, most wasp individuals in the overwintering eggs of the bug entered summer diapause immediately after winter diapause. However, at Nara, where the bug does not alternate its host plant, the wasp proved to have no summer diapause. Changes in the parasitization rate between generations differed at the two study sites. In Kyoto, the overwintered generation suffered the highest parasitism among the three generations of the year. In contrast, the first and second generations suffered higher parasitization rates in Nara. This difference in level of parasitization between the two study sites corresponded to the different diapause regime of the wasp and the seasonal population trends of the lace bug. Laboratory experiments showed that short photoperiod in combination with low temperature could terminate the long diapause at the time the non-aestivating individuals terminate winter diapause. As a life cycle without host plant alternation is likely to be an ancestral character of the bug, the aestivation of the wasp is thought to have been appended to overwintering as an adaptation to the evolution of seasonal host plant alternation in the lace bug.

SP  - 567-576
AB  - Preservation of diatoms in sediments of the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean through geologic time has been highly variable. The North Atlantic Ocean and the Nordic Seas were regions of high biosiliceous productivity until the onset of Northern hemisphere glaciations during the late Miocene. Later, fluctuating Pleistocene climatic conditions had a major impact on diatom productivity in the high-latitude North Atlantic. During interglacials high diatom productivity took place in the North Atlantic, whereas glacial stages are often barren of diatoms due to expansion of sea-ice cover. Diatom species show rapid evolution through time and are therefore an excellent biostratigraphic tool in this area. The high diversity of diatoms in polar and arctic environments also make them one of the most important tools available for paleoclimatic studies through reconstructions of sea-ice margins, oceanic fronts, and distribution of water masses. Diatoms have also been used to provide quantitative estimates of past sea-surface temperatures, which have been used to infer Holocene surface ocean conditions in the high-latititude North Atlantic. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Response to selection for rapid chill-coma recovery in Drosophila melanogaster: Physiology and life-history traits
VL  - 85
IS  - 1
SP  - 15-22
AB  - Resistance to low temperatures can vary markedly among invertebrate species and is directly related to their distribution. Despite the ecological importance of cold resistance this trait has rarely been studied genetically, mainly because low and variable fitness of offspring from cold-stressed mothers makes it difficult to undertake selection experiments and compare cold resistance of parents and offspring. One measure of cold resistance that varies geographically in Drosophila melanogaster and that is amenable to genetic analysis is chill-coma recovery. Three replicate lines of D. melanogaster were selected every second generation, for over 30 generations, for decreased recovery time following exposure to 0 °C. Correlated responses were scored to characterize underlying physiological traits and to investigate interactions with other traits. Lines responded rapidly to the intermittent selection regime with realized heritabilities varying from 33% to 46%. Selected lines showed decreased recovery time after exposure to a broad range of low temperatures and also had a lower mortality following a more severe cold shock, indicating that a general mechanism underlying cold resistance had been selected. The selection response was independent of plastic changes in cold resistance because the selected lines maintained their ability to harden (i.e. a short-term exposure to cool temperature resulted in decreased recovery time in subsequent chill-coma assays). Changes in cold resistance were not associated with changes in resistance to high temperature exposure, and selected lines showed no changes in wing size, development time or viability. However, there was a decrease in longevity in the selected lines due to an earlier onset of ageing. These results indicate that chill-coma recovery can be rapidly altered by selection, as long as selection is undertaken every second generation to avoid carry-over effects, and suggest that lower thermal limits can be shifted towards increased cold resistance independently of upper thermal limits and without tradeoffs in many life-history traits. © 2005 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Scan thermal processing, enabled by guidance of the heat source trajectory during fabrication, combines the flexibility of sequential methods to the productivity of parallel processes. For cylindrically symmetric parts, this is performed by their rapid revolution under a radially or axially translated torch. The source power is modulated to implement a specified thermal distribution as it sweeps the product surface, and thus to generate desirable material features. An analytical description of the thermal field, based on superposition of Green's fields, is developed for off-line analysis. Also, a multivariable model with least-squares parameter identification, is introduced for real-time compensation of the process efficiency. This model is embedded to a thermal distribution control scheme, driving the scanned torch motion and power by a simulated annealing optimization strategy. This uses temperature feedback from random surface locations by an infrared pyrometer. The thermal regulator is validated computationally and experimentally, and its applicability to other scanned processes is examined. © 1998 AACC.

VL  - 129

SP  - 58-64
AB  - Introduced species frequently undergo rapid evolutionary change in ecologically important traits that may strongly influence their performance in their introduced range. But for many introduced species, and particularly those in marine systems, the spatial and temporal dimensions of this evolutionary change are largely unknown. In this study, I conducted a common garden transplant experiment using replicate clones of an introduced tunicate, Botrylloides sp., collected from three sites in the southern Gulf of Maine to test for differential growth and survival in response to local thermal regimes. This species has a restricted larval development period, which may permit significant population differentiation over relatively small spatial scales. I found dramatic among-site differences in survival rates: tunicates collected from both the transplant site and from a distant northern site had high survival, while those collected from a southern site experienced 100% mortality. The most likely cause of this differential mortality was an anomalous upwelling event that produced some of the coldest mid-summer temperatures in the last 10 years based on NOAA weather buoy data. I also found significant differences in growth rates among sites as well as among clones within a site in comparison with growth-rate differences within clones. An estimate of broad-sense heritability based on these data was consistent with a genetic basis for among-site differences in growth rates, which were strongly predictive of subsequent mortality. I conclude that this species has undergone significant evolutionary change that has resulted in population differentiation with respect to temperature tolerances among sites separated by < 60 km.

AB  - Two lakes in the lower Siwalik Himalayas, five in the Kashmir valley and two situated in the high mountains of the Kashmir Himalayas were investigated for their physico-chemical and biological features. The lakes, differing significantly in their morphology and in thermal behaviour, rank from the subtropical monomictic to the dimictic type. The lakes at high altitudes (> 3000 m) have very low electric conductivity which increases with the decrease in altitude. The most dominant ions in water are calcium and bicarbonate. The macrophytic vegetation of the lakes does not show any definite relationship either with altitude or with physico-chemical milieu. In the lakes with low fertility the phytoplankton is dominated by diatoms and Chlorophyceae but in eutrophic lakes Cyanophyceae predominate. The zooplankton population of the lakes is mainly comprised of rotifera. On the basis of general limnological features and the rates of phytoplankton production most of the lakes may be categorized either as eutrophic or in the process of rapid evolution. Only one lake is oligotrophic. © 1980 Dr. W. Junk b.v. Publishers.

TI  - Latitudinal variation of wing : thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 52
IS  - 5
SP  - 1353-1362
AB  - In dipterans, the wing-beat frequency, and, hence, the lift generated, increases linearly with ambient temperature. If flight performance is an important target of natural selection, higher wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio should be favored at low temperatures because they increase the lift for a given body weight. We investigated this hypothesis by examining wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio in Drosophila melanogaster collected from wild populations along a latitudinal gradient and in their descendants reared under standard laboratory conditions. In a subset of lines, we also studied the phenotypic plasticity of these traits in response to temperature. To examine whether the latitudinal trends in wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio could have resulted from a correlated response to latitudinal selection on wing area, we investigated the correlated responses of these characters in lines artificially selected for wing area. In both the geographic and the artificially selected lines, wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio decreased m response to increasing temperature during development. Phenotypic plasticity for either trait did not vary among latitudinal lines or selective regimes. Wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio increased significantly with latitude in field-collected flies. The cline in wing:thorax size ratio had a genetic component, but the cline in wing-aspect ratio did not. Artificial selection for increased wing area led to a statistically insignificant correlated increase in wing-thorax size ratio and a decrease m wing-aspect ratio. Our observations are consistent with the hypotheses that high wing-thorax size ratio and wing aspect ratio are per se selectively advantageous at low temperatures.

VL  - 80
IS  - 1
SP  - 67-72
AB  - Tilapias are one of the most important species in commercial aquaculture world wide. As mixed-sex tilapia stocks are mainly farmed in extensive systems their high fecundity and reproduction rate results in overcrowding of ponds. Therefore all-male stocks are highly desirable. Previous investigations in this species showed a strong influence of temperature on sex determination with an suspected underlying genetic basis. Thus, losses in productivity due to stunting of mixed sex Nile Tilapia stocks could be alleviated by production of temperature sensitive lines to sustainably increase the proportion of males by temperature treatment (36°C/10 days). Starting with 36 families of Oreochromis niloticus from Lake Manzala (Egypt) as base population a two generation selection experiment was conducted to develop high and low temperature sensitive lines. The percentage of males in treatment groups was the selection criteria and the families showing the largest or lowest surplus in their sex ratios were selected. The results clearly indicated that selection for sex ratio in temperature treated groups is possible. In the second generation of selection a male percentage of 89.7% was obtained in the high line. Downwards selection resulted in a decrease of the male percentage from 65.2 %.to 54% in the second generation of selection. No correlated response to selection was observed in the sex ratios of control groups. The results showed that selection for temperature dependent sex ratios is a feasible approach. Thus, it seems to be possible to increase the male proportion in Nile tilapia by means of selection for temperature dependent sex determination. © Eugen Ulmer KG.

TI  - Thermal effects on the energetics of lizard embryos: Implications for hatchling phenotypes
VL  - 81
IS  - 11
SP  - 2957-2968
AB  - In many ectotherms, incubation temperature has profound effects on the timing of hatching and size of hatchlings, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. We studied the energetics of embryonic development and growth in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Eggs were incubated at six constant temperatures, ranging from 28 degrees to 38 degreesC, and embryonic metabolism, incubation period,and body size at hatching were determined. The duration of embryonic development decreased significantly from 55 d at 28 degrees to 40 d at 32 degreesC but did not differ significantly between 32 degrees and 34 degreesC. Embryos incubated at temperatures above 34 degreesC did not survive to hatching. Metabolic rate at specific stages of development (percentage of total incubation period) did not differ among embryos incubated at 28 degrees, 30 degrees, and 34 degreesC. As a result, the total amount of energy expended during the incubation period at 28 degreesC (2.0 kJ) was greater than that at 30 degrees -34 degreesC (1.7-1.8 kJ). However, the difference in energy expenditure did not affect body size at hatching; neither snout-vent length nor body mass varied significantly with incubation temperature, and both were the same as those of hatchlings collected in the field. Thus, there was no apparent , trade-off between hatching date and body size of lizards at hatching. In a natural population in New Jersey, USA, we quantified soil temperatures at potential nesting sites and studied the thermoregulatory, behavior of gravid females to examine the possible consequences of female behaviour for hatching phenotypes. In females and at potential nest sites, embryos would experience temperatures that resulted in high mortality in the laboratory experiment (>32 degreesC). Gravid females had a field body temperature of 33.9 degreesC (95% CI = 0.8 degreesC) and selected a body temperature of 33.3 degreesC (95% CI = 1.9 degreesC) when placed in thermal gradients in the laboratory. Soil temperatures rose above 32 degreesC for several hours each day. Embryos must be able to survive intermittent exposure to temperatures that were lethal under conditions of chronic exposure in the laboratory. Selection of relatively high body temperatures by gravid females, coupled with tolerance of acute exposure to relatively high soil temperatures, would reduce the incubation period without a concomitant reduction in body size at hatching.

AB  - Evidence for temperature adaptation in Daphnia magna was inferred from variation in the shape of temperature reaction norms for somatic growth rate, a fitness-related trait. Ex-ephippial clones from eight populations across Europe were grown under standardized conditions after preacclimation at five temperatures (17-29 degrees C). Significant variation for grand mean growth rates occurred both within populations (among clones) and between populations. Genetic variation for reaction norm shape was found within populations, with temperature-dependent trade-offs in clone relative fitness. However, the population average responses to temperature were similar, following approximately parallel reaction norms. The among-population variation is not evidence for temperature adaptation. Lack of temperature adaptation at the population level may be a feature of intermittent populations where environmentally terminated diapause can entrain the planktonic stage of the life-history within a similar range of temperatures.

VL  - 20

SP  - 534-540
AB  - Environmental conditions fostering marine communities around Antarctica differ fundamentally from those in the rest of the world's oceans, particularly in terms of pronounced climatic fluctuations and extreme cold. Here, we argue that the rarity of pelagic larval stages in Antarctic marine benthic invertebrate species is a consequence of evolutionary temperature adaptation and that this has greatly contributed to the current structure of the Antarctic benthic community. In arguing this position, we challenge the likelihood of previously suggested survival strategies of benthic communities on the Antarctic continental shelf and slope during Cenozoic glacial periods. By integrating evidence from marine geology and geophysics, we suggest that the Antarctic continental shelf and slope were both unfavourable environments for benthic communities during glacial periods and that community survival was only possible in the deep sea or in shelters on the continental shelf as a result of the diachronism in maximum ice extent. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 309

SP  - 435-446
AB  - I evaluated the effect of incubation temperature on phenotypes of the veiled chameleon, Chamaeleo calyptratus. I chose this species for study because its large clutch size (30-40 eggs or more) allows replication within clutches both within and among experimental treatments. The major research objectives were (1) to assess the effect of constant low, moderate, and high temperatures on embryonic development, (2) to determine whether the best incubation temperature for embryonic development also produced the "best" hatchlings, and (3) to determine how a change in incubation temperature during mid-development would affect phenotype. To meet these objectives, I established five experimental temperature regimes and determined egg survival and incubation length and measured body size and shape, selected body temperatures, and locomotory performance of lizards at regular intervals from hatching to 90 d, or just before sexual Maturity. Incubation temperature affected the length of incubation, egg survival, and body mass, but did not affect sprint speed or selected body temperature although selected body temperature affected growth in mass independently of treatment and clutch. Incubation at moderate temperatures provided the best conditions for both embryonic and post-hatching development. The highest incubation temperatures were disruptive to development; eggs had high mortality, developmental rate was low, and hatchlings grew slowly. Changes in temperature during incubation increased the among-clutch variance in incubation length relative to that of constant temperature treatments. J. Exp. Zool. 309A.-43.5-446, 2008.

TI  - Correlated responses to selection for stress resistance and longevity in a laboratory population of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 789-803
AB  - Laboratory studies on Drosophila have revealed that resistance to one environmental stress often correlates with resistance to other stresses. There is also evidence on genetic correlations between stress resistance, longevity and other fitness-related traits. The present work investigates these associations using artificial selection in Drosophila melanogaster. Adult flies were selected for increased survival after severe cold, heat, desiccation and starvation stresses as well as increased heat-knockdown time and lifespan (CS, HS, DS, SS, KS and LS line sets, respectively). The number of selection generations was 11 for LS, 27 for SS and 21 for other lines, with selection intensity being around 0.80. For each set of lines, the five stress-resistance parameters mentioned above as well as longevity (in a nonstressful environment) were estimated. In addition, preadult developmental time, early age productivity and thorax length were examined in all lines reared under nonstressful conditions. Comparing the selection lines with unselected control revealed clear-cut direct selection responses for the stress-resistance traits. Starvation resistance increased as correlated response in all sets of selection lines, with the exception of HS. Positive correlated responses were also found for survival after cold shock (HS and DS) and heat shock (KS and DS). With regard to values of resistance across different stress assays, the HS and KS lines were most similar. The resistance values of the SS lines were close to those of the LS lines and tended to be the lowest among all selection lines. Developmental time was extended in the SS and KS lines, whereas the LS lines showed a reduction in thorax length. The results indicate a possibility of different multiple-stress-resistance mechanisms for the examined traits and fitness costs associated with stress resistance and longevity. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - How did human intelligence evolve to be so high? Lynn [Lynn, R. (199 1). The evolution of race differences in intelligence. Mankind Quarterly, 32, 99-173] and Rushton [Rushton, J.P. (1995). Race, evolution, and behavior: A life history perspective. New Brunswick: Transaction] suggest that the main forces behind the evolution of human intelligence were the cold climate and harsh winters, which selected out individuals of lower intelligence. In contrast, Kanazawa [Kanazawa, S. (2004). General intelligence as a domain-specific adaptation. Psychological Review, 111, 512-523] contends that it is the evolutionary novelty of the environment which increased general intelligence. Multiple regression analyses support both theories. Annual mean temperature and evolutionary novelty (measured by latitude, longitude, and distance from the ancestral environment) simultaneously have independent effects on average intelligence of populations. Temperature and evolutionary novelty together explain half to two-thirds of variance in national IQ. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 180

SP  - 237-246
AB  - The aim was to assess whether selection for increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is associated with increased feed intake and/or better feed utilization. Growth responses of offspring from selected and wild lines of Atlantic salmon (initial weight 814 +/- 14 g and 533 +/- 12 g, respectively) were tested in a 14-week experiment. Selected and wild salmon increased body weight by 79 and 39%, respectively, during the experiment. Relative feed intake (DFI), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) were significantly higher in the selected (DFI: 0.67% BW d(-1), TGC: 2.96 x 10(-3) and FER: 1.16), than in the wild, line (DFI: 0.48% BW d(-1), TGC: 1.39 x 10(-3) and FER: 0.93). FER was positively correlated with mean growth rate (r = 0.90, n = 6, P < 0.05), and differences between the lines indicated a 4.6% increase in FER per generation of selection. Fish of the selected line had a significantly lower intake of protein and energy per kilogram gain, so the higher growth rate of the selected line was the result of both greater feed consumption and more efficient feed utilization for growth. This implies that selection for increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon may improve both of these traits. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Four lines of quail; random-selected, male-selected, female-selected and male- and female-selected lines, were subjected to 37 + 1.6 °C from 3 to 5 weeks of age while another four lines, similarly selected, were reared at room temperature (15 to 27 °C). 2. Selection for increased growth was practised for two generations using ten females and five males as parents in each line. 3. A significant interaction between time and temperature was observed in the third generation progeny; when exposed to heat stress, the stress-adapted lines showing a superior growth rate. 4. A sex x temperature interaction was also observed and was due largely to the control females being more sensitive to stress than the males. 5. A cumulative realised heritability estimate of 0·47 + 0·15 for 5-week body weight was obtained. © 1975, American Industrial Hygiene Association. All rights reserved.

We heat (or cool) insects in a temperature-controlled column and measure the temperature at which they are knocked down. 2. An artificial selection experiment on heat resistance demonstrates that knock-down temperatures respond rapidly to selection. After only four generations of selection, the experimental and control lines differed significantly in both knock-down temperature and physiological heat tolerance, as measured by per cent survival of a heat shock. 3. Potential applications (acclimation, ageing, selection) and technical problems (body size, humidity, statistical considerations) are evaluated.

AB  - Most ectothermal animals have variable body temperatures. Because physiological rates are temperature sensitive, an ectotherm's behavioural and ecological performance - even its fitness - can be influenced by body temperature. As a result, the thermal sensitivity of ectotherm performance is relevant to diverse issues in physiology, ecology and evolution. This review formalizes an emerging framework for investigating the evolution of thermal sensitivity, outlines some functional and genetical constraints on that evolution, and summarizes comparative and experimental advances in this field. © 1989.

VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SP  - 87-103
AB  - Most life history traits are positively influenced by body size, whereas disadvantages of large body size are poorly documented. To investigate presumed intrinsic costs of large size in the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae), we established two replicates each of three body size laboratory selection lines (small, control and large; selection on males only), and subjected flies of the resulting extended body size range to various abiotic stresses. Response to selection was symmetrical in the small and large lines (realized h2 = 0.16-0.18). After 24 generations of selection body size had changed by roughly 10%. Female size showed a correlated response to selection on male size, whereas sexual size dimorphism did not change. Development time also showed a correlated response as, similar to food limited flies, small line flies emerged earlier at smaller body size. At the lowest larval food limit possible, flies of all lines emerged at the same small body size after roughly the same development time; so overall phenotypic plasticity in body size and development time strongly increased following selection. Juvenile mortality increased markedly when food was extremely limited, large line flies showing highest mortality. Winter frost disproportionately killed large (line) flies because of their longer development times. Mortality at high temperatures was high but size-selective effects were inconsistent. In all environments the larger males suffered more. Initial growth rate was higher for males and at unlimited food. Small line individuals of both sexes grew slowest at unlimited larval food but fastest at limited larval food, suggesting a physiological cost of fast growth. Overall, extension of the natural body size range by artificial selection revealed some otherwise cryptic intrinsic juvenile viability costs of large size, mediated by longer development or faster growth, but only in stressful environments. © 2007 The Authors.

TI  - An adaptive mutation in adenylate kinase that increases organismal fitness is linked to stability-activity trade-offs
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
SP  - 19-27
AB  - Protein function is a balance between activity and stability. However, the relevance of stability-activity trade-offs for protein evolution and their impact on organismal fitness have been difficult to determine. Previously, we have linked organismal survival at increasing temperatures to adaptive changes to a single protein sequence through allelic replacement of an essential gene, adenylate kinase (adk), in a thermophile. In vivo continuous evolution of the temperature-sensitive thermophile has shown that the first step toward increased organismal fitness is mutation of glutamine-199 to arginine in the mesophilic enzyme (AKsub Q199R). Here, we show that although substitution of Arg-199 did confer a modest increase in stability (0.6 kcal mol-1at 20°C; ΔTm = 3.0°C), it is a large change in the activity profile of the enzyme that is responsible for its exceptional robustness during the earlier experimental evolution study. Kinetic studies of AKsub Q199R show that it has a strong loss of enzymatic activity (&gt;50%) at lower temperatures (20-45°C) and a subsequent increase at elevated temperatures. The stability-activity trade-off observed for AKsub Q199R was linked to the rigidification of the overall structure through stabilization of a polypeptide loop containing Arg-199 that is part of the ATP-binding site of the enzyme. Structural analysis revealed the formation of new ionic interactions facilitated by Arg-199. Our results suggest that stability-activity trade-offs are employed readily as an evolutionary strategy during natural selection to increase organismal fitness. © The Author 2007.

TI  - Temperature dependent larval resource allocation shaping adult body size in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
SP  - 1159-1167
AB  - Geographical variation in Drosophila melanogaster body size is a long-standing problem of life-history evolution. Adaptation to a cold climate invariably produces large individuals, whereas evolution in tropical regions result in small individuals. The proximate mechanism was suggested to involve thermal evolution of resource processing by the developing larvae. In this study an attempt is made to merge proximate explanations, featuring temperature sensitivity of larval resource processing, and ultimate approaches focusing on adult and pre-adult life-history traits. To address the issue of temperature dependent resource allocation to adult size vs. larval survival, feeding was stopped at several stages during the larval development. Under these conditions of food deprivation, two temperate and two tropical populations reared at high and low temperatures produced different adult body sizes coinciding with different probabilities to reach the adult stage. In all cases a phenotypic trade-off between larval survival and adult size was observed. However, the underlying pattern of larval resource allocation differed between the geographical populations. In the temperate populations larval age but not weight predicted survival. Temperate larvae did not invest accumulated resources in survival, instead they preserved larval biomass to benefit adult weight. In other words, larvae from temperate populations failed to re-allocate accumulated resources to facilitate their survival. A low percentage of the larvae survived to adulthood but produced relatively large flies. Conversely, in tropical populations larval weight but not age determined the probability to reach adulthood. Tropical larvae did not invest in adult size, but facilitated their own survival. Most larvae succeeded in pupating but then produced small adults. The underlying physiological mechanism seemed to be an evolved difference in the accessibility of glycogen reserves as a result of thermal adaptation. At low rearing temperatures and in the temperate populations, glycogen levels tended to correlate positively with adult size but negatively with pupation probability. The data presented here offer an explanation of geographical variation in body size by showing that thermal evolution of resource allocation, specifically the ability to access glycogen storage, is the proximate mechanism responsible for the life-history trade-off between larval survival and adult size.

TI  - Survival of impact-induced thermal anomalies in the Martian mantle
VL  - 107
SP  - 12-1 - 12-12
AB  - A number of geophysical arguments point out the possibility that global mantle convection could have been extremely sluggish or even absent during a large part of Martian history. This implies that early mantle thermal anomalies produced during planetary formation might not have been quickly erased by vigorous convection. One likely mechanism of early thermal inhomogeneity is large impacts at the end of heavy bombardment. We suggest that Tharsis province might be related to such an impact-induced thermal anomaly rather than a convective plume. The shape of the present-day geoid for our preferred model is in good agreement with the geoid measured by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

VL  - 276
IS  - 1673
SP  - 3581-3589
AB  - Ectotherms have evolved preferences for particular body temperatures, but the nutritional and life-history consequences of such temperature preferences are not well understood. We measured thermal preferences in Locusta migratoria (migratory locusts) and used a multi-factorial experimental design to investigate relationships between growth/development and macronutrient utilization (conversion of ingesta to body mass) as a function of temperature. A range of macronutrient intake values for insects at 26, 32 and 38°C was achieved by offering individuals high-protein diets, high-carbohydrate diets or a choice between both. Locusts placed in a thermal gradient selected temperatures near 38°C, maximizing rates of weight gain; however, this enhanced growth rate came at the cost of poor protein and carbohydrate utilization. Protein and carbohydrate were equally digested across temperature treatments, but once digested both macronutrients were converted to growth most efficiently at the intermediate temperature (32°8C). Body temperature preference thus yielded maximal growth rates at the expense of efficient nutrient utilization. © 2009 The Royal Society.

AB  - In temperate regions low temperatures seem to be the most restrictive factor for survival of Drosophila natural populations, which depends on the capacity of one or more developmental stages to resist unfavourable winter conditions. In this study we have attempted to answer the question of how D. melanogaster overwinters under natural temperature conditions. Only adults overwintered and no diapause was observed in any developmental stage. Thus, developmental duration becomes a decisive component with respect to overwintering potential and, therefore, the preadult stages are unlikely to overwinter. Possible evolutionary steps in adaptation to cold regions are discussed. 1991 The Netherlands Entomological Society

TI  - Acclimation and selection for increased resistance to thermal stress in Drosophila buzzatii
VL  - 142
IS  - 2
SP  - 471-479
AB  - Direct selection for increased resistance to a heat shock (41.9 degrees for 90 min) was carried out using two replicate lines of Drosophila buzzatii that were derived from a large base population. Selected individuals were first acclimated to high temperature before selection, while control individuals were acclimated but not selected, and selection was performed every second generation. Resistance to heat shock with acclimation increased in selected lines. Without acclimation, a correlated smaller increase in heat-shock resistance was suggested. Survival of males was higher than that of females in all lines when tested with acclimation, but with direct exposure to high temperatures, survival of females was greater than that of males both in selection and control lines but not in the base population. From analysis of reciprocal cross progeny between lines, one selection line was found to possess a dominant autosomal factor that significantly increased resistance of males much more than resistance of females. Also suggestive was recessive traits on the X chromosome in both selection lines that increased thermotolerance. No cytoplasmic effects were found. After accounting for other effects, survival of F-1 flies was intermediate, suggesting that additive variation is present for one or more of the autosomes.

VL  - 47

AB  - Groups of replicated lines of the bacterium Escherichia coli -ere propagated for 2,000 generations at constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C, or in an environment that alternated between 32 and 42-degrees-C. Here, we examine the performance of each group across a temperature range of 12-44-degrees-C measuring the temperatures over which each line can maintain itself in serial dilution culture (the thermal niche). Thermal niche was not affected by selection history: average lower and upper limits remained about 19 and 42-degrees-C for all groups. In addition, no significant differences among groups were observed in rate of extinction at more extreme temperatures. Within the thermal niche, we measured the mean fitness of the evolved groups relative to their common ancestor. Increases in mean fitness were temperature specific, with the largest increase for each group occurring near its selected temperature. Thus, the temperature at which mean fitness relative to the ancestor was greatest (the thermal optimum) diverged by about 10-degrees-C for the groups selected at constant 32-degrees-C versus constant 42-degrees-C. Tradeoffs in relative fitness (decrements relative to the ancestor elsewhere within the thermal niche) did not necessarily accompany fitness improvements, although tradeoffs were observed for a few of the lines. We conclude that adaptation in this system was quite temperature specific, but substantial divergence among groups in thermal optima had little effect on the limits of their thermal niches and did not necessarily involve tradeoffs in fitness at other temperatures.

VL  - 95

SP  - 697-703
AB  - Evolutionary changes depend on adaptive evolution and two other components that traditionally have not been taken into account: chance and history. However, concepts in evolutionary biology are very often supported by descriptive studies but not by empirical approach. In order to disentangle the three components of evolutionary change, we have investigated the effects of long-term selection pressure on fitness and cell size in the bloom-forming dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum triestinum Schiller, under increased nutrient concentrations and temperature. Two strains of P. triestinum, previously adapted to grow under standard conditions (f/2 medium, 20°C), were grown under increased nutrient concentrations and temperature (f medium, 25°C) until fitness and cell size were invariant as a function of time (720 days, corresponding to c. 400 generations). The mean value for fitness of both strains of P. triestinum showed a significant increase whereas a decrease in mean cell size was found. The changes in fitness have adaptive value, but the changes in cell size were due to both adaptation and the contribution of chance-plus-history. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Effect of the operating conditions of air-mist nozzles on the thermal evolution of continuosly cast thin slabs
VL  - 47
IS  - 2
SP  - 187-204
AB  - Commonly, the secondary cooling provided by air-mist nozzles is regulated by varying the water flow rate while maintaining constant air nozzle pressure. However, these cooling elements are more flexible since, as demonstrated in laboratory experiments, an increase in the air pressure, particularly from a typical value of 200 kPa to 250-400 kPa, causes a considerable increase in the boiling heat flux for a given impact water flux. Based on this finding, previous empirical correlations for the heat flux generated by air-mist nozzles impinging on hot surfaces were extended to include the effect of the air pressure. The correlations were then implemented into a transient 2-D heat conduction model to investigate the influence of new cooling conditions on the surface temperature and metallurgical length of the strand and ultimately on the possibility of increasing the casting speed, i.e., productivity. The model highlighted the potential of the new conditions and this was confirmed by plant results. Additional support to the usefulness of the correlations emerged from the accurate predictions that the model can achieve regarding the temperature evolution of the strand during transient operating conditions, such as during changes in casting speed, slab width, casting temperature and/or steel grade. The fact that the correlations did not need calibration emphasizes the importance of the appropriate characterization of spray and air-mist cooling to develop robust, flexible and accurate virtual casting machines for exploring and controlling the operation of real ones. © Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Published by Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Printed in Canada.

VL  - 58
IS  - 7
SP  - 1560-1572
AB  - The developmental trajectory of an organism is influenced by the interaction between its genes and the environment in which it develops. For example, the phenotypic traits of a hatchling reptile can be influenced by the organism's genotype, by incubation temperature, and by genetically coded norms of reaction for thermally labile traits. The evolution of parthenogenesis provides a unique opportunity to explore such effects: a hybrid origin of this trait in vertebrates modifies important aspects of the genotype (e.g., heterozygosity, polyploidy) and may thus impact not only on the phenotype generally, but also on the ways in which incubation temperature affects expression of the phenotype. The scarcity of vertebrate parthenogenesis has been attributed to developmental disruptions, but previous work has rarely considered reaction norms of embryogenesis in this respect. We used closely related sexual and asexual races of the Australian gecko Heteronotia binoei, which include those with multiple origins of parthenogenesis, to explore the ways in which reproductive modes (sexual, asexual), incubation temperatures (24, 27, and 30degreesC), and the interaction between these factors affected hatchling phenotypes. The hatchling traits we considered included incubation period, incidence of deformities, hatchling survivorship, body size and shape, scalation (including fluctuating asymmetry), locomotor performance, and growth rate. Developmental success was slightly reduced (higher proportion of abnormal offspring) in parthenogenetic lineages although there was no major difference in hatching success. Incubation temperature affected a suite of traits including incubation period, tail length, body mass relative to egg mass, labial scale counts, running speed, growth rate, and hatchling survival. Our data also reveal an interaction between reproductive modes and thermal regimes, with the phenotypic traits of parthenogenetic lizards less sensitive to incubation temperature than was the case for their sexual relatives. Thus, the evolution of asexual reproduction in this species complex has modified both mean hatchling viability and the norms of reaction linking hatchling phenotypes to incubation temperature. Discussions on the reasons why parthenogenetic organisms are scarce in nature should take into account interactive effects such as these; future work could usefully try to tease apart the roles of parthenogenesis, its hybrid origin (and thus effects on ploidy and heterozygosity, etc.), and clonal selection in generating these divergent embryonic responses.

AB  - Extradiol dioxygenase (EDO) catalyzes metal-dependent ring cleavage of catecholic substrates. We previously screened a metagenomic library of activated sludge used to treat industrial wastewater contaminated with phenols and cyanide to identify 43 EDO genes. Here, we have characterized the enzymes belonging to novel I.2.G, I.3.M and I.3.N subfamilies. The I.3.M and I.3.N EDOs were Fe(II) dependent and preferred bicyclic substrates, whereas the I.2.G EDOs were Mn(II) dependent, preferred monocyclic substrates and had the highest affinity for catechol reported thus far. The I.2.G EDOs were more tolerant against heat (60 °C for 1 h) and chemical inhibitors (H2O 2 and NaCN) than I.3.M and I.3.N EDOs. Considering the dominance of the I.2.G EDOs over all retrieved EDOs (20 of 43 clones) and the presence of cyanide in the environment, this high affinity for substrate and structural robustness should provide survival advantages to host microorganisms. The 20 I.2.G EDOs were classified into six groups based on the amino acid sequence of the predicted ancestor, 1A1. Enzymes were chosen from each group and characterized. Two descendents, 1D2 and 5B2, each had a kcat-K M approximately twofold higher than that of 1A1 and reduced thermal stability, suggesting that descendents of 1A1 have adapted evolutionarily by a trade-off of inherent stability for increased activity. © 2009 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

VL  - 173

SP  - E171-E176
AB  - Natural populations of hosts and their enemies are often spatially structured, with patches that vary in the strength of reciprocal selection, so-called coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots with strong or weak reciprocal selection, respectively. Theory predicts that dispersal from hotspots should intensify coevolution in coldspots, whereas dispersal from coldspots should weaken coevolution in hotspots; however, there have been few empirical tests. We addressed this using paired populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluoresces and the phage SBW25φ2 linked by one-way dispersal. Within each population, the strength of reciprocal selection was manipulated by altering the bacteria-phage encounter rate, which changes the rate of coevolution without affecting environmental productivity. We observed that dispersal from hotspots accelerated coevolution in coldspots, while dispersal from coldspots decelerated coevolution in hotspots. These results confirm theoretical predictions and suggest that source populations can act as coevolutionary "pacemakers" for recipient populations, overriding local conditions. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Food supplementation and timing of reproduction: Does the responsiveness to supplementary information vary with latitude?
VL  - 148
SP  - S625-S632
AB  - Food supplementation usually advances the timing of laying. Here, we report a meta-analysis of 35 food supplementation studies demonstrating that species at high latitudes are less responsive to food supplementation than those at lower latitudes. Because the length of the breeding season varies with latitude, species at high latitudes may rely mostly upon photic cues and be less responsive to other environmental information. Lower latitude species, where times suitable for breeding vary from year-to-year, are predicted to be more responsive to "supplementary" information to adjust reproduction to coincide with conditions that favor the successful rearing of young. Studies by Wingfield et al. (Gen Comp Endocrinol 101:242-255, 1996; Gen Comp Endocrinol 107:44-62, 1997; Gen Comp Endocrinol 131:143-158, 2003) suggest a physiological underpinning to this reduced responsiveness to supplementary information in high-latitude species. Given that temperature increases resulting from global climate change are most pronounced at high latitude, reduced plasticity to respond to these changes in individuals of high-latitude species could cause high-latitude breeders to be poorly synchronized with a resource base that emerges earlier than usual. If high-latitude breeders indeed lack sufficient individual-level plasticity to cope effectively with climate fluctuations, effective optimization of reproductive timing in a rapidly changing environment would require similarly rapid evolutionary change. It remains to be seen whether this will be possible. © Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2007.

VL  - 9

SP  - 169-183
AB  - Hypothesis: Phenotypic variation in traits induced by different incubation temperatures does not persist into the lifetime of young lizards, and therefore contributes little to variation in long-term fitness. Organism: Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis). Methods: Split-clutch laboratory incubation experiment including eggs from two different populations under two different incubation regimes, measurement of morphological traits at hatching, and tracking of morphology and temperature preference behaviour for 7 weeks after hatching. Results: Several morphological traits, including body mass, hindlimb length, inter-limb length, and tail length, initially differed between the two incubation treatments, but only the difference in tail length persisted to age 7 weeks. Thermal preference was relatively conserved, with juveniles showing no difference in mean selected body temperatures across treatments; however, warm-incubated lizards thermoregulated more precisely than their cool-incubated counterparts. Conclusion: Studies of incubation effects can reveal changes in animal phenotypes post-hatching, but if these effects do not persist, they may not be subject to natural selection and consequently be of little ecological relevance. © 2007 Christine R.

VL  - 99
IS  - 6
SP  - 632-640
AB  - Costs of resistance are expected to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for resistance in natural host populations. In the present study, we experimentally test for genetic trade-offs between parasite resistance and larval competitive ability expressed under varying levels of crowding and temperature. Artificial selection for increased behavioral resistance was applied against an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) in replicate lines of the fruit fly Drosophila nigrospiracula. We then measured correlated responses to selection in larval competitive ability by contrasting replicate selected and control (unselected) lines in the absence of parasitism. Experiments were conducted under variable environmental conditions: two temperatures and three levels of larval density. Our results reveal a negative genetic correlation between resistance and larval-adult survival under conditions of moderate and severe intra-specific competition. At both low and high temperature, percent emergence was significantly higher among control lines than selected lines. This divergence in larval competitive ability was magnified under high levels of competition, but only at low temperature. Hence, the interaction between selection treatment and larval density was modified by temperature. As predicted, larvae experiencing medium and high levels of competition exhibited an overall reduction in female body size compared to larvae at low levels of competition. Female flies emerging from selected lines were significantly smaller than those females from control lines, but this effect was only significant under conditions of moderate to severe competition. These results provide evidence of environment-dependent trade-offs between ectoparasite resistance and larval competitive ability, a potential mechanism maintaining genetic polymorphism for resistance. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

A sample of females from the 19th generation of the 'R-' and 'R+' lines divergently selected for the residual feed intake in the laying period was separated at 18 weeks of age in climatic rooms into two groups, one kept at a constant temperature of 21 ± 1 °C (control), the other kept at 31 ± 1 °C ('heated' group). Egg production was recorded until the age of 45 weeks, individual feed consumption was measured between the ages of 31 and 35 weeks, and water consumption was measured at 51 weeks. The usual effects of high ambient temperature compared to moderate temperature were observed in both lines: reduction of food intake (- 16%), egg number and egg mass (- 13%), mean clutch length, more days of pauses, depression of body weight (- 8%) and mean egg weight (- 4%). Similarly, over both treatments, the differences found previously between lines in total feed consumption (25%) and in its residual part (19%), in comb and wattle size, shank length and in water intake (51%) were observed. However, for several variables the line x treatment interaction was significant, especially for residual food intake, water intake, 48-week body weight and adult body weight variation, indicating that the 'overconsuming line' (R+) was better adapted to the high temperature with a reduction in egg number of only 10% versus 22% for the 'underconsuming' line (R-). The better adaptation of the R+ line may be due partly to a reduction of thermogenesis during feeding, and perhaps more probably to a higher capacity for heat dissipation. Finally, breeding for a laying hen with better food efficiency, which has been found to be advantageous in a temperate environment, shows some limits at high temperature.

TI  - Evolutionary response to size-selective mortality in an exploited fish population
VL  - 274
IS  - 1613
SP  - 1015-1022
AB  - Many collapsed fish populations have failed to recover after a decade or more with little fishing. This may reflect evolutionary change in response to the highly selective mortality imposed by fisheries. Recent experimental work has demonstrated a rapid genetic change in growth rate in response to size-selective harvesting of laboratory fish populations. Here, we use a 30-year time-series of back-calculated lengths-at-age to test for a genetic response to size-selective mortality in the wild in a heavily exploited population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Controlling for the effects of density- and temperature-dependent growth, the change in mean length of 4-year-old cod between offspring and their parental cohorts was positively correlated with the estimated selection differential experienced by the parental cohorts between this age and spawning. This result supports the hypothesis that there have been genetic changes in growth in this population in response to size-selective fishing. Such changes may account for the continued small size-at-age in this population despite good conditions for growth and little fishing for over a decade. This study highlights the need for management regimes that take into account the evolutionary consequences of fishing. © 2007 The Royal Society.

TI  - Genetic variation in growth and development time under two selection regimes in Leptinotarsa decemlineata
VL  - 127
IS  - 2
SP  - 157-167
AB  - It is possible to predict the potential range of a species on the basis of its ecological characteristics and those of the invaded ecosystem. The existence of genetic variation indicates a species' potential to respond to new environmental conditions, thus facilitating its success as an invader. Accordingly, evolutionary and ecological approaches are needed to identify the factors explaining both species' range and their potential to invade new areas. We combined these two approaches and studied whether genetic variation in life-history traits under abiotic (temperature) and biotic (host plant) selection pressures contributes to the potential range expansion of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We reared full-sib families of L. decemlineata from the current northernmost European population at 15 °C (temperature below that in the current range) and 25 °C (optimal temperature) and on three potato varieties. We monitored development time, adult weight and larval-to-adult survival, and estimated the amount of heritable variance. The development time and adult weight of progenies were more variable between than within families. Thus, there was genetic variability in traits relevant to the ability to adapt to a colder environment (i.e., accelerate development and become heavier) allowing range expansion further north in Europe, even though low temperature increased beetle mortality. Temperature strongly affected all traits measured. Potato variety, in turn, did not strongly affect beetles' performance. Beetle ability to adapt to a cool environment was further enhanced by the fact that size was not constrained by fast development. The results showed that beetle populations possess genetic variation allowing a response to temperature and thus have the evolutionary potential to adapt and spread beyond their current range. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - In early autumn, high temperatures terminate diapause in the alfalfa blotch leafminer Agromyza frontella; low temperatures maintain diapause. These responses subserve a thermally malleable dormancy and allow flexibility in the annual number of generations. The view that favorable conditions cannot reverse the course of diapause are contradicted by the data on A. frontella. A better understanding of the diverse seasonal adaptations that insects have evolved may add precision to life history studies and phenological models in insect pest management.

VL  - 59

SP  - 70-80
AB  - Parasite-mediated selection is potentially of great importance in modulating genetic diversity. Genetic variation for resistance, the fuel for natural selection, appears to be common in host-parasite interactions, but responses to selection are rarely observed. In the present study, we tested whether environmental variation could mediate infection and determine evolutionary outcomes. Temperature was shown to dramatically alter the potential for parasite-mediated selection in two independent laboratory infection experiments at four temperatures. The bacterial parasite, Pasteuria rainosa, was extremely virulent at 20degreesC and 25degreesC, sterilizing its host, Daphnia magna, so that females often never produced a single brood. However, at 10degreesC and 15degreesC, the host-parasite interaction was much more benign, as nearly all females produced broods before becoming sterile. This association between virulence and temperature alone could stabilize coexistence and lead to the maintenance of diversity, because it would weaken parasite-mediated selection during parts of the season. Additionally, highly significant genotype-by-environment interactions were found, with changes in clone rank order for infection rates at different temperatures. Our results clearly show that the outcome of parasite-mediated selection in this system is strongly context dependent.

TI  - Composition of fuel stores and digestive limitations to fuel deposition rate in the long-distance migratory thrush nightingale, Luscinia luscinia
VL  - 70
IS  - 1
SP  - 125-133
AB  - During their autumn migratory phase, thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) previously starved for 2 d were allowed to refuel under three different ambient temperature conditions (-7°, 7°, and 22°C). During the refueling period, as well as during the preceding control and starvation periods, food intake, body mass, and feces production were monitored. In addition, daily energy expenditure was measured during the refueling period. The compilation of the energy balance during the refueling period revealed an energy density of the deposited tissue of 33.6 kJ g-1. Assuming that the deposited tissue consists of fat and protein exclusively, with energy densities of 39.6 and 3.5 kJ g-1 wet mass, respectively, we estimated the deposited tissue to consist of 82% fat and 18% wet protein (6% dry protein and 12% water). Nitrogen balances during control, starvation, and refueling phases and during a period of prolonged and complete starvation indicated that 5% of the nutrient stores consisted of dry protein. Our results support recent findings that nutrient stores for migration often contain protein in addition to fat and consequently are 15%-25% less energy rich than pure fat stores. These proteins might be stored as muscle or other functional tissue and may be required to support the extra mass of the stores and/or reflect an incapacity of the metabolic machinery to catabolize fat exclusively. Fuel deposition rate was positively related with ambient temperature, whereas food intake rate was unaffected by temperature. These results indicate that the rate of fuel deposition is limited by a ceiling in food intake rate; when this ceiling is reached, fuel deposition rate is negatively affected by daily energy expenditure rate. To a certain extent, the ceiling in food intake rate varies depending on feeding conditions over the previous days. These variations in food intake capacity probably reflect the building and breakdown of gut tissues and/or gut enzyme systems and might be insensible and not evolutionary adaptive. Significant energetic costs, however, are probably associated with the maintenance of gut tissues. It is therefore feasible that changes in digestive capacity are regulated and are directed at energy economization.

VL  - 98
IS  - 6
SP  - 1917-1923
AB  - The solitary bee Osmia lignaria Say continues to be developed as an orchard pollinator in the United States and southern Canada. Female bees are active during the early spring and construct nests consisting of a linear series of unlined cells delimited by mud partitions. Cells are provisioned with a pollen/nectar mass on which an egg is deposited, and nests are sealed with a mud plug. In 1997, we initiated two experiments on the development, mortality, and emergence of O. lignaria at selected laboratory temperature regimes and outdoors. In the first experiment (published previously), we compared temperature treatments for their adequacy in maintaining healthy O. lignaria populations. In a second experiment (reported here), we determined the relationship between rearing temperatures and prepupa-adult development rates as well as emergence time and longevity after wintering and incubation the following spring. We observed important differences in O. lignaria prepupa versus pupa responses to selected temperature treatments. The relationship between temperature and days to pupa was U-shaped, with additional time to transit the prepupa-pupa interval at temperatures above and below 26°C. The negative relationship between temperature and the length of the pupa to adult interval contrasts with the U-shaped thermal response observed for prepupae. Thus, with each increase in thermal heat units over the range of temperature treatments tested, we observed an additional reduction in the pupa-adult interval. Individuals reared at constant 18°C required 2.4 times as many days to transit the pupa-adult interval compared with those at constant 32°C. Our results suggest that there is a need for the development of regionally adapted, latitude-specific breeding populations of this outstanding orchard crop pollinator. © 2005 Entomological Society of America.

AB  - A long-standing research goal has been to develop a self-sustained chemical system that is capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution. The notion of primitive RNA-based life suggests that this goal might be achieved by constructing an RNA enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA molecules, including the RNA enzyme itself. This reaction was demonstrated recently in a cross-catalytic system involving two RNA enzymes that catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four component substrates. The cross-replicating RNA enzymes undergo self-sustained exponential amplification at a constant temperature in the absence of proteins or other biological materials. Amplification occurs with a doubling time of ∼1 hour and can be continued indefinitely. Small populations of cross-replicating RNA enzymes can be made to compete for limited resources within a common environment. The molecules reproduce with high fidelity but occasionally give rise to recombinants that also can replicate. Over the course of many "generations" of selective amplification, novel variants arise and grow to dominate the population based on their relative fitness under the chosen reaction conditions. This is the first example, outside of biology, of evolutionary adaptation in a molecular genetic system. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Short summer seasons with low thermal energy input characterise polar ecosystems. Climatic variables and physical isolation of terrestrial habitats act as selective filters which must be passed to allow colonisation, establishment and survival in these extreme environments. Life history studies of the terrestrial biota of such ecosystems give little evidence of adaptive responses to low temperatures having evolved in situ, even though behavioural, ecophysiological and biochemical features allowing tolerance of the likely extremes are well-developed. Observed life history strategies are often consistent with the general predictions of 'adversity' (A) or 'stress' (S) selection. However, biota successful in these extreme environments may be better-grouped by the lack of particular life history features, rather than common possession.

VL  - 66

SP  - 978-984
AB  - Humans are evolutionarily adapted to chronic undernutrition as a consequence of ecologically dictated dietary restriction. Increased aridity, cooler temperatures and increased climatic oscillation effected an alteration of the quantity and quality of vegetation upon which hominids depended for food during the Plio-Pleistocene period. Hominids responded physiologically to climate-induced caloric curtailment in the same way organisms respond to experimentally imposed caloric restriction: by reducing the rate and/or altering the manner in which they metabolized fuel. Such metabolic alterations are mediated principally by the hypothalamus and it is herein hypothesized that the human hypothalamus was subjected to substantial selective pressure, promoting an energetically conservative hypometabolic state. Moreover, the most salient phenotypic characteristics typifying the human species - long lifespan, low reproductive potential, lengthy development and high brain/bodyweight ratio - are effectuated in organisms undergoing caloric restriction. These phenotypic/physiological characteristics - herein termed the quadripartite complex - can be modulated by metabolic rate, which is, in turn, modulated by the hypothalamus. An appreciable alteration in climate occurred between 2.0 and 1.5 million years ago, a juncture at which one hominid lineage (Paranthropus) went extinct. Paranthropus was characterized by such external adaptations as robust cranio-facial morphology and pronounced enamel deposition, indicative of subsistence on tough, low-quality vegetal foods. Conversely, the Homo lineage responded to its marginal dietary repertoire through internal means, centering on metabolic suppression. It is herein hypothesized that this adaptive metabolic alteration, enacted in response to ecologically imposed caloric restriction, produced the defining morphologic attributes of Homo and enabled the evolutionary success of the human species. Among the implications of this line of thinking is that modern humans may be particularly sensitive to the deleterious effects of excess energy intake and, concomitantly, particularly amenable to the ameliorative effects of caloric restriction. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 52

AB  - Desiccation and starvation tolerance were measured along latitudinal transects in three Drosophilid species (Drosophila ananassae, D. melanogaster, and Zaprionus indianus) of the Indian subcontinent. In each case, significant latitudinal clines were observed; desiccation tolerance increased with latitude while starvation tolerance decreased. Such field observations suggest that desiccation and starvation tolerance are fitness related traits that are independently selected in nature and genetically independent. It was, however, difficult to relate these genetic changes with precise climatic variables, except winter temperature. The overall negative correlation between the two traits, which was evidenced in natural populations, contrasts with a positive correlation generally observed in various laboratory selection experiments and that also seems to exist between different species. These observations point to the difficulty of interpreting correlations among fitness-related traits when different evolutionary levels are compared, and also different sets of data, that is, field versus laboratory studies.

TI  - The genetic covariance among clinal environments after adaptation to an environmental gradient in Drosophila serrata
VL  - 167
IS  - 3
SP  - 1281-1291
AB  - We examined the genetic basis of clinal adaptation by determining the evolutionary response of life-history traits to laboratory natural selection along a gradient of thermal stress in Drosophila serrata. A gradient of heat stress was created by exposing larvae to a heat stress of 36degrees for 4 hr for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of larval development, with the remainder of development taking place at 25degrees. Replicated lines were exposed to each level of this stress every second generation for 30 generations. At the end of selection, we conducted a complete reciprocal transfer experiment where all populations were raised in all environments, to estimate the realized additive genetic covariance matrix among clinal environments in three life-history traits. Visualization of the genetic covariance functions of the life-history traits revealed that the genetic correlation between environments generally declined as environments became more different and even became negative between the most different environments in some cases. One exception to this general pattern was a life-history trait representing the classic trade-off between development time and body size, which responded to selection in a similar genetic fashion across all environments. Adaptation to clinal environments may involve a number of distinct genetic effects along the length of the cline, the complexity of which may not be fully revealed by focusing primarily on populations at the ends of the cline.

AB  - Using a statistical-mechanical model of spins, the evolution of phenotype dynamics is studied. Configurations of spins and their interaction J represent the phenotype and genotype, respectively. The fitness for selection of J is given by the equilibrium spin configurations determined by a Hamiltonian with J under thermal noise. The genotype J evolves through mutational changes under selection pressure to raise its fitness value. From Monte Carlo simulations we find that the frustration around the target spins disappears for J evolved under temperature beyond a certain threshold. The evolved Js give the funnel-like dynamics, which is robust to noise and also to mutation. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

VL  - 86

SP  - 311-319
AB  - Temperature during embryonic development irreversibly determines gonadal sex in many oviparous reptiles. Although embryonic temperature also influences a number of other traits in these species. it is unclear whether such effects are primarily due to incubation temperature or to gonadal sex. Here we dissociated these normally confounding effects via hormonal manipulations of snapping turtle embryos (Chelydra serpentina), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. We then ascertained temperature and xx effects on residual yolk mass, abdominal fat body mass: and total mass in neonates shortly after hatching or after one month without feeding. Yolk mass was initially affected by incubation temperature. clutch identity, and rh;ir interaction, but not gonadal sex. Yolk mass was not influenced by any of these variables 30 d after hatching. Fat mass was initially affected by temperature and clutch, but not sex. Gonadal sex did, however, affect fat mass at 30 d of age as did temperature and clutch. Incubation temperature affected total mass in a complex manner. There were significant clutch by temperature interactions initially, bur no main effect of temperature. These effects changed so that the temperature effect was significant bur interaction effects il ere nor detected at 30 d of age. Repeated measures analysis of total mass after hatching and at 30 d of age indicated that turtles from lower temperatures lost more mass than turtles From higher incubation temperatures, and that females lost more mass than malts. These data indicate that some hatchling traits were influenced directly by incubation temperature, whereas others were independently affected by; gonadal sex. These results are consistent with a leading hypothesis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.

VL  - 112
AB  - The global budgets of argon and heat-producing elements have traditionally been used to argue for layered-mantle convection because they require a large fraction of Earth's mantle to remain isolated from mantle convection. We revise these mass balance arguments using our new composition model of the primitive mantle and show that the global budgets of argon, heat-producing elements, and rare earth elements are consistent with Earth's mantle almost entirely composed of the mid-ocean ridge basalt source mantle, supporting the notion of whole mantle convection. Combined with a recent theory on the thermal evolution of Earth, our revised thermal budget implies inefficient mixing and processing in the past, explaining the survival of long-lived geochemical heterogeneities in convecting mantle.

TI  - A time series of evolution in action: A latitudinal cline in wing size in South American Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 58
IS  - 4
SP  - 768-780
AB  - Drosophila subobscura is geographically widespread in the Old World. Around the late 1970s, it was accidentally introduced into both South and North America, where it spread rapidly over broad latitudinal ranges. This invading species offers opportunities to study the speed and predictability of trait evolution on a geographic scale. One trait of special interest is body size, which shows a strong and positive latitudinal cline in many Drosophila species, including Old World D. subobscura. Surveys made about a decade after the invasion found no evidence of a size cline in either North or South America. However, a survey made in North America about two decades after the invasion showed that a conspicuous size cline had evolved and (for females) was coincident with that for Old World flies. We have now conducted parallel studies on 10 populations (13degrees of latitude) of flies, collected in Chile in spring 1999. After rearing flies in the laboratory for several generations, we measured wing sizes and compared geographic patterns (versus latitude or temperature) for flies on all three continents. South American females have now evolved a significant latitudinal size cline that is similar in slope to that of Old World and of North American flies. Rates of evolution (haldanes) for females are among the highest ever measured for quantitative traits. In contrast, the size cline is positive but not significant for South or North American males. At any given latitude, South American flies of both sexes are relatively large; this in part reflects the relatively cool climate of coastal Chile. Interestingly, the sections of the wing that generate the size cline for females differ among all three continents. Thus, although the evolution of overall wing size is predictable on a geographic scale (at least for females), the evolution of size of particular wing components is decidedly not.

TI  - Evolution of thermal physiology in liolaemus lizards: Adaptation, phylogenetic inertia, and niche tracking
VL  - 174
IS  - 2
SP  - 204-220
AB  - Microevolutionary studies often find that complex quantitative characters are highly evolvable and adapted to the local environment, while macroevolutionary studies often show evidence of strong phylogenetic effects and stasis. In this contribution, we show how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to test hypotheses that may help resolve this paradox. As a test case, we studied the interplay between adaptation and phylogenetic inertia on the thermobiology of 32 species of Liolaemus (Squamata: Liolaemidae), a genus of South American lizards living under diverse climatic conditions. Despite a strong phylogenetic effect in the preferred (selected) body temperature, we found clear evidence that this variable is adapted to local temperature and climate. After controlling for adaptation to the thermal environment, little influence of phylogeny was left. This indicates that the phylogenetic effect was not caused by a lag or slowness in adaptation but primarily by the distribution of the thermal environments on the phylogeny. This can be due to thermal niche tracking. In contrast, we found little or no evidence for adaptation to the thermal environment in either cooling or heating rates, critical thermal minimum, or body size © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Different cell size and cell number contribution in two newly established and one ancient body size cline of Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 57
IS  - 3
SP  - 566-573
AB  - Latitudinal genetic clines in body size occur in many ectotherms including Drosophila species. In the wing of D. melanogaster, these clines are generally based on latitudinal variation in cell number. In contrast, differences in wing area that evolve by thermal selection in the laboratory are in general based on cell size. To investigate possible reasons for the different cellular bases of these two types of evolutionary response, we compared the newly established North and South American wing size clines of Drosophila subobscura. The new clines are based on latitudinal variation in cell area in North America and cell number in South America. The ancestral European cline is also based on latitudinal variation in cell number. The difference in the cellular basis of wing size variation in the American clines, which are roughly the same age, together with the similar cellular basis of the new South American cline and the ancient European one, suggest that the antiquity of a cline does not explain its cellular basis. Furthermore, the results indicate that wing size as a whole, rather than its cellular basis, is under selection. The different cellular bases of different size clines are most likely explained either entirely by chance or by different patterns of genetic variance or its expression - in founding populations.

VL  - 282

SP  - 71-94
AB  - We have used an experimentally based strategy to address molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation in Fundulus heteroclitus. In an attempt to falsify the hypothesis that selection is a major driving force in the maintenance of genetic diversity, we employed a multidisciplinary approach including allelic isozyme and mtDNA phylogeography, kinetic analyses of allelic isozymes, analysis of variation in coding and regulatory DNA sequences, metabolic biochemistry, organismal physiology, and selection experiments. Observed differences in gene structure and expression led us to make testable predictions about differences in metabolic flux, whole organism performance, and differential survival between allotypes. We have shown that variation in the lactate dehydrogenase-B (Ldh-B) protein results in differences in physiological function and is correlated with differences in survival at high temperatures. Recent work has investigated the role of variation in Ldh-B expression. There are differences in the levels of Ldh-B protein, mRNA, and transcription rate. We have addressed the mechanisms responsible for differences in transcription rate by a combination of sequence comparison; DNase I footprinting, and functional analyses both in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that variation in the regulatory sequence of Ldh-B is responsible for the differences in transcription rate between populations and that the patterns of variation are inconsistent with a neutral model of molecular evolution. This functional differentiation, coupled with departures from neutral expectations, suggests that natural selection has acted on the regulation of Ldh-B. This article illustrates the value of a multidisciplinary approach in addressing problems in gene structure, expression, and evolutionary adaptation. J. Exp. Zool. 282:71-94, 1998.

VL  - 172
IS  - 3
SP  - 239-253
AB  - The delta(13)C record of total organic carbon in the Lake Baikal core BDP-93-2 over the last glacial/interglacial transition shows remarkable correlation with atmospheric CO2 fluctuations and the negative isotopic shift of 3.5-4 parts per thousand in response to the global increase in paleo-pCO(2) level. With rapid evolution of the Lake Baikal carbon cycle from full glacial to full interglacial modes, however, the pCO(2) signal in the Baikal delta(13)C sedimentary organic matter is inundated by the basin-wide productivity signal, in the Holocene. The Baikal diatom abundance record, as a paleotemperature proxy, lags behind the GISP2 ice core delta(18)O temperature proxy record by ca. 1 ka, possibly reflecting the response time of the Baikal ecosystem to major climatic transitions. There is no lag associated with the pronounced Younger Dryas cooling, however, suggesting a different forcing mechanism, with a short response time, for this abrupt climatic event in continental interior Asia. The phase difference observed between the diatom abundance and delta(13)C proxies in Lake Baikal care BDP-93-2 suggests their independent responses to different forcing mechanisms, further justifying their importance for paleoclimate reconstructions from Lake Baikal records.

VL  - 48
IS  - 10
SP  - 961-970
AB  - Many of the physiological adaptations evolved in terrestrial invertebrates to resist desiccation have also been shown to enhance the survival of low temperatures. In this study we have examined temporal changes in the physiology of the collembolan Folsomia candida during acclimation to mild desiccation stress (98.2% RH), and how physiological changes correlate with resistance to subsequent cold shock. heat shock and acute desiccation stress. Drought-acclimation increased the resistance to cold and acute drought but reduced the resistance to heat shock. The composition of membrane phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) changed during acclimation resulting in a higher degree of unsaturation by the end of the 192-h acclimation period. This resembles typical membrane alterations seen in ectothermic animals exposed to cold. Only small changes were seen in the neutral lipid fraction. The temporal changes in cold resistance and drought resistance correlated well with changes in PLFA composition and accumulation of sugars and polyols ('cryoprotectives'). It is proposed that the drought-induced PLFA desaturation, combined with the membrane protecting accumulation of cryoprotectives, are important physiological adaptations providing tolerance to both desiccation and cold.

VL  - 58
IS  - 7
SP  - 1459-1471
AB  - Climate change will test the evolutionary potential of populations. Information regarding the genetic architecture within and among populations is essential for prediction of evolutionary outcomes. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation for relevant traits in natural populations or alteration of genetic architecture in a changing environment. In this study, pedigreed families from three populations of the annual prairie legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were reciprocally transplanted in three environments across a broad latitudinal range in the Great Plains. The underlying premise of this work is that northern populations will in the future experience climates similar to current-day climates further south. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.053 to 0.481, suggesting the potential for evolutionary change is possible for most traits. In general, the northern population harbored less genetic variation and had lower heritability for traits than the southern population. This population also experienced large reductions in fitness, as measured by estimated lifetime fecundity, when raised in either the intermediate or the southern climate, whereas the difference between the intermediate and southern population was less extreme. For fecundity, the pattern of cross-environment additive genetic correlations was antagonistic to evolutionary change in four of six cases when native and nonnative sites were compared. Six additional antagonistic positive correlations were found for the rate of phenological development and leaf thickness. Overall, the data suggest that if climate changes as predicted, the northern population will face a severe evolutionary challenge in the future because of low heritabilities, cross-environment genetic correlations antagonistic to selection, and demographic instability due to lower seed production in a hotter and drier climate.

AB  - Between 1960 and 2003, 13 Chinese expeditions successfully reached the summit of Chomolungma (Mt Everest or Sagarmatha). Forty-five of the 80 summiteers were Tibetan highlanders. During these and other high-altitude expeditions in Tibet, a series of medical and physiological investigations were carried out on the Tibetan mountaineers. The results suggest that these individuals are better adapted to high altitude and that, at altitude, they have a greater physical capacity than Han (ethnic Chinese) lowland newcomers. They have higher maximal oxygen uptake, greater ventilation, more brisk hypoxic ventilatory responses, larger lung volumes, greater diffusing capacities, and a better quality of sleep. Tibetans also have a lower incidence of acute mountain sickness and less body weight loss. These differences appear to represent genetic adaptations and are obviously significant for humans at extreme altitude. This paper reviews what is known about the physiologic responses of Tibetans at extreme altitudes.

TI  - The effects of selection for cold tolerance on cross-tolerance to other environmental stressors in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 263-276
AB  - Cross tolerance, whereby tolerance to one environmental stress is correlated with tolerance to other stressors, is thought to be widespread in insects. We used lines of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae) selected for survival at a 1-h exposure to -5°C to examine the extent to which this selection results in increased tolerance to other stresses, including high and low temperatures, desiccation and starvation. While selection improved tolerance to acute cold exposure and survival at -5°C, there was little effect of selection regime on tolerance to other stressors. There was no correlation between tolerances to any of the stressors, suggesting different mechanisms of tolerance. This supports arguments that correlations between stress tolerances during selection experiments with D. melanogaster may be coincidental. The magnitude of heat-hardening was apparently constrained by basal tolerance among lines, but the magnitude of the rapid cold-hardening response was not correlated with basal cold tolerance, implying that the relationship between inducible and basal tolerances differs at high and low temperatures. © 2009 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 81

AB  - Climate is a driver of biotic systems. It affects individual fitness, population dynamics, distribution and abundance of species, and ecosystem structure and function. Regional variation in climatic regimes creates selective pressures for the evolution of locally adapted physiologies, morphological adaptations (e.g., color patterns, surface textures, body shapes and sizes), and behavioral adaptations (e.g., foraging strategies and breeding systems). In the absence of humans, broad-scale, long-term consequences of climatic warming on wild organisms are generally predictable. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that most species responded ecologically by shifting their ranges poleward and upward in elevation, rather than evolutionary through local adaptation (e.g., morphological changes). But these broad patterns tell us little about the relative importance of gradual climatic trends as compared to extreme weather events in shaping these processes. Here, evidence is brought forward that extreme weather events can be implicated as mechanistic drivers of broad ecological responses to climatic trends. They are, therefore, essential to include in predictive biological models, such as doubled CO2 scenarios.

TI  - Environmental stress and the expression of genetic variation
VL  - 83
SP  - 79-96
AB  - We have started to test the effects of environmental extremes on the expression of genetic variation for traits likely to be under selection in natural populations. We have shown that field heritability may be high for stress response traits in contrast to morphological traits, which tend to show lower levels of heritable variation in nature compared with the laboratory. Selection for increased stress resistance can lead to a number of other evolutionary changes, and these may underlie trade-offs between favourable and stressful environments. Temperature extremes can have a marked influence on the heritability of life history traits. Heritabilities for fecundity can be high when parental flies are reared at low temperatures and under field conditions. The expression of genetic variation for development time is somewhat more complex when temperature extremes are considered. Populations at species margins may be ideal for studying the effects of environmental stress on evolution.

AB  - The ability of psychrophiles to survive and proliferate at low temperatures implies that they have overcome key barriers inherent to permanently cold environments. These challenges include: reduced enzyme activity; decreased membrane fluidity; altered transport of nutrients and waste products; decreased rates of transcription, translation and cell division; protein cold-denaturation; inappropriate protein folding; and intracellular ice formation. Cold-adapted organisms have successfully evolved features, genotypic and/or phenotypic, to surmount the negative effects of low temperatures and to enable growth in these extreme environments. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of these adaptations as gained from extensive biochemical and biophysical studies and also from genomics and proteomics. © 2006 European Molecular Biology Organization.

VL  - 20

SP  - 441-454
AB  - Largely derived from experiments in molecular evolution, a theory of the origins of protein synthesis cycles has been constructed. The sequence begins with ordered thermal proteins resulting from the self‐sequencing of mixed amino acids. Ordered thermal proteins then aggregate to cell‐like structures. When they contained proteinoids sufficiently rich in lysine, the structures were able to synthesize offspring peptides. Since lysine‐rich proteinoid (LRP) also catalyzes the polymerization of nucleoside triphosphate to polynucleotides, the same microspheres containing LRP could have synthesized both original cellular proteins and cellular nucleic acids. The LRP within protocells would have provided proximity advantageous for the origin and evolution of the genetic code. Copyright © 1981 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Protandry in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana
VL  - 4
IS  - 8
SP  - 1229-1240
AB  - Protandry is the earlier adult emergence of males than females. This is predicted from sexual selection theory because, under certain circumstances, earlier emergence of males will maximize their mating opportunities. The tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, is adapted to highly seasonal environments and selection pressures for protandry may vary across seasons. To examine such effects, we compared protandry across a wide range of rearing temperatures in the laboratory which match those that occur in the different seasons. The absolute amount of protandry (in days) remained constant at intermediate and high temperatures (wet season), but increased with temperature at lower temperatures (dry season). Nevertheless, average male development time as a percentage of female development time remained constant. We also compared lines established by artificial selection on development time and pupal weight across temperatures to assess the impact of different selection pressures on protandry. Data for the pupal weight selected lines were inconclusive. The male to female development time ratio did not change across temperatures for the development time selected lines. However, females were relatively slower than males in the slow selected lines (lower male: female development time ratio) than in either the fast lines or the stock. This indicates that sex-specific components to development time are present in B. anynana and that there is scope for a response of protandry to selection.

TI  - A review of fluid flows in liquid metal processing and casting operations
VL  - 49
IS  - 10
SP  - 1453-1467
AB  - Fluid flows have proved to be an integral part of many metallurgical processing operations. Metal, slag, and gas flows invariably affect the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency, of our reactor vessels. The performance characteristics of our blast furnaces and steelmaking vessels, such as BOF's, OBM's, ladles, tundishes, and the moulds of continuous casting machines, are all strongly influenced by such flows. Similarly, liquid metal quality and cast micro-structures, are also bound up with the way fluids have flowed and interacted. In all these aspects, the rapid evolution in our techniques and abilities to mathematically and physically model single and multi-phase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes, have contributed significantly to our understanding, and ability, to control and improve these metallurgical processing operations, and to develop new and better processes. The evolution and application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) over the past four decades has been particularly impressive. The author's many fine Japanese graduate students have made very valuable contributions to this new field of research for Process Metallurgists, as well as to the founding and scientific support of the McGill Metals Processing Centre, MMPC, following their return to Japan. © 2009 ISIJ.

AB  - The tectonic modes operating at any given time in the Earth are intimately related to the thermal evolution, since tectonics is driven by heat removal from the Earth's interior. Conversely, the viability of a proposed tectonic mode depends on its ability to remove heat from the interior as well as on its inferred consistency with geological evidence. On this basis it seems that plate tectonics may have been dominant only in the later part of Earth history, and that proposed earlier modes involving only a subcrustal thermal boundary layer may never have been dominant unless the effects of the basalt-eclogite transition or of latent heat removal were able to enhance their heat transport efficiency. More generally, the tectonic mode driven by the cool thermal boundary layer at the top of the mantle may have depended very sensitively on the effects of composition and latent heat on density. Calculations indicate that plumes could have operated through most of Earth history at about the present level of activity, unless heat conduction from the core into the mantle has been inhibited in later times, in which case they would have been hotter and more active in earlier times. Plumes could not have substituted for plate tectonics because plumes and plates are driven by different thermal boundary layers that operate largely independently. © 1993.

TI  - The sweet thing about Type 1 diabetes: A cryoprotective evolutionary adaptation
VL  - 65
IS  - 1
SP  - 8-16
AB  - The reasons for the uneven worldwide distribution of Type 1 diabetes mellitus have yet to be fully explained. Epidemiological studies have shown a higher prevalence of Type 1 diabetes in northern Europe, particularly in Scandinavian countries, and Sardinia. Recent animal research has uncovered the importance of the generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. In this paper, we hypothesize that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. This cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. When life expectancy was short, factors predisposing to Type 1 diabetes provided a survival advantage. However, deleterious consequences of this condition have become significant only in more modern times, as life expectancy has increased, thus outweighing their protective value. Examples of evolutionary adaptations conferring selection advantages against human pathogens that result in deleterious effects have been previously reported as epidemic pathogenic selection (EPS). Such proposed examples include the cystic fibrosis mutations in the CFTR gene bestowing resistance to Salmonella typhi and hemochromatosis mutations conferring protection against iron-seeking intracellular pathogens. This paper is one of the first accounts of a metabolic disorder providing a selection advantage not against a pathogenic stressor alone, but rather against a climatic change. We thus believe that the concept of EPS should now include environmental factors that may be nonorganismal in nature. In so doing we propose that factors resulting in Type 1 diabetes be considered a result of environmental pathogenic selection (EnPS). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 38
IS  - 1
SP  - 120-124
AB  - Experimentally elevated testosterone has been shown to increase the daily activity period of free-ranging lizards, but it is unknown whether the effect depends upon additional factors present in nature (i.e., conspecific interactions) or whether it can be elicited in the laboratory. In a relatively simple laboratory environment, male Mountain Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi) implanted with testosterone had significantly greater activity levels throughout the day than sham-implanted males. Differences were greatest during the morning and late afternoon, with testosterone-treated males more likely to be out earlier and to stay out later. This general result was repeated in both spring and fall experiments using separate groups of males. Although testosterone-treated males were more active (i.e., out in the open) than control males, there was not a significant difference in the frequency of movements (>20 cm), nor did the groups differ in selected body temperature in their home cages. Nonetheless, testosterone-implanted males lost significantly more body mass than controls over the course of the experiments. Because the effect of testosterone on daily activity period occurs in the laboratory as well as in the field, it is suggested that the effect is not dependent upon interactions with complex environmental stimuli.

TI  - Following the heart: Temperature and salinity effects on heart rate in native and invasive species of blue mussels (genus Mytilus)
VL  - 209
IS  - 13
SP  - 2554-2566
AB  - The three species of blue mussels, Mytilus trossulus Gould 1850, M. edulis Linnaeus 1758 and M. galloprovincialis Lamarck 1819, have distinct global distribution patterns that are hypothesized to reflect differences in their tolerances of temperature and salinity. We examined effects on heart rate (beats min(-1)) of acute exposure and acclimation to different combinations of temperature and salinity to test this hypothesis and, in the context of the invasive success of M. galloprovincialis, to gain insights into the factors that may explain the replacement of the temperate Pacific native, M. trossulus, by this Mediterranean Sea invader along much of the California coast. Heart rate of M. trossulus was significantly higher than that of M. galloprovincialis, consistent with evolutionary adaptation to a lower habitat temperature (temperature compensation) in the former species. Heart rates of M. trossulus/M. galloprovincialis hybrids were intermediate between those of the parental species. Following acclimation to 14 degrees C and 21 degrees C, heart rates of all species exhibited partial compensation to temperature. Heart rate increased with rising temperature until a high temperature was reached at which point activity fell sharply, the high critical temperature (H-crit). H-crit increased with increasing acclimation temperature and differed among species in a pattern that reflected their probable evolutionary adaptation temperatures: M. galloprovincialis is more heat tolerant than the other two congeners. Ability to sustain heart function in the cold also reflected evolutionary history: M. trossulus is more cold tolerant than M. galloprovincialis. Heart rates for all three congeners decreased gradually in response to acute reductions in salinity until a low salinity (S-crit) was reached at which heart rate dropped precipitously. S-crit decreased with decreasing salinity of acclimation and was generally lowest for M. galloprovincialis. Mortality during acclimation under common garden conditions was greatest in M. trossulus and was highest at high acclimation temperatures and salinities. These intrinsic differences in basal heart rate, thermal and salinity responses, acclimatory capacity, and survivorship are discussed in the contexts of the species' biogeographic patterning and, for the invasive species M. galloprovincialis, the potential for further range expansion along the Pacific coast of North America.

TI  - Adaptation to the new land or effect of global warming? An age-structured model for rapid voltinism change in an alien lepidopteran pest
VL  - 77
IS  - 3
SP  - 585-596
AB  - 1. Hyphantria cunea Drury invaded Japan at Tokyo in 1945 and expanded its distribution gradually into northern and south-western Japan. All populations in Japan were bivoltine until the early 1970s, at which time trivoltine populations appeared in several southern regions. Presently, H. cunea exists as separate bivoltine and trivoltine populations divided around latitude 36°. In the course of this voltinism change, the mean surface temperature in Japan rose by 1.0°C. 2. To determine whether and how this temperature increase might be responsible for the voltinism change, we constructed an age-structured model incorporating growth speed driven by actual daily temperature and detailed mechanisms of diapause induction triggered by both daily photoperiod and temperature. 3. The simulation result suggests that both the acceleration of the growth speed and the prolongation of diapause induction are necessary to cause changes in voltinism, regardless of temperature increase. We concluded that the H. cunea population changed its life-history traits as an adaptation parallel with its invasion into the south-western parts of Japan. 4. Though the temperature increase had little effect on the fitness and heat stress in bivoltine and trivoltine populations, the trivoltine life cycle has become advantageous at least in marginal regions such as Tokyo. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - The influence of a competitor on the geographic mosaic of coevolution between crossbills and lodgepole pine
VL  - 55

SP  - 282-294
AB  - The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution posits that the form of selection between interacting species varies across a landscape with coevolution important and active in some locations (i.e., coevolutionary hotspots) but not in others (i.e., coevolutionary coldspots). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) affects the occurrence of coevolution between red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex) and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) and thereby provides a mechanism giving rise to a geographic mosaic of selection. Red squirrels are the predominant predispersal seed predator and selective agent on lodgepole pine cones. However, in four isolated mountain ranges east and west of the Rocky Mountains, red squirrels are absent and red crossbills are the main predispersal seed predator. These isolated populations of pine have apparently evolved without Tamiasciurus for about 10,000 to 12,000 years. Based on published morphological, genetic, and paleobotanical studies, we infer that cone traits in these isolated populations that show parallel differences from cones in the Rocky Mountains have changed in parallel. We used data on crossbill and conifer cone morphology and feeding preferences and efficiency to detect whether red crossbills and lodgepole pine exhibit reciprocal adaptations, which would imply coevolution. Cone traits that act to deter Tamiasciurus and result in high ratios of cone mass to seed mass were less developed in the isolated populations. Cone traits that act to deter crossbills include larger and thicker scales and perhaps increased overlap between successive scales and were enhanced in the isolated populations. In the larger, isolated mountain ranges crossbills have evolved deeper, shorter, and therefore more decurved bills to exploit these cones. This provides crossbills with higher feeding rates, and the change in bill shape has improved efficiency by reducing the concomitant increases in body mass and daily energy expenditures that would have resulted if only bill size had increased. These parallel adaptations and counter adaptations in red crossbills and lodgepole pine are interpreted as reciprocal adaptations and imply that these crossbills and pine are in coevolutionary arms races where red squirrels are absent (i.e., coevolutionary hotspots) but not where red squirrels are present (i.e., coevolutionary coldspots).

TI  - Life history and growth of Asellus aquaticus (L.) in relation to environment in a eutrophic lake in Norway
VL  - 59
IS  - 3
SP  - 243-259
AB  - A new life history pattern for Asellus aquaticus is described from Lake Østensjøvatn in Oslo. Overwintering specimens (generation A) breed in spring. The next generation B matures, breeds and dies in first summer, giving rise to the overwintering generation C, which breeds next spring and dies. The death of generation B in its first summer could be shown by a study of oostegit development in the females. The end of the breeding season in autumn is thus accomplished by a complete replacement of generations. This pattern can be a) light stimulated, or b) a pre-determined cycle, uninfluenced by environmental factors. Breeding starts in spring when water temperature reaches about 7-8°C. Estimated incubation time was 23-35 days, corresponding to about 300 degree-days above 4°C. No growth took place from November till March-April. Growth started when water temperature reached 3-5°C. Growth increments per degree-day above 3°C were the same for the three generations which were followed, in spite of their different life spans and different temperatures. The total number of degree-days above 3°C available to the generations seemed to regulate the maximum length of the specimens in the respective generations. Comparison with life histories of the species in other lakes suggests that the different patterns described reflect an evolutionary adaptation to major environmental factors. © 1978 Dr. W. Junk b.v.

TI  - Variations in body melanization impact desiccation resistance in Drosophila immigrans from Western Himalayas
VL  - 276
IS  - 2
SP  - 219-227
AB  - Ectothermic species face problems of water balance under colder and drier climatic conditions in montane localities. We investigated five ecophysiological traits (body melanization, desiccation resistance, rate of water loss or gain and body size) in eight populations of Drosophila immigrans from an altitudinal gradient (600-2226 m) in the Western Himalayas. The traits showed bell-shaped variability patterns characteristic of quantitative traits. For body melanization, we observed high heritability (0.65) on the basis of parent-offspring regression. A comparison of highland versus foothill populations showed significant divergence for all the traits except body size. Darker flies from the highlands exhibited higher desiccation resistance but reduced rate of water loss or gain as compared with lighter flies from the foothills, which showed lower desiccation resistance and higher rates of water loss as well as gain. Lack of differences in the amount of epicuticular lipids cannot account for differential reduction in cuticular water loss in altitudinal populations. However, within- as well as between-population differences in body melanization can account for changes in desiccation resistance and reduction in cuticular water loss. Analyses of highland versus lowland populations as well as in assorted darker and lighter flies from a highland population have shown differences in haemolymph and dehydration tolerance. For the mechanistic basis of desiccation resistance, our results on wild populations of Drosophila immigrans are not in agreement with those reported for laboratory-selected desiccation-resistant strains in Drosophila melanogaster. Thus, ecophysiological mechanisms could be different under laboratory versus field selection. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 38

AB  - The 70 kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp70) exhibits a broad range of chaperone functions that respond both to internal and external stresses, and its heat-induced expression both declines with age and reduces age-specific mortality rates. Here we test for changes in both longevity and the level of Hsp70-induced expression as correlated responses to selection on both heat-stress resistance and longevity in D. melanogaster. Three replicated H lines were heat-stress selected and compared to their respective non-selected controls (C lines) in the 25th generation of heat-stress selection. The direct response in heat-stress resistance was 56% in males and 38% in females. Heat-stress selection improved longevity in males at normal temperatures. All lines were subsequently subjected to one generation of truncation selection on longevity (selection intensity, i = 1.28 for H lines and 1.36 for C lines). The heat-induced Hsp70 expression seems to increase very weakly by heat-stress selection but shows a dramatic and persistent decline by selecting for long-lived flies. A mechanism of longevity selection, involving changes in Hsp70 regulation, is suggested. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 74
SP  - 109-118
AB  - Evolutionary biologists often seek to infer historical patterns of relatedness among organisms using phylogenetic methods and to gauge the evolutionary processes that determine variation among individuals in extant populations. But relatively less effort is devoted to making evolutionary biology a truly predictive science, where future evolutionary events are precisely foreseen. Accurate predictions of evolvability would be particularly useful in the evolution of infectious diseases, such as the ability to preemptively address the challenge of pathogens newly emerging in humans and other host populations. Experimental evolution of microbes allows the possibility to rigorously test hypotheses regarding pathogen evolvability. Here, we review how genetic robustness was a useful predictor in gauging which variants of RNA virus ?6 should evolve faster in a novel high-temperature environment. We also present new data on the relative survival of robust and brittle viruses across elevated temperatures and durations of ultraviolet exposure, to infer a possible mechanism for robustness. Our work suggests that virus adaptability in a new environment can be predicted given knowledge of virus canalization in the face of mutational input. These results hint that accurate predictions of virus evolvability are a realistic possibility, at least under circumstances of adaptive thermotolerance. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - An interaction between environmental temperature and genetic variation for body size for the fitness of adult. Female Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 51
IS  - 4
SP  - 1164-1174
AB  - Drosophila and other ectotherms show geographic genetic variation in body size, with larger individuals at higher latitudes and altitudes. Temperature is implicated as an important selective agent because long-term laboratory culture of Drosophila leads to the evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that, in Drosophila melanogaster, larger size is favored at lower temperatures in part because of selection on adult females. We used replicated lines of D. melanogaster artificially selected for increased and decreased wing area with constant cell area. The resulting size differences between the selected lines were due solely to differences in cell number, and thereby were similar to the cellular basis of clinal variation in body size in nature. We examined life-history traits of adult females at 18 and 25°C. Rearing for two generations at the two temperatures did not affect the extent of the size differences between lines from the different selection regimes. There was a strong interaction between temperature and size selection for both survival and lifetime reproductive success, with larger females living significantly longer and producing more offspring over their lifetime only when reared and tested in the colder environment. There was also an increase in average daily progeny production in large-line females relative to the control and small lines again, only in the colder environment. Thus, the females from the large selection lines were relatively fitter at the colder temperature. At both experimental temperatures, especially the lower one, the small- line females rescheduled their progeny production to later ages. Larger body size may have evolved at higher latitudes and altitudes because of the advantages to the adult female of being larger at lower temperatures.

TI  - Evolutionary adaptation to temperature. V. Adaptive mechanisms and correlated responses in experimental lines of Escherichia coli
VL  - 50

SP  - 493-503
AB  - We previously demonstrated temperature-specific genetic adaptation in experimental lines of Escherichia coli. Six initially identical populations were propagated for 2000 generations under each of five regimes: constant 20 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 42 degrees C, and a daily switch between 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Glucose was the sole carbon source in all cases. Here, we examine the physiological bases of adaptation to determine whether the same mechanisms evolved among the replicate lines within each thermal regime and across different regimes. Specifically, we investigate whether changes in glucose transport may account for the temperature-specific adaptation. We compared each line's direct response of fitness to glucose with its correlated response to maltose; glucose and maltose enter the cell by different pathways, but their catabolism is identical. Except for lines maintained at the ancestral temperature (37 degrees C), almost all derived lines had significantly different fitnesses (relative to their common ancestor) in glucose and maltose, supporting the hypothesis that adaptation involved changes in glucose transport. An alternative explanation, that maltose transport decayed by genetic drift, appears unlikely for reasons that are discussed. Although most lines showed evidence of temperature-specific adaptation in glucose transport, several different mechanisms may underlie these improvements, as indicated by heterogeneity in correlated responses (across temperatures and substrates) among replicate lines adapted to the same regime. This heterogeneity provides a latent pool of genetic variation for responding to environmental change.

VL  - 135
IS  - 1
SP  - 35-40
AB  - Genotype-by-temperature interaction is a necessary condition for adaptive evolution of fitness traits as a response to temperature. Several fitness-related traits (developmental time, pre-adult survival, thorax and wing lengths, and wing loading) were measured in laboratory-reared D. buzzatii from four populations sampled at different altitudes in north-western Argentina: a lowland population (407 m a.s.l.), two populations from intermediate altitude (780 to 950 in a.s.l.), and a highland population (2380 in a.s.l.). Temperature is the main climatic difference between the collection sites: lowland but not highland populations are exposed to physiologically high temperatures during both spring and summer in nature. Three growth temperatures (20, 25 and 30degreesC) were used to test for population-by-temperature interactions. Both developmental time and pre-adult survival exhibit highly significant population-by-temperature interaction. Preadult Survival at 30degreesC is significantly higher in lowland than in highland populations, but not so at lower growth temperatures (20 and 25degreesC). Both wing length and wing loading show no population-by-temperature interaction, indicating that these traits are not the direct targets of thermal adaptation in nature. Wing loading is higher in highland than in lowland populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger selection in the highland population. This hypothesis is consistent with ecological observations in both types of populations. There is no obvious among-population relationship between developmental time and body size, even though both traits are related within populations in a well-known trade-off. Overall, thermal adaptation is evident for developmental time and pre-adult survival but not for size-related traits.

TI  - Combined effects of temperature and body weight on growth and protein utilization of the common octopus, Octopus vulgaris
VL  - 249
IS  - 1
SP  - 245-256
AB  - Octopus vulgaris is considered a serious candidate for rearing, in terms of its biological and market potential: easy adaptation to captivity conditions, high growth rate and high market price. The aim of this study was to examine the combined effects of temperature and body weight on specific growth rate (SGR, % day(-1)), absolute growth rate (AGR, g day(-1)), absolute feeding rate (AFR, g day(-1)), feed efficiency (FE, %), protein retention efficiency (PRE: [g protein gain g protein ingested(-1)] x 100), energy retention efficiency (ERE: [kJ gain kJ ingested(-1)] x 100), proximate composition and PIE ratio (protein/energy) of the common octopus. The experiments were performed in a closed system with controlled temperature (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). The octopuses were fed on squids (Loligo vulgaris). In the multiple regression equations estimated for SGR, AGR, AFR, FE, PRE and ERE, the linear and quadratic effects of temperature, as well as the linear effects of body weight were significant. In addition, the interaction effects of temperature and body weight were significant for SGR, AGR, FE, PRE and ERE; the temperature for maximum response decreased with increasing size, being 25 degrees C for octopuses of 50-150 g and 15 degrees C for animals of 200-600 g. The weight exponent in the relationships of these indices vs. body weight decreased with increasing temperature. The levels of SGR, FE, PRE and ERE varied slightly with temperature in individuals of 150-200 g, and the respective response surfaces showed a plateau within this range of body sizes independently of temperature. The temperature for maximum AFR was estimated to be 21.88 degrees C independently of body weight. Proximate composition and PIE ratio of octopuses were not affected by temperature or body weight. It is concluded that temperature should be adjusted according to the body weight of O. vulgaris for optimizing the economic viability of rearing. Temperature should be high for small individuals (50-150 g) and should be reduced gradually in order for animals larger than 200 g to be reared at low temperature. Therefore, O. vulgaris should be reared in closed systems with temperature control. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temporal resolution of biological and physical influences on bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli egg abundance near a river-plume frontal zone
VL  - 237
SP  - 257-269
AB  - Bay anchovy egg abundance in the Manatee River estuary, Florida, was compared with conditions in the spawning ground before and after spawning to distinguish prey-supply-based spawning responses from post-spawning advective effects. Plume fronts were a prominent feature of the spawning ground. Egg distribution, copepod distribution and front development were surveyed 25 times across a wide range of freshwater inflow conditions. Surface-front strength (maximum interpolated salinity slope) was strongly correlated with the size of the frontal zone, as defined by surface areas having slopes &gt;1 psu km-1. Eggs were most abundant landward of the frontal zone at a location with consistently high abundance of the copepod Acartia tonsa, which is consumed by adult and larval bay anchovies. Large, significant changes in egg abundance were observed over both long (seasons) and short (&lt;3 d) periods (Tukey 95% HSD multiple range tests). An El Niño-associated flood event caused the rapid evolution of a large, seaward-moving frontal system that initially had a negative effect on egg abundance. Spawning resumed in reduced salinity following passage of the front, demonstrating a level of plasticity in spawning response to salinity change. A stepwise regression model explained 92% of the variation in egg abundance and suggested that tidal amplitude was not a significant determinant of abundance. Instead, egg abundance appeared to be determined initially by pre-spawning prey supply and temperature, and subsequently by variable retention behind the frontal zone.

TI  - High-temperature stress and the evolution of thermal resistance in Drosophila
VL  - 83
SP  - 175-190
AB  - The evolution of thermal resistance and acclimation is reviewed at the population level using populations and isofemale lines of Drosophila buzzatii and D. melanogaster originating from different climatic regions. In general, ample genetic variation for thermal resistance was found within and among populations. A rough correlation between the climate of origin and thermal resistance was apparent. Acclimation at a non-lethal temperature led to a significant increase in survival after heat shock, and recurrent acclimation events generally increased survival even further. Acclimation effects lasted over several days, but this effect decreased gradually with time since acclimation. Protein studies showed that the concentration of Hsp70 in adult flies is greatly increased by acclimation and thereafter gradually decreases with time. For populations with relatively high survival at one life stage, survival often was low at other life stages. Furthermore, selection on different life stages showed that a selection response in one life stage did not necessarily result in a correlated response in another. These observations indicate that different mechanisms or genes at least in part are responsible for or are expressed at different developmental stages. Selection for increased resistance was successful despite low heritabilities for the trait. Survival and fertility were compared between acclimated and non-acclimated flies, and a cost of expressing the "heat shock response" was identified in that increased survival after acclimation was accompanied by reduced fertility. The relative costs increased under nutritional stress. Metabolic rate was genetically variable but did not correlate with temperature resistance. The more resistant lines, however, often had shorter developmental time. Inbreeding reduced thermal stress tolerance of adult flies, but it did not reduce tolerance of embryos that possibly are exposed to strong natural selection for thermal stress resistance. In general, inbreeding may reduce stress resistance, and thus multiple stressful events may account for increased inbreeding depression in harsh environments.

AB  - Starvation resistance is closely associated with fitness in natural populations of many organisms. It often co-varies with longevity and is a relevant target for understanding the evolution of aging.We selected for increased starvation resistance in the seasonally polyphenic butterfly Bicyclus anynana in a warm, wet-seasonal environment over 17 generations. We measured the response to selection for two selected lines compared to that of an unselected stock. Results show an increase in survival under adult starvation of 50%-100%. In addition, selection lines showed an increase in life span under normal adult feeding of 30%-50%. Female reproduction was changed toward laying fewer but larger eggs. The results indicate a sex-specific response to selection: females reallocated resources toward a more durable body, whereas males appeared to increase starvation resistance through changed metabolic rate. The phenotype produced by artificial selection resembles the form that occurs in the cool, dry-season environment, which suggests that selection has targeted the regulatory mechanisms for survival that are also involved in the suite of traits (including starvation resistance) central to the adaptive plastic response of this butterfly to seasonal conditions. In general, these results imply that the regulation of life span involves mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity. © 2007 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

TI  - Late Pleistocene climate change and Paleolithic cultural evolution in northern China: Implications from the Last Glacial Maximum
VL  - 9
SP  - 105
AB  - Temporal and spatial patterns in archeological data from Pleistocene north China suggest strong correlations between climate change and culture change, but only in extreme cases. In these cases, climate has an immediate impact on human mobility, which is severely constrained during the pronounced cold/dry intervals of the Pleistocene. As high mobility becomes incompatible with the environmental limitations of extreme intervals, such as the Last Glacial Maximum, previously disparate mobile human groups aggregate and compete for limited and spatially segregated resources. During such times, regional cultural variation evolves in isolation and natural selection acts on group-level adaptations, facilitating the evolution of cohesive and cooperative social networks. The process of group selection further allows for the rapid diffusion of cultural and technological innovation and may explain the rapid diffusion of microblade technology throughout northeast Asia during the post-glacial period. While climate change does present challenges to human survival and may promote alternative adaptive strategies, rapid cultural evolution is driven primarily by group formation, between-group competition, and the mechanics of cultural transmission. The degree to which climate change mediates these interactions is the extent to which climate should be implicated in cultural evolution. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temperature‐related divergence in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster. II. Correlation between fitness and body dimensions
VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 235-251
AB  - From a laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon), reared for more than 20 years at 18° C, a new population was derived and maintained at 28° C for 8 years. The chromosomal and cytoplasmic contribution to genetic divergence between the two populations was estimated. Six body traits and reproductive fitness were taken into account. The third chromosome is responsible for the adaptive difference for temperature between the two lines. Temperature‐selected genes which control body size are located on the second and third chromosomes, although the contribution of each chromosome depends on the environment in which the flies develop. The correlation between the chromosomal and cytoplasmic contributions to different traits and fitness, changes with temperature. At 28° C the correlation between fitness and each body trait is proportional to the response to selection exhibited by each of them, but this is not true at 18° C. Body size has, therefore, an adaptive significance in relation to temperature, which is expressed only in the environment where selection occurs. Cytoplasmic genes affect almost all characters to an extent similar to that of chromosomal genes. Inter‐chromosomal and nucleo‐cytoplasmic interactions are present and also change with temperature. In general, genes selected in a given environment produce greater phenotypic changes in that environment than in another. The population that experienced both temperatures is fitter in both environments, suggesting that the capacity to adapt to warm temperatures depends on genes other than those which are involved in the adaptation to cold.

AB  - We measured the feeding rate of individual (0.6–12.2 g) young-of-the-year ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) on the live eggs of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) at 3, 5, and 9°C in the laboratory. These temperatures were selected because they covered the range of lake temperatures over which eggs of most Great Lakes coregonines would be most vulnerable to predation by ruffe. Ruffe readily consumed lake whitefish eggs, and regression analysis showed consumption increased with ruffe size and water temperature. Mean daily egg consumption as a percent of mean ruffe body weight was 0.25% at 3°C, 0.59% at 5°C, and 1.00% at 9°C. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 32

SP  - 322-327
AB  - Low temperature and desiccation stress are thought to be mechanistically similar in insects, and several studies indicate that there is a degree of cross-tolerance between them, such that increased cold tolerance results in greater desiccation tolerance and vice versa. This assertion is tested at an evolutionary scale by examining basal cold tolerance, rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and chill coma recovery in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for desiccation resistance (with controls for both selection and concomitant starvation) for over 50 generations. All of the populations display a RCH response, and there is no effect of selection regime on RCH or basal cold tolerance, although there are differences in basal cold tolerance between sampling dates, apparently related to inter-individual variation in development time. Flies selected for desiccation tolerance recover from chill coma slightly, but significantly, faster than control and starvation-control flies. These findings provide little support for cross-tolerance between survival of near-lethal cold and desiccation stress in D. melanogaster. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Kaufman's NK model for genetic evolution and adaption is analyzed for for K=N-1. In this case it describes adaptive walks on random fitness landscapes, and its dynamics is equivalent to the Metropolis algorithm for Derrida's random-energy model at zero temperature. We derive analytical expressions for the average length and duration of adaptive walks, and for the variance about these averages. The results are exact to leading order in N, the number of genes. We also find that the lengths of walks are Poisson distributed to leading order in 1/lnN, and that the duration of walks essentially is exponentially distributed to leading order in 1/N. © 1992 The American Physical Society.

TI  - Selection for bristle numbers in some unrelated strains of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-49
AB  - 1. 1. 4 newly raptured wild strains of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for high and low number of bristles on the sternopleural areas and on the 4th and 5th abdominal sternites. 2 wild type laboratory strains, which had been cultured for at least two decades, were selected for high and low sternopleural bristle number. 2. 2. All the wild strains responded to selection, except in one case of high abdominal bristle selection. The maximum increase of sternopleural bristle number was 111%, of abdominal bristle number 36%. The maximum reduction was 36% for sternopleural and 59% for abdominal bristle number. In the laboratory strains a separation between the high and the low line amounting to at most 1-2 bristles was obtained. 3. 3. The intraculture variances of the selection lines usually decreased below those of the unselected populations. 3 of the AL-lines showed in some generations an abnormally high variation accompanied by reduced mean bristle number and low fecundity. 4. 4. The range of phenotypic expression was changed by the selection, and transgressed in all the SH- and most of the AL- and AH-lines the limits of the unselected populations. In the SL-lines, selection was unable to reduce the bristle numbers below those already present in the unselected populations, except in one case of late response. 5. 5. Reversed selection was effective after about 20 generations of sternopleural selection in one strain, but not after 50 generations in another. The influence of relaxed selection was studied at the end of the selection. The immediate consequences were a reduction of about 1 bristle in the SH-lines and increased fluctuations towards lower generation means in the AH-lines. The AL- and SL-lines were not changed. The lapse of 1 year (=25-30 generations) without selection caused a reversion almost to the unselected level in the two remaining SH-lines, and a small but significant increase in the AL- and SL-lines. Renewed selection was ineffective. The AH-lines were not changed during the uncontrolled period, and renewed selection brought the mean back to the selection level. 6. 6. The behaviour of the selection lines is discussed in relation to Mather's theory of balanced systems of polygenes, and it is concluded that a + and - balance cannot account for the results obtained. Instead, it is suggested that different genetical systems are responsible for the increase and the reduction of bristle number. More segregating factors seem to influence the increase than the reduction of sternopleural bristle number. 7. 7. The high intraculture variation in the AL-lines is explained by a delayed effect of the parental phenotype on the penetrance of a gene causing low abdominal bristle number. Other examples of similiar phenomena are given, and it is shown that influence of the parental phenotype is also exercised in the AH-lines. Long term fluctuations in the abdominal selection lines are interpreted as modifying influences of the genetical environment, which is modulated by natural selection. 8. 8. Genetical and non-genetical correlations were computed for 4 types of bristles: sternopleural, abdominal, coxal and frontal bristles. The non-genetical correlations were computed from the individual bristle numbers of the unselected strains and of late generations of Alg SH and Alg SL. Only one significant non-genetical correlation was found, viz. between sternopleural and abdominal bristle numbers. The genetical correlations were computed from the means of late generations of the selection lines and their unselected origins. The correlations found were all positive, which indicates a pleiotropic influence of the bristle determining genes. Following a method indicated by S. Wright, the variation was divided into parts depending on general, group and special factors. The non-genetical variation was mostly locally determined, and indicated no group factors. The genetical variation was more dependent on general factors and 3 systems of group factors were indicated, one correlating sternopleurals and coxals, one sternopleurals and frontals, and one abdominals and frontals. A survey of the development of the imaginal hypoderm is given, and it is suggested that the sternopleural-frontal correlation is caused by the close initial position of the imaginal discs producing the bristle forming tissues, whereas the correlations sternopleurals-coxals and abdominals-frontals are caused by simultaneous determination of the bristles. The non-genetical correlation between sternopleural and abdominal bristle numbers prove that the individual fluctuation in bristle number are not wholly locally determined. 9. 9. Selections in opposite directions from the same origin usually caused correlated responses of other bristle types in corresponding directions. Some cases of reversed responses were found. It is assumed that this depends on competetive gene action rather than on accidental linkage of locally acting genes. 10. 10. High temperature treatment was used in order to exaggerate the crossing over frequency and hereby influence the responses to sternopleural selection from the 4 wild strains and a pooled population from 3 unrelated strains. The end results of selection were not generally improved by the treatment, but the responses were accelerated in the high selection lines, proving that the genes for increased sternopleural bristle number are linked. 11. 11. Crosses were performed between 2 SH-lines and between 4 SL-lines from different origins. Ör SH and Ör SL were crossed to inbred, unselected lines from the same original strain. The mean bristle level of the F1:s and the end results of selections from the cross products indicated that the genes causing extreme bristle numbers were recessive to those maintaining the normal numbers, and that identical genes had been fixed in lines originating from the same strain and in the SH-lines from different strains. The crosses confirmed that more factors were segregating in the SH- than in the SL-line crosses. 12. 12. Varying linkage conditions, evolved by aid of natural selection, are suggested as a possible explanation for the different behaviour of the selection lines. © 1955.

TI  - Modularity and intrinsic evolvability of Hsp90-buffered change
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Hsp90 controls dramatic phenotypic transitions in a wide array of morphological features of many organisms. The genetic-background dependence of specific abnormalities and their response to laboratory selection suggested Hsp90 could be an 'evolutionary capacitor', allowing developmental variation to accumulate as neutral alleles under normal conditions and manifest selectable morphological differences during environmental stress. The relevance of Hsp90-buffered variation for evolution has been most often challenged by the idea that large morphological changes controlled by Hsp90 are unconditionally deleterious. To address this issue, we tested an Hsp90-buffered abnormality in Drosophila for unselected pleiotropic effects and correlated fitness costs. Up to 120-fold differences in penetrance among six highly related selection lines, started from an initially small number of flies and rapidly selected for and against a deformed eye trait (dfe), did not translate into measurable differences in any of several tests of viability, lifespan or competitive fitness. Nor were 17 dfe Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with fitness effects in over 1,400 recombinant lines. Our ability to detect measurable effects of inbreeding, media environment and the white mutation in the selection line backgrounds independent of dfe penetrance suggests that, within the limitations of laboratory tests of fitness, this large morphological change controlled by Hsp90 was selectable independent of strong, correlated and unconditionally deleterious effects - abundant, polygenic variation hidden by Hsp90 allows potentially deleterious alleles to be readily replaced during selection by less deleterious alleles with similar phenotypic effects. Hsp90 links environmental stress with the expression of developmental variation controlling unprecedented morphological plasticity. As outlined here and in the companion paper of this issue, the complex genetic architecture of Hsp90-buffered variation supports a remarkable modularity of Hsp90 effects on quantitative and qualitative phenotypes, consistent with the 'Hsp90 capacitor hypothesis' and standard quantitative genetic models of threshold traits. © 2006 Carey et al.

AB  - The present study was conducted to compare body weight, daily weight gain, relative growth rate, food intake, food conversion efficiency, abdominal fat weight, thyroid weight, plasma T4 concentration, body temperature, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and heat production among three Japanese-quail lines selected for body weight: a random bred line (RR) and lines for large (LL) or small (SS) body weight. 2. T4 concentration increased in the order SS, RR, LL in both sexes and did not vary significantly between sexes; the SS line had a significantly higher value than that of the LL line. 3. The body temperatures of SS, RR and LL lines were 42·45, 42·03 and 41·25°C in males, and 42·7, 42·03 and 41·63°C in females. 4. The oxygen consumptions of SS, RR and LL lines were 63·4, 46·0 and 43·8 ml/kgW0.75 min. in males, and 61·4, 44·8 and 37·2 in females. The value for SS was significantly higher than those of RR and LL lines in both sexes (P&lt; 0·01). The carbon dioxide productions of SS, RR and LL lines were 31·8, 33·8 and 27·3 ml/kg IT0·75 min. in males, and 31·2, 31·9 and 27·3 in females. In both sexes, that of the LL line was significantly lower than those of the SS and RR lines (P&lt; 0·01). 6. The heat productions of SS, RR and LL lines were 1·178, 0·994 and 0·842 KJ/kgW0.75 min. in males, and 1·142, 0·879 and 0·736 in females. In both sexes, the heat production of the SS line was higher than those of the RR and LL lines (P&lt; 0·01). 7. It was demonstrated that selection for body weight in Japanese quail was accompanied not only by changes in growth rate and conversion efficiency but also by changes in thyroid function and energy metabolism. © 1994, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Physiological ecology of frillneck lizards in a seasonal tropical environment
VL  - 106
IS  - 1
SP  - 49-56
AB  - The frillneck lizard, Chlamydosaurus kingii, is a conspicuous component of the fauna of the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia during the wet season, but it is rarely seen in the dry season. Previous studies have demonstrated that during the dry season the field metabolic rate (FMR) is only about one-quarter of the wet-season rate, and one factor involved in this seasonal drop is a change in the behavioural thermoregulation of the species such that lower body temperatures (Tbs) are selected during dry-season days. Here we examine other factors that could be responsible for the seasonal change in FMR: standard metabolic rates (SMR) and activity. Samples from stomach flushing revealed that the lizards in the dry season continued to feed, but the volume of food was half as much as in the wet season. SMR in the laboratory was 30% less in the dry season. During the dry season, the energy expended by the lizards is 60.4 kJ kg-1 day-1 less than during the wet season. Combining laboratory and field data, we determined the relative contribution of the factors involved in this energy savings: 10% can be attributed to lower nighttime Tb, 12% is attributable to lower daytime Tb, 12% is attributable to decreased metabolism, and the remaining 66% is attributable to other activities (including e.g. locomotion, reproductive costs, digestion). Calculations indicate that if FMR did not drop in the dry season the lizards would not survive on the observed food intake during this season. Seasonal analysis of blood plasma and urine indicated an accumulation of some electrolytes during the dry season suggesting modest levels of water stress.

AB  - Cuttlefish eggs provide useful material for studies devoted to cephalopod embryology. Live observations of embryogenesis are particularly easy given the large size of the embryo. The eggs are readily obtained when aquarium maintenance of field-collected adults or laboratory culture of cuttlefish are possible. Setting up such a culture allows one to obtain eggs year round, in contrast to field collection of eggs (by trawling, dredging, diving) which is restricted to certain periods of the year. Beach-collected eggs should be used with caution since they may have been exposed to adverse temperature conditions before collection. A careful study of such adverse effects obtained under controlled experimental conditions, however, may provide important information on developmental mechanisms involved in ecological adaptation and evolutionary change.

AB  - 1. Lines selected for high and low values of percentage residual food consumption (PRFC) were compared. 2. Several traits were recorded in order to determine the nature of variation in PRFC: heat production, body temperature, plumage condition, size of comb, wattle and shank, digestibility, abdominal fat content, yolk size and egg quality traits. 3. The difference in adjusted heat production between high and low PRFC groups increased during selection and in the last generation was 120 kj/metabolic body size. Half of the observed difference was attributable to differences in activity. It was found that proportion of yolk, abdominal fat content, total featherless areas and plumage condition made significant but small contributions to the variation in PRFC. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 140

SP  - 141-149
AB  - Ontogenetic shifts in microhabitat use are widespread among taxa and can result in drastic shifts in thermal habitat among age classes. Likewise, geographic variation in climate along latitudinal gradients can cause differences in thermal environments among populations of a species. Using a common garden design, we examined four populations of a single species of semi-aquatic snake, Nerodia rhombifer, to determine whether ontogenetic shifts in habitat use (and/or body size) and latitudinal differences in ambient temperature have resulted in evolutionary changes in thermal tolerance. We found ontogenetic differences in thermal tolerance for all populations, with neonates tolerating temperatures 2degreesC higher than adults, a pattern that is consistent with ontogenetic shifts in body size and microhabitat use in this species. There were differences in thermal tolerance among latitudes in neonates, suggesting genetic differences among populations, but adults showed no latitudinal differences. In combination, the increased thermal tolerance of neonates and the age-specific response to latitude suggest individuals may be most sensitive to selection on thermal tolerance as neonates. Although latitudinal differences exist in neonates, their tolerances were not ranked according to latitude, suggesting the effects of some other local factor (e.g., microclimate) may be important. Lastly, among neonates, females tolerate higher temperatures than males. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Potential constraints on evolution: sexual dimorphism and the problem of protandry in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana
VL  - 87
IS  - 4
SP  - 395-405
AB  - The earlier mean adult emergence between males and females, protandry, has been well studied mathematically and in comparative studies. However, quantitative and evolutionary genetic research on protandry is scarce. The butterfly, Bicyclus anynana exhibits protandry and here we selected for each of the different combinations of male and female development time in this species, thus including direct selection on protandry (i.e., FAST, fast males and fast females; SLOW, slow males and slow females; FMSF, fast males and slow females; and SMFF, slow males and fast females). After eight generations of selection there was no significant response for increased or decreased protandry, whereas selection for increased or decreased development time in both sexes (FAST or SLOW) was successful. Continued selection (&gt; 30 generations) for decreased or increased protandry showed a significant difference between the FMSFC and SMFFC lines (subscript c for continued selection), which was of the same magnitude as the nonsignificant difference observed between the FMSF and SMFF lines at generation eight. This indicated that the initial selection was successful, but that the difference between the lines did not increase with continued selection. Our results also indicate that the genetic covariance across sexes for development time is near unity. Interestingly, lines selected for decreased protandry (SMFF) had lower egg-to-adult survival, and broods from these lines had lower rates of egg hatching. This suggests that interactions with fertility might constrain certain directions of change in patterns of protandry. Moreover, selection yielded a change in the ratio of male to female development time for slow lines, suggesting that some amount of sex-specific genetic variance for development time is still present in this population. The FMSFC line showed the largest effect of selection on protandry, mainly through an effect on female developmental time. Lastly, our results show that temperature has an effect on the amount of protandry in the selected lines. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of this species and the evolution of protandry.

VL  - 34

SP  - 201-210
AB  - Closely related clonal and sexual populations may coexist in spite of the theorized lower potential for the evolution of clonal genotypes. Water frogs of the Rana esculenta complex have hemiclonal inheritance but most populations coexist with one of the recombinant parental species. We examine whether hemiclonal lineages may counterbalance their limitations of genetic variability by the adoption of one or more non-exclusive mechanisms: the general-purpose genotype or the frozen niche-variation model. Three coexisting hemiclones of the hybrid R. esculenta (GUT1, GUT2, GUT3) and both parental species (syntopic R. lessonae and allopatric R. ridibunda) were raised at two larval densities to examine morphological traits affecting jumping performance at the time of metamorphosis and size-independent jumping ability tested at three temperatures. Hind leg length and body mass at metamorphosis, traits that explain most of the variance in jumping performance, differed across hemiclones of R. esculenta. Metamorphs of hemiclone GUT1 had the longest hindlimbs and were bigger than metamorphs of the other hemiclones at low larval density but not at high density. Size adjusted jumping performance exhibited a significant genotype by larval density interaction. Metamorphs of GUT1 showed maximal jumping performance when raised at low larval density but at high density metamorphs of GUT2 were the best jumpers. In addition, within particular traits, differences were found between hemiclones across densities. These results appear to be consistent with both frozen niche-variation model and the general-purpose genotype model. Comparison with parental species revealed syntopic R. lessonae was smaller than hemiclones at metamorphosis but conversely exhibited better size-adjusted jumping performance when raised at low larval density. Temperature affected size-adjusted jumping performance only for frogs raised at low larval density but not for those raised at high larval densities. There was no significant temperature by hemiclone interaction.

TI  - The Effects of Bidirectional Selection for Social Dominance on Agonistic Behavior and Sex Ratios in the Paradise Fish (Macropodus Opercularis)
VL  - 90
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-44
AB  - A population of paradise fish (Macropodus opercularis) was subjected to five generations of bidirectional selection for social dominance in order to investigate correlated changes in agonistic behaviors. In addition to the high and low dominance lines (HD and LD respectively), a third dominance line was created through selection for individuals closest to the median in dominance success. The MD line provided standard opponents for members of the other two dominance lines and served as a control for inbreeding effects. The response to selection was asymmetrical. After five generations of selection the LD line had diverged significantly from the MD line, but the HD line had not. None of the three factors known to cause an asymmetrical response to selection (directional gene frequencies, directional allelic dominance and inbreeding depression) can account for the response to selection found here. The divergence of the HD and LD lines with respect to dominance success was not accompanied by any changes in the measures of aggressiveness. The F-5 generation of the HD and LD lines did not differ significantly for any of the measures of aggressiveness used here, indicating that social dominance and aggressiveness are not intimately related. An alteration in the sex ratio of the HD line was an unanticipated byproduct of selection. The F-5 generation of this selection line contained an overwhelming preponderance of males. Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that environmental factors such as temperature and the degree of crowding probably influence sexual differentiation in this species. The social crowding factor, in particular, was found to be important and was investigated in a preliminary way. For all three dominance lines it was found that as crowding increased, so did the proportion of females in a brood. Fish raised in physical isolation showed a strong tendency to become males. These results suggest that sexual differentiation is socially mediated. Within a given brood, fish of high dominance status tended to become males and fish of low dominance status tended to become females. The results from the isolation-reared fish indicate that it is not dominance per se that promotes maleness, but rather, the condition of being undominated. Under uncrowded conditions an individual is, on average, dominated by fewer fish than under crowded conditions. Above and beyond this density related trend in the sex ratios, however, there were significant between-the-line differences. The HD line showed a greater proportion of males than the other dominance lines, over all density conditions. It appears that selection for high social dominance constituted selection for maleness. This response to selection indicates a continuum of genetic sex in this species and a polyfactorial mode of inheritance. The alteration in the sex ratios might also explain the asymmetrical response to selection for social dominance, in that the HD line did in fact exhibit a greater proportion of dominant fish, though not a greater proportion of dominant males, than the other two dominance lines. As such, the asymmetrical response to selection would be an artifact of the measuring procedures. © 1984, Brill. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural populations are normally exposed to substantial environmental stress. The consequences of stress include elevated metabolic costs and additive genetic variability. From the former, preferred habitats should be located in environments corresponding to minimum total energy expenditure. This tendency occurs in the field for behavioral adaptation of Drosophila to variable temperature (and humidity) conditions. Laboratory studies of resource preference in Drosophila suggest a low genetic variability. However, under more stressful field conditions, genetic variability should be higher. Habitat preference studies under stressful conditions therefore need to be emphasized in modeling situations in nature. © 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - In the first days of life, the daily evaporative loss from premature neonates can reach up to 20% of body mass. Such loss can be reduced by increasing the air humidity inside the incubator. Neither passive humidification nor open loop systems allow high humidity rates to be maintained or easily controlled: at 34°C, the maximum levels vary with the system from 40% to 77% of relative humidity. The skin evaporative exchanges between the neonate and the environment are directly proportional to the water vapour partial pressure difference between the neonate's skin and the air. An active closed loop system has been designed, which permits reliable and accurate control of humidity according to the water vapour partial pressure set, between 1 and 6kPa, in an air temperature range of 28-39°C. It is characterised by variations of about 0.05 kPa around the set value and a maximum humidification speed of 0.25 kPa min-1. The algorithm is based on optimal control and the dynamic programming principles. Test results place this active system above usual systems for its power, precision and adaptability. It is an exploitable tool in fundamental and clinical research, to precisely study the humidity effects on neonatal comfort and thermo-regulation evolution.

AB  - Climate change will alter natural selection on native plant populations. Little information is available to predict how selection will change in the future and how populations will respond. Insight can be obtained by comparing selection regimes in current environments to selection regimes in environments similar to those predicted for the future. To mimic predicted temporal change in climate, three natural populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were sampled from a climate gradient in the Great Plains and progeny of formal crosses were reciprocally planted back into common gardens across this climate gradient. In each garden, native populations produced significantly more seed than the other populations, providing strong evidence of local adaptation. Phenotypic selection analysis conducted by site showed that plants with slower reproductive development, more leaves, and thicker leaves were favored in the most southern garden. Evidence of clinal variation in selection regimes was also found; selection coefficients were ordered according to the latitude of the common gardens. The adaptive value of native traits was indicated by selection toward the mean of local populations. Repeated clinal patterns in linear and nonlinear selection coefficients among populations and within and between sites were found. To the extent that temporal change in climate into the future will parallel the differences in selection across this spatial gradient, this study suggests that selection regimes will be displaced northward and different trait values will be favored in natural populations.

AB  - A theory for describing evolution as adaptive walks by a finite population with M walkers (M greater than or equal to 1) on an anisotropic Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape is presented, from a thermodynamical point of view. Introducing the 'free fitness' as the sum of a fitness term and an entropy term and 'evolutionary force' as the gradient of free fitness on a fitness coordinate, we demonstrate that the behavior of these theoretical walkers is almost consistent with the thermodynamical schemes. The major conclusions are as follows: (1) an adaptive walk (=evolution) is driven by an evolutionary force in the direction in which free fitness increases; (2) the expectation of the climbing, rate obeys an equation analogous to the Einstein relation in Brownian motion; (3) the standard deviation of the climbing rate is a quantity analogous to the mean thermal energy of a particle, kT (x constant). In addition, on the interpretation that the walkers climb the landscape by absorbing 'fitness information' from the surroundings, we succeeded in quantifying the fitness information and formulating a macroscopic scheme from an informational point of view.

VL  - 74

AB  - Reduced rates of genetic recombination are often associated with reduced genetic variability and levels of adaptation. Several different evolutionary processes, collectively known as Hill-Robertson (HR) effects, have been proposed as causes of these correlates of recombination. Here, we use DNA sequence polymorphism and divergence data from the noncrossing over dot chromosome of Drosophila to discriminate between two of the major forms of HR effects: selective sweeps and background selection. This chromosome shows reduced levels of silent variability and reduced effectiveness of selection. We show that neither model fits the data on variability. We propose that, in large genomic regions with restricted recombination, HR effects among nonsynonymous mutations undermine the effective strength of selection, so that their background selection effects are weakened. This modified model fits the data on variability and also explains why variability in very large nonrecombining genomes is not completely wiped out. We also show that HR effects of this type can produce an individual selection advantage to recombination, as well as greatly reduce the mean fitness of nonrecombining genomes and genomic regions. © 2009 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

VL  - 143

SP  - 77-83
AB  - Clinal analysis for fitness-related traits provides a well-known approach to investigate adaptive evolution. Several fitness-related traits (developmental time, thorax length, wing length and wing loading) were measured at two laboratory generations (G7 and G33) of D. buzzatii from an altitudinal gradient from northwestern Argentina, where significant thermal differences persist. Developmental time (DT) was positively correlated with altitude of origin of population. Further, DT was negatively correlated with maximal mean temperature at the site of origin of population, and this thermal variable decreases with altitude. Wing loading tended to be larger in highland than in lowland populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger selection pressure in highland populations. Developmental time showed a significant increase with laboratory generation number. There was no significant correlation between developmental time and body size across populations along the altitudinal cline of DT. This result illustrates that developmental time and body size do not always evolve in the same direction, even though both traits are often positively and genetically correlated in a well-known tradeoff in Drosophila.

VL  - 10

AB  - Aim: To explore the changes of blood gas indexes of basketball players of Chinese University Basketball Association (CUBA) in various hypoxia conditions. Methods: Ten healthy male basketball players, who participated in the training of the basketball team of Hunan Normal University, aged (20.3±1.3) years, body height (190.6±5.9) cm, body mass (80.57±7.77) kg, training time (6.0±1.8) years, without experience of living in high altitude for generations, were selected. After maximal exercise, the subjects were given graded 2 hours of hypoxia for one week. The blood gas indexes at quiet state were measured on the next day after training with 30 minutes, interval between 2 players and one person each time: 1The players pulled ligament for 5 minutes after 13 minutes of warm-up, which referred to 8 minutes running around the basketball ground with heart rate of 120 times per minutes. 2Maximal exercise for 20 minutes: Return exercise of foot movement with freehand for the whole ground. 3The blood gas was immediately tested after maximal exercise, which was finished in one minute with mean heart rate of 189 times per minute. 4After the test, the players entered the hypobaric oxygen chamber for 2 hours, followed by collection of brachial artery blood to test the blood gas indexes in hypoxia condition (PO2 14.6 and 11.2 kPa). The blood gas analyzer was used to measure the base excess (BE), base excess of extracellular fluid (BEecf), buffer base (BB), HCO3- and pH value. Results: Ten players all entered the result analysis. 1Comparison of blood gas indexes at quiet state and the immediate moment after maximal exercise: The indexes, which represented the buffer capacity, including BE, BEecf, BB, HCO3- and pH value were decreased after maximal exercise, but there was no significant difference (P&gt; 0.05). 2Comparison of blood gas indexes at the immediate moment after maximal exercise and hypoxia condition (PO2 14.6 kPa): The BE, BEecf, BB, HCO3- and pH value were increased after intervention of hypoxia at immediate moment after maximal exercise, but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). 3Comparison of blood gas indexes at the immediate moment after maximal exercise and hypoxia condition (PO2 11.2 kPa): The indexes, which represented the buffer capacity, including BE, BEecf, BB, HCO3- and pH value were decreased after maximal exercise, but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). 4Comparison of blood gas indexes between PO2 14.6 and 11.2 kPa condition: With the increase of hypoxia, the indexes, which represented the buffer capacity, including BE, BEecf, BB, HCO3- and pH value were obviously increased, but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: 1The buffer systemic capacity increases after 2 hours hypoxia following maximal exercise in normal oxygen condition. 2With the increase of hypoxia (PO2 14.6 kPa decreased to 11.2 kPa), the buffer capacity significantly increased. 3The involvement of hypoxia after maximal exercise in normal oxygen condition is an effective method to make the buffer system appear well adaptive changes, which can provide some evidence for the training of basketball players in CUBA.

VL  - 55

SP  - 2194-2202
AB  - Stressful environments may be considered as those that reduce fitness, sometimes due in part to the increased metabolic expenditure required to sustain life. Direct adaptation to a stressor is expected to increase fitness and reduce maintenance metabolism, with the latter leading to increased biomass production. In this study, we test the general hypothesis that such adaptation to one stressor can preadapt organisms to novel stressful environments. Six lines of Escherichia coli propagated for 2000 generations at 41-42 degreesC (42 group), a stressful temperature, were compared to six control lines propagated for 2000 generations-at 37 degreesC (37 group) and to the common ancestor of both groups. We assayed biovolume yield (a measure of growth efficiency) and competitive fitness in the 42 group's selective high temperature environment as well as five novel stressful environments-acid, alkali, ethanol, high osmolarity and peroxide. As previously reported, at high temperature the 42 group had both higher yield and fitness than the 37 group and ancestor. In the novel environments, the 42 group generally produced yields higher than the 37 group (and marginally higher than the ancestor), but we found no differences in competitive fitness among the 37 and 42 groups and the ancestor. We also found that the performance of lines within groups was not correlated across stressful environments for either yield or relative fitness. Because previous adaptation to one stressor did not improve our measure of Darwinian fitness in novel stressful environments, we conclude that the 42 group shows no useful preadaptation, or cross-tolerance, to these types of environments.

VL  - 133

AB  - The ignition of a solid exposed to a step in surface temperature, including the effect of the curvature, is analyzed by means of large activation energy asymptotics in the whole range of values of the Damköhler number, Da, which lead to a thermal runaway. For very large values of Da the chemical reaction takes place in a surface boundary layer. The evolution of the temperature in this layer is described by a universal problem. Its solution contains a mathematical singularity, which identifies the ignition event occuring at an ignition time much smaller than the conduction time through the solid. When Da is large but of the same order that the square of the nondimensional activation energy, the ignition time becomes of the order of the conduction time. The structure of the ignition problem is identical to that in the previous case, but its solution depends on the body size and shape. In both cases an initial quasisteady stage is followed by a transition stage in which the nonsteady effects must be retained. Finally, for Da of order unity the chemical reaction extends over the whole solid, and the ignition process can be described in terms of a first inert heating stage and a second reacting stage in which the temperature evolves according a nonsteady Frank-Kamenetskii equation. © 1998 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

VL  - 62

SP  - 1037-1052
AB  - This study presents the first intraspecific evaluation of larval growth performance across several different experimental scales, environments, and regions of a marine fish species. Size- and temperature-dependent growth models for larval and early juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are developed based on selected laboratory experiments with cod fed in excess. Observed sizes-at-age of cod from several experiments and stocks are compared with predictions from the models using initial size and ambient temperature history as inputs. Comparisons with results from other laboratory experiments reveal that the model predictions represent relatively high growth rates. Results from enclosure experiments under controlled seminatural conditions generally provide growth rates similar to those predicted from the models. The models therefore produce suitable reference growth predictions against which field-based growth estimates can be compared. These comparisons suggest that surviving cod larvae in the sea typically grow at rates close to their size- and temperature-dependent capacity. This suggests that climatic influences will strongly affect the year-to-year variations in growth of cod during their early life history owing to their markedly temperature-dependent growth potential. © 2005 NRC.

AB  - Only model organisms live in a world of endless summer. Fitness at temperate latitudes reflects the ability of organisms in nature to exploit the favorable season, to mitigate the effects of the unfavorable season, and to make the timely switch from one life style to the other. Herein, we define fitness as Ry, the year-long cohort replacement rate across all four seasons, of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, reared in its natural microhabitat in processor-controlled environment rooms. First, we exposed cohorts of W. smithii, from southern, midlatitude, and northern populations (30-50degreesN) to southern and northern thermal years during which we factored out evolved differences in photoperiodic response. We found clear evidence of evolved differences in heat and cold tolerance among populations. Relative cold tolerance of northern populations became apparent when populations were stressed to the brink of extinction; relative heat tolerance of southern populations became apparent when the adverse effects of heat could accumulate over several generations. Second, we exposed southern, midlatitude, and northern populations to natural, midlatitude day lengths in a thermally benign midlatitude thermal year. We found that evolved differences in photoperiodic response (1) prevented the timely entry of southern populations into diapause resulting in a 74% decline in fitness, and (2) forced northern populations to endure a warm-season diapause resulting in an 88% decline in fitness. We argue that reciprocal transplants across latitudes in nature always confound the effects of the thermal and photic environment on fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, no one has previously held the thermal year constant while varying the photic year. This distinction is crucial in evaluating the potential impact of climate change. Because global warming in the Northern Hemisphere is proceeding faster at northern than at southern latitudes and because this change represents an amelioration of the thermal environment and a concomitant increase in the duration of the growing season, we conclude that there should be more rapid evolution of photoperiodic response than of thermal tolerance as a consequence of global warming among northern, temperate ectotherms.

AB  - The ability to regulate body temperature was studied in 28 species (18 genera) of bats from different climatic zones. All bats from the cool temperate zone show body temperatures which are close to the environmental temperatures during the daily resting phase. Fruitbats (Megachiroptera) are independent of the environmental temperature and are able to regulate their body temperatures above low ambient temperatures. Bats which live only in tropical and subtropical zones lower their body temperatures at medium environmental temperatures but not when it is very cold. While bats of the temperate zone enter deep torpidity during cold, tropical bats show an "alarm reaction". They elevate their body temperature and their metabolism as long as possible. The state of torpidity (Kältelethargie) in vespertilionid and rhinolophid bats is subject of physiological regulation: Even in deep lethargy there is a small difference between body temperature and the environment. Respiration and metabolism are regulated to minimum levels. Torpid bats are able to regulate their body-temperatures to activity level either spontaneously or after a short stimulus without artificial rewarming. In tropical and subtropical bats, with exception of vespertilionid and rhinolophid bats, extended exposure to cold leads finally to uncontrolled hypothermia and to death. Hypothermic animals are never able to rewarm themselves, neither spontaneously nor after stimulation. The only way to interrupt the hypothermia is artificial rewarming. The Chiroptera are not poikilothermic animals as is still postulated in recent literature. All species of Megachiroptera studied are homeothermic animals. The Microchiroptera on the other hand show different degrees of heterothermism. While the pure tropical and subtropical bats are not able to enter deep torpidity, many species of the families Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae are able to enter lethargy even in the tropics. This ability was necessary to enter the cool temperate zone, where many adaptations evolved. It seems likely that both families are able to regulate their body temperatures at any given environmental temperature within the range of viability. © 1965 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We tested the effect of high temperature treatment (103 °C for 17 h) on seed survival for 26, 6 and 5 species in the Aizoaceae, Crassulaceae and Cactaceae, respectively. For both the Aizoaceae and Cactaceae species there was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of seeds surviving and the absolute maximum annual air temperature at the collection site. These results suggest that tolerance of extreme temperatures may have evolved as a mechanism to enable persistence in the soil in these predominantly desert species. Furthermore, these species may provide a useful model system for investigating the mechanism(s) of both desiccation- and thermo-tolerance in seeds. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The content of water, ash, carbohydrate, lipid, protein, chitin, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and energy was measured for all life stages of the bathypelagic mysid Gnathophausia ingens collected in San Clemente Basin off Southern California, USA between January 1969 and February 1982. These data are used to examine the life history, growth rates, growth pattern and partitioning of material and energy over the life of this species. Females reproduce only once and brood their young for about 1.5 yr, during which time the females do not feed. This species has a very high reproductive effort: of the energy accumulated over its life, 61.3% is used in egg production, 13.4% in parental care of young, 5.6% in cast exoskeletons and only 19.6% remains in the females after brooding. The relative rate of growth (percentage of energy d-1) is about 1% immediately after leaving the mother and declines to about 0.2% as maturity is approached. Such growth rates appear to be typical for an animal of this size living at low temperatures. The evolutionary context of this mysid's life history is discussed. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Unexplained high mortality of Tilapia mossambica (Peters) has at times been noted during winter in dams on the South African Highveld and prompted an investigation into the temperature tolerance and temperature preference of this species. This work deals with the temperature selected by the fish. The history of temperature selection experiments is outlined and a relatively simple technique of establishing a temperature gradient in a horizontal test tank is described. Results obtained with juvenile fish previously acclimated to various controlled temperatures showed that these fish selected a range of temperatures of 27.0°C to 33.5°C, with a theoretical median selection temperature of 28.5°C. The findings are discussed with reference to previous relevant literature. It is concluded that T. mossambica was a thermophilic species which could succumb during cold spells in the Highveld dams. © 1967 Dr. W. Junk Publishers.

SP  - 541-552
AB  - Animals representing a complete diallel cross among 4 inbred strains of Mus musculus were measured for 9 traits which potentially contribute to thermoregulation. Correlation matrices were estimated on males and females separately for general combining abilities, specific combining abilities, maternal effects, and residual error. There were a few differences between correlations in males and females which reflected differing amounts of additive or dominance effects on the individual traits, and the fact that females had more significant general combining ability, body weights were negatively correlated with physiological traits and positively correlated with each other. Nesting was correlated with body temperature and oxygen consumption, and negatively associated with weight gain and food consumption. Correlations of additive genetic effects are important factors in evolutionary adaptation, even in pairs of traits which have been important to fitness. Correlations of dominance deviations may further elucidate the extent of genetic coupling of fitness-related traits.-from Authors

VL  - 82

SP  - 241-256
AB  - Body size is important to most aspects of biology and is also one of the most labile traits. Despite its importance we know remarkably little about the proximate (developmental) factors that determine body size under different circumstances. Here, I review what is known about how cell size and number contribute to phenetic and genetic variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster, several fish, and fruits and leaves of some angiosperms. Variation in resources influences size primarily through changes in cell number while temperature acts through cell size. The difference in cellular mechanism may also explain the differences in growth trajectories resulting from food and temperature manipulations. There is, however, a poorly recognized interaction between food and temperature effects that needs further study. In addition, flies show a sexual dimorphism in temperature effects with the larger sex responding by changes in cell size and the smaller sex showing changes in both cell size and number. Leaf size is more variable than other organs, but there appears to be a consistent difference between how shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species respond to light level. The former have larger leaves via cell size under shade, the latter via cell number in light conditions. Genetic differences, primarily from comparisons of D. melanogaster, show similar variation. Direct selection on body size alters cell number only, while temperature selection results in increased cell size and decreased cell number. Population comparisons along latitudinal clines show that larger flies have both larger cells and more cells. Use of these proximate patterns can give clues as to how selection acts in the wild. For example, the latitudinal pattern in D. melanogaster is usually assumed to be due to temperature, but the cellular pattern does not match that seen in laboratory selection at different temperatures. © 2007 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SP  - 367-375
AB  - Under particular conditions of photoperiod and temperature, Armadillidium vulgare females, originating from a single population, might exhibit individual differences in the onset of reproduction and duration of the breeding period. In a population issued from a strain from middle latitudes, some females underwent only one parturial moult (northern tendency) and others three parturial moults (southern tendency). Females with an atypical northern phenology are the most numerous and tend to be found near the Danish population. In the latter, there is an asymmetrical response to laboratory selection (favourable to females with a longer breeding period). The asymmetrical variation in atypical individuals acts as a safety device against the unpredictability of the environment. The adaptation of this species, originally from the Mediterranean periphery, to a northern environment has led to a reduction in its capacity to breed over long periods of time. Populations from middle latitudes can undergo one or several parturial moults which enables the species to successfully colonize even far-away countries. These intrapopulation differences have an essential role and explain why Armadillidium vulgare is one of the most widely distributed species among Oniscidea. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - In modern maize production we have enhanced productivity primarily by changing the cropping environment to fit our maize hybrids. This strategy is becoming increasingly expensive, both in cost of inputs and in the environmental impact of these products, particularly when inappropriately applied to the field of production. In sustainable corn production, hybrids are needed that are productive under a range of environmental conditions. There is increasing evidence of the potential for building genetic tolerance into maize hybrids for some major stress conditions such as drought stress, heat stress, cold temperatures and freezing, which can help to maintain productivity under adverse growing conditions. In several cases where genetic differences are simply inherited (controlled by one or a few major genes), they are easily incorporated into hybrids by choosing parents, making appropriate crosses and selections, and testing promising genotypes under stress conditions. Maize is generally grown in Hungary where soils are fertile, but increasing population pressure has pushed production into less favourable areas. In these suboptimal conditions we should genetically adapt maize hybrids to the adverse soil environment; this is receiving most attention by corn breeders who intend to develop hybrids as components of a sustainable agricultural system. Maize lines and hybrids have shown differential responses to nitrogen fertilizer, and lines selected for high nitrogen use efficiently produced higher yields than lines selected for high yield under high nitrogen conditions. As with any breeding programme, the first step in adapting hybrids for sustainable systems is to define objectives carefully and describe the systems in which the hybrids will be produced. The choice of parents in a sustainable breeding programme is a critical initial step. We have found several appropriate traits of interest in high-yielding, well-adapted inbred lines that have superior combining abilities, in contrasts to bringing in those traits from nonadapted introductions. From our point of view, to develop maize hybrids for sustainable systems, it would be desirable to identify genetic combinations that not only tolerate stress conditions but that also respond to favourable growing conditions. On the basis of our results we can conclude that maize breeding will be central to the planning and implementation of more sustainable systems for the future. © 1993.

TI  - Thermal evolution of gene expression profiles in Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 7
AB  - Background: Despite its pervasiveness, the genetic basis of adaptation resulting in variation directly or indirectly related to temperature (climatic) gradients is poorly understood. By using 3-fold replicated laboratory thermal stocks covering much of the physiologically tolerable temperature range for the temperate (i.e., cold tolerant) species Drosophila subobscura we have assessed whole-genome transcriptional responses after three years of thermal adaptation, when the populations had already diverged for inversion frequencies, pre-adult life history components, and morphological traits. Total mRNA from each population was compared to a reference pool mRNA in a standard, highly replicated two-colour competitive hybridization experiment using cDNA microarrays. Results: A total of 306 (6.6%) cDNA clones were identified as 'differentially expressed' (following a false discovery rate correction) after contrasting the two furthest apart thermal selection regimes (i.e., 13°C vs. 22°C), also including four previously reported candidate genes for thermotolerance in Drosophila (Hsp26, Hsp68, Fst, and Treh). On the other hand, correlated patterns of gene expression were similar in cold- and warm-adapted populations. Analysis of functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology project point to an overrepresentation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acids metabolism and regulation of transcription among other categories. Although the location of differently expressed genes was approximately at random with respect to chromosomes, a physical mapping of 88 probes to the polytene chromosomes of D. subobscura has shown that a larger than expected number mapped inside inverted chromosomal segments. Conclusion: Our data suggest that a sizeable number of genes appear to be involved in thermal adaptation in Drosophila, with a substantial fraction implicated in metabolism. This apparently illustrates the formidable challenge to understanding the adaptive evolution of complex trait variation. Furthermore, some clustering of genes within inverted chromosomal sections was detected. Disentangling the effects of inversions will be obviously required in any future approach if we want to identify the relevant candidate genes. © 2007 Laayouni et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 131
IS  - 4
SP  - 479-488
AB  - The mode of spring viraemia of carp virus (SVCV) temperature-dependence was investigated using water route infection trials in 50 g fish held for 2 h in the Autumn at 11°C (5 x 103 p.f.u./ml water) followed by carefully controlled temperature variations. Above 18°C, infection occurred but immunity arose before any mortality appeared. Between 18 and 11°C, clinical disease supervened, but some fish became immune and survived the infection. Under 10°C there was no immunity and the disease was always fatal. Thus the further the temperature is removed from the physiological thermal optimum for the fish, the more serious the prognosis becomes, even if viral replication in itself is slowed by the cold (e. 5°C). It is concluded that the water temperature elevation which naturally occurs in spring is not a necessary factor in SVCV pathogenicity.

AB  - The viable and non-viable fractions of the bacterial community in a 2347-year-old permafrost soil from Spitsbergen were subjected to a comprehensive investigation using culture-independent and culture-dependent methods. LIVE/DEAD®BacLight™ staining revealed that 26% of the total number of bacterial cells were viable. Quantitatively, aerobic microcolonies, aerobic colony-forming units and culturable anaerobic bacteria comprised a minor fraction of the total number of viable bacteria, which underlines the necessity for alternative cultivation approaches in bacterial cryobiology. Sulfate reduction was detected at temperatures between -2°C and 29°C while methanogenesis was not detected. Bacterial diversity was high with 162 operational taxonomic units observed from 800 16S rDNA clone sequences. The 158 pure cultures isolated from the permafrost soil affiliated with 29 different bacterial genera, the majority of which have not previously been isolated from permafrost habitats. Most of the strains isolated were affiliated to the genera Cellulomonas and Arthrobacter and several of the pure cultures were closely related to bacteria reported from other cryohabitats. Characterization of viable bacterial communities in permafrost soils is important as it will enable identification of functionally important groups together with the as yet undescribed adaptations that bacteria have evolved for surviving subzero temperatures for millennia. © 2007 The Authors.

SP  - 263-270
AB  - Sites that display strong environmental contrasts in close proximity, such as 'Evolution Canyon' on Mt. Carmel, Israel, are natural theatres for investigating adaptive evolution in action. We reared Drosophila melanogaster from collection sites along altitudinal transects on the north- and south-facing canyon slopes in each of three temperature environments, and assessed genetic variation in ovariole number and body size between and within collection sites, and temperature plasticity. Both traits exhibited significant genetic variation within collection sites and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, but not genetic variation for plasticity. Between-site genetic variation in ovariole number was negatively correlated with altitude on both slopes of the canyon, and collections from the north- and south-facing slopes were genetically differentiated for male, but not female, body size. Genetic variation between sites within easy dispersal range is consistent with the action of strong natural selection, although neither the selective agent(s) nor the direct targets of selection are known. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Selection for fast and slow development in flour beetles Tribolium castaneum (CS) and T. confusum (CF) has resulted in a number of correlated responses in other characters. In general, the fast selected lines of both species have responded similarly with respect to these other traits. The fast lines are characterized by decreased length of time spent in all juvenile stages, decreased size, and essentially the same productivity and hatchability of eggs as the synthetic stocks. In CS-fast there was a substantial decrease in larval survival and an increase in the frequency of abnormal adults. The latter observations did not hold for the CF-fast line. The CS-slow line, on the other hand, exhibited an increased duration of egg, larval and pupal stages, increased size (at least as determined by pupal weight), and decreased hatchability and larval survival. Productivity also decreased somewhat when measured as the number of eggs per female per day. The frequency of abnormal beetles was also higher in this line than in the foundation stock. Fitness, as measured by competitive ability, decreased in all selected lines, supporting the notion of an intermediate optimum for developmental rate in the foundation populations. No evidence was found to support the existence of a compensation mechanism for developmental rate such as that found in Drosophila, whereby faster larval development is compensated for by an increase in the length of the pupal stage. © 1966 Martinus Nijhoff.

VL  - 34
IS  - 1
SP  - 3-20
AB  - The present study attempts to elucidate possible microevolutionary adaptations of life-history traits of high-latitude populations of the holarctic, littoral oribatid mite Ameronothrus lineatus by comparing arctic and temperate populations. Additionally, the paper provides an overview of the limited research on general ecology and population biology of arctic populations. In the Arctic the larviparous A. lineatus has a 5-year life cycle (larva-to-larva), and adults survive a further 2-3 years. High survival to maturity is consistent with a low lifetime reproductive output of ca. 20 larvae. The life history can be regarded as an extreme version of the typical oribatid life history. However, several life-history features suggest specific adaptations of arctic populations. In particular, the pre-moult resting stage is synchronized with the warmest part of the arctic summer, which shortens this vulnerable part of development. High reproductive investment by females at relatively low temperatures may represent a physiological adaptation to the cool arctic summer. Finally, prolonged cold exposure positively affects reproduction and survival the following summer, suggesting adaptation of the species to the highly seasonal arctic environment. On the other hand, the ability of all life-cycle stages to overwinter, and a flexible life history with the species being able to take advantage of favourable climatic conditions to accelerate development and larviposition, seem to be ancestral features. Thus, the success of A. lineatus in arctic habitats is probably attributable to a combination of derived and ancestral life-history traits. Studies of conspecific temperate populations are required to elucidate further local adaptations of arctic populations. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - What factors influence the ability of populations to adapt to extreme environments that lie outside their current tolerance limits? We investigated this question by exposing experimental populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to lethally high temperatures. We asked: (1) whether we could obtain thermotolerant mutants with an extended upper thermal limit by this selective screen; (2) whether the propensity to obtain thermotolerant mutants depended on the prior selective history of the progenitor genotypes; and (3) how the fitness properties of these mutants compared to those of their progenitors within the ancestral thermal niche. Specifically, we subjected 15 independent populations founded from each of six progenitors to 44 degrees C; all of the progenitors had upper thermal limits between about 40 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Two of the progenitors were from populations that had previously adapted to 32 degrees C, two were from populations adapted to 37 degrees C, and two were from populations adapted to 41-42 degrees C. All 90 populations were screened for mutants that could survive and grow at 44 degrees C. We obtained three thermotolerant mutants, all derived from progenitors previously adapted to 41-42 degrees C. In an earlier study,we serendipitously found one other thermotolerant mutant derived from a population that had previously adapted to 32 degrees C. Thus, prior selection at an elevated but nonlethal temperature may predispose organisms to evolve more extreme thermotolerance, but this is not an absolute requirement. It is evidently possible to obtain mutants that tolerate more extreme temperatures, so why did they not become prevalent during prior selection at 41-42 degrees C, near the upper limit of the thermal niche? To address this question, we measured the fitness of the thermotolerant mutants at high temperatures just within the ancestral niche. None of the four thermotolerant mutants had an advantage relative to their progenitor even very near the upper limit of the thermal niche; in fact, all of the mutants showed a noticeable loss of fitness around 41 degrees C. Thus, the genetic adaptations that improve competitive fitness at high but nonlethal temperatures are distinct from those that permit tolerance of otherwise lethal temperatures.

VL  - 42

SP  - 304-322
AB  - Recruitment in fish populations is characterized by a high temporal variability and a considerable stochasticity. It has therefore been suggested that fish populations should be likely candidates for coexistence based on the storage mechanism. Many characteristics of fish populations such as high variability in year class strength and mortality biased towards smaller (younger) individuals are also elements that make coexistence based on the storage mechanism likely. At the same time, considerable experimental evidence usually associated with deterministic competition models, such as density dependence in individual growth rates, density dependence in populations densities, and competition-related niche dynamics, is also present. We use temporal variation in temperature, an environmental variable involving both a stochastic and a regular (seasonal) component, to illustrate how both coexistence based on a storage mechanism and patterns expected from deterministic competition models may co-occur. Temperature is as important in fish as in other poikilothermic organisms, since the carrying capacity of the population will vary with temperature through the latter's effect on the metabolic requirements of individuals. Seasonal variation in temperature will, through its effect on metabolic demands, also cause favourable periods to alternate with unfavourable periods, i.e. environmental effects covary with competition effects as assumed in lottery models. We suggest that seasonal variation in temperature will promote coexistence and at the same time allow competition to be a regular event with significant evolutionary potential. Experimental and field evidence that supports the idea of a seasonal variation in resourse limitation strongly coupled to temperature is provided. © 1991 BRILL.

VL  - 16

AB  - In tropical rainforests, insects show especially high species richness and local endemism of species relative to vertebrates. One possible cause is that insects respond to historical fluctuations of rainforests on a smaller spatial scale than do vertebrates. To evaluate this hypothesis, we combine environmental niche models and mitochondrial DNA phylogeography for two pairs of sister species of the dung beetle genus Temnoplectron (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans and T. politulum-T. reyi) from the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where climate-driven rainforest fluctuations in the Quaternary have strongly influenced genetic and species diversity of vertebrates. Within both species pairs, the bioclimatic niche was conserved, but the T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans species pair had the narrower environmental range, and thus more restricted potential distribution. Coalescent analyses indicated Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene divergences for both species pairs, and earlier speciation in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) than in (T. politulum-T. reyi). Phylogeographic structure in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) was more pronounced than in (T. politulum-T. reyi), with significant isolation-by-distance in the former species-pair only. Nested clade and coalescence analyses indicated local range expansions for the T. aeneopiceum-subvolitans species pair and range-wide expansion for both T. politulum and T. reyi. We suggest that stronger phylogeographic structure and earlier divergence in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) than in (T. politulum-T. reyi) reflects a stronger influence of environmental barriers to gene flow under the present climate and greater sensitivity to warmer and drier periods of the Quaternary. The two species pairs evidently responded to Quaternary rainforest fluctuations at spatial scales similar to those seen within low-vagility species of vertebrate. Despite this similarity of scale, these insect lineages are reproductively isolated at parapatric boundaries, whereas analogous lineages of vertebrates often are not. We suggest that rapid evolution of genitalia may facilitate geographic speciation in rainforest beetles. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - Population dynamics on a rugged landscape is studied analytically and numerically. The dynamics of the population is described in terms of Langevin diffusion of a single particle in a specific random environment. The randomness in the mutation rate leads to population pinning and to a logarithmic slowdown of the evolution, resembling aging phenomenon in spin glass systems. Individual realizations of evolutionary behavior exhibit so-called punctuated equilibria, or long periods of stasis interrupted by rapid changes of fitness. In contrast, the randomness in the replication rate turns out to be irrelevant for evolution in the long-time limit as it is smoothed out by increasing “evolution temperature.” © 1997 The American Physical Society.

AB  - Abnormal temperatures (AT) induce in Nicotiana tabacum var. macrophylla irregularities in mitosis and especially in meiosis which lead to numerical chromosome alterations, aneuploid and euploid. They also induce structural chromosome changes. Among the progeny of treated plants structural and numerical variants of various kinds were found. By crossing among themselves the extreme variants thus produced, and by further breeding, paying greater attention to the more extreme ones, we obtained a large number of new variants, which behaved quite, differently. Chiasma formations between normal and structurally changed chromosomes, between partially homologous unchanged, and probably also between non-homologous ones, conditioned secondary structural changes and variations. Some of the variants are considered from an evolutionary point of view in connexion with the origin of the species N. tabacum and its varieties. The roles of abnormal temperatures and of other factors that induce hereditary variations in nature are discussed. © 1939 Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - The ecological stress theory of aging and hormesis: An energetic evolutionary model
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SP  - 233-242
AB  - Free-living organisms normally struggle to exist in harsh environments that are nutritionally and energetically inadequate, where evolutionary adaptation is challenged by internal stresses within organisms and external stresses from the environment. The incorporation of environmental variables into aging theories such as the free-radical and metabolic rate/oxidative stress theories, is the basis of the ecological stress theory of aging and hormesis. Environmental variation from optimum to lethal extremes gives a fitness-stress continuum, where energetic efficiency, or fitness, is inversely related to stress level; in the evolutionary context survival is a more direct measure of fitness for assessing aging than is lifespan. On this continuum, the hormetic zone is in the optimum region, while aging emphasizes survival towards lethal extremes. At the limits of survival, a convergence of physiological and genetical processes is expected under accumulating stress from Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS. Limited ecologically-oriented studies imply that major genes are important towards limits of survival compared with the hormetic zone. Future investigations could usefully explore outlier populations physiologically and genetically, since there is the likelihood that genetic variability may be lower in those cohorts managing to survive to extremely advanced ages as found in highly stressed ecological outlier populations. If so, an evolutionary explanation of the mortality-rate decline typical of cohorts of the extremely old emerges. In summary, an energetic evolutionary approach produces a general aging theory which automatically incorporates hormesis, since the theory is based on a fitness-stress continuum covering the whole range of possible abiotic environments of natural populations. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.

VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 145-173
AB  - Most main sequence stars are binaries or higher multiplicity Systems and it appears that at birth most stars have circumstellar disks. It is commonly accepted that planetary systems arise from the material of these disks; consequently, binary and multiple systems may have a main role in planet formation. In this paper, we study the stage of planetary formation during which the particulate material is still dispersed as centimetre-to-metre sized primordial aggregates. We investigate the response of the particles, in a protoplanetary disk with radius R(D) = 100 AU around a solar-like star, to the gravitational field of bound perturbing companions in a moderately wide (300-1600 AU) orbit. For this purpose, we have carried out a series of simulations of coplanar hierarchical configurations using a direct integration code that models gravitational and viscous forces. The massive protoplanetary disk is around one of the components of the binary. The evolution in time of the dust sub-disk depends mainly on the nature (prograde or retrograde) of the relative revolution of the stellar companion, and on the temperature and mass of the circumstellar disk. Our results show that for binary companions near the limit of tidal truncation of the disk, the perturbation leads to an enhanced accretion rate onto the primary, decreasing the lifetime of the particles in the protoplanetary disk with respect to the case of a single star. As a consequence of an enhanced accretion rate the mass of the disk decreases faster, which leads to a longer resultant lifetime for particles in the disk. On the other hand, binary companions may induce tidal arms in the dust phase of protoplanetary disks. Spiral perturbations with m = 1 may increase in a factor 10 or more the dust surface density in the neighbourhood of the arm, facilitating the growth of the particles. Moreover, in a massive disk (0.01 M(o)) the survival time of particles is significantly shorter than in a less massive nebula (0.001 M(o)) and the temperature of the disk severely influences the spiral-in-time of particles. The rapid evolution of the dust component found in post T Tauri stars can be explained as a result of their binary nature. Binarity may also influence the evolution of circumpulsar disks.

TI  - Polygenic mutation in Drosophila melanogaster: Genotype x environment interaction for spontaneous mutations affecting bristle number
VL  - 102
SP  - 199-215
AB  - A highly inbred line of Drosophila melanogaster was subdivided into replicate sublines that were subsequently maintained independently with 10 pairs of parents per generation. The parents were randomly sampled for 19 'unselected' sublines, and artificially selected for high or low abdominal or sternopleural bristle number for 12 'selected' sublines (with 3 replicate selection lines/trait/direction of selection). Divergence in mean bristle number among the unselected sublines, and response of the selected sublines to selection, are attributable to the accumulation of new mutations affecting bristle number. The input of mutational variance per generation, V-M, can be estimated from the magnitude of response or divergence, assuming neutrality of mutations affecting the bristle traits. We reared unselected lines at generations 222 and 224, and selected lines at generations 182-184 of mutation accumulation at each of three temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C), and estimated the mutational variance common to all environments and the mutational variance from genotype x environment interaction. For sternopleural bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 26% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to temperature x line interaction. For abdominal bristle number, the mutational interaction variance was 142% of the mutational variance common to all temperatures, and the interaction variance was due to interactions of temperature x line, sex x line, and temperature x sex x line. It is possible that segregating variation for bristle number is maintained partly by genotype x environment interaction, but information on the fitness profiles of mutations affecting bristle number in each environment will be necessary to evaluate this hypothesis quantitatively.

TI  - Cenozoic mass extinctions in the deep sea: What perturbs the largest habitat on Earth?
VL  - 424
SP  - 1-23
AB  - Deep-sea benthic foraminifera live in the largest habitat on Earth, constitute an important part of its benthic biomass, and form diverse assemblages with common cosmopolitan species. Modern deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages are strongly influenced by events affecting their main food source, phytoplankton (a relationship known as bentho-pelagic coupling). Surprisingly, benthic foraminifera did not suffer significant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, when phytoplankton communities underwent severe extinction. Possibly, bentho-pelagic coupling was less strong than today in the warm oceans of the Cretaceous-Paleogene, because of differences in the process of food transfer from surface to bottom, or because more food was produced below the photic zone by litho-autotrophs. Alternatively, after the end-Cretaceous extinction the food supply from the photic zone recovered in less time than previously thought. In contrast, deep-sea benthic foraminifera did undergo severe extinction (30%-50% of species) at the end of the Paleocene, when planktic organisms show rapid evolutionary turnover, but no major extinction. Causes of this benthic extinction are not clear: net extinction rates were similar globally, but there is no independent evidence for global anoxia or dysoxia, nor of globally consistent increase or decrease in productivity or carbonate dissolution. The extinction might be linked to a global feature of the end-Paleocene environmental change, i.e., rapid global warming. Cenozoic deep-sea benthic faunas show gradual faunal turnover during periods of pronounced cooling and increase in polar ice volume: the late Eocene-early Oligocene, the middle Miocene, and the middle Pleistocene. During the latter turnover, taxa that decreased in abundance during the earlier two turnovers became extinct, possibly because of increased oxygenation of the oceans, or because of increased seasonality in food delivery. The Eocene-Oligocene was the most extensive of these turnovers, and bentho-pelagic coupling may have become established at that time. © 2007 The Geological Society of America. All right reserved.

VL  - 50

SP  - 2338-2345
AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the causes and consequences of thermal evolution of body size in Drosophila melanogaster. This was done empirically by the integrated study of lines collected along latitudinal gradient and population that were undergoing long-term evolution at different temperatures in the laboratory. All experiments were conducted in the laboratory using controlled conditions of temperature and larval density. I examined 20 populations collected along a north-south transect in Australia (17°-43°S) and found that wing size increased with latitude. The genetic cline in wing size was mostly based on variation in cell number (82%). These findings contradicted previous results on thermal selection in the laboratory, where the divergence in wing size was achieved almost entirely by changes in cell size. In another experiment, 6 geographic lines were reared at 5 temperatures spanning the entire viability range for the species. Wing size, cell size and cell number all decreased with increasing development temperature. Cell size determined most of the plasticity in wing size (˜75%). Wing size increased with latitude across the reaction norm, mostly due to variation in cell number (87%), which repeated the pattern observed at a single temperature. Although there was significant variation among populations in phenotypic plasticity of the wing traits, a latitudinal trend in this variation was only detected for cell size; variation in plasticity of wing size among populations was attributable to both cellular components. The results of these experiments suggest that thermal evolution acted on body size itself, since cell number is the basis of additive genetic variation for body size within populations at a single temperature. In the experiments outlined above, it was also found that the size of the wing, relative to the size of the thorax, and the relative length of the wing both decreased in response to high selection and developmental temperatures.

AB  - We use a stepwise multiple regression procedure to correlate geographic patterns in the distribution of live-bearing reptilian species with patterns in climatic variables, in both Australia and North America. Previous authors have interpreted reptilian live-bearing as an evolutionary adaptation to cold climates. Our results indicate that environmental temperature and irradiance measures are no more highly correlated with the percent live-bearing species than are measures of precipitation, evaporation and humidity. We conclude that, except in very cold environments in North America, environmental temperatures seem to play little role in the relative success of live-bearing versus egg-laying reptilian reproductive strategies. It appears from previous work that reptilian live-bearing evolves mainly, or exclusively, because of the advantage it confers in enabling successful reproduction in cold climates. The present study suggests that the subsequent radiation of live-bearing reptilian species may be due to entirely different selective forces. © 1978 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The blind cave-dwelling fish Phreatichthys andruzzii shows rapid eye development, and at a temperature of 29.5 degreesC, maximal eye differentiation is reached 36 h after egg laying. Very rapid eye degeneration then occurs, and a rudimentary and very degenerated ocular cyst is all that remains 1 month later. This may explain why this species has so often been erroneously considered anophthalmic. Ocular degeneration starts with a decrease in the rate of mitosis in the neuroblastic cells of the retinal Anlage. Degeneration by means of lytic processes is clearly observed beginning 32 h after egg laying. Disappearance of the lens, transformation of the cornea into skin, and cryptic degeneration of the eyes are phenotypic variations of the fundamental mechanisms of eye development in vertebrates. These can be considered evolutionary adaptations by the ancestral fishes to the aphotic cave environment.

SP  - 836-847
AB  - Encysted embryos of the primitive crustacean, Artemia franciscana, are among the most resistant of all animal life history stages to extremes of environmental stress. This resistance has likely been acquired during evolutionary adaptation to their harsh ecological setting, In the laboratory, for example, some of these embryos survive more than 6 years of continuous anoxia while fully hydrated and at room temperature, a phenomenal capability that can easily be related to their frequent encounters with anoxic conditions in nature. A small heat shock protein belonging to the alpha-crystallin family of proteins, referred to as p26, appears to play a central role in the stress resistance of these embryos. Our evidence shows that this protein is an important component in their adaptive repertoire, and vital for the survival of Artemia in nature.

AB  - Human birth weight is known to be influenced by several factors, including maternal energy supply, maternal stature, disease status, smoking status and gestation length. This article proposes that the thermal environment may be a further factor influencing birth weight. Experimental animal studies demonstrate clear effects of thermal stress on placental function and birth weight, but may have limited relevance for humans due to between-species differences in pregnancy physiology. Observational studies suggest an inverse relationship between environmental temperature and birth weight within and between human populations. Variation in maternal size, body fatness, pregnancy weight gain and heat production is predicted to influence maternal thermoregulatory capacity, as are the size and composition of the foetus. These associations generate the hypothesis that low birth weight in hot environments may in part represent an adaptation to environmental heat stress. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

VL  - 18

SP  - 184-190
AB  - Abstract. In Drosophila melanogaster, the cold‐shock tolerance of adult flies at ‐7°C increased 22% after a prior 2h exposure to 4°C as measured by LD50, the dose (degree minutes of exposure to subzero temperature) which resulted in 50% mortality. Cold‐shock tolerance was further significantly increased by selecting cold resistant lines by exposure of adults (1) to 4°C for 2 h (short‐term chilling), or (2) to ‐7°C for 80–120 min (cold shock), or (3) to short‐term chilling followed by cold‐shock. After ten generations of selection, the greatest increase in cold‐shock tolerance was found in flies selected using the combined exposure of short‐term chilling and cold shock. LD50s increased 33% in comparison with the unselected control strain when no chilling pre‐treatment was given prior to cold shock at ‐7°C. The rapid cold‐hardening response increased 82% in the line selected by the short‐term chilling and cold‐shock regime. The enhanced cold‐shock tolerance was relatively stable since no decrease was observed after four generations without selection. This report shows the role of short‐term adaptation as well as selection in the capacity to survive low temperatures in non‐diapausing stages of insects. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell.

Recent work shows that the main HSP chaperone families also buffer phenotypic variation. Chaperones can do this either directly through masking the phenotypic effects of mutant polypeptides by allowing their correct folding, or indirectly through buffering the expression of morphogenic variation in threshold traits by regulating signal transduction. Environmentally sensitive chaperone functions in protein folding and signal transduction have different potential consequences for the evolution of populations and lineages under selection in changing environments.

TI  - Heterosis in crosses between lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected for adaptation to different environments
VL  - 77
IS  - 2
SP  - 253-259
AB  - Experiments were designed to examine whether heterosis would occur in crosses of Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted to 18 °C or 28 °C environments. Crosses were examined in parental environments, an intermediate environment (23 °C) and a mixed environment (alternating 18°/28°C). Parental populations did not show divergence for larval viability, cold shock or high temperature mortalities when tested in a common environment. However, the 28 °C population was less fecund than the 18 °C population, but had higher larval competitive ability and higher adult longevity. Heterosis for viability, cold shock mortality and high temperature mortality occurred in crosses between a population adapted to 18 °C and another adapted to 28 °C, but not in crosses between two populations adapted to the same temperature. The results suggest that, in the absence of drift, heterosis is expected in crosses between lines or populations with different histories of selection but not between lines with the same selection histories. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Very sensitive measurements of N2 and N2O flux from soil are possible when gas evolved from 15N-labeled soil is analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. This approach is useful for studying the fate of nitrogen fertilizer and for studying soil microbial processes contributing to the atmospheric increase of nitrous oxide, a radiatively active trace gas that can contribute to global warming and ozone depletion. Most systems of equations that relate isotopic analysis to gas flux are sufficiently complex that certain limitations and potentials of the 15N approach may be overlooked. We describe a graphical representation of labeled N-gas flux that illustrates the equations and encourages critical thinking regarding the implementation of related experiments. This model is used to interpret underestimation that occurs if flux derives from multiple pools of differing enrichment. A statistical derivation is presented for a previously published simulation of underestimation due to multiple pools. The same equations are applied to field data to explore whether temporal variation in soil nitrate enrichment is likely to cause significant underestimation. Two sampling strategies are proposed that may eliminate the assumption of pool uniformity, thereby eliminating a potential source of underestimation.

VL  - 37

SP  - 111-122
AB  - The Au-deposit of the Dungash gold mine area, Eastern Desert of Egypt, is situated in an EW-trending quartz vein along a shear zone in metavolcanic and metasedimentary host rocks. Petrographic and micro-chemical analyses show that the style of alterations (chloritization, sericitization, carbonatization and silicification) and mineralization (formation of sulphides and gold) are not limited to only the auriferrous quartz ore body (massive mineralization) but occurs also in the wall rocks (disseminated mineralization). Foliation, fracturing and shearing of the wall rocks are the major factors controlling the alterations and the mineralizations as these provided favourable channel ways for fluid flow. These fluid flows were generated under post-peak metamorphic greenschist facies conditions. The post-metamorphic hydrothermal origin of different stages of alteration/mineralization are documented based on various observations among which the most important are: (i) relics of undigested wall-rock materials and rutile (being a constituent of the wall rocks) are included in sulphides, carbonates and quartz (mainly concentrated in the quartz ore body); (ii) arsenopyrite, pyrite, gold and carbonate occur in various generations and are distributed over eight parageneses; (iii) the temperature of formation of the hydrothermal minerals varies between 500 degreesC and <300 degreesC (using the composition of chlorite and the stability of the (Ni-Co-Fe)AsS minerals (gersdorffite and arsenopyrite)).

TI  - Climatic Constraints Drive the Evolution of Low Temperature Resistance in Woody Plants
VL  - 61
IS  - 4
SP  - 189-202
AB  - Cold and frost are stress factors of widespread occurrence for plants. They damage woody plants due to chilling temperatures in the tropics, by freezing sensitive plants in regions with episodic frosts and temperatures down to -10 °C, and by freezing of even tolerant plants in regions with cold winters below - 10 and -40 °C. The wide range of frost resistances in plants from different climatic zones indicates that the ability to become hardened to freezing has evolved in a stepwise process. There are opinions how an evolutionary acquisition of freezing tolerance could have taken place in the following way: First there is a differentiation of better adapted ecotypes and in the long term a series of functional plant groups develop along climatic gradients. Frequent climatic stress and climatic changes stimulate the selection of new genotypes resistant to climatic extremes. Furthermore, plants exposed to multiple stress factors in their habitat acquire a general cross - tolerance to climatic constraints. The objective of this review is the understanding of low temperature resistance in woody plants, e.g. stabilization of biomembranes by lipid composition, deep supercooling, and ability to become freezing tolerant during winter dormancy. An over a hundred year long history of investigating frost stress and survival of different plant species has brought about an important understanding of basic processes. Recently antifreeze proteins which slow the freezing processes, and proteins, which protect the protoplasm against low temperature, frost and dehydration have been discovered. Findings that help to explain the mechanisms for coping with low temperature will be applicable to agriculture, horticulture, forestry and bioclimatology. © 2005, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

VL  - 53

AB  - The present study investigated evolutionary patterns of Escherichia coli growth and survival in transmission through the coastal ecosystem between human host and seawater using a novel 'Host to Coast' Laboratory Analog simulating an 11 d sequence cycling through the pH and temperature conditions of the small intestine, colon, sewer, seawater, human stomach, and back into the small intestine. Although historically E. coli has been assumed to die off rapidly in seawater, a few instances of E. coli growth have been observed in environmental fresh water, soils, and nutrientenriched tropical seawater, suggesting the potential for evolving greater viability in such environments. This study investigated whether E. coli can evolve increased capacity for growth and survival in seawater through selective exposures to singular abiotic factors such as the high alkalinity or low temperatures approximating coastal aquatic conditions, and also whether adaptation to cycling pH can lead to increased growth fitness in a human host. Specialists and generalists were examined to reveal patterns of trade-offs in the multi-stress environment of the Analog. Dramatic increases in fitness revealed in the Host to Coast Analog due to evolutionary exposure to alkalinity and cycling pH suggested that these factors are critically important in the evolutionary ecology of E. coli. Evolving the capacity for seawater survival and growth, combined with increased capability to infect human hosts, could facilitate E. coli infection from seawater exposure. Results suggest implications for wastewater management in order to prevent superior strains of pathogenic E. coli from evolving. © Inter-Research 2008.

VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 75-82
AB  - To examine how the duration of laboratory domestication may affect Drosophila stocks used in studies of thermotolerance, we measured expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 and survival after heat shock in D. melanogaster strains recently collected from nature and maintained in laboratory culture for up to 50 or more generations. After an initial increase in both Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance immediately after transfer to laboratory medium, both traits remained fairly constant over time and variation among strains persisted through laboratory domestication. Furthermore, variation in heat tolerance and Hsp70 expression did not correlate with the length of time populations evolved in the laboratory. Therefore, while environmental variation likely contributed most to early shifts in strain tolerance and Hsp70 expression, other population parameters, for example genetic drift, inbreeding, and selection likely affected these traits little. As long as populations are maintained with large numbers of individuals, the culture of insects in the laboratory may have little effect on the tolerance of different strains to thermal stress.

TI  - Temperature selection and performance by bluegills: Evidence for selection in response to available power
VL  - 125
IS  - 6
SP  - 948-955
AB  - Some fishes, including bluegills Lepomis macrochirus, have highest critical swimming speeds at their preferred temperatures; however, it is not known why fishes select temperatures that are optimal for performance. This paper examines the relationship between selected temperatures and critical swimming speeds for bluegills to test the hypothesis that fishes select temperatures in response to available power. A rationale is presented that available power is a useful short-term measure of fitness among intraspecific competitors, that Fry’s scope for activity is a measure of available power, and that critical swimming speed is a function of Fry’s scope for activity and can be used as a measure of available power. Results of this study supported the hypothesis by demonstrating that for each acclimation temperature, critical swimming speeds of bluegills were highest at preferred temperatures, and decreased at other temperatures with frequency of time spent at those temperatures, although the exact nature of the relationship has yet to be determined. These results supported the concept that fishes select temperatures on the basis of available power and have implications for quantifying and predicting the energetic cost of exposure of fish to sublethal temperatures. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 168

SP  - E123-E135
AB  - For ectotherms, environmental temperature affects the optimal size and number of offspring via multiple mechanisms. First, temperature influences the performance of offspring, which directly affects the optimal size of offspring. Second, temperature influences maternal body size, which indirectly affects the optimal size and/or number of offspring when larger females acquire more energetic resources or provide better parental care. Although traditional statistical approaches might distinguish the relative importance of these effects, an information-theoretic approach enables one to estimate effects more accurately by identifying the best evolutionary model in a set of candidate models. Here, we use the Akaike Information Criterion to calculate the likelihoods of seven path models, each derived from one or more optimality models of reproduction. Variation in reproductive traits among populations of lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) was used to quantify support for the models. Our results overwhelmingly supported a model based on an indirect effect of temperature that is mediated by maternal size. Path coefficients of this model were consistent with the hypotheses that, first, larger females can acquire more energy for reproduction and, second, the survival of offspring depends on both their size and their density. Our analyses exemplify how information theory can identify evolutionary hypotheses that merit experimental testing.

AB  - Meteorological variation throughout the year causes seasonal variations (seasonality) in the availability of food resources for herbivores. This seasonality creates latitudinal and altitudinal variations not only in food habits, but also in body size (Lindstedt and Boyce 1985; Geist 1986) and reproduction (reviewed by Bronson 1989) of the herbivores within a reaction norm (Stearns and Koella 1986). As sika deer have a broad latitudinal distribution (15-45° N; Ohtaishi 1986; Whitehead 1993), by comparative studies of nutritional ecology of sika deer in each habitat they occupy we can examine how they react to seasonality as evolved through adaptive radiation from warmer habitats near the equator to colder northern habitats. We present results on deer on the Boso Peninsula in central Japan to show the influence of seasonality on their nutritional ecology. © Springer 2009. All rights are reserved.

TI  - Locomotor performance and muscle metabolic capacities: Impact of temperature and energetic status
VL  - 139
IS  - 3
SP  - 371-382
AB  - In aquatic ectotherms, muscle metabolic capacities are strongly influenced by exogenous factors, principally temperature and food availability. Seasonal changes in temperature lead many organisms to modify their metabolic machinery so as to maintain capacity even in "slower" cold habitats. Modifications of mitochondrial capacities are central in this response. The increases in protein-specific oxidative capacities of mitochondria during cold acclimation of temperate fishes do not occur during the evolutionary adaptation to cold in Antarctic species. Instead, Antarctic fishes tend to increase the proportion of fibre volume devoted to mitochondria, perhaps to facilitate intracellular distribution of oxygen and metabolites. Variation in energetic status can drastically modify muscle metabolic status, with glycolytic muscle changing more than oxidative muscle. This in turn impacts swimming performance. A decrease in the condition of cod leads endurance at speeds above U-crit to drop by 70%. Sprint swimming is less affected, perhaps as it does not exhaust glycolytic muscle. We used interindividual variation in muscle metabolic capacities to identify correlates of swimming performance in stickleback and cod. Activities of cytochrome c oxidase in glycolytic muscle are a correlate of sprint swimming in stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and cod (Gadus morhua), whereas lactate dehydrogenase activities in glycolytic muscle are a correlate of cod endurance swimming. In scallops, gonadal maturation leads to virtually complete mobilisation of glycogen from muscle. This does not reduce the capacity of the scallops, Chlamys islandica and Euvola ziczac, to mount escape responses, but significantly slows their recuperation from exhaustive exercise. Muscle metabolic capacities fall in parallel with glycogen mobilisation. In the compromise between muscles' dual roles as a motor and a macromolecular reserve, a significant loss in locomotory ability occur, during gametogenesis and spawning. Reproductive fitness takes the upper hand over maintenance of performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A model is presented of optimum body sizes at different ambient temperatures. Selection is considered to optimize the difference between foraging profit per time and maintenance energy costs per time, scaled to body size. Two different scaling functions are considered: one maximizes the amount of activity that an individual can perform, and the other maximizes the length of time an individual can survive on the profit gained in a given period of foraging. With both scaling functions, optimum size increases as ambient temperature decreases. © 1980.

VL  - 118

SP  - 431-437
AB  - Most theoretical models for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) rely upon differential fitness of male and female offspring incubated under different thermal regimes. However, there are few convincing data on this topic. We studied incubation effects in a lizard species (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) with genotypic sex determination so that we could separate effects due to incubation temperatures from those due to offspring gender. We incubated eggs under two different fluctuating-temperature regimes that simulated hot and cold natural nest-sites. The effects of our incubation treatments on phenotypes of the hatchling lizards (morphology and locomotor performance) differed between the sexes. Females emerging from eggs exposed to the ''hot nest" treatment (diel cycling, 23-31 degrees C) were larger, and ran faster? than did their sisters from the "cold nest" treatment (16-24 degrees C). Males showed a smaller and less consistent phenotypic response than females. These incubation-induced responses were relatively stable during the first few weeks of life post-hatching, at least in captive lizards maintained under laboratory conditions. These kinds of sex differences in the phenotypic responses of hatchling reptiles to incubation conditions provide a plausible basis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles.

TI  - Counterintuitive density-dependent growth in a long-lived vertebrate after removal of nest predators
VL  - 87
IS  - 12
SP  - 3109-3118
AB  - Examining the phenotypic and genetic underpinnings of life-history variation in long-lived organisms is central to the study of life-history evolution. Juvenile growth and survival are often density dependent in reptiles, and theory predicts the evolution of slow growth in response to low resources (resource-limiting hypothesis), such as under densely populated conditions. However, rapid growth is predicted when exceeding some critical body size reduces the risk of mortality (mortality hypothesis). Here we present results of paired, large-scale, five-year field experiments to identify causes of variation in individual growth and survival rates of an Australian turtle (Emydura macquarii) prior to maturity. To distinguish between these competing hypotheses, we reduced nest predators in two populations and retained a control population to create variation in juvenile density by altering recruitment levels. We also conducted a complementary split-clutch field-transplant experiment to explore the impact of incubation temperature (25° or 30°C), nest predator level (low or high), and clutch size on juvenile growth and survival. Juveniles in high-recruitment (predator removal) populations were not resource limited, growing more rapidly than young turtles in the control populations. Our experiments also revealed a remarkably long-term impact of the thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development on growth of turtles prior to maturity. Moreover, this thermal effect was manifested in turtles approaching maturity, rather than in turtles closer to hatching, and was dependent on population density in the post-hatching rearing environment. This apparent phenotypic plasticity in growth complements our observation of a strong, positive genetic correlation between individual body size in the experimental and control populations over the first five years of life (r G ∼ +0.77). Thus, these Australian pleurodiran turtles have the impressive capacity to acclimate plastically to major demographic perturbations and enjoy the longer-term potential to evolve adaptively to maintain viability. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 25
IS  - 4
SP  - 394-401
AB  - The light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) shows high intraspecific variability in morphological, physiological, demographic and behavioural characters. To gain insight into the extent of adaptation and evolutionary changes in response to environmental heterogeneity in this species, quantitative genetic analyses of life-history variation were conducted for two natural populations under two thermal conditions (23 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Paternal half-sib heritability and genetic correlation in six life-history traits (i.e. development time, adult body weight, adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days after emergence, and total fecundity) were compared. Significant heritabilities were shown consistently in development time; this is also true for adult body weight, except for the Canberra population at 23 degrees C. However, neither population differences nor the effect of temperature were statistically detectable for any of these heritabilities, confirming thr generically determined flexibility. Positive genetic correlations between development time and adult body weight, and negative genetic correlations between the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days and adult lifespan were present for these populations at both temperatures, indicating the presence of genetic constraints. Pairwise comparisons of genetic correlations revealed the heterogeneity of the mio populations and across temperatures. These results suggest that the structure of generic covariance might have changed significantly during the divergence of natural populations and in response to the alteration of environmental conditions in E. postvittana.

TI  - Selection experiments to increase the proportion of males in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) by means of temperature treatment
VL  - 272
SP  - S80-S87
AB  - A two generation selection experiment in Nile tilapia (O. niloticus, Lake Manzala, Egypt) was carried out to test whether the proportion of males after temperature treatment could be sustainably influenced by selection. Starting with 45 families as a base population the families were tested for their thermal sensitivity in the following way. After a 9-day incubation period at 28 degrees C, fry of each family were subdivided into a control (28 degrees C) and a treatment group, each consisting of 110 fish. The treatment group was kept at a temperature of 36 degrees C for 10 days. Thereafter treated fry were gradually adapted to 28 degrees C again. Each treatment and corresponding control group was raised separately until sexing (by microscopic inspection of gonad squashes at a minimum age of 90 days). A random sample of ten males and females from control groups of each family was kept for later selection decisions. The percentage of males in treatment groups was the selection criterion and the families showing more than 80% males or less than 60% after temperature treatment were selected. Over two generations (G0 and G1) around 14% of the tested families were selected to produce two divergent lines (high and low line) which showed a high or low response to temperature treatment regarding their sex ratios. In the first and second generation of selection 66 and 26 families were tested in the high line and 72 and 13 families in the low line, respectively. After two generations of selection the temperature treated groups in the high line showed a male percentage of 90%, whereas the weakly sensitive low line showed an average male proportion of 54%. The realized heritability estimated from the cumulated realized selection response and -differential in successive generations was 0.69 in the high line and 0.86 in the low line. This study provides the first evidence that a surplus of males in temperature treated groups can be selected for as a quantitative trait. Thus, temperature sensitive lines could be produced as a consumer- and environment-friendly approach to significantly increase the proportion of males in Nile tilapia, if large numbers of broodstock could be tested.

AB  - Ectothermic body temperatures affect organismal performances and presumably fitness, and are strongly influenced by the thermal environment. Therefore, the processes of colonization of novel thermal habitats by lizards might involve changes in thermal preferences, performance curves (reaction norms) and field activity temperatures. According to theory based on optimality analysis, diverse aspects of the thermal biology of vertebrate ectotherms should co-evolve as to maximize performance at the temperature range more often experienced by animals in the field. One corollary of this premise is that derived lizard clades that experienced a significant shift in thermal ecology, in comparison with the ancestral condition, should prefer and select temperatures in a thermal gradient similar to those experienced in nature. Here we report an analysis of the premise stated before. Specifically, we verify whether or not Tropidurinae species from three major Brazilian habitats (the Rainforests, the semi-arid Caatingas and the Cerrados, a Savannah-like biome) differ in thermal ecology and thermoregulatory behavior. The Caatinga is believed to be the ancestral habitat of this sub-family, and differences are expected because species from semi-arid habitats usually exhibit high body temperatures for lizards, whereas forest specialists might be thermoconformers and active at low temperatures. We also compared selected temperatures in the laboratory by species from the two open habitats (Caatingas and Cerrados). Data were analyzed using both conventional and phylogenetic analysis tools. Although species from Caatingas exhibited higher activity temperatures in nature than those from Cerrados, mean selected temperatures were similar between ecological groups. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed these findings and evidenced large evolutionary divergence in field activity temperatures between sister species from different open habitats without coupled divergence in selected temperatures. Therefore, thermoregulatory behavior and ecological parameters did not evolve similarly during the colonization of contrasting open habitats by Tropidurinae. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Convection in icy outer shell and icy mantle has great influences on thermal evolution, internal dynamics, and survival of internal ocean in icy bodies. Rheological and kinetic properties in polycrystalline icy materials are key factors controlling the convective current in the interiors of icy bodies. It is indispensable to examine the grainsize sensitive flow law dominant at low stress conditions and kinetic processes affecting the grain-size evolution such as grain growth, dynamic recrystallization, and high-pressure transformation. Results of preliminary experiments on these properties are presented in this article.

AB  - The heating of simple geometric objects immersed in an isothermal bath is analysed qualitatively through Fourier's law. The approximate temperature evolution is compared with the exact solution obtained by solving the transport differential equation, the discrepancies being smaller than 20%. Our method succeeds in giving the solution as a function of the Fourier modulus so that the scale laws hold. It is shown that the time needed to homogenize temperature variations that extend over mean distances xm is approximately xm2/α, where α is the thermal diffusivity. This general relationship also applies to atomic diffusion. Within the approach presented there is no need to write down any differential equation. As an example, the analysis is applied to the process of boiling an egg.

VL  - 54

SP  - 238-244
AB  - Tradeoffs in performance or fitness across environments have important implications regarding the nature of evolutionary constraints. It remains controversial whether tradeoffs such as these reflect genetic correlations that are genuine evolutionary constraints. However, if such long-term genetic constraints do exist, they must be due to underlying pleiotropy such that alleles that confer high performance in one environment invariably confer low performance in another. The distribution of genetic correlations within and among populations can provide insight about the existence of such pleiotropic tradeoffs. The long-term association of certain teleost fish taxa with particular abiotic environments suggests that tradeoffs in performance across environments have constrained the geographic distribution of those taxa. Here we report the results of an experiment in which we artificially selected on acute heat- and cold-stress tolerance in two stocks of the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa from source populations with different thermal histories. Unexpectedly, we observed no direct responses to selection. Under certain conditions, fish from the different source populations differed significantly in cold tolerance, but not in heat tolerance. The results suggest there are no strong pleiotropic tradeoffs between heat- and cold-stress tolerance in these populations.

VL  - 5

SP  - 66-79
AB  - 1. A comprehensive reheat furnace model has been developed to determine the slab temperature evolution, the thermal stress, the dissolution temperatures, the heating speed, the furnace temperature profiles and the optimal residence time. These features provide a powerful tool for optimization of reheat furnace heating practices. 2. Two new heating criteria were created to address the lower temperatures of the skidmarks to avoid rolling load fluctuation and to ensure complete dissolution of the microalloy particles. 3. The effects of the curved skid riders were taken into account in the model, and the results indicate that the curved skid riders can help to alleviate the skidmarks by about 20°F and reduce the residence time by about 2 minutes. 4. The thermal stresses the slab experiences under typical Mobile furnace conditions would not be likely to cause cracking unless there are already preexisting defects in the slab. 5. It was interesting to reveal that, for slab reheating, depending on the temperature level and temperature homogeneity, a higher discharge temperature may require less residence time than that needed for a lower discharge temperature. This is opposite to what was commonly believed, that a lower discharge temperature would reduce residence time. 6. Thorough heating practice modifications were made by regrouping the heating families, decreasing or increasing the target discharge temperatures, reducing the minimum residence time and creating new heating practices. 7. The implementation of the modified practices to IPSCO's Mobile reheat furnace has exhibited an overall residence time savings of 12.3 minutes. This translates to a productivity increase of 8.8% and a substantial financial benefit.

AB  - Data of Ballhaus, Berry, and Green's oxygen barometry and Mössbauer spectroscopy were used to identify the redox state of dunites and chromites of the Nizhnii Tagil (dunite body of Mount Solov'eva) and Kytlym (Iov, Kos'va, and Sosnovka bodies) massifs in the Ural Platiniferous Belt and of the Uktus Massif, which does not belong to the belt. The accuracy of a series of olivine-chromite geothermometers (Roedder et al., 1979; Fabries, 1979; Ballhaus, Berry, and Green, 1991) was tested empirically, and correcting coefficients for them were proposed, which make it possible to take into account the effect of Ti on the partition of Fe and Mg between the phases and, thus, to make the calculated temperatures consistent with one another and with geothermometric data. The thermal evolution of the dunites during the development of the Platiniferous Belt was revealed, including the origin of autonomous dunite bodies over the temperature range 900-1100°C, their subsequent integration into dunite-clinopyroxenite-gabbro blocks (products of accretion at 700-800°C), and the development of platiniferous mineralization at 700-800°C. The analysis of these data reveals broad variations in the redox state of the inspected dunite and chromite samples, with the oxygen fugacity one to four orders of magnitude above the FMQ buffer. The redox parameters of ultramafics show variations within the belt as a whole, individual massifs, and blocks (for the Kytlym Massif). For example, at iron mole fractions of the Cr-spinel and olivine of 60 and 8%, respectively, the oxygen fugacity (logfO2 relative to the FMQ buffer) of dunites from various massifs is as follows: 2.6 for the Mount Solov'eva body, 2.2 for the Iov body, 3.0 for the Kos'va body, 2.5 for the Sosnovka body, and 1.9 for the Uktus Massif [at the Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratio of 60 and 8% for Cr-spinel and olivine, respectively]. The oxygen fugacity values in the chromitites, which are syngenetic with the dunites and bear background PGE concentrations, are practically identical to these values of the host dunites, while the epigenetic PGE-bearing chromitites are characterized by logfO2 values higher by 1.5-2 orders of magnitude. This testifies to the existence of a geologic interlude between the origin of different chromite types and the very strongly oxidized chemistry of the fluids responsible for the PGE mineralization. The redox state of ultramafic rocks of the Ural Platiniferous Belt and the genetically related rocks of the Uktus Massif is much more oxidized than that of sublithospheric Alpine-type ultramafics, both continental and oceanic, but is identical to the redox state of island-arc peridotites. Along with materials on the mineralogy and geochemistry of the mafic rocks and the composition of the PGE mineralization, these data led us to conclude that the whole rock complex of the belt and of the Uktus Massif was produced in environments close to those of island arcs.

TI  - Incubating female passerines do not let the egg temperature fall below the "physiological zero temperature' during their absences from the nest
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 97-110
AB  - Egg temperature was recorded at 1-5 min intervals during the incubation period in 42 nests of 14 different species. Only females incubated. Egg temperature therefore declined whenever a female left the nest for a period-off. Regardless of ambient temperature, however, females usually returned to their nests and continued incubating before the eggs had cooled down to the suggested "physiological zero temperature' (25-27°C). For 14 nests (6 species) in which egg temperature was measured at 1 min intervals, mean minimum egg temperature (MET) during periods-off was 30.4°C. Mean value for all 42 nests, with recording intervals varying from 1-5 min, was 31.2°C. The incubation rhythm adopted is presumably adaptive. Evolutionary aspects of the high MET-values are tentatively discussed. During periods of especially low ambient temperature the female either holds the egg temperature at a normal level or temporarily stops incubating altogether. Any intermediate solution seems to be ruled out. -Author

TI  - Oxidation of organic materials with perchlorates: Relevance to the chemistry on the Martian surface
VL  - 7441
AB  - No organic materials have been found on the Martian surface, based on the results from the Viking and Phoenix missions. The Phoenix mission detected the inorganic perchlorates in the Martian soil. Perchlorates are potent oxidizing substances. The high-temperature oxidative properties of perchlorates may promote combustion of organics in pyrolytic experiments. This may compromise the ability of Phoenix's TEGA (Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer) experiments to detect organics. The high temperature conditions of TEGA instrument are not representative of the environment on Mars. In this paper we pose a question if organic materials can survive oxidation with perchlorates at less drastic temperatures. We have surveyed the literature on oxidations of various groups of organic materials by perchlorates. Several amino acids, notably glycine and alanine, are quite resistant to this oxidation. The same is true for some heterocycles, purines and purimidines. These organic materials may have survived perchlorate oxidation in the natural environment on Mars. © 2009 SPIE.

VL  - 163
IS  - 1
SP  - 65-79
AB  - Competing hypotheses that try to relate population size, individual weight, and water temperature in running waters were tested. Female and male dry weight and specimen numbers of eleven caddisfly species (Trichoptera) collected from 1983 to 1991 in four emergence traps along the Breitenbach (Germany) were related to site specific water temperatures. Water temperature along the stream showed the classical pattern, almost constant near the source and increasing annual variability downstream. Temperature sum (dd = degree days) increased downstream; sums of the last three, six and nine months had a clear seasonality, twelve months sums were almost constant. Greatest up stream-down stream differences occurred in autumn and winter. Comparison of Trichoptera was based on yearly abundance and weight data. Females were heavier in all species but Potamophylax cingulatus. Among sites, weight differences were not detected for Apatania fimbriata, Silo pallipes, Tinodes rostocki, Plectrocnemia conspersa and for P. cingulatus (♂) and Rhyacophila fasciata (♂) at least in stream sections where they occurred regularly and abundantly. Weight differences were usually significant only between the uppermost or the lowermost, and the remaining sites along the stream. Sericostoma personatum exhibited an almost site by site weight increase downstream. Drusus annulatus (♂, ♀), R. fasciata (♀) and P. cingulatus (♀) were lightest at the downstream site, where only R. fasciata occurred regularly. C. villosa (♂, ♀), Potamophylax luctuosus (♂), S. personatum (♂) and Agapetus fuscipes (♂) were lightest at the uppermost site. No single hypothesis explained all results. High individual and population success (high weight or abundance) as predicted by the 'Thermal Equilibrium Hypothesis' occurred in D. annulatus, P. cingulatus and P. luctuosus. In contrast, high abundance and low weight occurred in C. villosa and S. personatum. Individual success seems to depend on a specific fit of genetic pre-adaptations, appropriate physiographical and ecological conditions, and competitive ability; it is not necessarily connected with population success. © 2005 E.

AB  - The strains of Caenorhabditis elegans displaying low (LT) and high (HT1, HT2, and HT3) thermotolerance were obtained from the wild-type N2 strain by artificial selection for thermostability of locomotion and by natural selection in laboratory for thermotolerance of fertility under tolerable environmental temperature elevation. All these strains are new genetic variants that emerged during the experiment. The worms of strains HT2 and HT3 displayed an elevated upper temperature limit for reproduction (from 26 to 27.5°C), thermostability of locomotion at 36°C, and survival at 37°C as compared with the strain N2. The results have demonstrated that adaptation of C. elegans to high tmeperatures is an appropriate laboratory model for studying the mechanisms involved in the evolution of thermotolerance of poikilothermic Metazoa. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

VL  - 50
SP  - 39-46
AB  - As revealed from recent drilling and organic geochemical testing and research, a series of lacustrine high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks was discovered in the upper section of the Chang 9 oil reservoir member of upper Triassic in Ordos Basin. The hydrocarbon source rocks show average TOC content as high as 5.03%, average bitumen "A" content as high as 0.8603%, and good quality organic precursors, which are of the sapropelic type mainly derived from lower aquatic plants and have reached the thermal evolution stage featured by oil-producing climax. Generally the lacustrine high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks were developed in local depressions of a lake basin, and the Chang 91 member was particularly formed in a depositional environment characterized by fresh water to weakly saline water, weakly oxidizing to weakly reducing setting and semi-deep lake facies, as was demonstrated by a variety of organic to inorganic geochemical parameters. As a result, high productivity constitutes the principal controlling force for generation of this series of high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks. Deposition of thinly-bedded and laminated tuffs as well as positive Eu anomaly corroborate the possible occurrence of anoxic geological event closely related to contemporaneous volcanic eruption, which would play a key part in development of the Chang 91 member of high-grade hydrocarbon source rocks. © Science in China Press 2007.

VL  - 45

SP  - 477-491
AB  - The resistance to body cooling of 594 newborn Scottish Blackface lambs was measured in a water bath during a programme of upwards and downwards genetic selection. Cold resistance was defined as the time taken for rectal temperature to fall to 35°C in the water bath. Upwards selection produced increased cold resistance which was genetically associated with increased skin thickness, increased total body insulation and greater persistence of high metabolic rate during cold exposure. The first two correlated responses to selection were more pronounced in twins than in singles. High cold resistance was phenotypically, but not genetically, associated with greater body weight, increased coat depth and higher levels of cold-induced metabolic rate (heat production). Single lambs showed higher weight-adjusted metabolic rates and higher cold resistance than twins. Singles recovered from hypothermia faster than twins in the low selection line only. Female lambs showed higher metabolic rate (whether weight-adjusted or not) and greater total body insulation than males. Their greater cold resistance was not quite significant. Increasing age (range 0·3 to 36 h) was associated with a small but significant decline in cold resistance. Thermoneutral metabolic rate was proportional to body surface area, whereas peak metabolic rate was proportional to body weight such that peak metabolic rate per unit body weight was independent of changes in body weight. These findings are discussed in relation to lamb survival. © 1987, British Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

SP  - 245-267
AB  - This paper attempts to apply a one dimensional model on four source rocks (Belayim, Lower Rudeis, Thebes, and Brown Limestone formations), in East Warda concession, October oil field, throughout the different geological times. Moreover, the fundamental aspects of the petroleum system in the study area is evaluated through studying maturation and hydrocarbon potential in order to gain an understanding of onset of oil generation and expulsion. The position of three wells (syn. or pseudo wells) is proposed based on the available geological and thermal data. Also, the existing temperature database is enhanced by using the available temperature data for 220 wells in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea, 53 wells in the Mediterranean Sea, 29 wells in the Nile delta, 7 wells in Sinai. 2 wells in Upper Egypt and 39 wells in the Western desert. Finally, the timing of oil generation for Belayim, Thebes, Lower Rudeis and Brown Limestone source rocks in the Northern Gulf of Suez area is updated. From this study we conclude that, the cumulative yield of the Belayim and Lower Rudeis formations is lower than that of the Thebes and Brown Limestone formations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 3
IS  - 7
SP  - 779-794
AB  - Despite intensive research, there is no clear empirical evidence to explain the evolution and persistence of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles. A recent hypothesis presented by Reinhold proposes that natal homing could lead directly to the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination. According to his hypothesis, daughters are produced in rare high-quality sites (associated with higher survival rates) to which they return and use to nest, thus deriving higher fitness than sons for whom the quality of the natal patch does not affect their reproductive output if they survive to maturity. We performed an initial empirical evaluation of several assumptions and predictions of this hypothesis as applied to painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), using data from five consecutive nesting seasons, on a major nesting beach. Females were somewhat philopatric to microgeographic sites and to vegetation cover types within the nesting beach, consistent with one of the assumptions of Reinhold's hypothesis. The variables we examined that influence hatchling fitness (predation, hatching success and sex ratio) were not stable at microgeographic nesting sites or at vegetation cover types. Predation was repeatable within females, whereas hatching success and sex ratio were not. Contrary to Reinhold's hypothesis, females did not nest more frequently in open sites (which tend to produce more females) than in patches with more vegetation (which tend to produce more males). Furthermore, preferred nest sites (as measured by nest density) did not produce predominantly females. However, nests with higher hatching success tended to produce slightly more females (although the magnitude of this effect was very small). Therefore, Reinhold's hypothesis is not applicable to C. picta at the level studied - that is, within a nesting beach over a 5 year period - because most of the essential conditions were not met by our data.

VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-58
AB  - The involvement of heat-inducible genes, including the heat-shock genes, in the acute response to temperature stress is well established. However, their importance in genetic adaptation to long-term temperature stress is less clear. Here we use high-density arrays to examine changes in expression for 35 heat-inducible genes in three independent lines of Escherichia coli that evolved at high temperature (41.5degreesC) for 2,000 generations. These lines exhibited significant changes in heat-inducible gene expression relative to their ancestor, including parallel changes in fkpA, gapA, and hslT. As a group, the heat-inducible genes were significantly more likely than noncandidate genes to have evolved changes in expression. Genes encoding molecular chaperones and ATP-dependent proteases, key components of the cytoplasmic stress response, exhibit relatively little expression change; whereas genes with periplasmic functions exhibit significant expression changes suggesting a key role for the extracytoplasmic stress response in the adaptation to high temperature. Following acclimation at 41.5degreesC, two of the three lines exhibited significantly improved survival at 50degreesC, indicating changes in inducible thermotolerance. Thus evolution at high temperature led to significant changes at the molecular level in heat-inducible gene expression and at the organismal level in inducible thermotolerance and fitness.

VL  - 19

SP  - 886-895
AB  - As genomic sequences become easier to acquire, shotgun proteomics will play an increasingly important role in genome annotation. With proteomics, researchers can confirm and revise existing genome annotations and discover completely new genes. Proteomic-based de novo gene discovery should be especially useful for sets of genes with characteristics that make them difficult to predict with gene-finding algorithms. Here, we report the proteomic discovery of 19 previously unannotated genes encoding seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) that are transferred from males to females during mating in Drosophila. Using bioinformatics, we detected putative orthologs of these genes, as well as 19 others detected by the same method in a previous study, across several related species. Gene expression analysis revealed that nearly all predicted orthologs are transcribed and that most are expressed in a male-specific or male-biased manner. We suggest several reasons why these genes escaped computational prediction. Like annotated Sfps, many of these new proteins show a pattern of adaptive evolution, consistent with their potential role in influencing male sperm competitive ability. However, in contrast to annotated Sfps, these new genes are shorter, have a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution, and have a markedly lower GC content in coding regions. Our data demonstrate the utility of applying proteomic gene discovery methods to a specific biological process and provide a more complete picture of the molecules that are critical to reproductive success in Drosophila. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - We analyse the dynamical and thermal evolution of dark matter and the intracluster medium in hydrodynamical N-body simulations of galaxy clusters. Starting from a sample of 17 high-resolution objects, with virial mass ranging from 3 x 10(14) to 1.7 x 10(15) h(-1) M., we follow the build-up of the systems in dark matter and hot gas through the repeated merging of satellites along their merging history trees. We measure the self-bound mass fraction of subhaloes as a function of time after the merging, estimate the satellite mean orbital properties as a function of the mass ratio with the main cluster at merging time, and study the evolution of their internal velocity dispersion, gas temperature and entropy as the substructure is disrupted by various dynamical processes, eventually reaching thermodynamic equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the main cluster. We model some relevant properties of subhalo orbits, as the time of the first pericentric and apocentric passages, and the typical distances and velocities at the corresponding times. This survival study can be used to interpret the dynamics of observed merging clusters; as an example, we apply our results to the system 1E0657-56. We show that, in the light of our results, the most likely interpretation of the data for this cluster points to the merger of a small group with mass M approximate to 1 x 10(13) h(-1) M. with a massive cluster with M approximate to 1.3 x 10(15) h(-1) M.

AB  - The role of temperature is central to both organic evolution and ecological processes. However, how temperature affects selection on body size is unknown. We tested whether small seed beetles (Stator limbatus) have an advantage over large beetles during scramble competition for mates, and whether this advantage varies with temperature. Within lines of beetles artificially selected to be large versus small, small males have a significant advantage over large males in scramble competition for females because the former takeoff more quickly and thus reach females before larger males. Selection favouring small male body size is significantly (and substantially) more intense at cooler temperatures. The adaptive significance of small male body size thus depends on ambient temperature. © 2007 The Royal Society.

AB  - Abstract: Parasitoids and their hosts are linked by intimate and harmful interactions that make them well suited to analyze fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes with regard to life histories evolution of parasitic association. Drosophila aspects of what parasitoid Hymenoptera have become model organisms to study aspects that cannot be investigated with other associations. These include the genetic bases of fitness traits variations, physiology and genetics of resistance/virulence, and coevolutionary dynamics leading to local adaptation. Recent research on evolutionary ecology of Drosophila parasitoids were performed mainly on species that thrive in fermenting fruits (genera Leptopilina and Asobara). Here, we review information and add original data regarding community ecology of these parasitoids, including species distribution, pattern of abundance and diversity, host range and the nature and intensity of species interactions. Biology and the evolution of life histories in response to habitat heterogeneity and possible local adaptations leading to specialization of these wasps are reported with special emphasis on species living in southern Europe. We expose the diversity and intensity of selective constraints acting on parasitoid life history traits, which vary geographically and highlight the importance of considering both biotic and abiotic factors with their interactions to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics of host-parasitoid associations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is common in some cryosurgical procedures to rely on freeze-thaw cycle(s) to destroy undesirable tissues. Most research in cryosurgery focuses on the freezing process and much less attention has been paid to thawing or re-warming. However, as ice melts during thawing, the extracellular solution can become locally hypotonic, driving water into cells, resulting in cell expansion and ultimately, membrane rupture. Therefore, the thermal history of the target tissue during both the freezing and thawing processes is critical for cell viability. To better understand and predict the thermal history during cryosurgery, we developed a two-dimensional numerical model to describe the complete freeze-thaw cycle during liquid nitrogen cutaneous cryosurgery. A stratified anatomical structure of human skin is considered in the model. The numerical simulation applies temperature-dependent thermal and physical properties for human skin tissue and considers the typical thermal boundary conditions for clinical practice. Parametric studies are performed to explore the influence of spray cooling, spray duration and surface heating. Results are discussed concentrating on iceball front propagation, lethal temperature isotherm evolution, tissue temperature variation and cooling rates. These results are expected to provide both quantitative and graphical support to cutaneous cryosurgery and suggest approaches to optimize current cryosurgical protocols. Copyright © 2005 by ASME.

TI  - Costs of resistance in the Drosophila-Macrocheles system: A negative genetic correlation between ectoparasite resistance and reproduction
VL  - 61
IS  - 6
SP  - 1391-1402
AB  - Genetic variation for parasite resistance occurs in most host populations. Costs of resistance, manifested as reduced fitness of resistant genotypes in the absence of parasitism, can be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of this variation. One powerful tool for detecting costs of resistance is the study of correlated responses to artificial selection. Provided that experimental lines are recently derived from large outbreeding populations, and that inbreeding is minimized during the experiment, correlated responses to selection are expected to be strong indicators of pleiotropy. We artificially selected for elevated behavioral resistance against an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) in replicate populations of the fly Drosophila nigrospiracula. Resistance was modeled as a threshold trait, and the realized heritability of resistance was estimated to be 12.3% (1.4% SE) across three replicate lines recently derived from nature. We contrasted the longevity and fecundity of resistant and control (unselected) flies under a variable thermal environment. We report that reduced fecundity is a correlated response to artificial selection for increased resistance, and that the strength of this effect increases from 25° to 29°C. In contrast, longevity differences were not detected between resistant and control lines at either temperature. These findings are robust as they were confirmed with an independent set of experimental lines. Thus, our results identify a negative genetic correlation between ectoparasite resistance and an important life-history trait. That a correlated response was only detected for fecundity, and not longevity, suggests that the genetic correlation is attributable to pleiotropic effects with narrower effects than reallocation of a general resource pool within the organism, although other interpretations are discussed. Combined with fluctuating parasite-mediated selection and temperature, the presence of this trade-off may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for resistance in natural populations. © 2007 The Author(s).

AB  - The association between climate change and the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events is now well established. General circulation models of climate change predict that heatwaves will become more frequent and intense, especially in the higher latitudes, affecting large metropolitan areas that are not well adapted to them. Exposure to extreme heat is already a significant public health problem and the primary cause of weather-related mortality in the U.S. This article reviews major epidemiologic risk factors associated with mortality from extreme heat exposure and discusses future drivers of heat-related mortality, including a warming climate, the urban heat island effect, and an aging population. In addition, it considers critical areas of an effective public health response including heat response plans, the use of remote sensing and GIS methodologies, and the importance of effective communications strategies.

TI  - Thermal plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster: A comparison of geographic populations
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Populations of Drosophila melanogaster show differences in many morphometrical traits according to their geographic origin. Despite the widespread occurrence of these differences in more than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of such variation are not fully understood. Thermal selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these differences. Results: In our work, we investigated several life history traits (body size, duration of development, preadult survival, longevity and productivity) in two tropical and two temperate natural populations of D. melanogaster recently collected, and in a temperate population maintained for twelve years at the constant temperature of 18°C in the laboratory. In order to characterise the plasticity of these life history traits, the populations were grown at 12, 18, 28 and 31.2°C. Productivity was the fitness trait that showed clearly adaptive differences between latitudinal populations: tropical flies did better in the heat but worse in the cold environments with respect to temperate flies. Differences for the plasticity of other life history traits investigated between tropical and temperate populations were also found. The differences were particularly evident at stressful temperatures (12 and 31.2°C). Conclusion: Our results evidence a better cold tolerance in temperate populations that seems to have been evolved during the colonisation of temperate countries by D. melanogaster Afrotropical ancestors, and support the hypothesis of an adaptive response of plasticity to the experienced environment. © 2006 Trotta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of cadmium resistance in Daphnia magna
VL  - 24
IS  - 9
SP  - 2341-2349
AB  - A diverse population of Daphnia magna Straus was formed in the laboratory by combining individuals from eight sources (48-hour EC50s from cadmium toxicity tests with these eight groups ranged from 26 to >120 μg/L). Selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was accomplished by determining the cadmium EC50 value, exposing neonates to that concentration for 48 hours, raising the survivors in cultures without cadmium, and using their offspring to repeat the procedure. After eight generations, this selection process increased the mean EC50 from 61 μg/L to 180 μg/L cadmium. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to first brood, number of offspring in the first brood, or the intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmium-adapted population and the control under ideal conditions or conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmium-adapted daphnids were smaller. The absence of differences between the two populations other than size suggests a lack of metabolic cost for the increased resistance. Gel electrophoresis indicated the presence of metallothionein, a metal binding protein, in daphnids. Because metallothionein is an inducible protein, the lack of apparent metabolic cost might be explained if elevated concentrations of metallothionein are only produced during cadmium exposure, when increased metabolic costs would be offset by greater survival probability. The EC50 values for the control and cadmium-adapted populations were not different during acute toxicity tests with copper or malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis of DNA showed a decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population based on the number of polymorphic markers and the calculated gene diversity, and this loss of diversity was reflected in reduced slopes of the concentration-response curves during cadmium toxicity tests. Although the evolved resistance would allow the adapted population to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to control daphnids, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant would likely reduce the probability of long-term survival, even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.

TI  - Temperature-induced shifts in associations of longevity with body size in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 56
IS  - 2
SP  - 299-306
AB  - One of the hypotheses of growing interest in studies of responses to thermal environments suggests that trade-offs and other trait associations may be altered by temperature. Here. the commonly observed positive association between body size and longevity was examined at two adult test temperatures, 14degreesC and 25degreesC. in cold-stress-selected lines (S) and their controls (C) in 25degreesC-reared Drosophila melanogaster. Thorax length (TL) and developmental time (DT) were also scored in 25degreesC-reared individuals before and after one generation of truncation selection on longevity. The topography of the selection surface that relates longevity to thorax and wing size was temperature dependent and differed both between lines and between sexes. Longevity increased monotonically with body size (TL) in C and S females at 25degreesC but, surprisingly, longevity decreased with body size in S individuals at 14degreesC, Body size did not diverge between S and C lines and showed no response to longevity selection. However, DT increased by 25degreesC-longevity selection in C individuals and decreased by 14degreesC-longevity selection in S individuals. These results suggest that trait associations (including the commonly observed trade-off between body size and DT) can greatly depend on temperature, as a shift in the sign of the correlation is possible at low temperature. Genotype X temperature interaction is an important source of variation in the relationship between soma size and longevity.

VL  - 8

AB  - Competing hypotheses: (1) Large body size confers more efficient energy use (relative efficiency hypothesis). (2) Large body size requires more energy to be sustained, a disadvantage when food is limited (absolute energy demand hypothesis). Organism: Yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), artificially selected for large and small body size in the laboratory for 11 (24) generations. Methods: Flies were reared in limited and unlimited larval food conditions and low and stressfully high temperatures, and after adult emergence they were held on water only to study the relationship between energy content (lipids, glucose, glycogen) and (physiological) adult life span under complete starvation (starvation resistance) in the laboratory. Conclusions: Limited larval food and high temperature decreased life span. Life span increased markedly with body size due to the greater energy content of larger flies. Small selection line flies had relatively more energy and longer life spans under complete starvation, indicating a compensatory correlated genetic response to body size selection. The larger males suffered most under multiple stresses. Our results support the relative efficiency hypothesis, which more than compensates for the greater absolute energy demand of larger individuals. © 2006 Wolf U. Blanckenhorn.

AB  - Shirnkage reducing admixtures (SRAs) are viable alternatives for reducing plastic shrinkage cracking in concrete. The objective of the present paper is to study early age plastic shrinkage in restrained concrete elements, where three different SRAs have been used. The influence of the admixture is analyzed through the following measurements: capillary pressure, evaporation, temperature evolution, crack evolution and settlement. The tests for studying the cracking and deformation were made on two different configurations (i.e., restrained prisms with reduced cross-section and restrained panel), in a wind tunnel, with controlled wind temperature and velocity. The conclusions obtained indicate the viability of the use of this type of admixture and the usefulness of the test methods.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae, Steinernematidae) are lethal insect parasites that have a symbiotic association with bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the changes in thermal sensitivity of two nematodes Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema anomali. The nematodes were genetically selected, together with their respective symbiotic bacteria, at nematodes' reproductive thermal niche breadth extremes, 15 degrees and 30 degrees C, by repeated passage through larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Nematode virulence (rate of insect mortality), establishment, and reproduction were evaluated after 12 passages (equal to 24-36 generations). Direct and correlated responses of the selected strains were compared with the ancestral strains, maintained at 25 degrees C, at the selection and novel temperatures. The thermal limits for virulence and establishment were extended in both species and at both selection regimes. The thermal reproductive niche breadth of H. bacteriophora was extended from 15 degrees-30 degrees C to 12 degrees-32 degrees C after selection at either 15 degrees or 30 degrees C, but that of S. anomali remained unchanged. Virulence of S. anomali was enhanced across the entire thermal niche breadth, but H. bacteriophora improved in one portion of the thermal niche and declined in another portion. Enhanced virulence of S. anomali was most likely due to the improvements in growth rate of the symbiotic bacteria, Xenorhabdus sp. Establishment of both species and reproduction of H. bacteriophora improved at most temperatures. S. anomali reproduction showed no direct response to temperature selection, but decrements and/or improvements were evident at novel temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the temperature-specific virulence and thermal niche breadth of entomopathogenic nematodes are malleable. Adaptation to either cold or warm temperature enhanced fitness in both cold and warm environments. S. anomali adapted to novel temperature by enhancing virulence, whereas H. bacteriophora improved fecundity. Trade-offs in fitness were rarely observed. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - The increase in air temperature in urban regions in relation to neighbouring rural areas is known as the 'heat island effect'. This study mapped the distribution of the heat island of São Paulo, Brazil, and compared three sample areas. Mortality and morbidity data were collected to assess the role of the excess temperature. A correlation was found between the intensity of the heat island and annual mortality rates associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The analysis of daily mortality data and air temperature data, however, led to the conclusion that, despite evidence of the heat island's influence on mortality and hospital admissions, there is no specific temperature increase pattern that could be considered as the main cause of health risks. Cultural and biological adaptation may play an important role in the health of the populations of tropical cities. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

VL  - 33

SP  - 93-100
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal biology of the Mexican lizards Sceloporus aeneus and Sceloporus bicanthalis (Phrynosomatidae). Sceloporus aeneus is oviparous, and has an elevation range of approximately 2400-3000 m. It is replaced at elevations above 3000 m by its viviparous sister species, S. bicanthalis, whose elevational range extends to at least 4250 m. Selected body temperatures (T(sel)) were measured on a laboratory thermal gradient. Mean selected body temperatures of S. aeneus and S. bicanthalis were 35.5 and 34.9 C, respectively. T(sel)'s for these two high elevation species were thus similar to T(sel) of low elevation Sceloporus, an observation that supports the static view of the thermal physiology of Sceloporus lizards. For neither species did selected body temperature vary as a function of sex or reproductive status of females. Body temperatures during activity in the field were not related to the time of year or the reproductive status of females, although male S. bicanthalis at one site had higher body temperatures than females. The mean daily maximum air temperature declined from 22 C at the S. aeneus site at 2800 m, to 19 C at the S. bicanthalis site at 3200 m, and to 8 C at the S. bicanthalis site at 4100 m. Mean body temperatures at these sites were 32, 32, and 29 C, respectively. These species were thus active at body temperatures lower than their 'preferred' body temperatures, presumably because of increasingly limited thermal opportunities at high elevations.

AB  - In response to starvation, bacteria may be stressed and develop mechanism to remain viable. By enhancing rates of macromolecular degradation and protein synthesis, they can enhance resistance to others stresses like heat shock. Moreover, starved bacteria can enter a viable but non culturable state. Then, they fail to grow on selective media under laboratory conditions. They can be present in food and stay able to initiate humans' illness. These bacteria are feared by hygienists but are uneasy to detect in food.

TI  - Geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in the frog Limnodynastes peronii
VL  - 204
IS  - 24
SP  - 4227-4236
AB  - I compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance of five populations of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) over a wide geographic range extending from the cool-temperate south to the tropical north of Australia. Maximum jumping performance of adult E peronii was assessed for each population at eight temperatures between 5degreesC and 32degreesC using a custom-designed force platform. From force recordings for each individual jump, maximum jumping force (F-max) and acceleration (A(max)) and maximum power output (P-max), take-off velocity (U-max), jump distance (D-J) and contact time on the platform (T-C) were calculated. The body mass of adult E peronii varied over their geographic range, from approximately 5 g for the lowland tropical population to more than 22 g for the cool-temperate populations. The thermal sensitivity of jumping performance varied over their geographic range, with the populations from the cooler climates generally performing better than those from the warmer climate populations at the cooler temperatures, and vice versa at the higher temperatures. However, not all parameters of jumping performance underwent parallel changes in thermal sensitivity amongst the populations of L. peronii. Only minor differences in the shape of the thermal sensitivity curves for F-max and A(max) were detected amongst the populations, while the thermal sensitivities of U-max, D-J and P-max all displayed considerable variation amongst the populations. The optimal temperatures for U-max, D-J and P-max were generally lower in the cool-temperate populations than in the tropical populations of L. peronii. To determine whether this geographic variation was due to genetic variation, or merely reflected phenotypic plasticity, I also compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance between metamorph L. peronii from two different populations raised under identical conditions in the laboratory. The maximum jumping distance of the metamorph L. peronii was assessed at seven temperatures between 8degreesC and 35degreesC for the two latitudinally extreme populations (i.e. lowland tropical Proserpine and cool-temperate Gippsland populations). Like adult L. peronii, the metamorphs from the cool-temperate population jumped further than those from the lowland tropical population at the lower temperatures, although no differences were detected at the higher temperatures. Thus, geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in L. peronii probably has a genetic component, and the different populations appear to have undergone genetic adaptation of their thermal sensitivity to the varied thermal environments.

TI  - Evolvability of Hsp70 expression under artificial selection for inducible thermotolerance in independent populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 75
IS  - 4
SP  - 325-334
AB  - To test whether expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 increases under selection for inducible thermotolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed artificial selection on replicate sets of Drosophila lines founded from two independent populations. Selection entailed pretreatment at 36 degreesC to induce thermotolerance and Hsp70 expression, followed by a more severe heat shock, whose temperature varied between sexes and among generations to achieve 50% mortality. Inducible thermotolerance increased slowly and continuously in selected lines and was 37%-50% greater than in controls after 10-11 generations. Lines founded from the two populations differed in their coevolution of Hsp70 expression. In lines founded from Evolution Canyon, Israel, Hsp70 level initially increased and thereafter was unchanged; replicate lines exhibited two temporal patterns of response to selection. In lines founded from Australia, Hsp70 levels increased throughout selection. In both cases, however, the increase in Hsp70 level averaged only 15%, suggesting that pleiotropy in Hsp70 function constrains evolutionary increase in its expression.

TI  - The evolution of Daphnia pulex in a temporally varying environment
VL  - 72
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-37
AB  - We investigated three aspects of adaptation to variable environments in Daphnia pulex (Cladocera: Crustacea): (1) effects of temporal variation on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity; (2) plasticity in sexual versus asexual lineages; (3) maintenance of genetic variation in variable environments. We performed a 72-day quasi-natural selection experiment comparing three patterns of variation: constant temperatures, varying but predictable temperature change, and unpredictable temperature change. All populations were begun with an identical array of 34 clones. During selection clonal variation declined in all populations and different patterns of environmental variation had little effect on amounts of genetic variation. Sexual and asexual lineages differed in size and growth rate, but did not differ in amounts of plasticity or in adaptation to variable environments. The primary target of selection was the Malthusian parameter (r) and life history traits of development time, offspring size and offspring number. The heritability of plasticity was generally lower than trait heritability. Because of this difference, the selection response on the mean of the traits overwhelmed the selection response on plasticity. Lower heritabilities of plasticity are very typical, suggesting that our results will be typical of responses to selection in nature. Our results suggest that selection will act mostly on trait means within environments and that plasticity will evolve often as a correlated trait. Because selection on plasticity is based on its across-deme, global fitness, this process will usually be slow. Comparative studies need to shift from closely related, local population differences to those of more distantly related populations or even different species.

TI  - Temperature dependence of fitness components in geographical populations of Drosophila melanogaster: Changing the association between size and fitness
VL  - 80
IS  - 4
SP  - 717-725
AB  - Contrary to the conventional wisdom 'bigger is better', evolution at high temperature invariably leads to small individuals in Drosophila melanogaster. Natural selection is known to be responsible, meaning that genotypes that are small because of adaptation to high temperature must have some temperature dependent fitness advantage. In this study we consider both preadult and adult fitness components, and show that large adults from a cold adapted population significantly outperform small adults from a warm adapted population only when tested at low temperature and low larval density. In all other conditions 'bigger is not necessarily better', meaning that environmental influences are capable of altering the association between size and fitness. Yet, 'smaller wasn't better either' under any condition, when considering the overall measure of fitness. Examination of individual fitness components revealed population by temperature interaction in preadult survival; this interaction is potentially capable of explaining the temperature specific advantage of small adult body size. At high temperature, the warm adapted population exhibits superior preadult survival while producing small adults. Geographical variation in adult body size seems to be the result of selection on larval growth and competitive strategies, resulting in alterations in the association between fitness components.

TI  - Thermal biology of Typhlodromips montdorensis: Implications for its introduction as a glasshouse biological control agent in the UK
VL  - 111
IS  - 2
SP  - 97-109
AB  - The recent unexpected local establishment of a non-native predatory mite, Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), in the UK prompted us to undertake this study, which investigated the thermal biology of an alien species Typhlodromips montdorensis (Schicha) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Laboratory and field experiments on its cold tolerance were used to assess its establishment potential outside of glasshouse environments in the UK. Currently, T. montdorensis is being tested as a glasshouse biological control agent against thrips and spider mites, but is not yet licensed for release in the UK. Typhlodromips montdorensis has a developmental threshold of between 10.3 and 10.7 degreesC, and a thermal budget of between 108.7 and 105.3 degree-days when estimated by weighted and simple linear regression, respectively. Under outdoor conditions, T. montdorensis could theoretically complete up to six generations a year. The supercooling points of female and larval T. montdorensis were -22 to -24 degreesC with 100% pre-freeze mortality apparent in both acute and chronic low temperature exposures. Typhlodromips montdorensis were unable to enter diapause under a selected laboratory regime. No reproduction occurred in the field from November to March, with 100% mortality within 7-14 days of release during this period. It is concluded that T. montdorensis would be a 'safe candidate' for introduction as a glasshouse biological control agent in the UK.

AB  - I tested the effects of different ration sizes on preferred temperatures of yearling lake charr, Salvelinus namaycush, by feeding them for about 2 weeks on one of four rations and then allowing them to thermoregulate in a temporal thermal gradient for 2 to 3 days. Selected temperatures and ration were directly and linearly correlated: the larger the ration, the higher the temperature selected. Mean preferred temperatures at different rations (shown in parentheses as percent of body weight per day) were as follows: 9.2°C (0.3); 10.6°C (0.8); 11.7°C (2.0); and 12.6°C (5.5). While the shift to lower temperature, under restricted ration, would maximize food conversion efficiency, previous growth studies indicate that even lower selected temperature would have been more beneficial. © 1985 Dr W.

AB  - During January 1977 three consecutive cold fronts crossed S Florida and the northern Bahamas which depressed shallow-water temperatures below the lethal limit for most reef corals. Digital thermal infrared data acquired by the NOAA-5 meteorological satellite, in situ water temperatures, and meteorological data were used to study the thermal evolution of Florida Bay and Bahama Bank waters. Coral mortality at Dry Tortugas was up to 91% during the 1977 event. Coral and fish kills were also reported from other parts of the Florida Reef Tract and northern Bahamas. Study results show that cold-water stress conditions can exist over vast shallow- water areas and have residence times of several days.-from Authors.

VL  - 20

SP  - 2144-2153
AB  - Evolutionary changes in the seasonal timing of life-history events can alter a population's exposure to seasonally variable environmental factors. We illustrate this principle in Wyeomyia smithii by showing that: (1) geographic divergence in diapause timing reduces differences among populations in the thermal habitat experienced by nondiapause stages; and (2) the thermal habitat of the growing season is more divergent at high compared with low temperatures with respect to daily mean temperatures. Geographic variation in thermal reaction norms for development time was greater in a warm compared with a cool rearing treatment, mirroring the geographic trend in daily mean temperature. Geographic variation in body size was unrelated to geographic temperature variation, but was also unrelated to development time or fecundity. Our results suggest that proper interpretation of geographic trends may often require detailed knowledge of life-history timing. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 135

SP  - 322-326
AB  - Although temperature is the most important environmental factor regulating arthropod development and reproduction, its influence on sex allocation in haplodiploid arthropods remains largely unexplored. We investigated under laboratory conditions how maternal age and temperature mediate offspring sex ratio of the spider mite Tetranychus mcdanieli (Acari: Tetranychidae). Over nine temperature regimes, female-biased sex ratios were consistently observed, varying from 57 to 87% among progeny produced over lifetime. Spider mite sex ratio was affected by maternal age: more male progeny were produced at both the beginning and the end of the female lifespan, yielding a dome shaped curvilinear relationship. This pattern of variation with age probably results from constraints on using sperm at young ages and sperm depletion or viability at older ages. We found a significant curvilinear relationship between temperature and sex ratio. The proportion of female offspring was lowest at intermediate temperatures and highest at extreme temperatures. We suggest that increased female-biased sex ratio at extreme temperatures is an evolutionary response of spider mites to deteriorating habitats as, in the Tetranychidae, females have better capacities than males to disperse and survive under harsh conditions.

VL  - 96

SP  - 97-107
AB  - We hypothesized that correlation between growth traits and upper thermal tolerance (UTT) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) might be explained by quantitative trait loci (QTL) localized to the same linkage groups. Microsatellites on three autosomal linkage groups carrying UTT QTL in rainbow trout were tested for associations with fork length (FL) and condition factor (K) in half-sib families of outbred rainbow trout and in backcrosses of trout lines selected on UTT. Additionally, we used a sex-linked microsatellite (OmyFGT19TUF) to test for marker-trait associations at the sex chromosomes. The sex-linked marker OmyFGT19TUF was significantly associated with FL and UTT, accounting for up to 9.6% and 9.7% of variance in these traits, respectively. Male advantages in FL (and, to a lesser extent, UTT) relative to their female sibs were dependent on the origin of the Y chromosome and thus varied among grandsire lines. However, males had higher K in a manner unrelated to Y chromosomal origin, suggesting a partially sex-limited expression of this trait. Omy325UoG was significantly associated with K in one of the outbred half-sib families, but no other significant autosomal marker-trait associations were detected. Our findings illustrate minor evidence that correlation between UTT and FL is partially determined by one or more sex-chromosomal QTL.

AB  - The genetic basis for determination of flight capacity in the light brown apple month, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Tortricidae), was investigated by means of heritability estimation, artificial selection and crossbreeding, using samples from two natural populations. The mean heritabilities estimated by offspring-parent regression were 0.559 for offspring on female parents and 0.427 for offspring on male parents. These results were largely consistent with those estimated from paternal half-sibs and with realized heritabilities calculated from selected generations, although the heritability of flight capacity varied, to some extent, with the populations and temperatures to which the individuals were subjected. These estimates indicate the existence of additive genetic variance for flight capacity in the natural populations. The response pattern in the selection experiment indicates that the genetic effect on flight capacity in this species is mainly additive, though the phenotype performance of flights in F, progeny from crossbreeding ‘long-fliers’ with ‘short-fliers’ suggests a weak dominance of short-flying genes and a slight maternal effect. © 1992 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

Climatologists have documented a rise in global average temperature that is unprecedented since the Industrial Revolution. This temperature change correlates with increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, which largely are of human origin. Global climate change is likely to profoundly affect global health. This article summarizes the science of climatology and global climate change caused by human actions and reviews potential health effects.

TI  - Asian, African and European biota meet at 'Evolution Canyon' Israel: Local tests of global biodiversity and genetic diversity patterns
VL  - 262
IS  - 1364
SP  - 149-155
AB  - Biodiversity differentiation and the relative importance of forces and causes driving evolution at the molecular and organismal levels require more critical testing. The opposite slopes of Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel, designated 'Evolution Canyon', display dramatic biotic contrasts. Higher solar radiation on the south-facing slope (S-slope) makes it spatiotemporally more heterogeneous, warmer, drier and fluctuating than the north-facing slope (N-slope). Consequently, local biodiversity differentiation across several hundred metres displays globally divergent patterns. In different groups of organisms (i.e. across phylogeny) the 'tropical Asian-African' S-slope harbours African and Asian xeric tropical biota. The S-slope is richer on average in terrestrial species, displaying higher genetic diversity than the 'temperate European' N-slope, which is richer in aquatic-dependent taxa. Adaptive differences in different organisms are demonstrated within and between the slopes. Microclimatic aridity diversifying selection seems here a major evolutionary force that drives adaptive molecular and organismal evolution. Present results suggest that 'Evolution Canyon' provides a fertile local testing model of evolutionary predictions.

VL  - 26

AB  - The claim that supercontinents insulate the mantle is largely based on recognition that seismically slow mantle below the Atlantic-African geoid high coincides with the former location of Pangea. We investigate the viability of continental insulation by varying both plate geometries and mantle properties in six three-dimensional (3D) mantle convection models. The efficiency of continental insulation is quantified by calculating the rate of change of the average temperature in the subcontinental mantle. Our findings generally agree with two-dimensional (2D) modeling results. However, we conclude that 2D convection models may exaggerate subcontinental heating, particularly in largely bottom heated cases, and that subcontinental heating results from an absence of subduction in the subcontinental mantle rather than the insulation of active upwellings. Correspondingly, we find that when large degrees of internal heating are present in the mantle, hotter-than-average regions evolve below large oceanic plates.

TI  - Body Size, Performance and Fitness in Galapagos Marine Iguanas
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 376-386
AB  - Complex organismal traits such as body size are influenced by innumerable selective pressures, making the prediction of evolutionary trajectories for those traits difficult. A potentially powerful way to predict fitness in natural systems is to study the composite response of individuals in terms of performance measures, such as foraging or reproductive performance. Once key performance measures are identified in this top-down approach, we can determine the underlying physiological mechanisms and gain predictive power over long-term evolutionary processes. Here we use marine iguanas as a model system where body size differs by more than one order of magnitude between island populations. We identified foraging efficiency as the main performance measure that constrains body size. Mechanistically, foraging performance is determined by food pasture height and the thermal environment, influencing intake and digestion. Stress hormones may be a flexible way of influencing an individual's response to low-food situations that may be caused by high population density, famines, or anthropogenic disturbances like oil spills. Reproductive performance, on the other hand, increases with body size and is mediated by higher survival of larger hatchlings from larger females and increased mating success of larger males. Reproductive performance of males may be adjusted via plastic hormonal feedback mechanisms that allow individuals to assess their social rank annually within the current population size structure. When integrated, these data suggest that reproductive performance favors increased body size (influenced by reproductive hormones), with an overall limit imposed by foraging performance (influenced by stress hormones). Based on our mechanistic understanding of individual performances we predicted an evolutionary increase in maximum body size caused by global warming trends. We support this prediction using specimens collected during 1905. We also show in a common- garden experiment that body size may have a genetic component in iguanids. This 'performance paradigm' allows predictions about adaptive evolution in natural populations.

TI  - Oxygen isotope variations in Lau Basin lavas
VL  - 144
IS  - 3
SP  - 177-194
AB  - New laser-fluorination oxygen isotope data are presented for volcanic glasses and phenocrysts from Lau and North Fiji Basin lavas. The low oxygen blank of the technique allows accurate analysis of these often scarce igneous phases. delta(18)O values of volcanic glass range from 5.53 parts per thousand to 6.06 parts per thousand. Oxygen isotope ratios of ferromagnesian and plagioclase phenocrysts are lower and higher than their host glasses, respectively, and coexisting phases appear to represent oxygen isotope equilibrium at magmatic temperatures. Evolved lavas from the propagating and dying rift tips in the Central Lau Basin display significant O-18-enrichment with magmatic evolution due to FeTi-oxide crystallisation and require that precursor melts had relatively low delta(18)O values immediately prior to oxide saturation. Development of these precursor melts from basaltic parents involved assimilation of hydrothermally altered sheeted dykes ol gabbros in recently accreted oceanic crust accompanied by crystallisation of a plagioclase-rich assemblage. The stable isotope geochemistry and petrology of Central Lau Basin lavas, constrain magmatic evolution to depth between 2.5 and 5 km beneath the seafloor. A dacite from Valu Fa Ridge is slightly O-18-enriched relative to Valu Fa basalts, consistent with crystallisation of a mineral assemblage similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts. O-18/O-16 ratios of Lau Basin basaltic glasses decrease with Mg Number; this observation could be reconciled with the assimilation and fractional crystallisation model proposed for initial differentiation of the evolved lavas. However, oxygen isotope data for Central Lau Basin basalts correlate positively with Ba/La while basaltic glasses from throughout the region display a negative correlation between delta(18)O and Na-8.0 suggesting that recycling of subducted oxygen and/or mantle fertility may also exert an influence on O-18/O-16 of primary melts. Presently, the lack of quantitative control over oxygen isotope fractionation in basaltic systems prohibits resolution of these effects. Detailed investigation of less complex suites of lavas, employing the precision offered by laser fluorination, may provide new insights into the behaviour of oxygen at magmatic temperatures.

AB  - Thermal selection by collared lizards (Crotaphytus collaris) and chuckawallas (Sauromalus obesus) was studied in continuously operating laboratory thermal gradients in a 12L:12D photoperiod in spring-summer. In both species, selected temperatures above the median were higher during the day than at night. Below the median selected temperature, however, nighttime temperature significantly exceeded daytime temperature in chuckawallas but not in collared lizards. Pinealectomized collared lizards selected significantly lower temperatures than sham-operated or intact controls. This effect was most pronounced at night. Pinealectomy had no effect on the temperatures selected by chuckawallas. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the seasonal life-history strategy of these two species. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Theories of the evolution of niche breadth usually depend. on the assumption that genotypes that are well adapted to exploit one habitat or resource are not well adapted to others. Such "trade-offs" are often apparent in interspecific comparisons, but have been harder to document at the within-population level. Selection experiments provide a promising. means for detecting within-population trade-offs: if selection for adaptation to one environment (e.g., diet, host, temperature) reproducibly lowers fitness in another, trade-offs are the likeliest explanation. Here, I describe strategies for using selection experiments to detect ecological trade-offs and-discuss some of the ambiguities that can arise in interpreting the results of such experiments. I also review two sets of studies that found evidence for trade-offs using selection experiments.

VL  - 25

SP  - 68-72
AB  - The oriental armyworm Mythimna separata (Walker) is a long distance migratory insect. It is well known that occurrence of this insect migratory behavior is regulated by many environmental and physiological factors such as rearing temperature, larval density, photoperiod, matting status, oviposition and hormone, while little is known affected by genetics. Since migration in insects usually occurs prereproductively and so the pre-oviposition period, determines the number of nights over which females of migrants can express their migratory potential. Pre-oviposition period ranged from 3 to 8 days in the female offsprings from insects collected in the field of Zhengzhou, He'nan Province, China on the same rearing conditions in the laboratory means it has a substantial genetic component which affect the female reproduction. The narrow sense heritability of pre-oviposition period was estimated by regression of mean offsprings on parents was 0.2899, demonstrating that genetic factors play a lesser role in the control of pre-oviposition period in M. separata. The flowing results of bi-selection experiments were consistent with those expected when a polygenic character is subjected to directional selection, the response of selection deduced from bi-selection in isofemale lines demonstrate that it is beneficial to the long pre-oviposition period female under the pressure of selection frequency though it is not obvious with the continuous generation selection. Further the results of reciprocal cross between isofemale lines indicate that pre-oviposition period is strongly influenced by genes located on the X chromosome, inherited from the male parent.

TI  - Different optimal offspring sizes for sons versus daughters may favor the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in viviparous lizards
VL  - 59
IS  - 10
SP  - 2275-2280
AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) has evolved independently in at least two lineages of viviparous Australian scincid lizards, but its adaptive significance remains unclear. We studied a montane lizard species (Eulamprus heatwolei) with TSD. Our data suggest that mothers can modify the body sizes of their offspring by selecting specific thermal regimes during pregnancy (mothers with higher and more stable temperatures produced smaller offspring), but cannot influence sons versus daughters differentially in this way. A field mark-recapture study shows that optimal offspring size differs between the sexes: larger body size at birth enhanced the survival of sons but reduced the survival of daughters. Thus, a pregnant female can optimize the fitness of either her sons or her daughters (via yolk allocation and thermoregulation), but cannot simultaneously optimize both. One evolutionary solution to reduce this fitness cost is to modify the sex-determining mechanism so that a single litter consists entirely of either sons or daughters; TSD provides such a mechanism. Previous work has implicated a sex difference in optimal offspring size as a selective force for TSD in turtles. Hence, opposing fitness determinants of sons and daughters may have favored evolutionary transitions from genetic sex determination to TSD in both oviparous turtles and viviparous lizards. © 2005 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

VL  - 18

SP  - 281-289
AB  - The evolution of phenotypic plasticity requires that it is adaptive, genetically determined, and exhibits sufficient genetic variation. For the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana there is evidence that temperature-mediated plasticity in egg size is an adaptation to predictable seasonal change. Here we set out to investigate heritability in egg size and genetic variation in the plastic response to temperature in this species, using a half-sib breeding design. Egg size of individual females was first measured at a high temperature 4 days after eclosion. Females were then transferred to a low temperature and egg size was measured after acclimation periods of 6 and 12 days respectively. Overall, additive genetic variance explained only 3-11% of the total phenotypic variance, whereas maternal effects were more pronounced. Genotype-environment interactions and cross-environmental correlations of less than unity suggest that there is potential for short-term evolutionary change. Our findings strengthen the support for the adaptive nature of temperature-mediated plasticity in egg size. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 38

AB  - SYNOPSIS. Morphological and physiological plasticity is often thought to represent an adaptive response to variable environments. However, determining whether a given pattern of plasticity is in fact adaptive is analytically challenging, as is evaluating the degree of and limits to adaptive plasticity. Here we describe a general methodological framework for studying the evolution of plastic responses. This framework synthesizes recent analytical advances from both evolutionary ecology and functional biology, and it does so by integrating field experiments, functional and physiological analyses, environmental data, and genetic studies of plasticity. We argue that studies of plasticity in response to the thermal environment may be particularly valuable in understanding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of plasticity: not only can thermally-relevant traits often be mechanistically and physiologically linked to the thermal environment, but also the variability and predictability of the thermal environment itself can be quantified on ecologically relevant time scales. We illustrate this approach by reviewing a case study of seasonal plasticity in the extent of wing melanization in Western White Butterflies (Pontia occidentalis). This review demonstrates that 1) wing melanin plasticity is heritable, 2) plasticity does increase fitness in nature, but the effect varies between seasons and between years, 3) selection on existing variation in the magnitude of plasticity favors increased plasticity in one melanin trait that affects thermorégulation, but 4) the marked unpredictability of short-term (within-season) weather patterns substantially limits the capacity of plasticity to match optimal wing phenotypes to the weather conditions actually experienced. We complement the above case study with a casual review of selected aspects of thermal acclimation responses. The magnitude of thermal acclimation ("flexibility") is demonstrably modest rather than fully compensatory. The magnitude of genetic variation (crucial to evolutionary responses to selection) in thermal acclimation responses has been investigated in only a few species to date. In conclusion, we suggest that an understanding of selection and evolution of thermal acclimation will be enhanced by experimental examinations of mechanistic links between traits and environments, of the physiological bases and functional consequences of acclimation, of patterns of environmental variability and predictability, of the fitness consequences of acclimation in nature, and of potential genetic constraints.

VL  - 41

SP  - 641-650
AB  - Resistance to fenvalerate was examined in a laboratory-selected population of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, during exposure through 10 generations. Selection results showed that LD50 values rose from 0.003,ug per larva to 31.1 mu g per larva and 36.7 mu g per larva respectively, in replications 1 and 2 during those 10 generations. Resistant line moth eggs were significantly smaller than those of moths before selection. Therefore, we selected a subpopulation of resistant lines under harsh environmental conditions of low humidity and high temperature, over 10 generations (Harsh line) without insecticide exposure. We selected another subpopulation of resistant lines under optimal environmental conditions of high humidity and normal temperature through all 10 generations (Optimal line). After 10 generations, the LD50 of fenvalerate decreased to 0.03 mu g per larva and 0.02 mu g per larva under harsh conditions and 0.2 mu g per larva and 0.29 mu g per larva under optimal conditions. The LD50 values were lower for the Harsh lines than for the Optimal lines in all generations. The egg size of both lines increased gradually through 10 generations. Comparisons of these two lines showed that the egg size increased more rapidly in the Harsh lines than in Optimal lines in early (first-sixth) generations. In subsequent generations, egg sizes were nearly normal in both lines. Comparison of immature survivability of Harsh and Optimal lines reared under those conditions showed that the survivability of Harsh line individuals was significantly lower than for Optimal lines. Comparison of the two lines' survivability showed an opposite result from the comparison when they were reared under equivalent optimal conditions. These results suggest that susceptibility to insecticides might recover more quickly in Harsh lines than in Optimal lines because resistant insects with small eggs had lower survivability than susceptible insects with normal eggs. They were eliminated more rapidly under harsh environmental conditions.

Data are few and many expect adaptation to be constrained by low genetic variation in invaders, which frequently experience population bottlenecks during colonization. Experimental results: We used a common-garden experiment to show that the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Insecta: Hemiptera: Adelgidae: Adelges tsugae) has evolved greater resistance to cold shock as it has expanded its range northward. This insect feeds on exposed twigs in winter and is vulnerable to extreme cold. Modelling results: Adelges tsugae has grown to a sufficiently large population size that its adaptive evolution appears unconstrained by the availability of new mutants, despite its parthenogenetic reproduction. Conservatively, its population size likely exceeds 1/(2u) within 40 ha of forest, where u is the haploid per-base mutation rate, so that on average a mutation arises each generation at every base pair in the entire genome within this area. Conclusion: This escape from genetic constraint is likely to be found in many species that have invaded successfully, facilitating their adaptation to novel conditions. © 2005 Adam H. Porter.

VL  - 169

SP  - 287-295
AB  - To assess the energetics of migration in an anadromous fish, adult American shad (Alosa sapidissima) were swum in a large respirometer at a range of speeds (1.0-2.3 body lengths (BL) s(-1), 13-24 degrees C). Metabolic rate (M-O2) was logarithmically related to swimming speed (B1 s(-1); r(2) = 0.41, slope = 0.23 +/- 0.037) and tailbeat frequency (beats x min(-1); r(2) = 0.52, slope = 0.003 +/- 0.0003). Temperature had a significant effect on metabolic rate (r(2) = 0.41) with a Q(10) of 2.2. Standard metabolic rate (SMR), determined directly after immobilization with the neuroblocker gallamine triethiodide, ranged from 2.2-6.2 mmolO(2) kg(-1) h(-1) and scaled with mass (W) such that SMR = 4.0 (+/- 0.03)W0.695(+/-0.15). Comparison of directly determined and extrapolated SMR suggests that swimming respirometry provides a good estimate of SMR in this species, given the differences in basal activity monitored by the two methods. Overall, American shad metabolic rates (M-O2 and SMR) were intermediate between salmonids and fast-swimming perciforms, including tunas, and may be a result of evolutionary adaptation to their active pelagic, schooling life history. This study demonstrates variability in metabolic strategy among anadromous fishes that may be important to understanding the relative success of different migratory species under varying environmental conditions.

AB  - The effect of an evolutionary adaptation to low environmental temperature on the development of lymphoid organs was examined in Harpagifer antarcticus from Signy Island (South Orkney Islands; 60° 43′S, 45° 38′W). Thymus, pronephric kidney and spleen were typical, both in position and structural development, of those observed in warmer-water teleosts. The pronephric kidney was the first organ to be infiltrated by leucocytes, at 1 h post-hatch, though the infiltration of the thymic epithelia and the development of the splenic anlage were not observed until 4 weeks post-hatch. Full development of the lymphoid organs was not achieved until the juvenile stage. Although an increased infiltration of the thymus, by subepithelial connective tissues and epithelial mucous cells, occurred in the juvenile and adult stages, there was no evidence of an advanced stage of thymic regression or involution in the adult Harpagifer. Thus, a suppressive influence of the low temperature environment, on the onset and degree of lymphoid organ development and thymic involution, was indicated in this species. © 1989.

VL  - 155
IS  - 5
SP  - 337-341
AB  - Bacteria are constantly facing many different environmental assaults, which may be of such severity that numerous survivors have important alterations in their genetic material. Some genetic systems induced in response to such stresses, for example the SOS system and the σS regulon, actively participate in the generation of genetic alterations. The key priority of those genetic systems during stress is to ensure survival. Therefore, the repair of lethal DNA lesions is an absolute necessity, while perfect restoration of original genetic information is not. Furthermore, the nature of DNA lesions might render error-free repair too costly, or even impossible for stressed bacterial cells. Although the majority of these genetic alterations are deleterious, the rare advantageous alterations may have long-term evolutionary consequences independently of whether the selection of molecular mechanisms involved in their generation is linked to survival strategies or not. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

The prediction capability of this integrated simulator has been extensively validated with data collected from several industrial batch annealing operations. In this article, the problems in controlling a batch annealing operation via conventional temperature based control strategy has been highlighted. These problems can be effectively resolved by using the integrated simulator. Furthermore, the utility of this simulator has been illustrated by a case study on optimization of coil dimensions for maximization of furnace productivity. © EDP Sciences.

AB  - Replicate lineages of the bacteriophage phi X 174 adapted to growth at high temperature on either of two hosts exhibited high rates of identical, independent substitutions. Typically, a dozen or more substitutions accumulated in the 5.4-kilobase genome during propagation. Across the entire data set of nine lineages, 119 independent substitutions occurred at 68 nucleotide sites. Over half of these substitutions, accounting far one third of the sites, were identical with substitutions in other lineages. Some convergent substitutions were specific to the host used for phage propagation, but others occurred across both hosts. Continued adaptation of an evolved phage at high temperature, but on the other host, led to additional changes that included reversions of previous substitutions. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the complete genome sequence not only failed to recover the correct evolutionary history because of these convergent changes, but the true history was rejected as being a significantly inferior fit to the data. Replicate lineages subjected to similar environmental challenges showed similar rates of substitution and similar rates of fitness improvement across corresponding times of adaptation. Substitution rates and fitness improvements were higher during the initial period of adaptation than during a later period, except when the host was changed.

TI  - How rapidly can maternal behavior affecting primary sex ratio evolve in a reptile with environmental sex determination?
VL  - 162
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-219
AB  - Theoretical models identify maternal behavior as critical for the maintenance and evolution of sex ratios in organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD). Maternal choice of nest site is generally thought to respond more rapidly to sex ratio selection than environmental sensitivity of offspring sex (threshold temperatures) in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD, a form of ESD). However, knowledge of the evolutionary potential for either of these traits in a field setting is limited. I developed a simulation model using local climate data and observed levels of phenotypic variation for nest-site choice and threshold temperatures in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with TSD. Both nest-site choice and threshold temperatures, and hence sex ratios, evolved slowly to simulated climate change scenarios. In contrast to expectations from previous models, nest-site choice evolved more slowly than threshold temperatures because of large climatic effects on nest temperatures and indirect selection on maternally expressed traits. A variant of the model, assuming inheritance of nest-site choice through natal imprinting, demonstrated that natal imprinting inhibited adaptive responses in female nest-site choice to climate change. These results predict that females have relatively low potential to adaptively adjust sex ratios through nest-site choice.

TI  - Climate change effects on wildlife populations
SP  - 239-252
AB  - climate change. Climate change effects on the demography of populations (i.e., changes in fecundity or survival rates) can be direct (i.e., abiotic through factors such as rainfall or temperature) or indirect through species interactions (i.e., through consumers, resources or competitors). Over time these processes and dynamics can result in positive, negative or neutral net effects with increasing, declining or stable population trends. For certain species groups it has been argued that shorter-lived species with higher fecundity might have a life span too short to develop behavioral adaptation to directional changes in their environment and are thus more sensitive to global change ('behavioral adaptation hypothesis'). In contrast, it has been postulated that short-lived and small-bodied species have a higher adaptation potential because (in the long term) shorter generation times allow higher rates of evolutionary adaptation ('structural adaptation hypothesis'). To evaluate these two hypotheses and to assess if and under which conditions net effects of climate change on species' demography are primarily positive or negative, we analyzed a selection of 47 peer-reviewed, empirical wildlife studies for the time period 1990-2007. Among all studies analyzed 73% reported negative climate change effects of which 60% were caused by biotic effects, i.e., indirect effects. There was an increased likelihood of positive effects amongst animals with shorter longevity (mean longevity = 13.3 and 5.7 years for negative and positive population effects, respectively). This suggests there may be an advantage to being shorter lived during periods of climatic change, and provides some support for the structural adaptation hypothesis. Mean number of generations studied was 4.1 (n=34, SD=8.2) and 9.3 (n=12, SD=10.1) among studies that reported negative and positive population effects, respectively. To our knowledge the results from this meta-analysis represent the first general assessment of climate change-induced demographic effects on wildlife populations. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Genetic enhancement of nematicide resistance in entomopathogenic nematodes
VL  - 7

SP  - 499-512
AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes are highly effective bioinsecticides. Their efficacy may be reduced due to the various pesticides they encounter in the soil. These include insecticides as well as nematicides used against plant-parasitic nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of genetic selection as means of enhancing resistance of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain HP88 to the nematicides: Fenamiphos (an organophosphate), Oxamyl (a carbamate) and Avermectin (a biological product). Estimates of heritability (h(2)) of resistance to the three nematicides were obtained from analysis of inbred lines derived from the base population. The heritability estimate for Fenamiphos was h(2) = 0.31, for Oxamyl h(2) = 0.71 and for Avermectin h(2) = 0.46. Five rounds of selection were performed. Thereafter, each line was divided into two: for one subline selection continued for six additional rounds. The other subline was reared without selection for the six additional rounds. After the eleventh round, resistance to the nematicides was examined as were several traits relevant to biocontrol efficacy including virulence, heat tolerance and reproduction potential. Selection resulted in an 8-9-fold increase in resistance to Fenamiphos and Avermectin and a 70-fold increase in resistance to Oxamyl. The enhanced resistance Oxamyl and Avermectin, and to a lesser extent to Fenamiphos, was stable and continued after selection was relaxed. No deterioration in traits relevant to biocontrol efficacy was observed in the selected lines as compared with the base population. The selected lines displayed enhanced cross-resistance towards some, but not all, of the nematicides tested. These results demonstrate that genetic selection can be used to enhance resistance of entomopathogenic nematodes to certain environmental stresses. The selected lines will be useful bioinsecticides in the context of integrated pest management.

TI  - Temperature, growth rate, and body size in ectotherms: Fitting pieces of a life-history puzzle
VL  - 44
IS  - 6
SP  - 498-509
AB  - The majority of ectotherms grow slower but mature at a larger body size in colder environments. This phenomenon has puzzled biologists because classic theories of life-history evolution predict smaller sizes at maturity in environments that retard growth. During the last decade, intensive theoretical and empirical research has generated some plausible explanations based on nonadaptive or adaptive plasticity. Nonadaptive plasticity of body size is hypothesized to result from thermal constraints on cellular growth that cause smaller cells at higher temperatures, but the generality of this theory is poorly supported. Adaptive plasticity is hypothesized to result from greater benefits or lesser costs of delayed maturation in colder environments. These theories seem to apply well to some species but not others. Thus, no single theory has been able to explain the generality of temperature-size relationships in ectotherms. We recommend a multivariate theory that focuses on the coevolution of thermal reaction norms for growth rate and size at maturity. Such a theory should incorporate functional constraints on thermal reaction norms, as well as the natural covariation between temperature and other environmental variables.

TI  - Variation in offspring investment within and among populations of Gammarus minus SAY (Crustacea: Amphipoda) in ten mid-Appalachian springs (U.S.A.)
VL  - 146
IS  - 3
SP  - 257-283
AB  - Amphipod crustaceans in freshwater springs offer excellent opportunities for testing hypotheses of life-history ecology and evolution. In this study, several hypotheses were tested regarding variation in brood mass, brood size (number of embryos per brood) and individual embryo mass within and among populations of Gammarus minus in ten cold springs in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Brood mass and brood size showed strong relationships with maternal body mass both within and among populations. Most of the relationships between brood mass and maternal mass were isometric or nearly so, as predicted by the hypothesis that available body volume within a confining exoskeleton is the major factor causing body-size scaling of reproductive investment in amphipods. However, as expected from optimal offspring-investment theory, embryo mass was usually unrelated to maternal mass and its variation was much less than that of brood mass and brood size. The effects of other factors were assessed by adjusting each reproductive trait to maternal mass (designated by the term 'relative'). As predicted by life-history theory, relative embryo mass and number were negatively correlated among populations. However, such trade-offs were usually absent within populations. Relative embryo mass was significantly greater during winter than summer in all four populations sampled, though varied seasonal effects occurred on relative brood mass and brood size. This seasonal variation in offspring size was unexpected, because in other amphipods it has usually been attributed to changes in water temperature, which varied little during the year in the study springs. Other potential causes of this variation are seasonal changes in food availability and watercress coverage. Relative brood mass, brood size and embryo mass varied significantly among the ten populations sampled. This variation was independent of differences in water chemistry among the springs. However, predation and watercress coverage appeared to have significant effects on reproductive investment in G. minus. Amphipods in springs with watercress and sculpin predators produced relatively many small eggs, whereas those in springs without watercress and sculpin predators produced relatively few large eggs. Eggs of intermediate size and number were produced in springs with watercress, but no sculpin predators. In addition, female size at maturation was smaller, and the slopes of brood mass and embryo mass regressed on maternal mass were steeper in predator-rich vs. predator-poor springs. It is suggested that these patterns are the result of habitat differences in age-specific growth and mortality rates, as predicted by life-history theory. However, it is not known whether the interpopulation differences in offspring investment are the result of evolutionary or phenotypically plastic responses to environmental variation.

TI  - Metabolic rates of benthic deep-sea decapod crustaceans decline with increasing depth primarily due to the decline in temperature
VL  - 37
IS  - 6
SP  - 929-949
AB  - The oxygen consumption rates of 11 species of benthic deep-sea decapod crustaceans were measured at a variety of temperatures to test the hypothesis that the metabolic rates of benthic crustaceans decline with increasing depth of occurrence only to the extent explained by the decline in temperature with depth. The species were captured at depths between 150 and 2000m off Southern California using an epibenthic beam trawl equipped with a thermally protecting cod-end to bring the animals to the surface uncontaminated by sediment and at the depth temperature. The data, combined with those for six species of shallower-living crustaceans from California waters, showed a significant decline in oxygen consumption rate with increased species' depths of occurrence, when the measurements were made at temperatures appropriate to each species' depth range. There was no significant relation between wet weight and depth of occurrence in these species. When the data were adjusted to 10°C using a moderate temperature effect factor (corresponding to Q10 values of 2-2.3 depending on the species and temperature range), the significant relationship between oxygen consumption rate and depth was lost, indicating that the observed decline with depth was due to the decline in temperature with depth. When the relationship between metabolic rate and depth of occurrence for the most active (carideans and penaeid) species were compared (ANCOVA) with that for the rest of the species, the active species had significantly higher rates. By combining this data set with data from the literature for a wide variety of shallow-living benthic decapod crustaceans, it was possible to create a data set of 35 species in which the effects of temperature, minimum depth of occurrence and body mass could be separated by multiple linear regression. This demonstrated highly significant effects of size and temperature, but no significant effect of depth for the entire data set and for the data set excluding penaeids and carideans. In contrast, the carideans showed a significant effect of depth on metabolic rate. This is discussed in terms of the adaptive and selective factors responsible for the well-known decline in metabolic rates of midwater crustaceans and fishes, an effect which does exceed the effect of temperature. It is suggested that the typical pattern for deeper living animals may be that metabolic rates on average vary as a function of depth due primarily to variation in temperature, except for the visually orienting pelagic groups (cephalopods, crustaceans and fishes). For those benthic forms which are particularly visually oriented and/or partially pelagic some significant depth-related decline in metabolism beyond that due to the decline in temperature is expected. © 1990.

TI  - Life span: Does the limit to survival depend upon metabolic efficiency under stress?
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
SP  - 233-241
AB  - Survival to old age in natural populations is enhanced by high vitality and resilience which depends upon substantial homeostasis and energetic and metabolic efficiency underlain by genes for stress resistance. Under this assumption increased longevity follows from primary selection for stress resistance where stress targets energy carriers. Furthermore old and young fitness should be correlated irrespective of age under the stressful selection regime of natural populations. In contrast, antagonistic pleiotropy is most likely under the less rigorous selection regime of well-nourished humans and laboratory populations surviving to old age. Similarly, hormesis for longevity, for example from a mild temperature stress or restricted food intake is most likely under benign environmental conditions. Assuming that aging in natural populations depends upon ecological circumstances, large evolutionary increases in life span are unlikely under the stress theory of aging since organisms are frequently close to their limits of survival where metabolic efficiency is at a premium. Exceptions can occur in island populations and for mutants under laboratory conditions since the risks from environmental hazards are reduced, and life span becomes extended as a consequence. In modern human populations, selection for stress resistance is less intense than in earlier times which should be permissive of the accumulation of stress-sensitive mutants under the mutation-accumulation theory of aging. However, this process is ultimately likely to restrict the evolution of life-span extensions in the future especially if abiotic conditions deteriorate, when survival would depend more directly on metabolic efficiency under stress.

VL  - 34

AB  - In an aquatic thermal gradient of 15-30 °C, 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old juvenile wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) acclimated to 20 °C selected the warmest temperature available (30 °C) and avoided the coldest temperatures available (15 and 18 °C). Mean selection of chambers differed between control and gradient tests across all temperatures except 27 °C. Turtles of all age classes relocated between chambers less often when the gradient was present than during control tests. Six- and 12-month-old turtles selected 30 °C more frequently, and selected colder temperatures less frequently, than 3-month-old turtles, suggesting that the ability to select preferred temperatures is better developed in older hatchlings. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hierarchical biomorphic ZnO films are prepared by a simple soakage procedure associated with succedent calcination treatment, using natural eggshell membrane (ESM) as the template. The hierarchy of ESM architecture is faithfully achieved by the assembly of ZnO nanocrystallites into interwoven meshwork at three dimensions. The thermal evolution, phase, morphology and pore size distribution of the samples are characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and nitrogen isothermal adsorption measurement.

AB  - New design techniques have been developed to optimize continuous casting (CC) refractory components. The overall objective is to increase CC productivity as well as steel quality by using optimized refractory from tundish-to-mold. These techniques allow the prediction of steel and refractory chemical interactions and, thus, steel chemistry evolution as well as build up and corrosion occurrence. Specific fluido-dynamic models (CFD) have also been developed to better take into account the physical parameters at the steel/refractory interface and to optimize steel flow control. The CFD model can be coupled with refractory chemical interactions to simulate steel chemical evolution. These two different approaches result in shape and material modifications. They are completed by dedicated thermal stress analysis in order to improve thermal shock resistance. The mechanical FEA evaluations take into account specific mechanical behavior of refractory components as well as high temperature evolution of their properties.

TI  - REALIS: Postgenomic analysis of Listeria monocytogenes
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 32-34
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a remarkably successful food-borne pathogen. It is capable a) of surviving and proliferating under conditions that exist within the food chain, such as at low temperatures, high salt and low pH and b) of colonizing animal host tissues after ingestion of contaminated food, causing opportunistic infections mainly, but not exclusively, in immunocompromised hosts. The ultimate goals of REALIS are two fold: Firstly, it aims to completely decipher all genes required for survival in and adaptation of Listeria monocytogenes to two very different environments, ie., the infected host and the external environment. Secondly, using genomics and postgenomic tools, REALIS seeks to precisely address fundamental questions regarding evolutionary relationships between pathogenic and non-pathogenic Listeria and to define qualities of particularly successful clonal pathovariants in causing disease. This project will provide both industry and health care managers with rational approaches to curbing food-borne contamination, minimising risks of infection and providing novel pharmacological approaches for halting the fulminant course of infection.

TI  - An evolutionary interpretation of the p-adic ultrametric diffusion equation
VL  - 75
IS  - 3
SP  - 453-455
AB  - An evolutionary model of ultrametric diffusion based on the ultrametric diffusion equation corresponds to the hierarchical picture of the referent description of biological world and one of the central problems of evolution theory, the problem of the error catastrophe. The error catastrophe in models is essentially related to the Archimedean metric and the combinatorially large size of the space of sequences and these considerations stimulate the search for evolution. The referent representation of the biological world is based on the assumption that each level of organization has integral typical representatives. The referent representation of the evolution process includes both horizontal evolution, which is related to the accumulation (reproduction), differentiation, recombination, and integration of bearers of referent features, and vertical evolution. In conclusion, the successive factorization of referent features with decreasing evolution temperature can be interpreted as an ultrametric concept of the origination and evolution of the biosphere.

AB  - Abstract: Climate change could significantly affect vectorborne disease in humans. Temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other climatic factors are known to affect the reproduction, development, behavior, and population dynamics of the arthropod vectors of these diseases. Climate also can affect the development of pathogens in vectors, as well as the population dynamics and ranges of the nonhuman vertebrate reservoirs of many vectorborne diseases. Whether climate changes increase or decrease the incidence of vectorborne diseases in humans will depend not only on the actual climatic conditions but also on local nonclimatic epidemiologic and ecologic factors. Predicting the relative impact of sustained climate change on vectorborne diseases is difficult and will require long-term studies that look not only at the effects of climate change but also at the contributions of other agents of global change such as increased trade and travel, demographic shifts, civil unrest, changes in land use, water availability, and other issues. Adapting to the effects of climate change will require the development of adequate response plans, enhancement of surveillance systems, and development of effective and locally appropriate strategies to control and prevent vectorborne diseases. © 2008.

VL  - 109
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-60
AB  - Cratons stabilized in the Archean because their mantle roots remained strong despite temperatures in the convecting mantle and amounts of radiogenic elements in the crust and in the lithospheric mantle that were larger than today. Thermal evolutionary models are developed using constraints from heat flow and heat production data in Archean provinces. The large time-scale of diffusive heat transport implies that the lithospheric mantle can remain thermally decoupled from the crust for as long as 1 Gyr. Heat production in the lithospheric mantle is a key variable in determining thermal conditions that permit stabilization of the crust and the preservation of a thick cratonic mantle root. Archean provinces are currently characterized by low heat flow, with an average of 41 MW m(-2) less than the global continental average (56 mW m(-2)). The range of regionally averaged heat flow values in Archean provinces (18-54 mW m(-2)) is narrower than in Proterozoic and Paleozoic terranes. However, at the end of the Archean, when crustal heat production was double the present value, surface heat flow would have varied over a range (approximate to 45-90 mW m(-2)) at least as wide as that presently observed in Paleozoic provinces. The high crustal heat production during the Archean is not sufficient to account for elevated lower crustal temperatures recorded in some metamorphic assemblages without some additional heat input, or without the crust being thicker, or the vertical distribution of radioelements being different from today's. Thermal models and the observed correlation between the degree of upper crustal enrichment and heat production values indicate that crustal melting and differentiation were largely driven by heating due to insitu radiogenic heat production. Even for values of the surface heat flow higher than average in cratons, the crust can be stabilized before 2.5 Ga if the radioelements are confined to shallow crustal layers. For present surface heat flow of 40-45 MW m(-2), calculations indicate that, prior to differentiation, the lowermost crust was near the solidus. Present heat production in the mantle root is constrained by estimates of the mantle heat flow. Further constraints can be obtained by modeling the past thermal regime of the root when heat production was higher. If heat generation is high and/or if the root is thick, the lower lithosphere must have cooled more rapidly than the convecting mantle, which implies that the temperature gradient was inverted at the base of the lithosphere and a weak mechanical layer formed in the middle of the root, precluding its survival. A low temperature gradient at the base of the root leads to the development of convective instabilities and possible removal of the lowermost part. Following its isolation from the convecting mantle and stabilization, thick continental lithosphere adjusts slowly to in-situ heat production and basal heat supply. We show that, due to in-situ heat production, temperatures in the lithospheric mantle may rise above their initial values inherited from the process of root formation due to in-situ radiogenic heat production.

VL  - 102

SP  - 909-915
AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid assay for enumerating thermophilic bacteria in milk powder. Methods and Results: The BactiFlow™ flow cytometer was used to count bacteria based on esterase activity in viable bacterial cells. A protocol for total viable bacteria was modified by heat-treating the sample to selectively label thermophilic bacteria. Samples of milk powder dissolved in 0.1% peptone were treated with 0.8% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to reduce background interference because of denatured milk proteins. Either thermophilic bacteria were added to the dissolved milk powder or milk powder solutions were incubated at 55°C for 2-3 h to enrich the natural thermophile population for testing. Results from the BactiFlow were compared with traditional plate count results. Conclusions: Thermophilic bacteria in milk powder can be enumerated within 1 h using the BactiFlow flow cytometer. Significance and Impact of the Study: Microbiological test results obtained within 1 h can potentially be used to monitor manufacturing processes, effectively trace problems and provide confidence in the manufacture of product. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 307
IS  - 8
SP  - 439-448
AB  - The thermal environment experienced during embryonic development can profoundly affect the phenotype, and potentially the fitness, of ectothermic animals. We examined the effect of incubation temperature on the thermal preferences of juveniles in the oviparous lizard, Anolis carolinensis. Temperature preference trials were conducted in a laboratory thermal gradient within 48 hr of hatching and after 22-27 days of maintenance in a common laboratory environment. Incubation temperature had a significant effect on the upper limit of the interquartile range (IQR) of temperatures selected by A. carolinensis within the first 2 days after hatching. Between the first and second trials, the IQR of selected temperatures decreased significantly and both the lower limit of the IQR and the median selected temperature increased significantly. This, along with a significant incubation temperature by time interaction in the upper limit of the IQR, resulted in a pattern of convergence in thermoregulation among treatment groups. The initial differences in selected temperatures, as well as the shift in selected temperatures between first and second trials, demonstrate plasticity in temperature selection. As a previous study failed to find environmentally induced plasticity in temperature selection in adult A. carolinensis, this study suggests that this type of plasticity is exclusive to the period of neonatal development. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted to assess the genetics of heat stress survival time (HSST) and its relationship to body weight (BW) in Japanese quail. In Experiment 1, Japanese quail from the Athens Randombred population were used and estimations of heritability (h2) and genotypic correlation (rg) were based on half-sib relationships. Three lines of Japanese quail selected under different environments and the Athens Randombred line were studied in Experiment 2. Estimations of h2 and rg were based on full-sib relationships. Heritability for HSST was moderate (.28 to .53) in Experiment 1 and low in Experiment 2 (.13 to .24). Phenotypic correlations between HSST and BW ranged from -.33 to -.05, and a negative genotypic correlations between HSST and BW suggested that selection for longer HSST would result in reduced BW.

SP  - 607-610
AB  - The possibility was examined whether the pool of sequence variants of HLVd which accumulated as progeny of "thermomutants" induced upon heat-treatment of hop could initiate infection of non-host solanaceous plants. It was found that HLVd microevolution led to the appearance of HLVd population in tomato. This viroid population was maintained at levels detectable by molecular hybridisation, showing the highest concentration in apical leaves. HLVd was further transferred from tomato to Nicotiana benthamiana, where distinct HLVd sequence variants appeared and were stably maintained at low levels. Our results show that replication of HLVd under heat stress resulted in the production of viroid quasispecies, potentially important for viroid evolution in so-called non host plants.

AB  - The thermal structure of Archean and Proterozoic lithospheric terranes in southern Africa during the Mesozoic was evaluated by thermobarometry of mantle peridotite xenoliths erupted in alkaline magmas between 180 and 60 Ma. For cratonic xenoliths, the presence of a 150-200 degreesC isobaric temperature range at 5-6 GPa confirms original interpretations of a conductive geotherm, which is perturbed at depth, and therefore does not record steady state lithospheric mantle structure. Xenoliths from both Archean and Proterozoic terranes record conductive limb temperatures characteristic of a "cratonic" geotherm similar to 40 mW m(-2)), indicating cooling of Proterozoic mantle following the last major tectonothermal event in the region at similar to1 Ga and the probability of thick off-craton lithosphere capable of hosting diamond. This inference is supported by U-Pb thermochronology of lower crustal xenoliths [Schmitz and Bowring, 2003. Contrib. Mineral. Petrol. 144, 592-618]. The entire region then suffered a protracted regional heating event in the Mesozoic, affecting both mantle and lower crust. In the mantle, the event is recorded at similar to 150 Mato the southeast of the craton, propagating to the west by 108-74 Ma, the craton interior by 85-90 Ma and the far southwest and northwest by 65-70 Ma. The heating penetrated to shallower levels in the off-craton areas than on the craton, and is more apparent on the southern margin of the craton than in its western interior. The focus and spatial progression mimic inferred patterns of plume activity and supercontinent breakup 30-100 Ma earlier and are probably connected. Contrasting thermal profiles from Archean and Proterozoic mantle result from penetration to shallower levels of the Proterozoic lithosphere by heat transporting magmas. Extent of penetration is related not to original lithospheric thickness, but to its more fertile character and the presence of structurally weak zones of old tectonism. The present day distribution of surface heat flow in southern Africa is related to this dynamic event and is not a direct reflection of the pre-existing lithospheric architecture.

AB  - An understanding of factors that influence species richness of lotic insects is generally lacking. We present comparative data on aquatic insect species richness from several North American and other streams. Factors such as large sample numbers and drainage area (species area relationships) are not significant predictors of species richness across the streams we examined. We explore several hypotheses regarding the origins and maintenance of species richness using Upper Three Runs Creek (UTR), South Carolina, USA, as a reference stream. UTR has the highest species richness of any stream in the Western Hemisphere. Hypotheses examined included historical, regional and local processes such as: (1) Evolutionary time, (2) disturbance regime/environmental variability, (3) temperature/evolutionary-speed, (4) productivity, and (5) habitat heterogeneity. Of these hypotheses, we suggest that productivity and habitat heterogeneity appear to contribute most to the high species richness found in UTR. We believe that multi-disciplinary analysis of other streams is necessary because without this crucial information our knowledge of, and desire to protect biodiversity in streams will be wanting.

IS  - 4
SP  - 958-964
AB  - Rock dragons are medium-sized agamid Lizards restricted to arid or semiarid rocky habitats in southern Australia. When eggs from two species (Ctenophorus decresii and Ctenophorus ornatus) were incubated at constant temperatures in the laboratory, temperature affected incubation period, hatchling tail length, and sex determination. At the lowest incubation temperature (25 C), all hatchlings were female; the proportion of males increased at big-her incubation temperatures. Rock dragons are fast growing and short-lived lizards; in the field they reproduce for only one or two seasons, Females lay multiple clutches of eggs from spring through to late summer which, in the climatically temperate part of Australia where these species occur, suggests that the date of hatching may be a good predictor of hatchling sex. Any sex differences in hatching date would, in turn, translate into sex differences in body size at the beginning of the next reproductive season, If the relationship between body size and reproductive success differs between the sexes in adult rock dragons, this would provide a plausible basis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in these species.

AB  - The fossil record of the volutid gastropod Arctomelon is represented by three species from the Koryak Upland and the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russian northeast), ranging in age from late middle Eocene to early Miocene. Although Recent Arctomelon stearnsii (Dall, 1872) from the northeastern Pacific is a cold-water species, paleontological data point to the origin of the genus in shallow, warm-water conditions that existed in high latitudes of the northwestern Pacific during Paleogene time. The fossil record also indicates survival of the genus during the climatic coolings through the Cenozoic. It is apparent that Arctomelon successfully adapted to the new cooler and deeper-water conditions. Despite this major change of life habit, shell morphology has remained fairly unchanged since the Eocene. Two new species of the genus Arctomelon, A. harasewychi sp. nov. and A. rateginense sp. nov., are described.

VL  - 45

SP  - 69-74
AB  - Newborn Scottish Blackface lambs from lines previously selected for high (H) or low (L) resistance to body cooling were tested for their metabolic response (O2 consumption) to cold exposure in a water bath or to subcutaneous injections of exogenous noradrenaline as a measure of non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). Six rams from the H line and six rams from the L line were used to produce lambs such that each sire had both cold-tested (no. = 48) and noradrenaline-tested (no. = 86) progeny. The mean elevations in metabolic rate produced by cold exposure and by noradrenaline were, respectively, 3·4 times and 2·4 times resting (thermoneutral) metabolic rate. H lambs showed significantly greater cold resistance and metabolic response to cold than L lambs. H lambs showed greater NST than L lambs but the difference was not significant. There were significant sire effects on NST, indicating genetic variation. There was a significant correlation between the metabolic responses to cold and those o t noradrenaline among the sire progeny groups. NST capability appears to be a phenotypic component of neonatal cold resistance which would respond to genetic selection, but this genetic variation is not a major component of that determining cold resistance. © 1987, British Society of Animal Science.

AB  - Temperature and humidity are among the most important environmental factors affecting insect adaptive strategies and evolution. Here, we report multiple adaptive differences between Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from the opposite slopes of Lower Nahal Oren canyon at Mount Carmel, Israel. The slopes are separated by 100 m at the bottom and 400 m at the top, and contrast sharply in physical and biotic factors. The multivariate fitness complex analysed in D. melanogaster included oviposition temperature preferences, viability and longevity changes, caused by short-term and lifetime temperature treatments, and resistance to drought stress at different temperatures. Some of these measures were obtained for the sibling species, D. simulans, and gave results that paralleled those of D. melanogaster. We conclude that strong microclimatic natural selection overrides migration in Drosophila at this microsite.

VL  - 55
IS  - 12
SP  - 2493-2502
AB  - Selection for late-life fecundity and longevity in adult Drosophila melanogaster is well known to modify numerous characteristics of life history and physiology. We report experiments here in which selection applied to behavior affects features in an identical fashion. Selection for feeding rate of larval D. melanogaster modifies caloric intake, as measured by the uptake and incorporation of labeled glucose. Selection for slow larval feeding produced lines of D. melanogaster in which larvae synthesized significantly less lipid prior to pupation and eclosed to have low early-life fecundity and a long life as adults. They also had greater lifetime fecundity, but lower viability of egg to hatched adult. Alternatively, fast-feeding larvae incorporated more lipid before pupation and eclosed with high early-fecundity that declined rapidly throughout their short adult life. Slow-feeding populations also had a significantly enhanced expression of the stress-resistance genes CuZn-SOD, CATALASE, and HSP70. Selection on larval feeding behavior reproduced the antagonistic evolutionary trade-off found under selection for adult life span and mimicked the physiological response in life span as seen in many species when dietary restriction is imposed on adults. Thus, nutrient acquisition during development appears to share a common evolutionary and genetic basis with the allocation processes that determine adult life-history traits and the related phenotypic dietary restriction phenomena.

VL  - 54
IS  - 3
SP  - 403-410
AB  - A variety of organisms have independently evolved proteins exhibiting antifreeze activity that allows survival at subfreezing temperatures. The antifreeze proteins (AFPs) bind ice nuclei and depress the freezing point by a noncolligative absorption-inhibition mechanism. Many organisms have a heterogeneous suite of AFPs with variation in primary sequence between paralogous loci. Here, we demonstrate that the diversification of the AFP paralogues is promoted by positive Darwinian selection in two independently evolved AFPs from fish and beetle. First, we demonstrate an elevated rate of nonsynonymous substitutions compared to synonymous substitutions in the mature protein coding region. Second, we perform phylogeny-based tests of selection to demonstrate a subset of codons is subjected to positive selection. When mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of the fish antifreeze type III antifreeze structure, these codons correspond to amino acid positions that surround but do not interrupt the putative ice-binding surface. The selective agent may be related to efficient binding to diverse ice surfaces or some other aspect of AFP function.

VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 447-460
AB  - The concentrations and quantities of eleven essential plant nutrients in a 15 m tall Eucalyptus signata dominated forest have been determined. This forest of 180 habiomass is supported on one of the most phosphorus‐deficient forest soils yet reported. The ecosystem is also particularly low in calcium, and relatively abundant in nitrogen. The nutrient stocks in the sclerophyllous heath understorey are only slightly more than half the quantity expected on the basis of their proportion of the total forest biomass occupied by this stratum. This lends some confirmatory evidence to the idea that the heath understorey of eucalypt forests is a separately evolved synusia adapted to soils of low fertility. Partitioning of nutrients among plant parts on this forest differs in a number of respects from other forests studied. This suggests the lack of strong selective pressure towards convergence of strategy between formations in the manner of partitioning of nutrients among forest components.

AB  - The lengths of the body and appendages of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphididae) vary seasonally in sexual North American and asexual Australian populations. The first generation of spring aphids in North America and winter aphids in Australia have short appendages in relation to body length. Excluding this phenotype, North American and Australian aphids cannot be discriminated morphometrically. The short appendages in North America are associated with a specialized morph called a fundatrix; the short appendages of Australian aphids are caused by exposure to low temperatures during prenatal development. The same temperature-sensitive mechanism operates in sexual and asexual North American aphids, but does not explain the short appendages of the fundatrix, which appear to arise through a separate mechanism. The short appendages are caused neither by a maternal effect from winged mothers, although such an effect exists, nor by seasonal changes in body length and allometry, nor by microevolutionary changes. The temperature-induced shortening of appendages is a seasonal polymorphism, which mimics the short appendages seen in fundatrices. The two types of phenotypic plasticity have the same consequence in sexual and asexual populations of the same species and may be an example of convergent evolution.

The studies were conducted by recording the thermal evolution in different parts of the piece as it was being forged, which was done by placing a series of type K thermocouples within the part and logging the data into a computer driven system. The initial trials put in evidence the need to change the heating practice in order to ensure a greater thermal homogeneity. Metallographic evaluation was carried out on formed pieces to study variations in their microstructure before and after the changes in the heating practice were made. Modification of this practice resulted in improvements in quality, such as the reduction in the variation in microstructure and wall thickness, as well as an increase in productivity, as the pressing speed was augmented.

TI  - Building Human Resilience. The Role of Public Health Preparedness and Response As an Adaptation to Climate Change
VL  - 35

SP  - 508-516
AB  - Abstract: Global climate change will increase the probability of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, drought, wildfire, cyclones, and heavy precipitation that could cause floods and landslides. Such events create significant public health needs that can exceed local capacity to respond, resulting in excess morbidity or mortality and in the declaration of disasters. Human vulnerability to any disaster is a complex phenomenon with social, economic, health, and cultural dimensions. Vulnerability to natural disasters has two sides: the degree of exposure to dangerous hazards (susceptibility) and the capacity to cope with or recover from disaster consequences (resilience). Vulnerability reduction programs reduce susceptibility and increase resilience. Susceptibility to disasters is reduced largely by prevention and mitigation of emergencies. Emergency preparedness and response and recovery activities-including those that address climate change-increase disaster resilience. Because adaptation must occur at the community level, local public health agencies are uniquely placed to build human resilience to climate-related disasters. This article discusses the role of public health in reducing human vulnerability to climate change within the context of select examples for emergency preparedness and response.

AB  - Relying on the results of investigations on the selection of turbine unit and boilers for industrial and heating thermal electric central stations, the article considers the main lines of selection of the optimal steam productivity of various types of boilers for different fuels for the foreseeable future. The problem is topical because of the expected large-scale design and manufacture of a few series of packaged boilers. It is concluded that statistical processing of available data makes it possible to obtain mean arithmetic and mean probabilistic evaluations of the expected unit productivity of boilers taking into account indeterminate character of the initial information.

AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution of fish eggs and larvae in the Ivinhema River Basin was analyzed. The aim was to determine the spawning areas and their relationship to environmental factors. Monthly collections were done from September, 1994, to February, 1995, in four sites: one in the Ivinhema River and three in different tributaries. Conic-cylindrical plankton net with 0.5 mm, coupled with a flow meter was used, and the samples were preserved in formol 4%. The abundance was standardized for 10 m3. Data related to water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, electric conductivity, and rainfall were also collected. Principal Components Analysis determined the correlation between the environmental variables and the ichthyoplankton density along each river stretch. 23,325 eggs and 16,012 larvae were collected. The density was higher during the rainy period. The spawning period coincided with high precipitation Jevel and temperature (October to December), with higher densities on the collect stations of Dourados and Vacaria rivers, with relatively basic pH and low electric conductivity.

AB  - Occurrences of medium-temperature eclogite-facies assemblages in the Norwegian Caledonides, Western Alps and Central European Variscides are reviewed with reference to a generalized tectono-thermal model for their stabilization in continental plate collision zones involving A-type subduction. It is demonstrated that the respective pressure-temperature-time paths for lower continental crust and uppermost mantle during such orogenesis contrast with that for upper crust, and that mineralogical features, such as chemical zoning in garnets, may monitor the tectonic location and thermal evolution of different crustal levels in the resultant thrust-nappe stack. Phanerozoic orogenic belts of this type typically show evidence of the generation of early eclogite-facies assemblages subjected to partial greenschist- or amphibolite-facies overprint some 40-60 Ma later. The survival and ultimate surface exposure of the high-pressure assemblages requires that their exhumation is rapid (mean uplift rate around 1 mm/year) relative to the rate of thermal relaxation in the tectonically thickened continental crust. © 1986 The Geological Society.

AB  - Thigh skin temperature was studied during bicycle ergometry graded exercise by means of Infrared Functional Imaging (IRFI). Executing of graded exercise determined a decreasing of the skin temperature throughout the exercise period, while it increased during the after-exercise recovery. Skin cooling and warming processes depended on the fitness level of the subjects, as estimated by the maximal oxygen consumption. IRFI permitted to record skin temperature time evolution of different regions involved in the exercise. IRFI may provide indirect complementary information about the hemodynamic recruitment by the muscular masses and the thermal processes associated with the exercise.

TI  - Comprehensive geochemical identification of highly evolved marine carbonate rocks as hydrocarbon-source rocks as exemplified by the Ordos Basin
VL  - 49
IS  - 4
SP  - 384-396
AB  - This study reversed the developing environments of hydrocarbon-source rocks in the Ordos Basin and evaluated carbonate rocks as hydrocarbon-source rocks and their distributions on account of the fact that China's marine carbonate rocks as hydrocarbon-source rocks are characterized by intensive thermal evolution and relatively low abundance of organic matter, by taking the Lower Paleozoic of the Ordos Basin for example and in light of the calculated enrichment coefficients of trace elements, the REE distribution patterns, the mathematical statistics analysis of elements and carbon isotopes and their three-dimensional diagrammatization in combination with the necessary organic parameters. As for the Ordos Basin, TOC=0.2% is an important boundary value. Studies have shown that in the strata where TOC is greater than 0.2%, Ba is highly enriched with positive delta C-13(carb) shifts and delta C-13(org) less than -28 parts per thousand, reflecting a thigh paleo-productivity, high burial amounts of organic matter, relatively good hydrocarbon-generating potentiality and intensive REE fractionation. All these indicated that the settlement rates are low and the geological conditions are good for the preservation of organic matter, hence favoring the development of hydrocarbon-source rocks. The Klimory and Wulalik formations show certain regularities in those aspects and, therefore, they can be regarded as the potential effective hydrocarbon-source rocks. In the strata where total TOC is less than 0.2%, the contents of Ba are low, delta C-13(carb) values are mostly negative, and delta C-13(org) values range from -24 parts per thousand-28 parts per thousand, demonstrating low burial amounts of organic matter, poor potentialities of hydrocarbon generation, weak REE fractionation and rapid settlement rates. These facts showed that most of the hydrocarbon-source rocks were formed in shallow-water, high-energy oxidizing environments, thus unfavoring the development of hydrocarbon-source rocks. It is feasible to make use of the geochemical method to comprehensively assess the highly evolved marine carbonates rocks as potential hydrocarbon-source rocks and their distributions.

AB  - Management programs to maintain and increase the sports fishery require large numbers of strong, healthy, acclimatized fingerlings for restocking the lakes and streams. To produce the fingerling trout needed, stocks of fish are first developed and selected at fishery laboratories, then tested in the field. At the University of Washington over a period of 23 years of intensive selective breeding, rainbow trout (Salmo gairdnerii) stocks have shown increased growth rate, earlier maturity, increased tolerance to warm water temperatures, resistance to disease, and greatly increased egg production. The egg production has been most satisfactory, rising from an average of less than 1,000 eggs from 4-year-old spawners in 1932 to an average of 3,894 eggs for 2-year-old females, 5,029 for 3-year-old females, and 4,984 eggs for 4-year-old females in 1955. © 1957 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Female philopatry in a heterogeneous environment: Ordinary conditions leading to extraordinary ESS sex ratios
VL  - 7
AB  - Background. We use a simulation-based model to study the impact of female philopatry and heterogeneity of habitat quality on the evolution of primary sex ratio. Results. We show that these conditions may lead to strongly biased ESS habitat-dependent sex ratios, under two kinds of density-dependent population regulation. ESS sex ratios are always biased towards females in good habitats, towards males in poor habitats, and are generally equilibrated considering the whole population. Noticeably, the predicted bias of sex ratio usually increases with decreasing female philopatry. Conclusion. The selection forces responsible for these results are fully described. This study provides a new perspective on the evolutionary significance of temperature sex determination. We discuss the case of turtles by comparing our theoretical results with field observations. © 2007 Hulin and Guillon; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - The ocean is not deep enough: Pressure tolerances during early ontogeny of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis
VL  - 276
IS  - 1657
SP  - 717-726
AB  - Early ontogenetic adaptations reflect the evolutionary history of a species. To understand the evolution of the deep-sea fauna and its adaptation to high pressure, it is important to know the effects of pressure on their shallow-water relatives. In this study we analyse the temperature and pressure tolerances of early life-history stages of the shallow-water species Mytilus edulis. This species expresses a close phylogenetic relationship with hydrothermal-vent mussels of the subfamily Bathymodiolinae. Tolerances to pressure and temperature are defined in terms of fertilization success and embryo developmental rates in laboratory-based experiments. In M. edulis, successful fertilization under pressure is possible up to 500atm (50.66MPa), at 10, 15 and 20°C. A slower embryonic development is observed with decreasing temperature and with increasing pressure; principally, pressure narrows the physiological tolerance window in different ontogenetic stages of M. edulis, and slows down metabolism. This study provides important clues on possible evolutionary pathways of hydrothermal vent and cold-seep bivalve species and their shallow-water relatives. Evolution and speciation patterns of species derive mostly from their ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions, within environmental constraints, which promote morphological and genetic variability, often differently for each life-history stage. The present results support the view that a direct colonization of deep-water hydrothermal vent environments by a cold eurythermal shallow-water ancestor is indeed a possible scenario for the Mytilinae, challenging previous hypothesis of a wood/bone to seep/vent colonization pathway. © 2008 The Royal Society.

AB  - Relationships between mean egg weight and overwintering survival in the laboratory were explored in selected large-and small-egg lines and also in first laboratory generations from 5 widely separated locations. Overwintering stress was provided by prolonged storage or above average storage temperature. Under stress large eggs were shown to have greater survival than small eggs in both stocks of insects. The results explain why spruce budworm from higher latitudes (longer winters) have heavier (larger) eggs. Other effects of prolonged storage and storage selection on subsequent size and development rates in both the treatment and the F1 generations are reported. © 1985, Entomological Society of Canada.

TI  - Incubation temperature effects on hatchling growth and metabolic rate in the African spurred tortoise, Geochelone sulcata
VL  - 87
IS  - 1
SP  - 64-72
AB  - We tested competing hypotheses regarding the persistence of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in the African spurred tortoise (Geochelone sulcata (Miller, 1779)), by measuring the effects of incubation temperature (T-inc) on a suite of physiological and behavioral endpoints, including resting metabolic rate, yolk-to-tissue conversion efficiency, posthatching growth, and temperature preference. Correlations of these variables with T-inc could lend support to the hypothesis that TSD persists owing to sex-specific benefits of development at specific temperatures, whereas absence of T-inc effects support the null hypothesis that TSD persists simply because selection favoring alternate sex determining mechanisms is weak or absent. The metabolic rate Q(10) value exhibited temporal variation and was higher immediately after hatching compared with 40 or 100 days posthatching, and mass conversion efficiency varied among clutches. Incubation temperature correlated inversely with duration of embryonic development, but did not influence yolk conversion efficiency, growth, or resting metabolic rate. Thus, our results provide little evidence indicating contemporary benefits of TSD, suggesting that TSD in G. sulcata is no longer evolutionarily adaptive but persists because selection against it and in favor of other sex-determining mechanisms is weak, or that TSD is an adaptive trait but for reasons not elucidated by this study.

TI  - Adaptive dimensions of health research among indigeneous siberians
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 165-180
AB  - Present evidence suggests that modern humans were the first hominid species to successfully colonize high-latitude environments (≥55°N). Given evidence for a recent (<200,000 years) lower latitude naissance of modern humans, the global dispersal and successful settlement of arctic and subarctic regions represent an unprecedented adaptive shift. This adaptive shift, which included cultural, behavioral, and biological dimensions, allowed human populations to cope with the myriad environmental stressors encountered in circumpolar regions. Although unique morphological and physiological adaptations among contemporary northern residents have been recognized for decades, human biologists are only now beginning to consider whether biological adaptations to regional environmental conditions influence health changes associated with economic modernization and lifestyle change. Recent studies have documented basal metabolic rates (BMRs) among indigenous Siberian populations that are systematically elevated compared to lower latitude groups; this metabolic elevation apparently is a physiological adaptation to cold stress experienced in the circumpolar environment. Important health implications of metabolic adaptation are suggested by research with the Yakut (Sakha), Evenki, and Buriat of Siberia. BMR is significantly positively correlated with blood pressure, independently of body size, body composition, and various potentially confounding variables (e.g., age and smoking). Further, this research has documented a significant negative association between BMR and LDL cholesterol, which remains after controlling for potential confounders; this suggests that high metabolic turnover among indigenous Siberians has a protective effect with regard to plasma lipid levels. These results underscore the importance of incorporating an evolutionary approach into health research among northern populations. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

TI  - Synthesis of life in the lab? Defining a protoliving system
VL  - 66

SP  - 181-185
AB  - The synthesis of a living system in the lab has been judged by a number of critics as partly attained by the proteinoid microsphere because of its primitive properties of metabolism, growth, and reproduction. These same critics, however, judge the organism as not alive, or as being 50 to 75 percent alive (Baltscheffsky and Jurka, 1984), owing to the absence of a nucleic acid genetic coding mechanism. The experiments in retracing evolution suggest, however, that the self-sequencing of amino acids was the evolutionary precursor of modern nucleic acid templating; the genetic memory is the molecule. The proteinoid microsphere is not a modern living system, but does represent at least a protoliving system (Fox and Dose, 1972). Berra (1990, p. 75) has commented on other difficulties in defining a protoliving system. In Berra's opinion, metabolism, reproduction, responsiveness to stimuli, and cellularity constitute or describe aliveness. These properties characterize proteinoid microspheres. A number of experiments demonstrate that amino acids in aminoacyl adenylates yield specific products, whereas nucleotides are without effect. For this and related reasons, especially the demonstrated self-sequencing of amino acids when they are warmed, resultant bio-functional properties of self-assembled microstructures, and demonstrated self-sequencing of amino acids in modern systems, the results appear to bridge from the chemical era to the biological period. All the above emerges from a departure in style of research (Young, 1984; Pauling and Zuckerkandl, 1972). The latter authors said, "It appears likely that biogenesis is the passage from a 'non-living system' existing in a large number of states to a 'living' system also existing in a large number of states."(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

VL  - 154

SP  - 37-42
AB  - Lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacterium commonly found on fresh meat and represents the predominant flora of vacuum-packed meat. In the present article, we studied the behavior of L. sakei in a chemically defined medium under various growth conditions relative to temperature or NaCl concentration. Growth occurred at each temperature, but growth rate and final cell density decreased at low temperature and survival was enhanced. In the presence of NaCl, we also observed a longer doubling time and a lower final cell density together with an enhanced long-term survival. When both conditions were combined, the long-term survival was greatly increased to about 28 weeks. Differences in cell morphology were observed under electron microscopy when cells were grown at low temperature in the presence of salt. We speculate that these are due to modifications in membrane structure. These results show that L. sakei is able to adapt to these environmental conditions and that slow growth is clearly associated with enhanced long-term survival. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

TI  - Fitness variation in response to artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 7
AB  - Background. Genetically based body size differences are naturally occurring in populations of Drosophila melanogaster, with bigger flies in the cold. Despite the cosmopolitan nature of body size clines in more than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of body size variation are not fully understood. In particular, it is not clear what the selective value of cell size and cell area variation exactly is. In the present work we determined variation in viability, developmental time and larval competitive ability in response to crowding at two temperatures after artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in four different natural populations of D. melanogaster. Results. No correlated effect of selection on viability or developmental time was observed among all selected populations. An increase in competitive ability in one thermal environment (18°C) under high larval crowding was observed as a correlated response to artificial selection for cell size. Conclusion. Viability and developmental time are not affected by selection for the cellular component of body size, suggesting that these traits only depend on the contingent genetic makeup of a population. The higher larval competitive ability shown by populations selected for reduced cell area seems to confirm the hypothesis that cell area mediated changes have a relationship with fitness, and might be the preferential way to change body size under specific circumstances. © 2007 Trotta et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Topoisomerase function during bacterial responses to environmental challenge
VL  - 8
SP  - d256-d263
AB  - Every living organism needs to have multiple defense mechanisms against environmental challenge for survival during evolution. Rapid changes in gene expression have been demonstrated during bacterial adaptation to environmental stress. Since DNA supercoiling varies in response to environment, and since supercoiling is known to influence strand separation in DNA, and therefore many vital cellular processes, including transcription, supercoiling could potentially serve as a molecular mechanism through which expression of many genes could be influenced by the environment. The relationship between changes in DNA topology and a number of environmental stress conditions including high temperature, oxidative stress and extreme pH, is reviewed here. The activities of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I are key components in determining the degree of bacterial DNA supercoiling. The specific involvement of topoisomerase function in bacterial adaptation to these environmental stress conditions, as demonstrated by the effect of mutations or inhibitors on adaptation and survival for these potentially lethal conditions, is also reviewed.

TI  - Assessing robustness for cell line selection
SP  - 8435
AB  - Robustness is among the most desirable features of a cell culture manufacturing process, which is tightly linked to the robustness of the production cell line. Process robustness is often assessed after the selection of the production clone. Screening multiple process parameters on multiple production clones can yield a model that predicts the robustness of each clone with respect to the parameters tested and the ability to control those parameters in a manufacturing environment. The statistically designed screening experiment first yields a model of the desired output (e.g. titer) as a function of the screening variables (e.g. pH, temperature, media conditions). This model is then used, with the knowledge of the capability to maintain set point at manufacturing scale, to provide a robustness index for each cell line. Final selection of the clone is based on the ability to meet the target productivity, optimization potential, and robustness. Multiple clonal cell lines were assessed for productivity and robustness for two independent clinical antibodies expressed in a CHO host. The experimental methods and robustness analyses of these multiple cell lines will be presented.

AB  - There are three Northeast Pacific Rivers still supporting spawning populations of green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris, but all have been modified hydrologically and thermally by dam construction. Age 1- to 3-year-old green sturgeon, progeny of artificially spawned, wild-caught Klamath River adults, were used to assess the effects of temperature and carbon dioxide on critical hematological parameters related to evolutionary adaptations of this species to its physical environment. In vitro measurement of the effect of temperature and carbon dioxide on blood-oxygen affinity and equilibrium curve shape yielded the following data for the respective temperature treatments (11, 15, 19, and 24°C): half-saturation values (P50's, kPa, a measure of affinity) 1.26, 1.44, 1.63, 1.69 for low-PCO2 treatments and 2.08, 2.41, 2.74, 2.94 for high-PCO2 treatments; Bohr factors -0.322, -0.327, -0.366, -0.536; and non-bicarbonate buffer values (slykes) -6, -3, -5, -8. Temperature sensitivities (ΔH, kJ mol O 2 -1 ) between these respective temperatures were -34.20, -15.24, -6.74 for low-PCO2 treatments and -20.05, -27.00, and -11.55 for the high-PCO2 treatments. These data suggest that juvenile green sturgeon may tolerate moderate environmental hypoxia, moderate aerobic activity, low to moderate hypercapnia, and moderate temperature changes in their environments. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - Inflating and deflating hot jupiters: Coupled tidal and thermal evolution of known transiting planets
VL  - 702
IS  - 2
SP  - 1413-1427
AB  - We examine the radius evolution of close in giant planets with a planet evolution model that couples the orbital-tidal and thermal evolution. For 45 transiting systems, we compute a large grid of cooling/contraction paths forward in time, starting from a large phase space of initial semimajor axes and eccentricities. Given observational constraints at the current time for a given planet (semimajor axis, eccentricity, and system age), we find possible evolutionary paths that match these constraints, and compare the calculated radii to observations. We find that tidal evolution has two effects. First, planets start their evolution at larger semimajor axis, allowing them to contract more efficiently at earlier times. Second, tidal heating can significantly inflate the radius when the orbit is being circularized, but this effect on the radius is short-lived thereafter. Often circularization of the orbit is proceeded by a long period while the semimajor axis slowly decreases. Some systems with previously unexplained large radii that we can reproduce with our coupled model are HAT-P-7, HAT-P-9, WASP-10, and XO-4. This increases the number of planets for which we can match the radius from 24 (of 45) to as many as 35 for our standard case, but for some of these systems we are required to be viewing them at a special time around the era of current radius inflation. This is a concern for the viability of tidal inflation as a general mechanism to explain most inflated radii. Also, large initial eccentricities would have to be common. We also investigate the evolution of models that have a floor on the eccentricity, as may be due to a perturber. In this scenario, we match the extremely large radius of WASP-12b. This work may cast some doubt on our ability to accurately determine the interior heavy element enrichment of normal, noninflated close in planets, because of our dearth of knowledge about these planets' previous orbital-tidal histories. Finally, we find that the end state of most close in planetary systems is disruption of the planet as it moves ever closer to its parent star. © 2009 The American Astronomical Society.

AB  - Selection of molecules with desired properties from random pools of biopolymers has become a powerful tool in biotechnology. On designing an evolution experiment, a certain knowledge of the concomitant fitness landscape is clearly helpful to set up the optimal experimental conditions. The correlation function is a useful means of characterizing a given landscape, since it can be efficiently measured if one has a method of separating a pool of random sequences according to their Hamming distance from a moderately small number of test sequences. In this paper we describe a special type of hybridization chromatography, where a mixture of oligomers (partially) complementary to a given test sequence is hybridized to the test sequence, covalently bound to a matrix. DNA oligomers are eluted in an 'effective temperature gradient' using conditions that minimize the differences of effects of GC versus AT pairs on the melting temperatures. This method should be a means to quickly separate error classes and thus be the crucial step in characterizing fitness landscapes of biopolymers through an experimental approach. It would also be a useful tool to design sequence pools with a bias towards desired mutant spectra.

VL  - 197

SP  - 34-44
AB  - Xylem ray parenchyma cells of Stylax obassia twigs undergo supercooling to -26 degrees C as the terminal temperature of the low temperature exotherm in summer and to -41 degrees C in winter upon freezing. During supercooling, no evidence of cell dehydration was recognized. cell walls were uncollapsed, no plasmolysis occurred, no ultrastructural changes in the plasma membranes or in cytoplasmic structures occurred, and high survival rates were maintained. Osmotic manipulation with hypertonic solutions of sorbitol did, however, cause dehydration of ray parenchyma cells, in which shrunken protoplasts and plasmolysis were observed. Freeze-fracture replicas showed that, in summer samples, osmotic dehydration produced aparticulate domains accompanied by fracture-jumps in the plasma membranes, which are known as a symptom of dehydration-induced injury, but no such effects were seen in winter samples. By contrast, in winter samples, osmotic dehydration produced conformational changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, which are known as a feature of dehydration tolerance, however, these changes were not seen in the summer samples. These results indicate that the ray parenchyma cells in S. obassia have the ability to tolerate dehydration in winter and lose this ability in summer. Such tolerance is similar to the dehydration tolerance in plant cells that adapt to freezing by extracellular freezing.

TI  - Relating environmental variation to selection on reaction norms: An experimental test
VL  - 169
IS  - 2
SP  - 163-174
AB  - Theoretical models predict that selection on reaction norms should depend on the relative frequency of environmental states experienced by a population. We report a laboratory experimental test of this prediction for thermal performance curves of larval growth rate in Pieris rapae in relation to their thermal environment. We measured short-term relative growth rate (RGR) for each individual at a series of five temperatures, and then we assigned individuals randomly to warm or cool selection treatments, which differ in the frequency distributions of environmental temperatures. Selection gradient analyses of two independent experiments demonstrated significant positive selection for increasing RGR, primarily through its effects on survival to adulthood and on development rate. In both the warm and cool selection treatments, the magnitude of directional selection on RGR was consistently greater at lower (suboptimal) temperatures than at higher temperatures; differences in selection between the treatments did not match model predictions. The temporal order and duration of environmental conditions may affect patterns of selection on thermal performance curves and other continuous reaction norms, complicating the connections between variation in environment, phenotype, and fitness. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 117

SP  - 778-788
AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments lies at the very heart of ecology and evolutionary biology. Clinal variation in traits related to fitness suggests a contribution of directional selection, and analyzing such variation has consequently become a key element in investigating adaptive evolution. In this study we examine climatic adaptation in the temperate-zone butterfly Lycaena tityrus across replicated populations from low-, (mid-) and high-altitudes, each reared at two different temperatures. In common garden experiments, high- compared to low-altitude populations showed a longer development time accompanied by reduced larval growth rates, increased cold- but decreased heat-stress resistance, and increased flight duration across a range of ambient temperatures. In contrast, differences in morphological traits such as pupal mass or wing size were negligible, suggesting that morphology is not necessarily indicative of flight performance. While patterns in stress resistance traits suggest adaptation to local temperatures, development times between populations were associated with differences in season length (enabling a second generation at lower altitudes, while high-altitude populations are monovoltine) rather than with temperature per se. Mid-altitude populations showed either intermediate patterns or patterns resembling low-altitude populations. Plastic responses to different rearing temperatures resulted, as expected, in reduced larval and pupal development times at higher temperatures accompanied by higher growth rates and decreased pupal mass. Further, butterflies reared at a lower temperature showed reduced chill-coma recovery times and decreased heat knock-down resistance as compared to those reared at a higher temperature. In summary, this study demonstrates local adaptations to regional climates, and that environmentally-induced plasticity can be as important as genetic factors in mediating adaptive responses. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of repetitive emplacement of basaltic intrusions on thermal evolution and melt generation in the crust
VL  - 203
IS  - 3
SP  - 937-955
AB  - A one-dimensional thermal conduction model simulates the repetitive intrusion of basalt sills into the deeper parts of the crust. The model assumes geothermal gradients of 10-30degreesC km(-1), and intrusion depths at 20 and 30 km. A range of intrusion rates from 50 m of intruded basalt every 1000, 10 000 and 100 000 years cover a range of geodynamic situations. There is an initial incubation period in which the basalt intrusions solidify. Generation of silicic melts initiates when the solidus temperatures of either the basalt magma or surrounding crust is reached. At an intrusion rate of 50 m per 10 000 years incubation periods in the range 10(5)-10(6) years are estimated, consistent with geochronological and stratigraphic data on many volcanic systems where there is commonly an evolution from mafic to silicic volcanism. Melt generation involves simultaneous cooling and crystallization of intruding basalt and partial melting of both new basaltic crust and pre-existing old crust. The proportion of these components depends on the fertility of the crust, in particular the abundance of hydrous minerals, and the temperature and water content of the basalt magma. For a wet (2% H2O) and cool (1100degreesC) basalt, melt generation can be dominated by residual liquids from basalt crystallization. For a dry (0.3% H2O) and hot (1300degreesC) basalt emplaced into fertile crustal rocks, such as pelite, melt generation can be dominated by partial melting of old crust. Melt proportions and temperature vary greatly across such a deep crustal intrusion zone, resulting in geochemical diversity in magmas. Segregated melts, if mixed together during ascent or in a high-level magma chamber, will be geochemical hybrids with mantle and crustal components. Intrusion rates of 50 m per 100 000 years or less are too low for large-scale melt generation in the crust. Periods of magmatic intrusion create reverse geothermal gradients and thermal anomalies in the crust which will take several million years to decay. Such anomalous zones are predisposed to remelt if a subsequent magmatic episode initiates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental temperatures preferred or selected by postlarval black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (body weight 84 +/- 25 mg and body length 2.66 +/- 0.21 cm, mean +/- s.d.) acclimatized to 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 or 36 degrees C, were determined in a horizontal gradient (17-37 degrees C). The results indicated that the crustaceans were competent in detecting thermal discontinuities and in showing preference. The mean temperature selected by the postlarvae rose from 20.0 degrees C to 25.6 degrees C and the mode from 15 degrees C to 27 degrees C when the acclimation temperature was increased from 16 degrees C to 36 degrees C. The preferred temperature of the shrimp was not significantly different among the groups acclimatized at 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C. The final preferendum of the shrimp was estimated to be 23.2 degrees C, which is considerably lower than the optimal growth temperature for the species.

TI  - Nested patterns in hyporheic meta-communities: The role of body morphology and penetrability of sediment
VL  - 95
IS  - 10
SP  - 917-926
AB  - Nestedness has been regarded as a common pattern of species distribution especially in terrestrial systems and vertebrate faunas. However, a significantly lower degree of nestedness has been reported for aquatic invertebrates. We analyzed the vertical distribution patterns of taxa in the upper 70 cm of the hyporheic zone. This biotope is abundantly inhabited by epigean fauna, which is morphologically pre-adapted to life within the limited space of sediment interstices. We tested the hypotheses that in the vertical profile of the hyporheic zone sediment acts as a physical barrier (filter), allowing only the morphologically pre-adapted and adapted (i.e., smaller, narrower, more flexible) taxa to penetrate to deeper layers. We demonstrated that this mechanism can promote a strongly nested and colonization-driven pattern at higher taxa levels. The sediment filter (1) constricted the body width: 0.50 mm appeared to be the upper limit for successful sediment colonization at the study site, and (2) favored elongated taxa against small sized taxa. We tested also the assumption that distribution of fine sediment affects the accessibility of hyporheic zone for fauna ("filter density") and thereby influences nestedness. However, we found that nestedness could be sufficiently explained by the depth itself. Our study offers a possible explanation of depth patterns in hyporeic meta-communities as a result of morphological characteristics promoting nestedness at higher taxa level. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Selection does not favor larger body size at lower temperature in a seed-feeding beetle
VL  - 62
IS  - 10
SP  - 2534-2544
AB  - Body size of many animals increases with increasing latitude, a phenomenon known as Bergmann's rule (Bergmann clines). Latitudinal gradients in mean temperature are frequently assumed to be the underlying cause of this pattern because temperature covaries systematically with latitude, but whether and how temperature mediates selection on body size is unclear. To test the hypothesis that the "relative" advantage of being larger is greatest at cooler temperatures we compare the fitness of replicate lines of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, for which body size was manipulated via artificial selection ("Large," "Control," and "Small" lines), when raised at low (22°C) and high (34°C) temperatures. Large-bodied beetles (Large lines) took the longest to develop but had the highest lifetime fecundity, and highest fitness (rC), at both low and high temperatures. However, the relative difference between the Large and Small lines did not change with temperature (replicate 2) or was greatest at high temperature (replicate 1), contrary to the prediction that the fitness advantage of being large relative to being small will decline with increasing temperature. Our results are consistent with two previous studies of this seed beetle, but inconsistent with prior studies that suggest that temperature-mediated selection on body size is a major contributor to the production of Bergmann clines. We conclude that other environmental and ecological variables that covary with latitude are more likely to produce the gradient in natural selection responsible for generating Bergmann clines. © 2008 The Author(s).

TI  - Climatic adaptation of Drosophila buzzatii populations in southeast Australia
VL  - 96

SP  - 479-486
AB  - Variation in 19 traits possibly relevant for thermal adaptation was studied in 11 populations of Drosophila buzzatii collected in southeast Australia. Using stepwise multiple regression, the variation was compared to variation in geographic coordinates and to a set of climatic variables estimated for each collection site. For 13 of the traits, a significant part of the variation was explained by climatic variables and/or geographic coordinates, suggesting directional selection for adaptation to the environment in the majority of traits studied. In 10 of the traits, both geographic coordinates and climatic variables explained significant proportions of the variation, with R2 ranging from 0.075 to 0.58. Although larvae, pupae and adults of D. buzzatii share a common habitat, the measured traits were not correlated across life stages and gender. Also, there seemed to be special conditions in marginal populations near species borders, giving rise to nonlinear relations with latitude. Climate apparently does influence the adaptive evolution of the traits studied, but they also are affected by other factors that vary with latitude, longitude and distance to coast. These results highlight the complex challenges imposed by the environment on the adaptive process. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

VL  - 9

SP  - 228-241
AB  - Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

TI  - Factors affecting habitat selection in a specialist fossorial skink
VL  - 97
IS  - 3
SP  - 531-544
AB  - Habitat specialists maximize their fitness by using a subset of the habitats that are potentially available to them and fare poorly if they move elsewhere. The factors that constrain habitat use are diverse and often difficult to identify, but are important to distinguish if we are to understand the trade-offs that drive species to become specialists. In the present study, we investigated habitat use in a fossorial skink, Lerista labialis, and explore the factors that confine it to the crests of sand dunes in the Simpson Desert, central Australia. Models positing that L. labialis selects dune crests because of their sparse cover of vegetation, more favourable temperatures, and greater abundance of preferred prey, received no support. Instead, a model positing that dune crests provide soft and less compacted sand that facilitates movement by L. labialis, was strongly supported. Sand on the crests was consistently softer that that on the sides and swales of the dunes; the skinks preferred soft rather than hard sand for movement in captivity, and were captured more often on experimentally softened sand than on compacted sand in the field. There was no evidence that L. labialis responds to attributes of the substrate other than softness because captive animals used loose sand from the dune crests, sides, and swales equally. We suggest that the dune crest environment allows L. labialis to reduce the energetic costs of locomotion, provides priority of access to the subterranean galleries of its termite prey, and also a secure refuge from surface-active predators and extreme surface temperatures.

VL  - 66

SP  - 1404-1418
AB  - The widespread distribution of insects over many ecological niches is a testimony to their evolutionary success. The colonization of environments at high latitudes or altitudes required the evolution of biochemical strategies that reduced the impact of cold or freezing stress. This review focuses on our current interests in some of the genes and proteins involved in low temperature survival in insects. Although the most widespread form of protection is the synthesis of low molecular weight polyol cryoprotectants, proteins with intrinsic protective properties, such as the thermal hysteresis or antifreeze proteins are also important. These have been cloned and characterized in certain moths and beetles. Molecular techniques allowing the isolation of genes differentially regulated by low temperatures have revealed that heat shock proteins, cold stress proteins, membrane protectants, as well as ice nucleators and other less well characterized proteins likely also play a role in cold hardiness. © 2009 Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel.

AB  - The aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum population is composed of different morphs, such as winged and wingless parthenogens, males, and sexual females. The combined effect of reduced photoperiodicity and cold in fall triggers the apparition of sexual morphs. In contrast they reproduce asexually in spring and summer. In our current study, we provide evidence that clonal individuals display phenotypic variability within asexual morph categories. We describe that clones sharing the same morphological features, which arose from the same founder mother, constitute a repertoire of variants with distinct behavioral and physiological traits. Our results suggest that the prevailing environmental conditions influence the recruitment of adaptive phenotypes from a cohort of clonal individuals exhibiting considerable molecular diversity. However, we observed that the variability might be reduced or enhanced by external factors, but is never abolished in accordance with a model of stochastically produced phenotypes. This overall mechanism allows the renewal of colonies from a few adapted individuals that survive drastic episodic changes in a fluctuating environment. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

AB  - Background: Given the recent changes in climate, there is an urgent need to understand the evolutionary ability of populations to respond to these changes. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed individual-based simulations with different shapes of the fitness curve, different heritabilities, different levels of density compensation, and different autocorrelation of environmental noise imposed on an environmental trend to study the ability of a population to adapt to changing conditions. The main finding is that when there is a positive autocorrelation of environmental noise, the outcome of the evolutionary process is much more unpredictable compared to when the noise has no autocorrelation. In addition, we found that strong selection resulted in a higher load, and more extinctions, and that this was most pronounced when heritability was low. The level of density-compensation was important in determining the variance in load when there was strong selection, and when genetic variance was lower when the level of density-compensation was low. Conclusions: The strong effect of the details of the environmental fluctuations makes predictions concerning the evolutionary future of populations very hard to make. In addition, to be able to make good predictions we need information on heritability, fitness functions and levels of density compensation. The results strongly suggest that patterns of environmental noise must be incorporated in future models of environmental change, such as global warming. Copyright: © 2009 Björklund et al.

AB  - Hypothermia with starvation is a major cause of neonatal mortality among lambs born outdoors. The results of selection for resistance to hypothermia (cold resistance) in newborn Scottish Blackface lambs are described. Cold resistance was defined as the time required to induce a decline in body temperature of about 4·5°C by means of tests involving part-immersion in a cooled water bath. From about 200 tested lambs (half males) four ram lambs with the lowest cold resistance and four with the highest resistance were selected and each mated randomly at 7 months of age to about 30 ewes to establish upward and downward selection lines. The progeny were subsequently tested for cold resistance and the selection process was repeated for four male generations. Tested females were allocated at 18 months of age to high or low lines according to their performance as lambs. Preliminary half-sib analysis and sire-offspring regression gave estimates of 0·3 for the heritability of cold resistance. Response to selection was rapid but asymmetrical with a realized heritability for cold resistance of 0·27 (s.e. 0·13) for upward selection, 0·01 (s.e. 0·16) for downward selection and 0·17 (s.e. 0·09) for the line divergence. Body weight at test was phenotypically, but not genetically, correlated with cold resistance. Rate of recovery from induced hypothermia was not significantly correlated with cold resistance. The results are discussed in relation to lamb mortality in the field. © 1986, British Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. 1.|Various traits in the reproductive potential of temperature populations of D. melanogaster show a balanced polymorphism through seasonal variations: viz. number of ovarioles, initial retention in virgin females and oviposition blocking capacity. The most probable selective factor seems to be temperature. This hypothesis was tested in laboratory conditions on the offspring of flies submitted to different developmental temperatures. 2. 2.|The experiment started with a study of 3 successive generations developed at a temperature of 25°C. Then one part of the population continued to evolve at this high temperature while another part was reared at 14°C. The changes in developmental temperatures induced modifications in the genetic equilibrium of the population as shown, in standardly reared offspring, by variations in phenotype frequencies of the various traits. The results tend to confirm the predominance of developmental temperature as selective factor in the induction of the observed balancing selection under natural conditions. Moreover they emphasize the importance of these variations in the stabilization of the various polymorphisms. © 1986.

AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide has resulted in scientific projections of changes in global temperatures, climate in general, and surface seawater chemistry. Although the consequences to ecosystems and communities of metazoans are only beginning to be revealed, a key to forecasting expected changes in animal communities is an understanding of species' vulnerability to a changing environment. For example, environmental stressors may affect a particular species by driving that organism outside a tolerance window, by altering the costs of metabolic processes under the new conditions, or by changing patterns of development and reproduction. Implicit in all these examples is the foundational understanding of physiological mechanisms and how a particular environmental driver (e.g., temperature and ocean acidification) will be transduced through the animal to alter tolerances and performance. In this review, we highlight examples of mechanisms, focusing on those underlying physiological plasticity, that operate in contemporary organisms as a means to consider physiological responses that are available to organisms in the future. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Thermal effects occurring upon heating a culture of blue-green microalgae Spirulina platensis in the temperature range 5-55 degrees C were studied. Under these conditions, an intensive heat evolution was observed. The heat evolution-versus-temperature curve has a peak with a maximum at approximately 45 degrees C and two distinct shoulders at approximately 25 and 40 degrees C. It was found that heat evolution Q at heating rates below 0.083 degree C/min does not change and is (381 +/- 20) J/g of dry biomass. It was concluded that this value is optimal for maintaining the cell viability (in particular, respiration) under anaerobic conditions, in the dark and in the stationary regime.

AB  - Current techniques in evolutionary synthesis of analogue and digital circuits designed at transistor level have focused on achieving the desired functional response, without paying sufficient attention to issues needed for a practical implementation of the resulting solution. No silicon fabrication of circuits with topologies designed by evolution has been done before, leaving open questions on the feasibility of the evolutionary circuit design approach, as well as on how high-performance, robust, or portable such designs could be when implemented in hardware. It is argued that moving from evolutionary 'design-for experimentation' to 'design-for-implementation' requires, beyond inclusion in the fitness function of measures indicative of circuit evaluation factors such as power consumption and robustness to temperature variations, the addition of certain evaluation techniques that are not common in conventional design, Several such techniques that were found to be useful in evolving designs for implementation are presented; some are general, and some are particular to the problem domain of transistor-level logic design, used here as a target application. The example used here is a multifunction NAND/NOR logic gate circuit, for which evolution obtained a creative circuit topology more compact than what has been achieved by multiplexing a NAND and a NOR gate. The circuit was fabricated in a 0.5 μm CMOS technology and silicon tests showed good correspondence with the simulations. © IEE, 2004.

VL  - 56

SP  - 349-360
AB  - Ectothermic organisms, such as insects and reptiles. rely on external heat sources to control body temperature and possess physiological and behavioral traits that are temperature dependent. It has therefore been hypothesised that differences in body temperature resulting from phenotypic properties. such as color pattern. may translate into selection against thermally inferior phenotypes. We tested for costs and benefits of pale versus dark coloration by comparing the behaviors (i.e., basking duration and bouts) of pygmy grasshopper (Tetrix undulata) individuals exposed to experimental situations imposing a trade-off between temperature regulation and feeding. We used pairs consisting of two full-siblings of the same sex that represented different (genetically coded) color morphs but had shared identical conditions from the time of fertilization. Our results revealed significant differences in behavioral thermo regulation between dark and pale individuals in females, but not in males. Pale females spent more time feeding than dark females, regardless of whether feeding was associated with a risk of either hypothermia or overheating. In contrast, only minor differences in behavior (if any) were evident between individuals that belonged to the same color morph but had been painted black or gray to increase and decrease their heating rates. This suggests that the behavioral differences between individuals belonging to different color morphs are genetically determined, rather than simply reflecting a response to different heating rates. To test for effects of acclimation on behaviors, we used pairs of individuals that had been reared from hatchlings to adults under controlled conditions in either low or high temperature. The thermal regime experienced during rearing had little effect on behaviors during the experiments reported above, but significantly influenced the body temperatures selected in a laboratory thermal gradient. In females (but not in males) preferred body temperature also varied among individuals born to mothers belonging to different color morphs, suggesting that a genetic correlation exists between color pattern and temperature preferences. Collectively, these findings, at least in females. are consistent with the hypothesis of multiple-trait coevolution and suggest that the different color morphs represent alternative evolutionary strategies.

AB  - Using physical models of Paleozoic insects in a wind tunnel, explored the potential effects of wings for increasing gliding distance, increasing dispersal distance during parachuting, improving attitude control or stability, and elevating body temperatures during thermoregulation. The effect of body size and shape, wing length, number, and venation, and meteorological conditions are considered. Hypotheses consistent with both fixed and moveable wind articulations are examined. A hypothesis is proposed in which the transition from thermoregulatory to aerodynamic function for winds involved only isometric changes in body size. Changes in body form were not a prerequisite for this major evolutionary change in function.-from Authors

VL  - 23

SP  - 989-995
AB  - P> Thermal acclimation is one of the basic strategies by which organisms cope with thermal heterogeneity of the environment. Under predictable variation in environmental temperatures, theory predicts that selection favours acclimation of thermal performance curves over fixed phenotypes. We examined the influence of diel fluctuations in developmental temperatures on the thermal sensitivity of the maximal swimming capacity in larvae of the alpine newt, Triturus alpestris. We incubated newt eggs under three thermal regimes with varying daily amplitudes (1, 5 and 9 degrees C) and similar means (17 center dot 6-17 center dot 9 degrees C), and accordingly we measured the swimming speed of hatched larvae at three experimental temperatures (12, 17 and 22 degrees C), which they would normally experience in their natural habitat. Embryonic development under low and middle temperature fluctuations produced larvae with similar swimming speeds across experimental temperatures. In contrast, the most fluctuating regime induced development of phenotypes, which at 12 degrees C swam faster than larvae developed under moderate diel fluctuations. Our results provide evidence that diel temperature fluctuations induce acclimation of thermal dependence of locomotor performance. In ectotherms experiencing diel cycles in environmental temperatures, this plastic response may act as an important pacemaker in the evolution of thermal sensitivity.

AB  - Pacific Island nations face serious problems as a result of climate change. There are likely to be effects on their economy, culture and society and there may also be threats to the survival of the small low-lying islands. If temperatures continue to increase, it is very likely that there will be irreversible damage to coral reefs and to large areas of land that could be inundated by sea-level rise. These islands may experience a reduction of freshwater resources and more severe storms and cyclones. If Pacific Island nations seek a remedy at international law, there are a number of different fora where they could commence a legal action. Some of these are the International Court of Justice, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, human rights institutions and the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement system. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of accessing these fora to try to obtain justice for Pacific Island nations that are facing the adverse effects of climate change. Another option for Pacific Island nations is that they may adopt other strategies to assist them to cope with future impacts, such as mitigation and adaptation strategies, or by seeking international assistance to obtain adequate insurance protection. © Australian Centre for Climate and Environmental Law 2009.

AB  - A series of hybrid hazelnuts developed by Phillip Rutter, Badgersett Research Farms, Canton, MN, have gained interest as potential alternative crops for farmers in mid-western USA. These hybrids were derived from crossing the commercially important Corylus avellana with North American species (C. cornuta and C. americana), possess tolerance to the harsh winter temperatures of the region and are relatively disease resistant, but they are difficult to propagate by conventional methods. Successful micropropagation has been achieved in our laboratory for selected genotypes by employing a medium based in part on the composition of the hazelnut kernel (Nas and Read, 2004). Acclimatization and subsequent establishment in the field proved to initially be an obstacle, but direct rooting of the microcuttings in rehydrated compressed peat pellets under conditions of high humidity and moderate light and temperature led to successful production of potted plants of one-half to one meter in height. Use of direct rooting in special plastic containers, together with a regimen of dilute nutrient sprays has facilitated more efficient and rapid multiplication, resulting in improved potential for scaled- up acclimatization and field establishment of the micropropagated hazelnut hybrids. Field plantings have been made in several locations and are being evaluated for trueness to type, winter survival, disease tolerance, growth characteristics and productivity.

VL  - 6
IS  - 2
SP  - 177-184
AB  - The ability of hatchling and juvenile turtles to thermoregulate, as evidenced by selection of preferred temperatures in thermal gradients, is an important factor influencing fitness. Previous studies in laboratory thermal gradients suggest that most young turtles select warm temperatures (25 degrees-33 degrees C) within a narrow range. Confounding factors affecting microhabitat selection, such as predator avoidance, foraging, or social interaction, may influence thermal preference in some species, particularly softshell turtles (Apalone spp.) that frequently bury in the substrate to remain cryptic. We analyzed temperature selection of juvenile Apalone spinifera in an aquatic thermal gradient of 15 degrees-30 degrees C with either gravel, sand, or a combination of sand and no substrate. Across all substrate treatments in the gradient tests, hatchlings selected the warmest temperature available (30 degrees C: 56.1% of observations) and avoided the 2 coldest temperatures (15 degrees C: 5.3%; 18 degrees C: 3.6%). Turtles relocated between chambers more often in control tests than when a gradient was present and fewer observations involved a chamber relocation in control tests. In gradient tests, chamber temperature significantly influenced selection, and the interactive effect of temperature and substrate was significant. We observed turtles more frequently in 30 degrees C in tests conducted with a sand substrate than with a gravel substrate or without a substrate. In tests conducted with sand in the 4 coolest chambers only, turtles chose the warmest temperature with a sand substrate more often than all other temperatures, except 30 degrees C. Our results indicate that hatchling A. spinifera can effectively detect temperature differences and select preferred temperatures within at least a 3 degrees C range and that substrate type may affect selected temperature.

AB  - We present results of the evolution of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of 3 and 5 M⊙ with solar metallicity calculated with the Eggleton stellar evolution code (STARS), which has a fully implicit and simultaneous method for solving for the stellar structure, convective mixing and nuclear burning. We introduce the concept of a viscous mesh in order to improve the numerical stability of the calculations. For the 5-M ⊙ star, we evolve through 25 thermal pulses and their associated third dredge-up events. We obtain a maximum helium luminosity of 1.7 × 109 L⊙ and significantly deep dredge-up after the second pulse. Strong hot-bottom burning is observed after the fifth pulse. The 3-M⊙ model is evolved through 20 thermal pulse events, and we find third dredge-up after the seventh pulse. During the 14th pulse, sufficient carbon has been brought to the surface to produce a carbon star. We find that dredge-up and the transformation into a carbon star occur at significantly smaller core masses (0.584 and 0.608 M⊙, respectively) than in previous calculations for 3 M⊙.

AB  - Oreochromis aureus exposed juring the first 28 days of exogenous feeding to constant 35 degrees C, or fluctuating temperatures (day at 35 degrees C, night at 27 degrees C, and vice versa) showed significantly (P<0.05) faster growth, least size heterogeneity and better survival rates than siblings under constant 27 degrees C. Constant high temperatures had a strong masculinizing effect (M : F sex ratios of 7.33-19.00 : 1.00 v. 0.75-0.82 : 1.00 in controls reared at 27 degrees C). Fluctuating temperatures had less masculinizing potential but still produced sex ratios significantly skewed to the detriment of females (M : F sex ratios of 2.33-11.50 : 1.00). This suggests that ambient temperature may have represented a sufficient environmental pressure for the selection of thermolabile sex-determinism in this species, and presumably in other Oreochromis spp. The evolutionary advantage of thermosensitivity in Oreochromis spp. is discussed. considering a framework where individual advantages oppose, to some degree, to the population or species interest.

VL  - 54

SP  - 1760-1767
AB  - The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) varies significantly in individual growth rates and life-history traits (maturation, reproduction, and survival) among adjacent populations in nature. This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental components of the substantial among-population variation in growth rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet, frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to affect first-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These results are considered in the context of population colonization history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate variation.

TI  - Phenotypic variability of quantitative traits in Indian populations of Drosophila kikkawai
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 13-18
AB  - Drosophila kikkawai, which has colonized the Indian subcontinent in the recent past, exhibits geographical variations for five quantitative traits among eight Indian populations (5.29-32.7 degrees N). Body weight, wing length, thorax length, abdominal bristles and ovariole number exhibit significant clinal variation with increase in latitude, while sternopleural bristles do not demonstrate such a trend. For the female sex, the slope values for body weight (2.25) and wing length (2.40) are higher but they are lower for thorax length (0.64) and ovariole number (0.51 per degree latitude). There is significant sexual dimorphism for the slope values only for body weight and thorax length suggesting simultaneous action of latitudinal selection pressure on these trails. However, the two sexes do not differ statistically in the latitudinal slope values for the wing length. A regression analysis of different traits on body weight implies correlated selection response on wing length and wing/thorax ratio while thorax length corresponds to changes in body size and does not differ in the two sexes. Regression analysis, on the basis of temperature-related climatic variables, evidence significantly higher association between all the five size-related traits and coefficient of variation of mean annual temperature (seasonal thermal amplitude; T-ev), T-min and relative humidity. Thus, genetic differentiation for quantitative traits in D. kikkawai are due to selective pressure from variable climatic conditions occurring on the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - The effects of intrasexual selection (i.e., male-male competition) and intersexual selection (i.e., mate choice) may result on the evolution of different secondary sexual traits. We tested whether chemosensory responses of male and female Iberolacerta cyreni lizards to femoral secretion of conspecific males (a chemical sexual trait used in social behavior) were eliciting by different chemical traits. Tongue-flick essays showed that males and females had similar chemosensory responses to the femoral secretions of males, but males and females differed in the magnitude of their chemosensory responses to the different chemicals found in secretions. Moreover, responses to chemicals related to body size depended on the own body size of the responding male, but did not in females. These results might support that femoral secretions of males convey different messages for male or female I. cyreni lizards. © 2008 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

VL  - 22

AB  - In insects including Drosophila melanogaster, females can overwinter at the adult stage by adopting a shallow reproductive diapause, but almost nothing is known about male reproductive diapause. In this study, we test for the maintenance of fertility in overwintering males from the eastern Australian D. melanogaster cline. Males from southern temperate populations maintained in field cages in temperate Melbourne had a higher fertility in spring compared with males from tropical locations. Temperate males successfully inseminated more females, and there were also more offspring produced per inseminated female. The resulting linear post-winter fertility clines were unrelated to male body size. In contrast, there was no clinal variation for fertility in nonoverwintering males held in the laboratory.

AB  - Nocturnal lizards inhabiting cool temperate environments potentially experience a wide range of body temperatures (T(b)). We used radio telemetry to characterize field T(b). in a nocturnal diplodactylid gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus) from a high-latitude (45 degrees S), sub-alpine site in Southern New Zealand. Variation in T(b) within days (diel), among clays and among different reproductive groups of this viviparous species (pregnant females, non-pregnant females and males) was measured with temperature-sensitive transmitters. We found that surgical implantation of transmitters did not have a significant effect on selected temperature on a laboratory gradient (T(sel)). Field T(b) values were examined in concert with T(sel) and microhabitat temperature in late Summer, revealing marked fluctuations of up to 30 degrees C in T(b) both within and between days. When weather conditions allowed, all reproductive groups exhibited some degree of thermoregulation, with T(b) generally elevated at least 4 degrees C above microhabitat temperature and within the bounds (central 50%) of T(sel) at the warmest times of day on most clays. Considerable thermoregulation occurred early in the day, particularly for pregnant females, and is likely to have involved some degree of direct solar basking. Temperature telemetry revealed both extreme variability in T(b) and complexity of thermoregulatory behaviour in a primarily nocturnal, thigmothermic lizard.

TI  - Thermal sensitivity of growth rate in hatchling Sceloporus lizards: environmental, behavioral and genetic aspects
VL  - 78
IS  - 3
SP  - 411-419
AB  - To investigate the physiological, behavioral, and genetic contributions to growth rate, we studied the thermal sensitivity of growth rate in hatchlings of the iguanid lizards Sceloporus occidentalis and S. graciosus in the laboratory. We used a cycling thermal regime patterned after thermal environments found in nature. Growth rates increased with duration of access to radiant heat. Thus, variation in the thermal environment can cause phenotypic variation in growth rate and hence body size. The two species differed in both the magnitude and thermal sensitivity of growth rate, and these differences were associated with differences in behavioral thermoregulation. Thus, growth is determined interactively by both behavior and physiology. We found evidence of among-family variation in the growth rates of S. occidentalis, suggesting that growth rate has the genetic potential to evolve. In S. occidentalis, both growth rate and egg size affected body size of hatchlings at several weeks of age. In turn, hatchling size may affect fitness: for example, larger S. occidentalis hatchlings had higher sprint speeds and may therefore be more adept at capturing prey or evading predators. Our results demonstrate that growth rate has genetic, behavioral, and physiological components, and that the resulting effects on body size may have important consequences for ecological performance e.g., sprint speed. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Non-genetic parental effects may largely affect offspring phenotype, and such plasticity is potentially adaptive. Despite its potential importance, little is known about cross-generational effects of temperature, at least partly because parental effects were frequently considered a troublesome nuisance, rather than a target of experimental studies. We here investigate effects of parental, developmental and acclimation temperature on life-history traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Higher developmental temperatures reduced development times and egg size, increased egg number, but did not affect pupal mass. Between-generation temperature effects on larval time, pupal time, larval growth rate and egg size were qualitatively very similar to effects of developmental temperature, and additionally affected pupal mass but not egg number. Parental effects are important mediators of phenotypic plasticity in B. anynana, and partly yielded antagonistic effects on different components of fitness, which may constrain the evolution of cross-generational adaptive plasticity.

AB  - The related bacteriophages φX174 and G4 were adapted to the inhibitory temperature of 44° and monitored for nucleotide changes throughout the genome. Phage were evolved by serial transfer at low multiplicity of infection on rapidly dividing bacteria to select genotypes with the fastest rates of reproduction. Both phage showed overall greater fitness effects per substitution during the early stages of adaptation. The fitness of φX174 improved from -0.7 to 5.6 doublings of phage concentration per generation. Five missense mutations were observed. The earliest two mutations accounted for 85% of the ultimate fitness gain. In contrast, G4 required adaptation to the intermediate temperature of 41.5° before it could be maintained at 44°. Its fitness at 44° increased from -2.7 to 3.2, nearly the same net gain as in φX174, but with three times the opportunity for adaptation. Seventeen mutations were observed in G4: 14 missense, 2 silent, and 1 intergenic. The first 3 missense substitutions accounted for over half the ultimate fitness increase. Although the expected pattern of periodic selective sweeps was the most common one for both phage, some mutations were lost after becoming frequent, and long-term polymorphism was observed. This study provides the greatest detail yet in combining fitness profiles with the underlying pattern of genetic changes, and the results support recent theories on the range of fitness effects of substitutions fixed during adaptation.

AB  - Cardinal evolutionary problems await resolution and critical testing. "Evolution Canyon" in Mount Carmel, Israel, is an excellent microcosmic model system of sharp physical (microclimatic) and biotic interslope contrasts, enabling critical tests in nature relevant to macrocosm evolution. We genotypically and phenotypically tested two phylogenetically and biologically very distant organisms there, the sessile, predominantly inbreeding plant wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, and the vagile and outbreeding drosophilid fruit fly, Zaprionus tuberculatus, a very recent colonizer of Israel. The genomes of these extremely different organisms were tested by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) for genetic diversity at 357 and 345 genetic markers (presumed gene loci), respectively. We found in both organisms parallel genetic patterns reflecting the canyon's opposite slopes, with significantly higher genetic polymorphism in subpopulations on the ecologically more stressful "African" (warmer and drier) south-facing slope. Likewise, both organisms displayed higher viability in parallel in response to severe drought stress on the more arid and climatically fluctuating "African" SFS. Our results suggest: (i) microclimatic selection is the major evolutionary interslope's fast-acting diverging force upon genotypes and phenotypes, overriding migration and drift, and (ii) ecological stress can generate global-scale adaptive evolutionary genome and phenome strategies, at both micro and macroscales, reinforcing homeostasis and fitness and suggesting continuity between micro and macroevolution. © 2006 Science From Israel / LPPLtd.

AB  - A strong foundation of basic and applied research documents that the estuarine fish Fundulus heteroclitus and related species are unique laboratory and field models for understanding how individuals and populations interact with their environment. In this paper we summarize an extensive body of work examining the adaptive responses of Fundulus species to environmental conditions, and describe how this research has contributed importantly to our understanding of physiology, gene regulation, toxicology, and ecological and evolutionary genetics of teleosts and other vertebrates. These explorations have reached a critical juncture at which advancement is hindered by the lack of genomic resources for these species. We suggest that a more complete genomics toolbox for F. heteroclitus and related species will permit researchers to exploit the power of this model organism to rapidly advance our understanding of fundamental biological and pathological mechanisms among vertebrates, as well as ecological strategies and evolutionary processes common to all living organisms. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 15

AB  - 1. The physical conditions experienced by reptile embryos inside natural nests can influence the size, shape and behaviour of the resultant hatchlings. Although most reptiles are tropical, the effects of incubation temperatures on offspring phenotypes have received little attention in tropical species. 2. The consequences of differences in thermal variance during incubation on offspring were studied in a tropical natricine snake (the Keelback Tropidonophis mairii), which lays eggs in soil cracks of varying depths. Some 253 eggs from 19 clutches were incubated under two thermal regimes with identical mean temperatures (25.6 degreesC), but temperatures in the 'variable' treatment fluctuated more (21.8-29.6 degreesC) than those in the 'constant' temperature treatment (25.2-26.5 degreesC). These thermal regimes were similar to those of shallow (20 cm deep) and deep (40 cm deep) soil cracks, respectively, and represent thermal conditions inside natural nests and potential nest sites. 3. Incubation temperatures affected body size, shape and antipredator behaviour of hatchling snakes. Snakes from constant temperature incubation were longer and thinner than snakes from high variance incubation. Clutch effects influenced all offspring traits, with significant interactions between clutch of origin and incubation treatment for body size, but not swimming speed or behaviour. 4. There was a significant interaction between incubation treatment and offspring sex on neonate swimming speed. Incubation under cycling thermal regimes significantly increased swimming speeds of females, but had little effect on males. Such sex differences in phenotypic responses of hatchling snakes support a major assumption of the Charnov-Bull hypothesis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.

VL  - 78

SP  - 1712-1722
AB  - We investigated the possible role of environmental variables in determining body size within a complex of salamander species (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). We analyzed data generated from life-history studies on populations from throughout the range of this species complex. We incorporated an alternative-hypothesis framework (sensu Platt) to determine the better predictor of adult body size, age at maturity, or size at metamorphosis. We found that almost 90% of the variation in adult body size was explained by size at metamorphosis, which was determined by a combination of rate of larval growth and length of the larval period. Environmental temperature and moisture level were positively correlated with larval growth rate and length of the larval period, respectively. We propose a simple model of body-size evolution that incorporates both adaptive and plastic components. We suggest that the length of the larval period may adaptively respond to moisture-level predictability. In addition, we suggest that the response of the larval growth rate to temperature may be plastic. Because the selection pressure due to drying-induced mortality is pervasive among species of amphibians, it may have played a role in shaping body-size radiation in desmognathines as well as the ecological structure of Appalachian streamside communities.

AB  - One of the key factors that determine an animal's distribution and abundance is environmental temperature. This factor affects all the components of an organism's energy budget and fitness. In this study, we tested the effect of water temperature and starvation on patterns of space use in the intertidal fish Girella laevifrons. We postulated that starved animals would select cold temperatures as a mechanism of energy conservation while fed animals would prefer higher temperatures as a mechanism to facilitate digestive processes. In a thermal gradient tank, fishes, irrespective of treatment (fed and starved), actively selected temperatures between 15 and 18 degrees C. Starvation did not affect temperature selection, although it did alter the time and number of visits to thermal gradient extremes. Starved fishes stayed longer in, and visited the warmer temperatures of the gradient more frequently. In contrast, fed fishes stayed longer in, and visited cold temperatures more frequently. We discuss the ecological consequences of temperature selection and the possible relationship between water temperature, food selection and digestive processes.

VL  - 140
IS  - 2
SP  - 171-177
AB  - Along an elevational gradient on SW Utah, sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) exhibit an unexpected pattern of growth. Lizards from a high elevation population grow faster than lizards from two populations at lower elevations despite shorter daily and seasonal activity. Results from a common environment study of growth suggest that the differences in growth are not due to adaptation to local environmental conditions. In this study, I test the hypothesis that higher growth rates in lizards from high elevation may be attributable to reduced resting metabolic expenditure compared to that of lizards from populations at two lower elevations. Resting metabolic rates were measured for individuals from each of the study populations across different times of day and over a broad range of temperatures. Under the same laboratory conditions, field-caught lizards from the high elevation population exhibited lower metabolic rates when compared to lizards from lower elevations. Daily resting metabolic expenditures were calculated using the observed metabolic rates coupled with estimates of daily activity. Daily resting metabolic expenditure was 50% greater for individuals from the two lower elevation populations, which could result in 12.5% more energy that could be potentially allocated to growth for lizards from high elevation. Such energetic savings may be able to explain differences in the patterns of growth observed in nature. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

SP  - 348-359
AB  - Lactococcus lactis, the most extensively characterized lactic acid bacterium, is a mesophilic- and microaerophilic-fermenting microorganism widely used for the production of fermented food products. During industrial processes, L. lactis is often exposed to multiple environmental stresses (low and high temperature, low pH, high osmotic pressure, nutrient starvation and oxidation) that can cause loss or reduction of bacterial viability, reproducibility, as well as organoleptic and/or fermentative qualities. Among these stress factors, oxidation can be considered one of the most deleterious to the cell, causing cellular damage at both molecular and metabolic levels. During the last two decades, considerable efforts have been made to improve our knowledge of oxidative stress in L. lactis. Many genes involved with both oxidative stress resistance and control mechanisms have been identified; functionally they seem to overlap. The finding of new genes, and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stress resistance in L. lactis and other lactic acid baterium, will lead to the construction and isolation of stress-resistant strains. Such strains could be exploited for both traditional and probiotic uses.

AB  - Detailed studies of the seasonal phenology and developmental biology of two eucalypt-feeding coreid species, Amorbus obscuricornis and Gelonus tasmanicus, were undertaken over three years in Tasmania. Both species are univoltine, their active season being from spring to autumn, with the adults being the overwintering stage. Adults of A. obscuricornis and G. tasmanicus emerge during spring to feed, mate and oviposit. Periods of peak copulatory activity and gravidity of females in both species correspond to times when the proportion of males to females is slightly male biased. Eggs of A. obscuricornis did not hatch at temperatures below 15 degrees C while the number of eggs of G. tasmanicus hatching at 13 degrees C remained high. The minimum developmental threshold temperature and number of degree-days (DD) required for hatching by eggs of A. obscuricornis and G. tasmanicus were estimated to be 11.8 and 10.8 degrees C and 147 and 136 DD, respectively. Embryonic developmental rates are considered to reflect differences in the evolved temperature preferences of each species. During spring and summer the nymphs develop through five instars to eclose in autumn just before overwintering. Second-instar mortality for both species was high, suggesting that the initiation of feeding may be a crucial developmental stage.

AB  - Quality of agricultural soils is largely a function of soil organic matter. Tillage and crop management impact soil organic matter dynamics by modification of the soil environment and quantity and quality of C input. We investigated changes in pools and fluxes of soil organic C (SOC) during the ninth and tenth year of cropping with various intensities under conventional disk-and-bed tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT). Soil organic C to a depth of 0.2 m increased with cropping intensity as a result of greater C input and was 10% to 30% greater under NT than under CT. Sequestration of crop-derived C input into SOC was 22±2% under NT and 9±4% under CT (mean of cropping intensities ± standard deviation of cropping systems). Greater sequestration of SOC under NT was due to a lower rate of in situ soil CO2 evolution than under CT (0.22±0.03 vs. 0.27±0.06 g CO2-C g-1 SOC yr-1). Despite a similar labile pool of SOC under NT than under CT (1.1±0.1 vs. 1.0±0.1 g mineralizable C kg-1 SOC d-1), the ratio of in situ to potential CO2 evolution was less under NT (0.56±0.03) than under CT (0.73±0.08), suggesting strong environmental controls on SOC turnover, such as temperature, moisture, and residue placement. Both increased C sequestration and a greater labile SOC pool were achieved in this low-SOC soil using NT and high-intensity cropping.

AB  - Tradeoffs have played a prominent role in the development of theories describing the evolution of reaction norms. Different classes of tradeoffs are known to constrain the evolution of phenotypes, but current theories incorporate only a subset of these tradeoffs. Consequently, these theories cannot account for some of the variation in reaction norms that has been observed within and among species. Empirical studies of thermal reaction norms for physiological and life historical traits have shown that different proximate mechanisms can produce similar reaction norms. As a consequence, certain tradeoffs can be circumvented when the fitness costs imposed by these tradeoffs are severe. We argue that a unified theory that includes all classes of tradeoffs would provide a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive the evolution of reaction norms.

TI  - Thyroid rhythm phenotypes and hominid evolution: A new paradigm implicates pulsatile hormone secretion in speciation and adaptation changes
VL  - 135
IS  - 1
SP  - 105-129
AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs, T3/T4) are essential central regulators that link many biological tasks, including embryonic and post-natal growth, reproductive function, and the behavioral and physiological responses to stress. Recently I proposed a novel theory to explain the role of THs in vertebrate evolution. Here I review the concept and discuss its ability to explain changes over time in hominid morphology, behavior and life history. THs are produced in a distinctly pulsatile manner and appear to generate species-specific TH rhythms with distinct ontogenic shifts. Individual variations in genetically controlled TH rhythms (TR phenotypes) must generate coordinated individual variation in morphology, reproduction and behavior within populations. Selection for any manifestation of a particular TR phenotype in an ancestral population selects all traits under thyroid control, resulting in rapid and well-coordinated changes in descendants. The concept provides the first really plausible explanation for a number of phenomena, including the convergent evolution of bipedalism in early hominids, species-specific sexual dimorphism, coordinated changes in morphology, brain function and gut length over time in hominids, cold adaptation in Homo neanderthalensis, the possible independent evolution of H. sapiens in Asia, and regional adaptation of hominid populations. This new paradigm provides a unique theoretical framework for explaining human origins that has important implications for human health. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 32

SP  - 395-415
AB  - The small, typically estuarine fish Atherina boyeri Risso forms local populations which can differ greatly in their population biology and morphology; this species is viewed as being on the brink of speciation. This analysis of the reproductive strategy shows that A. boyeri can rapidly adapt its life history and morphology to environments ranging from freshwater to polyhaline coastal lagoons and oceanic waters. The optimum strategy is shown to be tied to temperate seasonality: the cold winters act to lengthen the life cycle, and result in cyclic switching of energy between reproduction, somatic growth and fat storage. The adaptability of the fish to a range of environmental characters is viewed as being due to natural selection acting to produce a genotype capable of a flexible phenotypic response. This flexibility is essential for survival in the highly variable inshore/brackish habitat. It is argued that such preadaptive plasticity, coupled with the potential for populations to become isolated, produces ideal conditions for speciation. The importance of the coastal, estuarine and lagoonal environment as a springboard for teleost evolution is discussed. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Many intertidal teleosts exhibit amphibious behavior and facultatively breathe air. We examined the intertidal teleost Fundulus heteroclitus, the mummichog for the ability to take up O-2 and release CO2 aerially over a range of temperatures. Additionally, we measured aquatic oxygen consumption before and after aerial emergence. Fundulus heteroclitus exchanged O-2 and CO2 effectively during an emergence of 1.5 h. Respiratory exchange ratios (RER, CO2 release:O-2 uptake) were between 0.74 and 1.0, sufficient to keep pace with metabolic CO2 production. Oxygen consumption was significantly lower in air than in water. Upon return to water after an hour of aerial emergence, aquatic O-2 consumption was no higher than prior to emergence, an indication that anaerobic metabolism is not used during air emergence. We conclude that F. heteroclitus can withstand air emergence in the salt marsh by breathing air. Emergence and aerial respiration might appear to be a specific adaptations to survival in intertidal habitats in F. heteroclitus, but phylogenetic evidence suggests that these traits may also be ancestral characters. Additional physicological testing in closely related species will aid in elucidating the evolution and adaptive characteristics of aerial respiration in this clade.

AB  - From the crystal field analysis of optical absorption spectra on monoclinic S.G. P2(1)/c MgNd(BO2)(5), where Nd3+ occupies a single crystallographic position with no symmetry elements, energy level schemes and an expression of the associated wavefunctions for the 4f(3) configuration of Nd3+ have been derived, considering approximate C-2v and C-s (C-2) symmetries. Despite of the low symmetry of Nd3+, resulting rms deviations between calculated and experimental levels are very satisfactory. The composition of the crystal field wavefunctions from both sets of phenomenological free-ion and crystal field parameters has been checked through a calculation of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic susceptibility chi, according to the Van Vleck formula. The same simulation was performed with crystal field parameters (CFPs) resulting from the ab initio simple overlap model (SOM), considering the Nd3+ real point symmetry, C-1. Over the whole measured range, 1.7-375 K, and especially at low temperatures, a very good reproduction of the experimental chi vs. T is yielded by each of the experimental and SOM calculated collections of CFPs. The oversimplified SOM model seems thus to be useful providing reasonable estimations of crystal field strength parameters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We performed truncation selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under conditions of chronic stress from the combined effects of low nutrients and high temperature, representative of extremes likely to be encountered in nature by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. We performed selection on geographical parental populations and their hybrids to determine whether hybridization would facilitate or constrain adaptation under our selection protocol. The stressful environment decreased fitness (r(c)) by 54% averaged across all populations relative to near-optimal conditions. After approximate to 10 generations of selection under chronically stressful conditions, exactly one-half of the parental and one-half of the hybrid populations had gone extinct. Thus hybridization had no effect on the likelihood of population persistence. Fitness (r(c)) of the surviving populations did not show any response to selection. Despite initial hybrid vigour under stressful conditions, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving hybrid populations was either equal to, or worse than, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving parental populations after approximate to 10 generations of selection. These results suggest that outcrossing populations to augment genetic variation and facilitate adaptation to a rapidly changing environment may not be useful over longer time scales, even in cases where hybridization does initially increase fitness. Although we detected no direct response to selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under lifetime chronic stress, selected populations showed a strong correlated response for survivorship through transient, acute heat and desiccation shock. In evaluating how organisms might respond to future climate change, biologists must maintain a clear distinction between lifelong performance in chronically stressful environments and short-term survivorship through transient, acute stress.

SP  - 172-179
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of stocking density (125 or 200 fish m-3) on the growth performance of three strains of the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus: the non-improved strain (NS), the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) and the Freshwater Aquaculture Center selected tilapia known as the FaST selected line (SL). Each strain and density combination was triplicated in 0.42 m3 fibreglass tanks within a re-circulating water system. Water temperature was maintained at 29.0±1.0°C. Large Nile tilapia having a mean body weight of 100-110 g were stocked in each tank and hand-fed four times daily with commercial tilapia pellets (35% protein) for 104 days. Results showed that at the two stocking densities, the GIFT and SL strains showed a significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) mean weight (MWT), daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and gross yield (GY) than the NS. In all three strains, growth performance was negatively affected by stocking density. The lower density (125 fish m-3) treatments had significantly higher MWT, DGR and SGR than the higher density one (200 fish m-3). However, higher FCR and GY were observed at the higher density. Survival rates were high in all treatments and were not affected by strain or density. In general, the SL strain had better growth parameters than the GIFT strain. The findings of this study demonstrated the superior growth performance of the improved strains at both densities compared with the NS. The higher density (200 fish m-3) could be more profitable for the tilapia farms in Kuwait than the lower density of (125 fish m-3) in terms of reduced land cost and facilities, demand on the limited low-salinity underground water and manpower. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Reaction norms for age and size at maturity in response to temperature: A test of the compound interest hypothesis
VL  - 16
IS  - 4
SP  - 333-349
AB  - In ectotherms, temperature induces similar developmental and evolutionary responses in body size, with larger individuals occurring or evolving in low temperature environments. Based on the occasional occurrence of opposite size clines, showing a decline in body size with increasing latitude, an interaction between generation time and growing season length was suggested to account for the patterns found. Accordingly, multivoltine species with short generation times should gain high compound interest benefits from reproducing early at high temperatures, indicating potential for extra generations, even at the expense of being smaller. This should not apply for obligatorily monovoltine populations. We explicitly test the prediction that monovoltine populations (no compound interest) should be selected for large body size to maximise adult fitness, and therefore size at maturity should respond only weakly to temperature. In two monovoltine populations (an Alpine and a Western German one) of the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe, increasing temperatures had no significant effect on pupal weight and caused a slight decrease in adult weight only. In contrast, two closely related, yet potentially multivoltine Lycaena populations showed a greater weight loss at increasing temperature (in protandrous males, but not in females) and smaller adult sizes throughout. Thus, the results do support our predictions indicating that the compound interest hypothesis may yield causal explanations for the relationship between temperature and insect size at maturity. At all temperatures, the alpine population had higher growth rates and concomitantly shorter development times (not accompanied by a reduction in size) than the other, presumably indicating local adaptations to different climates.

AB  - Soil bacteria that also form mutualistic symbioses in plants encounter two major levels of selection. One occurs during adaptation to and survival in soil, and the other occurs in concert with host plant speciation and adaptation. Actinobacteria from the genus Frankia are facultative symbionts that form N 2-fixing root nodules on diverse and globally distributed angiosperms in the "actinorhizal" symbioses. Three closely related clades of Frankia sp. strains are recognized; members of each clade infect a subset of plants from among eight angiosperm families. We sequenced the genomes from three strains; their sizes varied from 5.43 Mbp for a narrow host range strain (Frankia sp. strain HFPCcI3) to 7.50 Mbp for a medium host range strain (Frankia alni strain ACN14a) to 9.04 Mbp for a broad host range strain (Frankia sp. strain EAN1pec.) This size divergence is the largest yet reported for such closely related soil bacteria (97.8%-98.9% identity of 16S rRNA genes). The extent of gene deletion, duplication, and acquisition is in concert with the biogeographic history of the symbioses and host plant speciation. Host plant isolation favored genome contraction, whereas host plant diversification favored genome expansion. The results support the idea that major genome expansions as well as reductions can occur in facultative symbiotic soil bacteria as they respond to new environments in the context of their symbioses. ©2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

VL  - 17

AB  - Aim: To measure latitude-related body size variation in field-collected Paropsis atomaria Olivier (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) individuals and to conduct common-garden experiments to determine whether such variation is due to phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation. Location: Four collection sites from the east coast of Australia were selected for our present field collections: Canberra (latitude 35°19′ S), Bangalow (latitude 28°43′ S), Beerburrum (latitude 26°58′.S) and Lowmead (latitude 24°29′ S). Museum specimens collected over the past 100 years and covering the same geographical area as the present field collections came from one state, one national and one private collection. Methods: Body size (pronotum width) was measured for 118 field-collected beetles and 302 specimens from collections. We then reared larvae from the latitudinal extremes (Canberra and Lowmead) to determine whether the size cline was the result of phenotypic plasticity or evolved differences (=local adaptation) between sites. Results: Beetles decreased in size with increasing latitude, representing a converse Bergmann cline. A decrease in developmental temperature produced larger adults for both Lowmead (low latitude) and Canberra (high latitude) individuals, and those from Lowmead were larger than those from Canberra when reared under identical conditions. Main conclusions: The converse Bergmann cline in P. atomaria is likely to be the result of local adaptation to season length. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster larvae are used to examine habitat choice behavior and its effect on a component of preadult fitness (pupal survivorship). We established strains of flies by collecting pupae from two microhabitats from an orchard. Strain differences in pupation site choice (on versus off fruit) persisted in a field‐like laboratory assay without artificial selection. To produce heterogeneous environments, air temperature and soil water content were varied in these assays. A habitat suitability difference measure was used to determine for each environment, which microhabitat (on or off fruit) resulted in greater pupal survivorship. We found 1) that habitat choice behavior had both plastic and heritable components, 2) that strain‐by‐environment interactions influenced habitat choice behavior and pupal survivorship and, 3) a significant positive correlation between habitat suitability and larval habitat choice behavior.

AB  - Given the evolutionary importance of gene duplication to the emergence of species-specific traits, we have extended the application of cDNA array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to survey gene duplications and losses genome-wide across 10 primate species, including human. Using human cDNA arrays that contained 41,126 cDNAs, corresponding to 24,473 unique human genes, we identified 4159 genes that likely represent most of the major lineage-specific gene copy number gains and losses that have occurred in these species over the past 60 million years. We analyzed 1,233,780 gene-to-gene data points and found that gene gains typically outnumbered losses (ratio of gains/losses = 2.34) and these frequently cluster in complex and dynamic genomic regions that are likely to serve as gene nurseries. Almost one-third of all human genes (6696) exhibit an aCGH- predicted change in copy number in one or more of these species, and within-species gene amplification is also evident. Many of the genes identified here are likely to be important to lineage-specific traits including, for example, human-specific duplications of the AQP7 gene, which represent intriguing candidates to underlie the key physiological adaptations in thermoregulation and energy utilization that permitted human endurance running. ©2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - Desiccation stress at sub-zero temperatures in polar terrestrial arthropods
VL  - 49
IS  - 3
SP  - 193-203
AB  - Cold tolerant polar terrestrial arthropods have evolved a range of survival strategies which enable them to survive the most extreme environmental conditions (cold and drought) they are likely to encounter. Some species are classified as being freeze tolerant but the majority of those found in the Antarctic survive sub-zero temperatures by avoiding freezing by supercooling. For many arthropods, not just polar species, survival of desiccating conditions is equally important to survival of low temperatures. At sub-zero temperatures freeze avoiding arthropods are susceptible to desiccation and may lose water due to a vapour diffusion gradient between their supercooled body fluids and ice in their surroundings. This process ceases once the body fluids are frozen and so is not a problem for freeze tolerant species. This paper compares five polar arthropods, which have evolved different low temperature survival strategies, and the effects of exposure to sub-zero temperatures on their supercooling points (SCP) and water contents. The Antarctic oribatid mite (Alaskozetes antarcticus) reduced its supercooling point temperature from -6 to -30 degreesC, when exposed to decreasing sub-zero temperatures (cooled from 5 to -10 degreesC over 42 days) with little loss of body water during that period. However, Cryptopygus antarcticus, a springtail which occupies similar habitats in the Antarctic, showed a decrease in both water content and supercooling ability when exposed to the same experimental protocol. Both these Antarctic arthropods have evolved a freeze avoiding survival strategy. The Arctic springtail (Onychiurus arcticus), which is also freeze avoiding, dehydrated (from 2.4 to 0.7 g water g(-1) dry weight) at sub-zero temperatures and its SCP was lowered from c. -3 to below - 15 degreesC in direct response to temperature (5 to -5.5 degreesC). In contrast, the freeze tolerant larvae of an Arctic fly (Heleomyza borealis) froze at c. -7 degreesC with little change in water content or SCP during further cold exposure and survived frozen to -60 degreesC. The partially freeze tolerant sub-Antarctic beetle Hydromedion sparsutum froze at c. -2 degreesC and is known to survive frozen to -8 degreesC. During the subzero temperature treatment, its water content reduced until it froze and then remained constant. The survival strategies of such freeze tolerant and freeze avoiding arthropods are discussed in relation to desiccation at sub-zero temperatures and the evolution of strategies of cold tolerance.

AB  - Annealing of flat cold rolled steel sheets is one of the critical operations, which significantly influences the final product quality and overall productivity of cold rolling mills. An integrated process model, with the capability of predicting spatial and temporal evolution of temperature, microstructure and mechanical properties in cold rolled coils during batch annealing, has been developed. The model is based on fundamental principles of heat transfer, microstructural evolution kinetics and microstructure-property correlation. The parameters for heat transfer are based on in plant experimentation, whereas the coefficients for microstructural kinetics and structure-property correlation were obtained from laboratory studies. The prediction capability of the model has been extensively validated through data collected from industrial operations. Details of the model formulation, its validation with the plant data and possible uses of such an integrated model are presented.

In this article, the salient features as well as the potential applications of this integrated Batch Annealing Furnace simulator have been presented. Furthermore, the utility of this simulator in designing the thermal cycle and optimizing the coil dimensions for improving furnace productivity has been demonstrated.

TI  - The significance of predation in nest site selection of turtles: An experimental consideration of macro- and microhabitat preferences
VL  - 102
IS  - 3
SP  - 592-600
AB  - Nest selection has important consequences for fitness in freshwater turtles, as nest predation is extremely high in most populations. However, nest predation has rarely been considered a major factor affecting nest site selection. Thermal qualities of a nest are often suggested as a factor influencing maternal choice of nest site because incubation temperature affects offspring performance and growth, as well as the sex ratio of the clutch in species with temperature dependent sex determination (TSD). Yet experimental manipulations of the nesting environment (habitat and threat) to test factors influencing maternal nest site selection in turtles are uncommon. In this paper, we show that nest site selection in an Australian turtle (Emydura macquarii) with genetically determined sex determination (GSD) exists at two spatial scales, with predation as the major factor affecting the location of a nest. Females prefer to nest in areas where nest predation is minimal but when the risk of direct predation is increased, they trade-off minimising nest predation with survival by locating their nests closer to shore. However, experimentally reducing cover demonstrated that females prefer to nest in open areas, which are more common closer to shore. Hence females are forgoing preferred microhabitat to locate their nests away from shore to minimise nest predation. Despite a preference for open nesting areas, females exhibit similar repeatability of microenvironment selection to a North American species with TSD. Repeatability of nesting overstory vegetation in the North American turtle, Chrysemys picta, suggests that females may exert some control over the thermal qualities of the nests; a key assumption in theoretical models of the microevolution and adaptive significance of TSD in reptiles. Incubation temperature is one factor that may affect microhabitat preferences in both turtles but other factors (e.g. predation and soil moisture) affected by microhabitat may be critical in the evolution of repeatability of overstory cover.

(2)|The population response to thermal selection significantly changes due to heat acclimation. The survival of individuals during heating increases. This process is accompanied by (a) the levelling of genetic differences in the resistance of individuals (phenotypical masking of genetic differences) and (b) changes in the order of elimination of individuals during thermal selection. 3. (3)|A coordinated reaction of individuals of the same population to changes in the environmental temperature was accomplished without any interaction of individuals. It is considered to be the result of a specific genetic structure of the population which accounts for functional polymorphism. 4.

AB  - In snakes, body size and reproductive output vary greatly among disjunct populations. Clutch size is notably influenced by food availability, thermal conditions and maternal body size. A comparison between three large-scale areas - north continental, south continental and island populations of European whip snakes - revealed significant variation in body size and reproductive output. More importantly, there was a geographical difference in the covariation between clutch size and maternal body size, two traits mechanistically linked as body size constrains clutch size. This suggests that clutch size can vary independently of maternal body size, a situation that provides opportunities to tease apart the contribution of phenotypic plasticity from local genetic adaptations in these two life-history traits.

AB  - Perciform fishes of the suborder Notothenioidei are the dominant fishes in the Ross Sea and in the Southern Ocean in general. They have evolved physiological adaptations which ensure their survival in ice-laden seawater at a temperature of -1.9°C and extended their habitat range. Among these adaptations are relatively high metabolic rates made possible by enzymes efficient in catalyzing energyproducing reactions at subzero temperatures; a restricted range of temperature tolerance; slow growth rates in spite of relatively high metabolic rates; antifreeze glycoproteins which reduce the freezing point of body fluids below that of seawater and prevent ice crystal growth; aglomerular nephrons which preclude the loss of small molecular weight antifreeze molecules in the urine and mechanisms (especially skeletal reduction and lipid deposition) promoting neutral buoyancy in some species even though swim bladders are absent. Species with different buoyancies are associated with the pelagic, cryopelagic, benthopelagic and benthic habitats in the Ross Sea. Physiological specializations, including buoyancy adaptations in many body systems, and the absence of competition from other fishes allowed this presumably monophyletic group to radiate into several habitats in the Southern Ocean. © Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

VL  - 103
IS  - 5
SP  - 364-367
AB  - The Palaearctic species Drosophila subobscura recently invaded the west coast of Chile and North America. This invasion helped to corroborate the adaptive value of the rich chromosomal polymorphism of the species, as the same clinal patterns than those observed in the original Palaearctic area were reproduced in the colonized areas in a relatively short period of time. The rapid response of this polymorphism to environmental conditions makes it a good candidate to measure the effect of the global rising of temperatures on the genetic composition of populations. Indeed, the long-term variation of this polymorphism shows a general increase in the frequency of those inversions typical of low latitudes, with a corresponding decrease of those typical of populations closer to the poles. Although the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood, the system remains a valid tool to monitor the genetic impact of global warming on natural populations. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Adaptation to cold environments of ectotherm populations is expected to result in increased standard metabolic rates if resources are not limiting. However, it is still unclear how the maintenance of high standard metabolic rates would affect locomotor performance and its impact at the population level. 2. We compared standard metabolic rate and swimming performance of Brown Trout populations inhabiting rivers with contrasting thermal conditions. To avoid environmental confounding effects, we tested offspring raised in controlled conditions. There were significant differences among populations and families for both traits, suggesting that the observed differentiation pattern has a genetic basis. 3. We found a significant negative relationship between standard metabolic rate and swimming performance at the population level. On the other hand, standard metabolic rates tended to be negatively related to the temperature in the rivers of origin, whereas swimming performance was positively related to river temperature, but these trends were not significant. 4. These results suggest that selection for traits positively linked with standard metabolic rates may result in lower relative prolonged swimming performance. The potential evolutionary consequences of the observed negative relationship are discussed. © 2006 British Ecological Society.

AB  - Sandstorms are an important climatic phenomenon of many deserts, causing major ecological problems for plant life. A number of features observed in desert plants allow survival under certain ecological constraints caused by wind-blown sand and related phenomena. In this context, a peculiar adaptation to desert condition, the 'psammophorous' plants, are of special interest. Hitherto under-rated, many plant species possess specialized structures, enabling them to fix a protective layer of sand grains on parts of their surface. An analysis of the distribution, ecology, and structural peculiarities of psammophorous plants in the Namib and Karoo is presented. It is proposed that strongly developed psammophory primarily has evolved as an adaptation to habitats which experience a high impact from wind blown sand, while the phenomenon in less well developed cases might be of relevance for the plant water budget, thermal energy balance, serve as protection against herbivores or have a mimetic function.

AB  - Intraventricular administration of the opioid peptide, β-endorphin to goldfish altered their body temperatures and activity levels. Low doses (0.5-5.0 pg g-1 body weight) of β-endorphin significantly increased behaviorally selected body temperatures while higher doses (15 pg g-1) decreased the preferred temperatures selected in horizontal thermal gradients. There was a significant day-night rhythm in the extent of these effects. These thermoregulatory effects could be blocked and reversed by systemic administration of the opiate antagonist, naloxone, supporting mediation of the thermoregulatory effects at opioid receptors. In addition, administration of naloxone by itself significantly decreased preferred temperature. Removal of the pineal gland significantly increased the preferred temperatures selected by goldfish and eliminated the thermoregulatory effects of β-endorphin administration in both the day and the night. The behavioral activity effects of β-endorphin were dependent on the thermal conditions. In fish held at a constant temperature (20°C) β-endorphin caused a dose-dependent increase in activity, while in individuals held in thermal gradients administration of β-endorphin had no effects on activity. In both situations naloxone caused a decrease in activity levels. Pinealectomy also eliminated the behavioral activating effects of β-endorphin, though it had no apparent effects on the actions of naloxone. These results indicate that the pineal gland is involved in the mediation of the thermoregulatory and behavioral activating effects of β-endorphin. Speculations are made as to the possible mechanisms of action of the pineal gland in mediating the effects of opioid neuropeptides. © 1982.

AB  - Gaseous respiration by central mudminnows (Umbra limi), particularly their use of bubbles composed of gas mixtures other than air, may have evolved as an adaptation to the oxygen-depleted, carbon dioxide-rich water of winterkill lakes. Under simulated winterkill conditions, mudminnows frequently engulfed gaseous bubbles. Use of bubbles was not related to varying methane or nitrogen content (0 to 80 percent) when all bubbles contained 20 percent oxygen. When the oxygen content of bubbles varied (0 to 20 percent), fish visited bubbles randomly but remained longer and took fewer "breaths" at bubbles with high oxygen content. High temperature (16° to 34°C) and low pH (6.8 to 4.5) did not stimulate increased air-breathing when dissolved oxygen was sufficient.

SP  - 381-386
AB  - The effect of temperature and salinity on resting egg size of two Brachionus plicatilis (Rotifers) clones was investigated. Clones were selected according to their different behaviour in laying resting eggs: one clone ejects them, whereas they remain inside the females body in the other clone. The difference in resting eggs size between the two clones is noticeable, although the difference is not as great as that between female body size. An important temperature-salinity interaction on resting egg size has been observed. The general inverse relationship between size and temperature is only true at lower temperatures. At high temperatures size varies around the mean although could be greater than at intermediate temperatures. This is more evident at the intermediate salinity tested which is considered to be the closest to the optimum in our experiments. This pattern of variation suggests that mean size is bigger than expected, in relation to temperature and salinity, when these factors have values close to the extremes of their range, normally found in nature, and to which adaptative mechanisms can evolve. Size is bigger at the salinity - temperature low - low and high - high combinations which are the most commonly found in the temperate environments. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

VL  - 15

SP  - 1023-1033
AB  - The distinct lifestyle of obligately intracellular bacteria can alter fundamental forces that drive and constrain genome change. In this study, sequencing the 792-kb genome of Blochmannia pennsylvanicus, an obligate endosymbiont of Camponotus pennsylvanicus, enabled us to trace evolutionary changes that occurred in the context of a bacterial-ant association. Comparison to the genome of Blochmannia floridanus reveals differential loss of genes involved in cofactor biosynthesis, the composition and structure of the cell wall and membrane, gene regulation, and DNA replication. However, the two Blochmannia species show complete conservation in the order and strand orientation of shared genes. This finding of extreme stasis in genome architecture, also reported previously for the aphid endosymbiont Buchnera, suggests that genome stability characterizes long-term bacterial mutualists of insects and constrains their evolutionary potential. Genome-wide analyses of protein divergences reveal 10- to 50-fold faster amino acid substitution rates in Blochmannia compared to related bacteria. Despite these varying features of genome evolution, a striking correlation in the relative divergences of proteins indicates parallel functional constraints on gene functions across ecologically distinct bacterial groups. Furthermore, the increased rates of amino acid substitution and gene loss in Blochmannia have occurred in a lineage-specific fashion, which may reflect life history differences of their ant hosts. ©2005 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

VL  - 21
IS  - 2
SP  - 150-159
AB  - Introduction Stress proteins are ubiquitous and inducible by a vast number of stressors. Their relevance for ecological and microevolutionary adaptations has been investigated since the early 1990s. Stress proteins: function and induction Stress proteins are categorized in different families of which most data have been recorded for Hsp70, Hsp60, and Hsp90. These cytoplasmatic proteins play a central role in protein folding, the trans-membrane passage of proteins, and the stabilization of signal transduction pathways. Hsp70 is induced by elevated concentrations of unfolded or malfolded intracellular proteins and hence indicates proteotoxicity. Modulation of the stress protein level by internal factors During certain developmental stages, stress protein levels are modified by internal factors. This has been particularly shown for the early ontogeny, for the formation of quiescent stages, and for the reproductive phase. Adaptation to external stressors in the laboratory Laboratory studies on the effects of ecophysiologically relevant stressors have revealed short-term physiological adaptation to heat or environmental chemicals to involve an elevation of stress protein levels. Extreme stressor impact disrupts this responsive mechanism. Adaptation to field situations Also in the field, physiological responses to temperature fluctuations or contamination usually involve the induction of stress proteins which can be used as a biomarker of proteotoxic effect. Implications for evolutionary biology In long-term contaminated sites, however, phenotypes displaying low stress protein levels appear to be evolutionarily favored. Whether different stress response strategies may entail different degrees of phenotypic variation even under natural conditions - via Hsp action on developmental canalization - is a matter of hot debate. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - Most social insect species are able to regulate the temperature within their nests. In this review, we examine the variety of mechanisms that social insect species have evolved to regulate temperature. We divide these mechanisms into two broad categories: active and passive. 'Passive' temperature regulation includes such mechanisms as nest site selection to optimize internal nest temperature, nest structures that permit passive heating or cooling, or simple behaviour such as brood translocation to regions within a nest where temperatures are most favourable. 'Active' temperature regulation refers to behaviour where individuals modify nest temperature by physical activity like wing fanning or evaporative cooling. Although there is enormous variation in the thermoregulatory mechanisms, there are also many similarities. All thermoregulatory mechanisms are self-organized and arise from simple rules followed by each individual worker. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 34

SP  - 325-332
AB  - A few days of thermal acclimation (to 5 °C versus 15 °C) may strongly affect tolerance to drought stress in Collembola. To better understand this phenomenon, the effect of acclimation on water loss rate and its consequence for survival in the species Pogonognathellus flavescens Tullberg (Tomoceridae) is investigated. Acclimation does not affect the water content of hydrated animals but animals exposed to 15 °C and 76% relative humidity lose water much faster after having been acclimated to 5 °C rather than 15 °C. Tolerance to water loss is not affected; in both treatment groups, animals survive up to 40% loss of the water content recorded when fully hydrated. The percentage water content of hydrated animals decreases with size, which may explain why the proportion of initial water lost appears to be a better predictor for survival than the amount of remaining water. The proportion of initial water lost per unit time is little influenced by size in animals acclimated to 15 °C but increases with decreasing size in the group at 5 °C, indicating that acclimation affects a physiological protection against water loss. © 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Immune function is likely to be a critical determinant of an organism's fitness, yet most natural animal and plant populations exhibit tremendous genetic variation for immune traits. Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental heterogeneity may retard the long-term efficiency of natural selection and even maintain polymorphism, provided alternative host genotypes are favoured under different environmental conditions. 'Environment' in this context refers to abiotic factors such as ambient temperature or availability of nutrient resources, genetic diversity of pathogens or competing physiological demands on the host. These factors are generally controlled in laboratory experiments measuring immune performance, but variation in them is likely to be very important in the evolution of resistance to infection. Here, we review some of the literature emphasizing the complexity of natural selection on immunity. Our aim is to describe how environmental and genetic heterogeneities, often excluded from experimentation as 'noise', may determine the evolutionary potential of populations or the potential for interacting species to coevolve. © 2008 The Royal Society.

VL  - 34

SP  - 267-276
AB  - Diapause and non-diapause larvae of Plodia interpunctella from two selected lines, fast development (FDL) and slow development (SDL), reared at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C were tested for low temperature tolerance, supercooling ability and accumulation of cryoprotective compounds. Exposure to -20 degrees C was fatal for both diapause and non-diapause larvae. Diapause larvae, particularly those reared at 20 degrees C, were more tolerant to - 10 degrees C than non-diapause larvae. Their higher survival under increased exposure periods indicates that the chilling tolerance in P. interpunctella is associated with diapause. Rearing temperatures did not affect the supercooling capacity of the larvae, since the supercooling points (SCPs) of the diapause and non-diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C did not differ; mean SCPs ranged from - 12 degrees C to -15 degrees C. Trehalose was the major cryoprotective compound synthesized by the larvae. Photoperiod and temperature affected the accumulation of trehalose as diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C (LD 12 : 12) had significantly higher concentrations of trehalose than non-diapause larvae at 20 degrees C and diapause and non-diapause larvae at 25 degrees C. Low temperature (5 degrees C) exposure for 30 days enhanced the supercooling ability of diapause larvae reared at 20 degrees C by decreasing the SCP to ca. -22 degrees C. The results suggest that diapause larvae can overwinter successfully in a supercooled state. Acclimation did not increase trehalose concentration. This leads to the conclusion that the regulation of supercooling in P. interpunctella is independent of trehalose concentration. Diapause and non-diapause larvae from the two selection lines did not differ in SCP, concentration of cryoprotectants, or rate of survival at low temperature.

TI  - Factors affecting retreat-site selection by coppertail skinks (Ctenotus taeniolatus) from sandstone outcrops in eastern Australia
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 326-336
AB  - Coppertail skinks (Ctenotus taeniolatus) are medium-sized diurnal lizards that are widespread in eastern Australia. Field surveys on sandstone outcrops in the Sydney region showed that these animals use available rocks non-randomly: coppertails were found under large, sun-exposed rocks on deep soil. Choice trials in the laboratory documented selection of retreat sites that were warm, with substrate preferences shifting in a diel cycle. Lizards selected retreats with rock substrates during the day but with sandy substrates at night. Rocky retreats attain higher temperatures during daylight hours, but burrows in sand beneath rocks may provide greater protection against ingress by nocturnal predators. During fieldwork we rarely found lizards under rocks with either ants or centipedes, suggesting that coppertails may avoid these predatory invertebrates. Tongue-flick trials showed that the lizards could discriminate among common ant species based on chemosensory cues, but apparently could not detect centipede chemical cues. In experimental trials, the lizards did not avoid retreat sites scented by either ants or centipedes. Our data thus suggest that retreat-site selection in coppertails is driven by abiotic cues (rock size, sun exposure and substrate type) that may confer fitness benefits in terms of thermoregulation and predator avoidance, with biotic cues playing a less important role. © 2006 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - Quantitative trait loci for upper thermal tolerance in outbred strains of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
VL  - 86
IS  - 3
SP  - 333-341
AB  - The expression of three putative QTL for upper thermal tolerance (UTT) was examined in two strains of outbred rainbow trout unselected for this trait using simple-sequence repeat (SSR; microsatellite) markers associated with UTT in backcrosses of lines selected on this trait. Two-way diallel lots in the third generation of an outbred pedigree were exposed to an acute thermal challenge. QTL detection was performed separately by each second-generation parent within each diallel lot, incorporating the effects of full sib families and correlated traits. Inheritance of different alleles at the SSR Ssa20.19NUIG from the sire 93-32-1 was strongly associated with the thermal tolerance of his half sib progeny, explaining 7.5% of their phenotypic variance in this trait. A hierarchical linear model incorporating allelic inheritance from all four grandsires of the experimental diallels (in addition to family specific and covariate trait effects) was also used to detect associations between the SSR and thermal tolerance in their third-generation grandprogeny. Ssa20.19NUIG was strongly associated with thermal tolerance in the grandprogeny of the grandsire G(0)SVM2. The generally stronger marker-trait associations found in male parents may be partially due to reduced chromosomal recombination rates in male salmonids compared to females. These results indicate the effects of a QTL on a fitness-related trait in unselected populations of rainbow trout.

VL  - 148

SP  - 719-731
AB  - Most sexually reproducing species have sexual proportions around 1:1. This major biological phenomenon remained unexplained until 1930, when FISHER proposed that it results from a mechanism of natural selection. Here we report the first experimental test of his model that obeys all its assumptions. We used a naturally occurring X-Y meiotic drive system - the sex-ratio trait of Drosophila mediopunctata - to generate female-biased experimental populations. As predicted by FISHER, these populations evolved toward equal sex proportions due to natural selection, by accumulation of autosomal alleles that direct the parental reproductive effort toward the rare sex. Classical Fisherian evolution is a rather slow mechanism: despite a very large amount of genetic variability, the experimental populations evolved from 16% of males to 32% of males in 49 generations and would take 330 generations (29 years) to reach 49%. This slowness has important implications for species potentially endangered by skewed sexual proportions, such as reptiles with temperature sex determination.

VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 231-237
AB  - Most ectotherms show increased body size at maturity when reared under colder temperatures. In principle. temperature could produce this outcome by influencing growth, proliferation and/or death of epidermal cells. Here we investigated the effects of rearing temperature on the cell size and cell number in the wing blade, the basitarsus of the leg and the cornea of the eye of Drosophila melanogaster from two populations at opposite ends of a South American latitudinal cline. We found that, in both strains of D. melanogaster and in both sexes, a decrease in rearing temperature increases the size of the wings, legs and eyes through an effect on epidermal cell size, with no significant change in cell number. Our results indicate that temperature has a consistent effect on cell size in the Drosophila epidermis and this may also apply to other cell types. In contrast, the evolutionary effects of temperature on the different organs are not consistent. We discuss our findings in the context of growth control in Drosophila. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

VL  - 45
IS  - 2
SP  - 127-134
AB  - In this paper, we report the thermal adaptation of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes, characterized as changes in growth parameters. Six clones derived from a single colony of P. pseudoalcaligenes were cultured in two different temperature regimes for 10 months, with three clones forming the control group, cultured at a constant temperature, and another three clones forming the high-temperature (FIT) group, cultured at increasing temperature (from 41 to 47degreesC). Three growth parameters were measured: the lag time (lambda), which is the period between the time of transfer to a new medium and the time when the cell replication starts; the maximum growth rate (mu(m)); and the maximum yield (A). These three parameters are major components of bacterial fitness. The Gompertz and logistic models were used to estimate these three parameters. The two models gave almost identical estimates, but the Gompertz model had R-2 values consistently larger than the logistic model. The HT clones had significantly shorter lambda, but higher mu(m) and A than the control clones when both were grown at the originally stressful temperature of 45degreesC, suggesting significant thermal adaptation. Interestingly, the HT clones grew equally well as the control clones at 35degreesC, i.e. improved performance at 45degreesC was not associated with a reduced performance at 35degreesC.

AB  - Evolutionary ecology aims to understand how phenotypes are designed for reproductive success and survival. Perhaps the most powerful approach towards this goal is to alter a character genetically and observe the resulting change in reproduction, survival, growth, defense or competitive ability. Until recently, this strategy was not practical. Transgenic manipulation now offers a solution - novel genes are introduced into the germ line and are then expressed in the developing organism. This technique is already available in model and agricultural organisms. The challenge for molecular evolutionary ecologists is to find ways to adopt these powerful systems to understand the mechanisms underlying adaptive traits and their evolution.

VL  - 130

SP  - 367-375
AB  - Geographic variation in life history traits and population dynamics of Atlantic croakers Micropogonias undulatus found north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, suggests the possibility of two stocks along the U.S. Atlantic coast. The basis for this variation (i.e., genetic versus ecophenotypic) is unclear. Young-of-the-year Atlantic croakers were collected from three Atlantic coast estuaries (Delaware Bay, Delaware; Cape Fear River, North Carolina; and Indian River Lagoon, Florida) that represent the center and extreme distributional limits of the species' U.S. Atlantic coast range. Intrinsic growth capacity and cold tolerance were measured under common laboratory conditions to test for adaptive genetic variation in these traits. Results were used to evaluate the two stock hypothesis for the Atlantic croaker and to examine the integrity of Cape Hatteras as a possible genetic stock boundary. Growth capacity, feeding rate, growth efficiency, and cold tolerance were similar across geographic locations. Survival curves for Delaware and Florida Atlantic croakers were indistinguishable at each of four low temperatures tested (1, 3, 5, and 7 degreesC), with neither group capable of surviving temperatures of 3 degreesC or less. The suggested lack of adaptive variation we found in these physiological traits supports the hypothesis of a single genetic stock of Atlantic croakers along the Atlantic coast. Although severe winter temperatures may select for fast growth and cold-tolerant genotypes in northern estuaries, gene flow is apparently sufficient to preclude local genetic adaptation.

AB  - Solar radiation, which influences temperature and hydroperiod, should strongly influence colonization, development rate, development strategies and survival in temporary pools. We assessed these hypotheses at two spatial microscales with varying microclimate. One scale, ca. 200 m, was opposing slopes of a canyon on MT Carmel, Israel, referred to as 'Evolution Canyon' (Nevo, 1995). Due primarily to differential solar radiation, the warmer and drier South-facing slope (SFS) supports a savanna-like open park forest while the cooler, moister North-facing slope (NFS) is heavily forested, primarily with live oak. Using artificial pools, we assessed how these close but contrasting environments may influence developmental plasticity in the frog, Hyla savignyi, and colonization of insects. As expected, hydroperiod was considerably longer on the NFS. Hyla tadpole development was significantly faster on the SFS, while size at metamorphosis was greater on the NFS. Insect species richness was higher in NFS pools. The most common species, Culex pipiens, oviposited significantly more in NFS pools than in SFS pools. In the second scale, we placed pools only meters apart, but varying in shade and thus maximum temperature at Haifa University Campus, MT Carmel. Species richness and maximum temperature among pools were not correlated during winter and early spring (cool to mild temperatures), but were strongly and negatively correlated during early summer (hot temperatures). Thermal tolerance in the laboratory of selected species matched their thermal spatial distribution in the field. These results indicate that temperature can play a strong role in affecting developmental strategies, species' distributions and community structure in temporary pools over a very small spatial scale. © 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Adults were relatively insensitive to cold, but hatchlings suffered from adverse weather when the incidence of late cold spells was high. Great tit Parus major, a southern newcomer and partial resident, seemed to be a relatively 'robust' breeder, but it has apparently failed to evolve the necessary adaptations to cope with the arctic winter. Redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus, a northern native and migrant, bred successfully; population fluctuations seemed to be influenced by factors occurring outside the breeding season. Pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca, a southern newcomer and migrant, suffered severe nesting losses, and the harsh northern weather conditions were the most important factors limiting its population. In northern Lapland, annual fluctuations in the numbers of breeding pairs (Ph. phoenicurus and F. hypoleuca), time of egg-laying (F. hypoleuca) and nesting success (F. hypoleuca) were greater than further south. -from Author

AB  - Animals can respond in three main ways to environments that change and deteriorate. They can cope with their inherent physiological flexibility, evolve or adapt to new conditions, or migrate away to areas consistent with survival. The main factors dictating survival are the rates of change and capacities of species to cope. Articulated brachiopods are known as a group that employ low energy solutions and exhibit slow rates in life histories characters, especially in growth and metabolic rates. This way of life carries with it a range of consequences, including poor abilities to raise metabolic rates to perform work. This brings with it poor abilities to cope with elevated temperature. Slow growth, deferred maturity and low feeding rates make them less likely to produce novel adaptations compared with other marine invertebrate taxa. Being largely restricted to hard substrata and low energy supply environments also makes it harder for them to migrate to new sites compared to other groups, because of the large geographic distances between colonisable areas. The only clear area they may have that gives them advantages is in the flexibility of their larval release strategies, where settlement can be from very short, millimetre-scale distances to hundreds of kilometres. © 2008 Royal Society of Edinburgh.

AB  - Non-Mendelian inheritance was revealed for the 'heat-sensitivity' character of the poikilothermic insect Drosophila melanogaster. Genetic analyses were performed on heat-sensitive (S, S1) strains, derived through indirect selection, and on stocks constructed through extensive chromosomal and cytoplasmic substitutions between strains obtained from two replicate cage populations. The populations were kept for about 7 years under different temperatures (14°-25°) and exhibited different survival. We conclude that the character studied is quantitative, responds to selection pressure and is transmitted through the maternal cytoplasm, while nuclear genes modify its expression.

VL  - 8

AB  - Organisms living in shallow-water tropical coral reef environments are exposed to high UVR irradiances due to the low solar zenith angles (the angle of the sun from the vertical), the natural thinness of the ozone layer over tropical latitudes, and the high transparency of the water column. The hypothesis that solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 290-400 nm) is an important factor that affects the biology and ecology of coral reef organisms dates only to about 1980. It has been previously suggested that increased levels of biologically effective ultraviolet B radiation (UVB, 290-320 nm), which is the waveband primarily affected by ozone depletion, would have relatively small effects on corals and coral reefs and that these effects might be observed as changes in the minimum depths of occurrence of important reef taxa such as corals. This conclusion was based on predictions of increases in UVR as well as its attenuation with depth using the available data on UVR irradiances, ozone levels, and optical properties of the water overlying coral reefs. Here, we review the experimental evidence demonstrating the direct and indirect effects of UVR, both UVB and ultraviolet A (UVA, 320-400 nm) on corals and other reef associated biota, with emphasis on those studies conducted since 1996. Additionally, we re-examine the predictions made in 1996 for the increase in UVB on reefs with currently available data, assess whether those predictions were reasonable, and look at what changes might occur on coral reefs in the future as the multiple effects (i.e. increased temperature, hypercapnia, and ocean acidification) of global climate change continue. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.

AB  - In laboratory tests, young Chelydra serpentina and Trachemys scripta altered their distribution in the presence of a temperature gradient, Selection of temperatures in the gradient for hatchlings and yearlings showed that body temperatures (T(b)s) of C. serpentina were lower than T. scripta,but the difference was insignificant. Relatively low TbS could allow greater activity range and reduced metabolic maintenance cost for C. serpentina, which seldom leaves water. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Some thermal constraints on crustal assimilation during fractionation of hydrous, mantle-derived magmas with examples from Central Alpine Batholiths
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 403-422
AB  - We provide a model for the fractional crystallization of hydrous mantle-derived magma to form calc-alkaline plutons, based upon mass balance for geological examples of fractionation sequences in the lower continental crust. This is complemented by a thermal model for the heat budget obtained from a projected phase diagram and thermodynamic data. Fractional crystallization (FC) and assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) paths have been calculated with these models and the mass ratio of assimilation to crystallization as a function of parent magma type and temperature, crustal rock fertility and temperature, and mechanism of assimilation, have been determined. When these results are combined with F (melt fraction) and r (ratio of mass assimilated/crystallized) values evaluated from geochemical data then new information, not available with the methods separately, can be deduced. This includes when and at what depth and temperature in the crust the assimilation took place, as well as the likely parent magma type and temperature of the assimilant. Our results are presented in simple graphical fashion to facilitate future studies that examine the evolution of individual calc-alkaline plutons and the mechanisms of crustal contamination, and to improve melt models involving hydrous magma in volcanic arcs and in the lower continental crust.

VL  - 28

SP  - 457-464
AB  - Although Dugesia dorotocephala is among the most widely distributed and eurythermal triclads within North America, its thermal relations are poorly known. We compared the upper thermal tolerances and the temperatures selected in a circular gradient of planarians acclimated to 15 degreesC or 22 degreesC. We also compared speeds of planarians tested at 22 degreesC after up to 10 days of starvation or after acclimation to 15 degreesC, 22 degreesC, or 30 degreesC. We compared speeds of 22 degreesC acclimated animals at temperatures ranging from 10 degreesC to 30 degreesC, and we examined the interaction between temperature and water viscosity. The triclads could survive temperatures close to 33 degreesC for up to 12h, but had incipient lethal temperatures around 30.5 degreesC. Warm acclimated animals survived somewhat better at the higher, but not at the lower, temperatures within this range. The triclads selected temperatures between 12 degreesC and 28 degreesC, with the 15 degreesC acclimated animals selecting higher mean temperatures (23.1 degreesC) than the 22 degreesC acclimated animals (20.9 degreesC). The latter group showed a normally distributed selection pattern, whereas that of the former group was skewed to the right. Speeds increased during the first two days of fasting but showed no further changes between days 3 and 10. Speeds increased with body size with a scaling exponent of about 0.25. There was a significant effect of temperature, with a Q(10) of 2.31 between 10 degreesC and 30 degreesC. Thermal acclimation did have a significant effect on locomotion, with 30 degreesC acclimated animals being markedly slower than 15 degreesC or 22 degreesC acclimated individuals. Although there was a slight indication of a viscosity effect., the resulting differences were not statistically significant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecological and reproductive variance in serum leptin in wild vervet monkeys
VL  - 137
IS  - 4
SP  - 441-448
AB  - Leptin was originally thought to be an antiobesity hormone, but increasing evidence suggests that its ancestral role was to mobilize neuroendocrine responses to starvation. Research on wild primates is critical for interpreting the high leptin values seen in Western human populations and captive animals. This study examined natural variation in serum leptin in wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops), testing the hypothesis that serum leptin in vervets varies with sex, adiposity, ecology, and reproductive state. Analyses made use of a unique dataset comprised of serum and morphometric measurements obtained from vervet monkeys in four Kenyan sites differing in altitude, temperature, rainfall, and access to human foods. Leptin and gonadal steroid concentrations were analyzed in serum samples from 116 adults. Low leptin levels in males and acyclic females support the contention that levels seen in captivity are not typical for wild primates. Measures of adiposity were not correlated with serum leptin, reflecting the extremely low fat storage in wild cercopithecine primates. Associations with habitat and season, however, indicate that leptin does register ecological variation in energy balance. Leptin levels were higher in sites and seasons with higher rainfall. Moreover, leptin varied significantly with reproductive state, with higher levels in pregnant than in acyclic females. Changes in leptin with gestation stage and duration of lactation suggest that transitory and reversible elevations were an important part of its ancestral role. These data show that in this wild primate population leptin is a sensitive index of natural variation in habitat and seasonally fluctuating reproductive state. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 99-113
AB  - We used a coupled physical-biological model to examine potential distances between hatching and settlement locations for lobsters in the Gulf of Maine. The physical model is based on a finite-element mesh and climatological averages of the seasonally evolving temperature and density fields. Larval trajectories from coastal and offshore hatching sites (21-224 m deep) were calculated for early, middle and late-season hatching by coupling temperature-dependent development rates and depth (the biological model) to the circulation. Model results showed large spatial differences in larval development times (from 18 to 38 days) and distances transported (19-280 km) for the early hatch. Development time and transport decreased markedly by mid-season at most sites, but strong spatial differences persisted. The eastern Maine coast appears to experience stronger removal and less resupply of larvae than other regions, consistent with observed lower recruitment. Inverse solutions of the model for larvae arriving in mid-coastal Maine indicate that they originate from a broad section of the eastern coast 'upstream', with those nearest the shoreline generally travelling the shortest distances. The postlarval stage is neustonic (living near the surface), and a simple inverse model demonstrates that a diurnal coastal sea breeze can contribute substantially to inshore movement during this final planktonic stage. Thus, offshore reproduction may be linked to inshore recruitment.

TI  - The role of stress proteins in responses of a montane willow leaf beetle to environmental temperature variation
VL  - 32
IS  - 3
SP  - 477-488
AB  - The heat shock response is a critical mechanism by which organisms buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefits of Hsp expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent development of unfit phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp expression among natural populations of ectotherms may be due to interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra willow leaf beetle Chrysomela aeneicollis, which lives in highly variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp70 expression among PGI genotypes correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity. Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond effectively to environmental change. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Adaptive sex-specific life history plasticity to temperature and photoperiod in a damselfly
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
SP  - 986-995
AB  - We investigated four predictions about how temperature, photoperiod and sex affect the life history plasticity and foraging activity of a damselfly. (i) As predicted, increased temperatures increased foraging activity and growth rates, but in contrast with the prediction, late photoperiod (high time stress) did not affect foraging activity and growth rate. (ii) Unexpectedly, the increase in growth rate at increasing temperatures was not larger under high time stress. (iii) As predicted, age and size at emergence decreased at higher temperatures and at the late photoperiod. Temperature-induced life history shifts were direct or the result of behavioural growth mediation depending on the temperature range. Photoperiod-induced life history shifts were direct. (iv) As predicted, males emerged before females but at a smaller size. The degree of sexual size dimorphism was influenced by the joint effects of temperature and photoperiod. We could only detect genetic variation in size plasticity to photoperiod. The match between the sex-specific life history responses to temperature and photoperiod and predictions by relevant optimality models suggests adaptive life history plasticity to these variables.

VL  - 3

SP  - 102-116
AB  - Chromobacterium violaceum is a Gram-negative bacterium, abundant in a variety of ecosystems in tropical and subtropical regions, including the water and borders of the Negro River, a major component of the Amazon Basin. As a free-living microorganism, C. violaceum is exposed to a series of variable conditions, such as different sources and abundance of nutrients, changes in temperature and pH, toxic compounds and UV rays. These variations, and the wide range of environments, require great adaptability and strong protective systems. The complete genome sequencing of this bacterium has revealed an enormous number and variety of ORFs associated with alternative pathways for energy generation, transport-related proteins, signal transduction, cell motility, secretion, and secondary metabolism. Additionally, the limited availability of iron in most environments can be overcome by iron-chelating compounds, iron-storage proteins, and by several proteins related to iron metabolism in the C. violaceum genome. Osmotically inducible proteins, transmembrane water-channel, and other membrane porins may be regulating the movement of water and maintaining the cell turgor, activities which play an important role in the adaptation to variations in osmotic pressure. Several proteins related to tolerance against antimicrobial compounds, heavy metals, temperature, acid and UV light stresses, others that promote survival under starvation conditions, and enzymes capable of detoxifying reactive oxygen species were also detected in C. violaceum. All these features together help explain its remarkable competitiveness and ability to survive under different types of environmental stresse.

VL  - 56
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-37
AB  - Standard (SMR) and routine (RMR) metabolic rates (mg O2 h-1) of bream, Abramis brama, were measured over a wide range of fish sizes and water temperatures (1-560 g wet mass, 5-23°C) by automated, computerised intermittent flow respirometry. These data were compared to similar data collected on roach, Rutilus rutilus, a sympatric species within the same subfamily Leuciscinae (Cyprinidae). For bream, both SMR and RMR were described by allometric mass exponents of 0.70 and exponential temperature dependencies over the entire size and temperature range. In bream, the temperature dependency of SMR and RMR was described by a Q10 of 2.8 and 2.2, respectively, while roach displayed Q10 values of 2.4 and 1.9, respectively. There were small but significant differences between bream and roach in the temperature dependency of SMR. Between 5 and 10°C, juvenile roach (Q10 = 5.8) and adult bream (Q10 = 4.9) displayed significantly higher sensitivity of mass-independent RMR to temperature changes than equal-sized juvenile bream and adult roach, respectively. This indicates different strategies during winter and the early spring period. When comparing these results with related literature about energy intake, it appears that roach and bream have evolved different thermal phenotypes, with bream showing a slightly more pronounced increase of metabolic energy loss and a less pronounced increase of energy intake (consumption, digestion) with temperature compared to sympatric roach. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2006.

TI  - Herpetological diversity along Andean elevational gradients: Links with physiological ecology and evolutionary physiology
VL  - 133
IS  - 3
SP  - 469-485
AB  - A well-defined macroecological pattern is the decline in biodiversity with altitude. However, this decline is taxa-specific. For example, amphibians are more diverse than squamates at extreme elevations in the tropical Andes, but this pattern is reversed at extreme elevations in the southern latitudes. Several ecophysiological and evolutionary factors may be related to this difference. At high-elevations in southern latitudes temperature differs dramatically among seasons and dry soils dominate, characteristics that appear to favor lizard physiological ecology. Tropical high altitudes, in contrast, are humid and offer abundant and diverse water resources. These characteristics allow for a richer anuran community but might complicate lizard egg development through temperature and oxygen constrains. Differences in strategies of thermal adaptation might also modulate diversity patterns. The thermal physiology of anurans is extremely labile so that behavioral and physiological performance is maintained despite an altitudinal decrease in field body temperature. Lizards, in contrast, exhibit a conservative thermal physiology and rely on behavioral thermoregulation to face cold and variable temperatures. Both, lizard behavioral strategies and anuran physiological adjustments seem equally efficient in allowing ecological success and diversification for both groups in the tropics up to approximately 3000 m. At higher elevations physiological thermal adaptation is required, and lizards are ecologically constrained, perhaps at various ontogenetic stages. Patterns of biodiversity along environmental clines can be better understood through a physiological approach, and can help to refine and propose hypotheses in evolutionary physiology. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - A method for the determination of the S AR distribution produced by an electromagnetic applicator for localized hyperthermia is described. The procedure for SAR evaluation consists of recording the time evolution of the temperature inside a polyacrylamide phantom by means of thermochromic liquid crystal sheets inserted in it. The technique allows a complete characterization of applicators in a very broad frequency range, using power levels of the order of those needed in real treatments. Criteria for the minimum phantom size and the maximum time duration of the characterization procedure are indicated, which allow a reliable determination of the effective field size and penetration depth of the applicator. © 1991 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

TI  - Injury and Repair of Gram-Negative Bacteria, with Special Consideration of the Involvement of the Cytoplasmic Membrane
VL  - 23
SP  - 219
AB  - Researchers have proposed several theories to explain the mechanisms of injury and repair in gram-negative bacteria. Approaches have been basically twofold, involving either an examination of chemical and morphological changes in cells incurred as a result of the stress treatment, or investigation of the nutrient and physical requirements for repair. Table I11 summarizes selected research findings evolving from experiments implicating the involvement of the cytoplasmic membrane in gram-negative cell injury and repair. Leakage of intracellular constituents during exposure to stress has been noted for several species and implies a malfunction of the cytoplasmic membrane. Increased sensitivity of injured cells to uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and to surface-active compounds also implicates the membrane as a site of damage. To what extent these debilitations affect the survival of bacteria is not thoroughly understood. It seems likely, however, that when and if death of injured gram-negative bacteria occurs, the damaged membrane has a contributing influence. © 1978 Academic Press Inc.

TI  - Evaluating genetic resources of forest trees by means of life history traits - A Norwegian example
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SP  - 1681-1696
AB  - Additive variation in adaptive traits is a prerequisite for selection and adaptation to future environmental changes, but distribution of adaptive genetic variability between and within populations is poorly known in most forest trees. Owing to this deficiency, life history traits such as geographic range, pollination vector and seed dispersal capability, which significantly affect gene flow and thus the distribution of genetic variability, were used to evaluate the genetic resources in 23 Norwegian native forest tree species. Based on the combination of life history traits the species' genetic resources were classified either as viable, potentially vulnerable or vulnerable, assuming a decrease in within-population variability in this sequence. Twelve widely distributed species with generally effective dispersal of pollen and seeds were considered viable (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Juniperus communis, Betula pubescens, B. pendula, Alnus incana, A. glutinosa, Salix caprea, Populus tremula, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Prunus padus) and have as such no particular conservation needs. Effective seed dispersal of these species, as inferred from post-glacial migration rates, may be partly responsible for their generally early post-glacial appearance, and may, in combination with the wide ranges and relatively large evolutionary potential, indicate that viable species are best able to cope with climatic change. Among species with restricted ranges and more limited gene flow eight were considered potentially vulnerable (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, Taxus baccatu, Ilex aquifolium, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra) and three were considered vulnerable (Tilia cordata, Malus sylvestris, P. avium). Application of different intensities of a multiple population breeding system (MPBS) is considered the most appropriate mode of conserving genetic resources in these species.

AB  - In the first experiment reported here 44 isofemale lines from four recently collected base populations were each divided into three selection lines, one for each of three temperature environments—constant 23°C, constant 29°C and diurnally varying 17°C/29°C. Allele frequency responses after 30 generations of selection were similar across the three environments for the Adh, Gpdh and Pgm polymorphisms but differed among the four base populations for Adh and Gpdh. Equilibrium AdhF and GpdhS frequencies predicted from maximum likelihood estimates of selection coefficients were higher for base populations from more temperate latitudes; this was consistent with latitudinal dines previously reported in AdhF and GpdhS frequencies. By contrast, the equilibrium frequencies predicted for Pgm1.00 were generally high for all base populations; however this was also consistent with geographic data on Pgm1.00 frequencies, which are uniformly high over a wide range of latitudes. In a second experiment involving greater temperature stress, adults from eight recent collections were exposed to 38°C for an hour. Differences in survival percentages were then evident among Gpdh, but not Adh, genotypes. (Pgm genotypes were not consistently scorable after the heat shock.) Survival percentages were highest for GpdhF/GpdhF; intermediate for GpdhF/GpdhS and lowest for GpdhS/GpdhS. From the first experiment it was suggested that the latitudinal dines for Adh and Gpdh in part reflect latitudinal variation in the selection imposed by the internal environments of the flies, as determined by their genetic backgrounds. The second experiment suggested that the Gpdh dines also reflect direct selective effects of stressfully high temperatures. © 1985 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

TI  - The adaptive and evolutionary significance of wing polymorphism and parthenogenesis in Ptinella Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Ptiliidae)
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SP  - 89-98
AB  - Abstract. The incidence of wing polymorphism varies seasonally in field populations of Ptinella aptera and Ptinella errabunda with alatae increasing in abundance in summer. In laboratory cultures of P. aptera alate development varies with temperature. This implies that morph determination is based on a physiological switch sensitive to temperature and possibly other adaptively relevant environmental factors. Alate P. aptera produce a higher proportion of alate offspring than do apterous parents suggesting an inherited component in polymorphism control, or some form of maternal effect. The female biased sex ratio expected of a regularly inbreeding species was found only in the alate morph. Apterous beetles show a 1:1 sex ratio which is explained by the females' limited capacity to store sperm, the enormous size of the sperm, and the consequent need for multiple insemination. Ptinella errabunda is thelytokous but fails to realize the potentially doubled fecundity associated with parthenogenesis. Both the number of eggs produced and their viability is lower than in bisexual congeners. Enhanced colonizing ability, rather than energy economy, is considered to be the most important selective advantage of parthenogenesis to Ptinella in the subcortical habitat. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the subcortical habitat is considered to have favoured the evolution and maintenance of parthenogenesis and wing polymorphism in Ptinella.

AB  - We present a two-fluid description of the Kondo lattice that is based on an analysis of [Formula presented] at various levels of dilution with La. We show that thermal and transport measurements provide evidence for the survival of the Kondo impurity component in the lattice as [Formula presented], and that the evolution of the low temperature properties of the Kondo lattice can be viewed as the partial condensation of the lattice of Kondo centers into a heavy fermion fluid. The resulting two-fluid model is shown to be applicable to the general problem of the ground state of the Kondo lattice. © 2004 The American Physical Society.

TI  - Terrestrial insects along elevation gradients: Species and community responses to altitude
VL  - 80
IS  - 3
SP  - 489-513
AB  - The literature on the response of insect species to the changing environments experienced along altitudinal gradients is diverse and widely dispersed. There is a growing awareness that such responses may serve as analogues for climate warming effects occurring at a particular fixed altitude or latitude over time. This review seeks, therefore, to synthesise information on the responses of insects and allied groups to increasing altitude and provide a platform for future research. It focuses on those functional aspects of insect biology that show positive or negative reaction to altitudinal changes but avoids emphasising adaptation to high altitude per se. Reactions can be direct, with insect characteristics or performance responding to changing environmental parameters, or they can be indirect and mediated through the insect's interaction with other organisms. These organisms include the host plant in the case of herbivorous insects, and also competitor species, specific parasitoids, predators and pathogens. The manner in which these various factors individually and collectively influence the morphology, behaviour, ecophysiology, growth and development, survival, reproduction, and spatial distribution of insect species is considered in detail. Resultant patterns in the abundance of individual species populations and of community species richness are examined. Attempts are made throughout to provide mechanistic explanations of trends and to place each topic, where appropriate, into the broader theoretical context by appropriate reference to key literature. The paper concludes by considering how montane insect species will respond to climate warming. © 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.

VL  - 17

AB  - Pure and polycrystalline samples of Yb3Sb5O 12 were prepared under vacuum by solid-state reaction. In this cubic matrix, space group I4̄3m (No. 217), Z = 4, Yb3+ occupies a single crystallographic site with point symmetry S4. The confident determination of the Yb3+ energy levels was carried out through the analysis of 9 K optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and 300 K Raman measurements, assisted by models and procedures providing proper estimations of crystal-field (CF) interactions in this host. The parametrization of free-ion and CF effects for Er3+ in Er3Sb 5O12 has been revised and then used as reference in the simulation of Yb3+ CF energy levels. The correctness of the energy level sequence of Yb3+ in Yb3Sb5O12, which is characterized by a large splitting for the 2F7/2 ground state, 933 cm-1, and the composition of the associated wave functions were tested through the successful reproduction of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic molar susceptibility χm of Yb 3Sb5O12. Some parameters of interest accounting for application perspectives as a laser material have been evaluated and compared with those corresponding to other stoichiometric and Yb-doped confirmed laser materials. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

TI  - SILICON NITRIDE EMERGING AS VIABLE GAS TURBINE MATERIALS

AB  - Silicon nitride is in the forefront of an evolution in high temperature materials. Simple shapes capable of withstanding temperatures near 2000F without losing excellent rigidity, hardness or chemical resistance are, even today, typical of silicon nitride applications. But development of gas turbine engines which can run more efficiently at temperatures beyond the capabilities of metal alloys is changing all this. Pioneer work in turbines is aimed at developing complex parts which also capitalize on silicon nitride's oxidation and thermal shock resistance as well as its creep and rupture stability and physical strength. Performance demands may some day range from survival for 50 hr in an aerospace turbine engine for unmanned aircraft to considerably longer duration in automobile engines. And there is even a possibility that silicon nitride parts will sustain turbine engine conditions for as long as 50,000 hr in stationary power generation systems.

VL  - 150
IS  - 3
SP  - 393-397
AB  - The tropical high Andes experience greater daily temperature oscillations compared to seasonal ones as well as a high frequency of night frost occurrence year round. Survival of organisms, under such environmental conditions, has been determined by selective forces which have evolved into adaptations including avoidance or tolerance to freezing. These adaptations have been studied in different species of trees, shrubs and perennial herbs in páramo ecosystems, while they have not been considered in grasses, an important family of the páramo. In order to understand survival of Poaceae, resistance mechanisms were determined. The study was performed along an altitudinal gradient (2,500-4,200 m a.s.l.) in the páramo. Supercooling capacity and frost injury temperature were determined in nine species in order to establish cold resistance mechanisms. Grasses registered a very low supercooling capacity along the altitudinal gradient, with ice formation between -6 and -3°C. On the other hand, frost injury temperature oscillated between -18 and -7°C. Our results suggest that grasses exhibit freezing tolerance as their main cold resistance mechanism. Since grasses grow at ground level, where greatest heat loss takes place, tolerance may be related to this life form as reported for other small life forms. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - The evolution of thermal performance curves in semi-aquatic newts: Thermal specialists on land and thermal generalists in water?
VL  - 33
IS  - 7
SP  - 395-403
AB  - The position and shape of thermal performance curves (TPCs, the functions relating temperature to physiological performance) for ecologically relevant functions will directly affect the fitness of ectotherms and therefore should be under strong selection. However, thermodynamic considerations predict that relationships between the different components of the TPC will confound its evolutionary optimization. For instance, the "jack-of-all-temperatures" hypothesis predicts a trade-off between the breadth of the TPC and the maximal performance capacity; the "warmer is better" hypothesis suggests that low thermal optima will come with low absolute performances. Semi-aquatic organisms face the additional challenge of having to adjust their TPCs to two environments that are likely to differ in mean temperature and thermal variability. In this paper, we examine how parameters of the TPCs for maximal running and swimming speed have co-evolved in the semi-aquatic newt genus Triturus. We consider evolutionary relationships between the width and the height of the TPCs, the optimal temperatures and maximal performance. Phylogenetic comparative analyses reveal that in Triturus, swimming and running differ substantially in the (co-)variation of TPC parameters. Whereas evolutionary changes in the TPC for swimming primarily concern the shape of the curve (generalist versus specialist), most interspecific variation in running speed TPCs involves shifts in overall performance across temperatures.

TI  - Laterally transferred elements and high pressure adaptation in Photobacterium profundum strains
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Oceans cover approximately 70% of the Earth's surface with an average depth of 3800 m and a pressure of 38 MPa, thus a large part of the biosphere is occupied by high pressure environments. Piezophilic (pressure-loving) organisms are adapted to deep-sea life and grow optimally at pressures higher than 0.1 MPa. To better understand high pressure adaptation from a genomic point of view three different Photobacterium profundum strains were compared. Using the sequenced piezophile P. profundum strain SS9 as a reference, microarray technology was used to identify the genomic regions missing in two other strains: a pressure adapted strain (named DSJ4) and a pressure-sensitive strain (named 3TCK). Finally, the transcriptome of SS9 grown under different pressure (28 MPa; 45 MPa) and temperature (4°C; 16°C) conditions was analyzed taking into consideration the differentially expressed genes belonging to the flexible gene pool. Results: These studies indicated the presence of a large flexible gene pool in SS9 characterized by various horizontally acquired elements. This was verified by extensive analysis of GC content, codon usage and genomic signature of the SS9 genome. 171 open reading frames (ORFs) were found to be specifically absent or highly divergent in the piezosensitive strain, but present in the two piezophilic strains. Among these genes, six were found to also be up-regulated by high pressure. Conclusions: These data provide information on horizontal gene flow in the deep sea, provide additional details of P. profundum genome expression patterns and suggest genes which could perform critical functions for abyssal survival, including perhaps high pressure growth. © 2005 Campanaro et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - This chapter reviews the numerous direct effects temperature has on living systems and their environments. The direct effects of temperature are amplified by the complex interplay among temperature, the availability of essential nutrients, and the geological processes that affect the character and composition of the earth's crust, oceans, and atmosphere. The chapter discusses the episodes in the Earth history during which temperatures rose or high-temperature zones spread are highly favorable to evolutionary innovation and diversification. This is not only because increases in temperature make many adaptations catalytically more attainable, but also because global increases in temperature are accompanied by higher oxygen levels in the atmosphere, as well as by a greater availability of nutrients and higher primary productivity. Finally, it caution against atomizing the environment into discrete physical and biological factors, and argue instead that feedbacks between life and its environment demand a holistic approach to the problem of cause and effect in evolution. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the life spans of wild type flies (Sevelen strain, n = 2991) and post-replication DNA repair-deficient flies (mei-41D5, n = 1607) as members of age-synchronized birth cohorts and as members of full sibships. Flies were individually housed from the time they were laid as eggs until they died as imagoes; environmental conditions were constant throughout the life span of these virgins. In this minimal stress experiment, developmental time and imaginal longevity were negligibly correlated (r = -0.09 to -0.25), even though developmental time was canalized at different levels in both strains. Previous research involving environmental perturbations during the life span of Drosophila (e.g. temperature, diet, population density) has demonstrated significant strong correlations, mostly positive, between developmental time and adult longevity. We have demonstrated that the duration of development and aging are not coupled in the absence of such stresses. We therefore suggest that regulated changes in the duration of the pre-imaginal and the adult stages of the lifecycle of Drosophila may have evolved through adaptation to environmental stresses. © 1984.

VL  - 29

AB  - Although animals use habitats non-randomly in the wild, complex correlations among environmental features mean that proximate influences on habitat selection can be identified only by experimental manipulation of potential cues. Thick-tailed geckos Nephrurus milii are large lizards that are widely distributed through southern Australia. These nocturnally active animals typically spend daylight hours under surface rocks. We presented captive geckos with alternative retreat-sites (rock crevices) differing in attributes potentially relevant to habitat selection. The lizards showed strong preference for shelter-sites that enhanced thermoregulation (warm rather than cool) and that reduced the animal's vulnerability to predators (narrow crevices with small openings and not containing the scent of a predatory snake). Horizontal rather than sloping crevices were also preferred. Overall crevice size and thickness of the overlying rock did not influence retreat-site selection in the laboratory, but could be important in the field because of their influence on thermal regimes under rocks. The present study supports the idea that nocturnal reptiles base their selection of diurnal shelters on multiple aspects related to the fitness consequences of occupancy of alternative available retreat-sites.

VL  - 360

SP  - 272-281
AB  - In a previous paper, using Eggleton's stellar evolution code, we have discussed the structure and evolution of low-mass W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) type contact binaries with angular momentum loss owing to gravitational radiation or magnetic braking. We find that gravitational radiation is almost insignificant for cyclic evolution of low-mass W UMa type systems, and it is possible for angular momentum to be lost from W UMa systems in a magnetic stellar wind. The weaker magnetic activity shown by observations in W UMa systems is likely caused by the lower mass of the convective envelopes in these systems than in similar but non-contact binaries. The spin angular momentum cannot be neglected at any time for W UMa type systems, especially for those with extreme mass ratios. The spin angular momenta of both components are included in this paper and they are found to have a significant influence on the cyclic evolution of W UMa systems. We investigate the influence of the energy transfer on the common convective envelopes of both components in detail. We find that the mass of the convective envelope of the primary in contact evolution is slightly more than that in poor thermal contact evolution, and that the mass of the convective envelope of the secondary in contact evolution is much less than that in poor thermal contact evolution. Meanwhile, the rate of angular momentum loss of W UMa type systems is much lower than that of poor thermal contact systems. This is indeed caused by the lower masses of the convective envelopes of the components in W UMa type systems. Although the models with angular momentum loss for W UMa systems exhibit cyclic evolution, they seem to show that a W UMa system cannot continue this type of cyclic evolution indefinitely, and it might coalesce into a fast-rotating star after about 1200 cycles of evolution (about 7.0 × 109 yr). © 2005 RAS.

TI  - Genotype-by-environment interactions and adaptation to local temperature affect immunity and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
AB  - Natural populations of most organisms harbor substantial genetic variation for resistance to infection. The continued existence of such variation is unexpected under simple evolutionary models that either posit direct and continuous natural selection on the immune system or an evolved life history "balance" between immunity and other fitness traits in a constant environment. However, both local adaptation to heterogeneous environments and genotype-by-environment interactions can maintain genetic variation in a species. In this study, we test Drosophila melanogaster genotypes sampled from tropical Africa, temperate northeastern North America, and semi-tropical southeastern North America for resistance to bacterial infection and fecundity at three different environmental temperatures. Environmental temperature had absolute effects on all traits, but there were also marked genotype-by- environment interactions that may limit the global efficiency of natural selection on both traits. African flies performed more poorly than North American flies in both immunity and fecundity at the lowest temperature, but not at the higher temperatures, suggesting that the African population is maladapted to low temperature. In contrast, there was no evidence for clinal variation driven by thermal adaptation within North America for either trait. Resistance to infection and reproductive success were generally uncorrelated across genotypes, so this study finds no evidence for a fitness tradeoff between immunity and fecundity under the conditions tested. Both local adaptation to geographically heterogeneous environments and genotype-by-environment interactions may explain the persistence of genetic variation for resistance to infection in natural populations. © 2008 Lazzaro et al.

AB  - Age, growth and mortality of red bandfish, Cepola macrophrhalma (L.), from the western Aegean Sea were studied using the otoliths from 1113 fish and the length and weight of 3351 fish. Two regions were established (north and south of the Euripos Strait). The red bandfish grows allometrically (slope of length‐weight regressions ≤2) and relatively rapidly until age 4 or 5 years. It is proposed that this rapid linear growth represents an adaptation which evolved to reduce the vulnerability of red bandfish to whole‐fish swallowers. Back‐calculated lengths‐at‐age showed significant differences between regions and between sexes. Males were larger than females after age 2 years. Maximum age of northern fish was also higher than southern fish (8 and 5 years respectively). Southern fish grow at a faster rate (K=0.379) but to a significantly smaller size (Lx=424.8mm t.l., Wx=25.1 g) than northern fish (K=0.214, Lx=676.1 mm t.l., Wx=90.9 g). Mortality rates (total and natural instantaneous mortalities) of southern fish were also higher than northern fish. We suggest that these variations represent responses to the different conditions of temperature and food availability prevailing in the two regions. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

TI  - Why do female lizards lay their eggs in communal nests?
VL  - 76
IS  - 5
SP  - 881-887
AB  - 1. In many reptile species, females oviposit communally (i.e. many clutches are laid within the same nest). This behaviour might result from constraint (scarcity of nest-sites offering suitable incubation conditions) or adaptation (direct fitness benefits accruing from the proximity of other eggs). 2. To test between these alternatives, we gathered field and laboratory data on montane scincid lizards Bassiana duperreyi from south-eastern Australia. Our data support the adaptationist hypothesis. 3. In the field, communal vs. solitary clutches were laid in similar sites, and the relative frequency of communal nesting was not predictable from nest-site availability. Thermal regimes for incubation did not differ between communal vs. solitary nests, nor between eggs at the core vs. periphery of a communal nest. In the laboratory, females selectively oviposited beside existing eggs rather than in otherwise identical potential nesting sites. 4. From cycling-temperature incubation in the laboratory, eggs incubated within a cluster of other eggs took up less water, but produced hatchlings that were larger and faster-running than were hatchlings from eggs incubated alone. 5. Hydric modifications of incubation conditions within a cluster of tightly packed eggs thus may provide a direct fitness benefit to communal oviposition. © 2007 The Authors.

SP  - 27-32
AB  - Evidence from the past and recent discoveries provide material for a philosophical review and possible scenarios, for the future of sponges, their essential characters, their evolutionary potential and direction, and their survival. Their short and long term futures appear secure. Species are capable of coping with the outcomes of human impacts on the oceans (survival in highly polluted, warmer waters, in dark and oligotrophic conditions), whereas increased sedimentation is a potential problem to the deep-sea species. Recent species have an ancient, simple 'bauplan' more-or-less unchanged since Precambrian times and are capable of simplifying (independently losing the essential poriferan characters of the aquiferous system and choanocytes), much like the newly discovered Precambrian fossils, to adopt a carnivorous life style. To date, 'complexification' in sponges has been restricted to their considerably complex biochemical constituency and numerous biosynthetic pathways and their ability to develop a canal system, filter-feeding habit and single layer of choanocytes which permit them to attain larger sizes and to have considerable ecological success. But the oldest fossils show that Precambrian sponges did not have such filtering devices and new findings show that carnivorous sponges can certainly live without them. These characters, therefore, are probably not fundamental characteristics of Porifera, which may be better defined by their characteristic cell motility, plasticity of body organisation, absence of tissues and organs and presence of spicules (although the latter optional).

AB  - After reviewing the microscopic and macroscopic texture of fault zones, the localisation of rupture and creep is described, and the reduced strength of fault zones is investigated. Simple strength and viscosity models for the whole lithosphere play a major role for the geometry of fault zones. Compressional faults (thrusts) show ramp- and flat structures, often soling in a (weak) detachment zone, extensional faults prefer a listric shape, often turning subhorizontal and being invisible in the seismic lamellae of the ductile lower crust which according to the models is also a broad zone of detachment and decoupling. Faults in the lower crust are rare and restricted to strain hardened fault rocks or intrinsically rigid rocks like oceanic mafic-ultramafic rocks of suture zones. Transient faults in the lower crust are created by rupture processes of large earthquakes. Some deep faults, moderately dipping or flat, are again observed in the (rather rigid) uppermost mantle. The observation of folding inside the crust seems to be connected with an intermediate viscosity range and with a broad (vertical) transition zone where rigid reactions and ductile processes are mixed. Various methods of detecting faults by seismic studies are critically reviewed, and some sequence of reliability is suggested. Impedance contrasts, polarity, dip, thickness, and multiple fault strings have to be deciphered by wavefront modelling. Origin and survival of faults are considered to be a consequence of tectonic and thermal evolution under specific stress systems.

TI  - Tilapia sex determination: Where temperature and genetics meet
VL  - 153
IS  - 1
SP  - 30-38
AB  - This review deals with the complex sex determining system of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, governed by the interactions between a genetic determination and the influence of temperature, shown in both domestic and wild populations. Naturally sex reversed individuals are strongly suggested in two wild populations. This can be due to the masculinising temperatures which some fry encounter during their sex differentiation period when they colonise shallow waters, and/or to the influence of minor genetic factors. Differences regarding a) thermal responsiveness of sex ratios between and within Nile tilapia populations, b) maternal and paternal effects on temperature dependent sex ratios and c) nearly identical results in offspring of repeated matings, demonstrate that thermosensitivity is under genetic control. Selection experiments to increase the thermosensitivity revealed high responses in the high and low sensitive lines. The high-line showed similar to 90% males after 2 generations of selection whereas the weakly sensitive line had 54% males. This is the first evidence that a surplus of males in temperature treated groups can be selected as a quantitative trait. Expression profiles of several genes (Cyp19a, Foxl2, Amh, Sox9a,b) from the gonad and brain were analysed to define temperature action oil the sex determining/differentiating cascade in tilapia. The coexistence of GSD and TSD is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several polar continental air masses intruding into the south Florida/northern Bahama Bank region during January 1981 caused record low air temperatures and rapid chilling of extensive shallow-water carbonate systems. Numerous "coral kills" along the Florida reef tract and massive fish mortalities in Florida Bay were attributable to unusually cold waters generated at this time. Thermal evolution of Florida Bay/Florida reef tract and northern Bahama Bank waters from 8 to 21 January was assessed from thermal infrared data acquired by the NOAA-6 environmental satellite, in situ water temperatures, local meteorological data, and a computerized heat flux model. Field observations and laboratory experiments identify 16°C as a thermal stress threshold for most reef corals (Mayor 1915; Davis 1981). Temperaturecorrected digital satellite data indicated that water temperatures below 16°C were generated in Florida Bay and on Little and Great Bahama Banks during a 10-day period in January. Lowest temperatures on the Florida reef tract resulted from offshelf transport of Florida Bay water through major tidal channels. Offshelf movement of bay water is driven primarily by strong northerly winds, density gradients, and tidal pumping. Absence of reef development opposite major tidal passes along the Florida reef tract (Ginsburg and Shinn 1964) and aperiodic coral kills along bank margins can be attributed to this process, which has probably had a limiting influence on Holocene reef development in these areas. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Most industrial hot-shaping operations, such as rolling of rails, are comprised of several stages of deformation, each at different temperatures and strain rates. The behaviour of the steel, i.e. the flow stress, ductility and microstructural changes, during each of these stages, depend on the structure developed up to that point as a result of strain hardening, dynamic recovery and/or recrystallization during previous passes coupled with static recovery and/or recrystallization in the arrests between them. The simulation of forming schedules by several techniques, tension, compression and torsion, are compared and their results described, which show that the amount of softening between passes increases with inverse temperature, strain rate and strain during the pass (accumulated strain if no recrystallization in previous arrests) and with temperature and duration of arrest. Such laboratory tests guide the selection of schedules to equalize loads, minimize energy, improve product properties, reduce defects and improve productivity. © 1982 Maney Publishing.

VL  - 86

AB  - The screwworm fly is mass-produced using an artificial larval diet and an artificial oviposition substrate. On the artificial diet, mean fecundity was 185 eggs per female, whereas host-reared flies averaged 280 eggs per female. Host-reared flies were generally larger (head capsule width [HCW] > 3.6 mm) than laboratory-reared flies (HCW < 3.6 mm). Larger flies are generally more fecund, and size is related to larval nutrition. Only 75-89% of females reared on artificial diet and maintained at 30-degrees-C were gravid at 6 d of age compared with 100% of host-reared females tested at 5-6 d. When gravid females were offered artificial substrate for oviposition, almost-equal-to 28% failed to oviposit and another 11% laid only partial clutches. Among all females tested for oviposition, 25% of the total egg production was withheld. Fecundity influenced oviposition, because the more mature eggs a female had, the more likely she was to oviposit. Supplementing the adult diet of honey and water with raw meat increased fecundity by 14% under normal laboratory conditions, but by as much as 350% in flies in which larval feeding was curtailed by removal of the larvae from the media 1 d before the normal completion of development. Many females became gravid in 4-5 d at 30-degrees-C versus 8-9 d at 22-degrees-C. But fecundity and oviposition rate were more variable (less synchronous) in colonies maintained at the higher temperature. This suggests that there may be greater selection for laboratory adaptation at the higher maintenance temperatures.

TI  - Thermal release of nitric oxide from ambient air and diesel particles
VL  - 33
IS  - 8
SP  - 1175-1178
AB  - In recent years there have been numerous reports of an association between daily increases in particle air pollution (PM10) and daily increases in mortality and morbidity. Despite these reports, there continue to be unresolved issues with these studies, including the issue of a plausible biological mechanism by which small increases in daily particle levels could cause adverse human health effects. Chemical characterization of particles is a critical step in testing any biological mechanism. We have characterized gas-phase material associated with particles from various sources and found that measurable amounts of nitric oxide (NO) can be thermally released from these particles. NO is well-known to be an effective vasodilating agent at very low concentrations. In this work, release of NO from four NIST reference materials, two ambient air particulate samples, and two diesel particulate samples was quantified after heating the samples for 1 h. The amount of NO originating from particles depends on the temperature used to evolve this gas. NO levels ranged from 0.005 ng of NO/mg of sample at 37 °C to 1900 ng of NO/mg of sample at 140 °C. These experiments demonstrate that nitric oxide can be released from some particles at physiological temperatures (37 °C). Release of nitric oxide (NO) from four NIST reference materials, two ambient air particulate samples, and two diesel particulate samples was quantified after heating the samples for 1 h.

VL  - 293
IS  - 5
SP  - 443-449
AB  - The role of hypothalamic neurotransmitter systems in behavioral thermoregulation was investigated. in the prespawning female tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. Intrahypothalamic microinjection with serotonin (5-HT, 3 mul of 1.0 x 10(-6) M) resulted in a significant increase in the selected temperature. This effect was mimicked by the agonist of 5-HT1A, 1B, and 2C receptors, N-3-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine. Intrahypothalamic microinjection of tilapia with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulted in a biphasic effect of the temperature selection, whereas microinjection with muscimol, an agonist of GABA(A) receptor, had no effect on temperature selection. Both agonist and antagonist of glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and MK-801 (1.0 x 10(-6) M), a noncompetitive blocker of NMDA receptor, significantly decreased the preferred temperature. These results indicate that the hypothalamic 5-HT, GABA, and Glu systems play a role in the temperature selection of prespawning female tilapia. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

VL  - 59
IS  - 4
SP  - 551-556
AB  - Bioremediation of weathered diesel fuel in Arctic soil at low temperature was studied both on-site in small-scale biopiles and in laboratory microcosms. The field study site was on Ellesmere Island (82degrees30'N, 62degrees20'W). Biostimulation was by fertilization with phosphorous and nitrogen. Bioaugmentation was with an enrichment culture originating from the field site. In biopiles, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were reduced from 2.9 to 0.5 mg/g of dry soil over a period of 65 days. In microcosms at 7 C, TPH were reduced from 2.4 to 0.5 mg/g of dry soil over a period of 90 days. Inoculation had no effect on hydrocarbon removal in biopiles or in microcosms. Maximum TPH removal rates in the biopiles were approximately 90 mug of TPH g(-1) of soil day(-1), occurring during the first 14 days when ambient temperature ranged from 0 to 10degreesC. The fate of three phylotypes present in the inoculum was monitored using most-probable-number PCR, targeting 16S rRNA genes. Populations of all three phylotypes increased more than 100-fold during incubation of both uninoculated and inoculated biopiles. The inoculum increased the initial populations of the phylotypes but did not significantly affect their final populations. Thus, biostimulation on site enriched populations that were also selected in laboratory enrichment cultures.

VL  - 141
IS  - 4
SP  - 391-400
AB  - The goal of this symposium paper was to identify and quantify developmental plasticity in the onset of cardiovascular responses in the zebrafish. Developmental plasticity was induced by altering the developmental environment in one of three ways: (1) by developing zebrafish in a constant current of 5 body lengths per second, (2) by developing zebrafish at a colder temperature (20 degrees C), and (3) by developing zebrafish in severe hypoxia (DO=0.8 mg/L). Early morphological development was significantly affected by each of the treatment environments with hypoxia slowing development the most and producing the highest variation in measurements. Development in constant water current did not significantly affect the timing onset of cardiovascular responses to the pharmacological agents applied. Development at 20 degrees C significantly delayed the onset of all cardiovascular responses measured by 2-3 days. Development in hypoxia, however, not only delayed onset of all cardiovascular responses, but also shifted the onset relative to the developmental program. Hypoxia clearly has a profound affect on the onset of cardiovascular regulation and it will take many more studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which hypoxia is having its effect. Furthermore, long term studies are also needed to assess whether the plasticity measured in this study is adaptive in the evolutionary sense. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 35

AB  - Copepod dormancy evolved as an adaptation to precarious and temporary aquatic habitats. Large numbers of the world's planktonic copepods exhibit some form of diapause. Many Calanoids in the family Centropagoidea produce dormant (and diapause) eggs, whereas some Megacalanoidea diapause as copepodids in deep oceanic waters. Numerous freshwater Cyclopoids undergo dormancy as copepodites and are widely distributed in freshwater habitats. Harpacticoids diapause only as adults in both fresh and marine waters. Historically, much of the work on copepod dormancy has been descriptive, examining life cycles and population dynamics of the copepods. Experimental work on cues inducing or terminating diapause has been done since 1980. To date, the proximate cues for inducing dormancy (and specifically diapause) are unknown; however, temperature and photoperiod are the two most common environmental cues suspected to induce or terminate diapause. Most researchers favour a combination of the two as necessary. Copepod dormancy is complex and widespread among the three free-living Orders. It is identical in most ways to diapause in insects, although less attention has been given to these aquatic invertebrates.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster females from a multifemale stock (SC-1) showed strong oviposition site preference (OSP) in a continuous gradient of substrate temperatures (18-31°C). Flies reared at 25°C had an OSP ( {Mathematical expression} ±SE) of 25.2±0.2°C, whereas flies reared at 18°C had an OSP of 23.5±.2°C. Flies reared from egg to adult at one temperature and exposed as adults for 4 days to another temperature had OSPs intermediate between these extremes. This second 4-day exposure seemed to have a greater effect on OSP than the first rearing temperature. Selection experiments failed to produce significant change in mean OSP in eight generations, indicating a low heritability of temperature OSP in this stock. © 1979 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

TI  - Specific effects of cycling stressful temperatures upon phenotypic and genetic variability of size traits in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 6

SP  - 873-890
AB  - In previous studies, the relationship between developmental temperature and phenotypic or genetic variability has been mainly investigated using different constant temperatures. Natural conditions, however, are characterized by daily thermal cycles, sometimes resulting in a periodic daily stress. Using the isofemale line technique, we examined the effects of daily cycles on body size in two French populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used either cold stress (daily cycle 8-25 degreesC, average 16.5 degreesC) or heat stress (cycle 18-33 degreesC, average 25.5 degreesC), and the results were compared to those obtained at two constant temperatures, 17 and 25 degreesC. In all cases, stressful regimes produced specific effects, the mean trait values being smaller than those observed under constant conditions. Significant differences were also found for the variance parameters. For the within-line variance, which mostly expresses an environmental component, the two cycling regimes produced similar outcomes - that is, a significant increase in individual variability. For the between-line, genetic variance, however, contrasting results were obtained: an increase with cold stress but a decrease with heat stress. With respect to constant-temperature conditions, evolvability (genetic CV) was increased by daily cold stress, but decreased by daily heat stress. Within-line correlations, between wing and thorax length, were stable and not affected by stress, whereas the between-line, genetic correlation was maximum under cold stress and minimum under heat stress. These results demonstrate that a periodic stress may induce specific effects with respect to permanent stress, and that heat and cold are not equivalent. A possible adaptive interpretation, related to the fact that temperate populations are certainly submitted to cold stress but not to heat stress, is discussed.

AB  - Different methods of freezing and of estimating frost damage in cell cultures of Solanum tuberosum L. and a number of wild Solanum species were compared. Frost‐killing temperatures (FKT, i.e. the temperature resulting in 50% of the maximum possible frost damage) in leaves of these species were ‐6°C (S. acaule), 5°C (S. me‐gistacrotobum), ‐4.5°C (S. commersonii) and ‐3°C (S. polytrichon and S. tubero‐sum) No appreciable species differences were found in FKT when cells were submerged in either buffer or medium and frozen. However, differences did exist when cells were frozen in a non‐submerged condition: S. acaule and S. commersonii callus were more sensitive to frost than suspensions, whereas suspensions of the other species were the most sensitive. Measurement of freezing damage by either electrolyte leakage or by 2,3,5‐triphenyltetrazolium chloride viability assays revealed similar FKT values. Cell cultures of S. acaule showed better frost tolerance than S. tuberosum (FKT values were ‐4.5 to ‐6°C and ‐2.5°C. respectively), however, frost tolerance of S. megistacrolobum and S. commersonii was only poorly expressed at the cell level (FKT values were between ‐2 and ‐3°C). Variant cell lines previously selected for resistance to the amino acid analogues hydroxyprotine, aminoethylcysteine and 5‐methyhryptophan appeared to be more tolerant to frost than the wild type S. tuberosum clone.

AB  - The reproductive behavior of the stickleback is unique and odd, occurring inevitably with nesting. However, upon investigation, it has been found that nesting is an obstacle to hatching. The author conducted a survey in the necessity of nesting behavior in the nine-spined stickleback, Pungitius pungitius, and reached following conclusion: For Pungitius pungitius, nesting is the means of communicating to descendants settlement at a fixed area where cold water flowed bountifully and the water temperature was constant. Pungitius pungitius has evolved a behavior pattern that involves settling where water temperature is uniform, without evolving physiologically or morphologically, thereby enabling Pungitius pungitius to adapt to the changes in environment.

VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SP  - 541-570
AB  - We analyzed variation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits between two Cardamine flexuosa populations based on differences in plasticity of age and size at maturity. C. flexuosa (Cruciferae) is a facultative, vernalization-sensitive, long-day annual, and its phenology and the phenotypic expressions of many life history traits are largely controlled by photoperiod and vernalization in natural populations. We used plants from two populations which differed in their responses to chilling and photoperiod treatments. The timing of developmental processes was changed by controlling temperature and photoperiod regimes in growth chambers. Plasticity in size at maturity was analyzed as changes in a growth trajectory using two parameters, age at maturity (Delta t) and growth rate (k). Both traits showed plasticity, but differences between the populations were found mostly for Delta t. Distinctive differences in size at maturity of individuals in the two populations were mainly due to different amounts of plasticity in Delta t. Variations in plasticity of nine other life history traits and their associations to age and size at maturity were also analyzed. Variation for eight of the traits can be described, at least in part, as a function of age and size at maturity for both populations, and most of the variation in the total number of seeds was explained by age and size at maturity. Only age at maturity had any effect on changes in resource allocation. The nine life history traits were integrated through associated character expressions with age and size at maturity. Changes in the association between a trait and age and/or size at maturity were rather conservative compared to changes in the plasticity of a trait between the two populations. Associations with age and size at maturity are mostly explicable in terms of inherent relationships in the developmental processes, and they may limit the ecological range expansion and the adaptive evolution of plasticity in C. flexuosa. The negative correlation between reproductive allocation and age at maturity can be a cost of delaying maturation in C. flexuosa.

VL  - 15
IS  - 3
SP  - 289-296
AB  - 1. Thermal adaptation was investigated in the fruitfly Drosophila buzzatii Patterson and Wheeler. Two natural populations originating from a high- and a low-temperature environment, respectively, were compared with respect to Hsp70 (heat shock protein) expression, knock-down resistance and heat shock resistance. 2. Three main hypotheses were tested: (i) The expression level of Hsp70 in flies from the high-temperature habitat should be down-regulated relative to flies from the colder habitat. (ii) Flies having higher Hsp70 expression levels should be weakened most by a hardening treatment and go faster into coma, as Hsp70 level reflects stress intensity, and therefore display reduced heat knock-down resistance. (iii) Heat shock resistance should be increased in the population with highest Hsp70 expression because the level of Hsp70 is positively associated with this trait. 3. The results generally matched the hypotheses. Hsp70 expression was reduced in the high-temperature population. Knock-down resistance was higher in the high-temperature population and survival after heat shock was lower in the high-temperature population. 4. This study showed genetic differences in thermal tolerance between populations, indicating that high temperature in nature may be an important selective factor. Moreover, knock-down resistance in this study seems to be a more relevant trait than standard heat shock resistance for identifying thermal adaptation in natural populations.

TI  - r-and K-selection in soil ciliates: a field and experimental approach
VL  - 66
IS  - 4
SP  - 574-579
AB  - Previously published field studies have suggested that the concept of r/K selection may be applied to terrestrial ciliates. A census was taken of the dominant groups, the Colpodea and Polyhymenophora, to determine species composition and absolute abundances in climatically unpredictable alpine and predictable lowland sites. In addition, two typical representatives of each of the two taxa (Colpoda aspera and Grossglockneria acuta, and Blepharisma undulans and Gonostomum affine, respectively) were selected for examination under laboratory conditions. Variables investigated were: the C/P index (ratio of Colpodea to Polyhymenophora), fertility, tolerance of altered environmental conditions, incidence in predictable or unpredictable biotopes, opportunism, competitive ability, and body size. Our own observations were supplemented by reference to the literature. The field census produced a higher C/P index in the unpredictable sites than in the predictable ones. The experiments show that C. aspera and G. acuta are less sensitive to changes in temperature and exhibit a more rapid rise in individual density as well as a higher number of individuals than do B. undulans and G. affine, although the former species have longer generation times at low temperatures. The explosive increase in number of individuals can be ascribed to the special reproductive strategy of the Colpodea (quadripartition in cysts). These results imply that the Colpodea are more r-selected as compared with the Polyhymenophora. That might be an explanation for their wide distribution and high density in unfavourable terrestrial habitats. © 1985 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - X chromosomes and autosomes evolve at similar rates in Drosophila: No evidence for faster-X protein evolution
VL  - 16
IS  - 4
SP  - 498-504
AB  - Recent data from Drosophila suggest that a substantial fraction of amino acid substitutions observed between species are beneficial. If these beneficial mutations are on average partially recessive, then the rate of protein evolution is predicted to be faster for X-linked genes compared to autosomal genes (the "faster-X" hypothesis). We test this prediction by comparing rates of protein substitutions between orthologous genes, taking advantage of variations in chromosome fusions within the genus Drosophila. In members of the Drosophila melanogaster species group, the chromosomal arm 3L segregates as an ordinary autosome (i.e., two homologous copies in both males and females). However, in the Drosophila pseudoobscura species group, this chromosomal arm has become fused to the ancestral X chromosome and is hemizygous in males. The faster-X hypothesis predicts that protein evolution should be faster for genes on this chromosomal arm in the D. pseudoobscura lineage, relative to the D. melanogaster lineage. Here we combine new sequence data for 202 gene fragments in Drosophila miranda (in the pseudoobscura species group) with the completed genomes of D. melanogaster, D. pseudoobscura, and Drosophila yakuba to show that there are no detectable differences in rates of amino acid evolution for orthologous X-linked and autosomal genes. Our results imply that the contribution of the faster-X (if any) to the large-X effect on reproductive isolation in Drosophila is not due to a generally faster rate of protein evolution. The lack of a detectable faster-X effect in these species suggests either that beneficial amino acids are not partially recessive on average, or that adaptive evolution does not often use newly arising amino acid mutations. ©2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - The contribution of new mutations to genotype-environment interaction for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 50
IS  - 6
SP  - 2316-2327
AB  - Many studies have documented the existence of genotype-environment interaction (GEI) for traits closely related to fitness in natural populations. A type of GEI that is commonly observed is changes in the fitness ranking of genetic groups (families, clones, or inbred lines) in different environments. We refer to such changes in ranking as crossing of reaction norms for fitness. A common interpretation of crossing of reaction norms for fitness is that selection favors different alleles in the different environments (i.e., that ''trade-offs'' exist). If this is the case, selection could maintain genetic variation, and even lead to reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different environments. Even if the stunt alleles are favored in every environment, however, deleterious mutations that vary in the magnitude of their effect depending on environment could cause reaction norms for fitness to cross. If deleterious mutations with environment-dependent effects are responsible for maintaining much of the Variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness in natural populations, it should be possible to observe crossing of reaction norms for fitness among otherwise genetically identical lines bearing newly arisen spontaneous mutations. We examined the contribution of new mutations to GEI for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. Eighteen lines were derived from a common, highly inbred base stock, and maintained at a population size of 10 pairs far over 200 generations, to allow them to accumulate spontaneous mutations. Because of the small population size of the lines, selection against mildly deleterious mutations should have been relatively ineffective. The lines were tested for productivity (number of surviving adult progeny from a standard number of parents) in five different environmental treatments, comprising different food media, temperatures, and levels of competition. The lines showed highly significant GEI for productivity, owing largely to considerable changes in ranking in the different environments. We conclude that mutations that are deleterious on average, but whose quantitative effects depend on environment, could be responsible for maintaining much of the Variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness that has been observed in samples of D. melanogaster from the wild.

AB  - Treatment of Drosophila melanogaster adults with an inhibitor of protein synthesis led to a decrease in intrinsic cold-shock tolerance, but no difference in the rapid cold hardening response, which is apparent only if a period at 4 degreesC precedes the cold stress. Increases in energy reserves, including proline, were found in lines of flies selected for resistance to chilling injury. Since an increase in proline levels has been associated with overwintering in insects, and for salt and cold tolerance in plants, an RNase protection assay was developed to assess changes in transcript abundance for two genes encoding enzymes important for proline metabolism, pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase and proline oxidase. The mRNA levels did not change in response to low temperature, but the high level of pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase transcript is consistent with the interpretation that a large proline pool is important for Drosophila metabolism and survival during cold stress.

VL  - 73

SP  - 4834-4845
AB  - Like many bacterial pathogens, Neisseria gonorrhoeae must adapt to environmental changes in order to successfully colonize and proliferate in a new host. Modulation of gene expression in response to environmental signals is an efficient mechanism used by bacteria to achieve this goal. Using DNA microarrays and a tissue culture model for gonococcal infection, we examined global changes in gene expression in N. gonorrhoeae in response to adherence to host cells. Among those genes induced upon adherence to human epithelial cells in culture was rpoH, which encodes a homolog of the heat shock sigma factor, σ32 (RpoH), as well as genes of the RpoH regulon, groEL and groES. Attempts to construct an rpoH null mutant in N. gonorrhoeae were unsuccessful, suggesting that RpoH is essential for viability of N. gonorrhoeae. The extracytoplasmic sigma factor, RpoE (σE), while known to regulate rpoH in other bacteria, was found not to be necessary for the up-regulation of rpoH in gonococci upon adherence to host cells. To examine the role of RpoH in host cell interactions, an N. gonorrhoeae strain conditionally expressing rpoH was constructed. The results of our experiments showed that while induction of rpoH expression is not necessary for adherence of gonococci to epithelial cells, it is important for the subsequent invasion step, as gonococci depleted for rpoH invade cells two- to threefold less efficiently than a wild-type strain. Taken together, these results indicate that σ32, but not σE, is important for the response of gonococci in the initial steps of an infection. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 254

AB  - A 2D multilayered model has been considered to estimate the transient evolution of temperature and pressure perturbations in multi-disk clutches and brakes during operation. The model proposed by Decuzzi et al. [1] has been modified here to estimate the variation of b-perturbation growth rate-with V-relative sliding speed. It has been verified that the perturbation with the lowest critical speed has also the highest growth rate, and that low frequency perturbations are less critical than high frequency perturbations, at fixed critical speed. Therefore, when comparing perturbations with identical critical speed, those with higher wave numbers are responsible for more intense thermomechanical damages. Also, for perturbations with wave number smaller than the critical m(er), the temperature increases with m; vice versa for perturbations with wave number larger than mer the temperature decreases with m. A reduction in thickness ratio a(1)/a(2) between friction and metal disks has the effect of increasing the temperature and growth rate. An approximate formula for the temperature variation with time has been derived for a linearly decreasing engagement speed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Variations in morphological and life-history traits under extreme temperatures in Drosophila ananassae
VL  - 34
IS  - 2
SP  - 263-274
AB  - Using half-sib analysis, we analysed the consequences of extreme rearing temperatures on genetic and phenotypic variations in the morphological and life-history traits of Drosophila ananassae. Paternal half-sib covariance contains a relatively small proportion of the epistatic variance and lacks the dominance variance and variance due to maternal effect, which provides more reliable estimates of additive genetic variance. Experiments were performed on a mass culture population of D. ananassae collected from Kanniyakumari (India). Two extremely stressful temperatures (18A degrees C and 32A degrees C) and one standard temperature (25A degrees C) were used to examine the effect of stressful and non-stressful environments on the morphological and life-history traits in males and females. Mean values of various morphological traits differed significantly among different temperature regimens in both males and females. Rearing at 18A degrees C and 32A degrees C resulted in decreased thorax length, wing-to-thorax (w/t) ratio, sternopleural bristle number, ovariole number, sex comb-tooth number and testis length. Phenotypic variances increased under stressful temperatures in comparison with non-stressful temperatures. Heritability and evolvability based on among-sires (males), among-dams (females), and the sum of the two components (sire + dam) showed higher values at both the stressful temperatures than at the non-stressful temperature. These differences reflect changes in additive genetic variance. Viability was greater at the high than the low extreme temperature. As viability is an indicator of stress, we can assume that stress was greater at 18A degrees C than at 32A degrees C in D. ananassae. The genetic variations for all the quantitative and life-history traits were higher at low temperature. Variation in sexual traits was more pronounced as compared with other morphometric traits, which shows that sexual traits are more prone to thermal stress. Our results agree with the hypothesis that genetic variation is increased in stressful environments.

TI  - Evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation in a localized butterfly
VL  - 67
IS  - 3
SP  - 485-497
AB  - 1. Theoretical studies of the costs and benefits of migration predict that evolutionary changes in dispersal traits may take place in response to habitat fragmentation. 2. For the butterfly Plebejus argus, we investigated five morphological characters potentially associated with flight ability, in locations that varied in level of habitat fragmentation. The traits were: total mass, relative thorax mass (containing flight muscle), relative abdomen mass (containing reproductive organs), relative wing area and wing aspect ratio. All characters were measured on individuals reared in a common environment. 3. Morphology was related to the level of habitat fragmentation in both limestone and heathland habitats. Total mass increased with decreasing heathland habitat area lover the range 13 000-10 ha). Relative allocation to the thorax increased, while allocation to the abdomen decreased, with declining limestone habitat area lover the range 3.5-0.2 ha). Morphological characters were not significantly correlated with habitat isolation. 4. Significant family effects for total mass, relative thorax mass, relative abdomen mass and (for females only) relative wing area indicate that these traits may have a heritable component, and therefore have the potential to respond to selection acting on flight ability. 5. We suggest that evolutionary changes in life history traits are taking place in response to changes in landscape structure: in P. argus, these traits may be influenced by the effects of mate-location strategy on emigration rates. Specific changes in traits can be complex, and may vary among species and populations. 6. P. argus had a 50% chance of occurring in heathland fragments of 33 ha, and was present on all heathlands above 50 ha, but population systems may not yet have achieved equilibrium. P. argus is unlikely to undertake major evolutionary changes in response to reduced habitat area in heathlands > 50 ha. Extinctions from smaller heathlands can be explained most plausibly by population/vegetation dynamics. Therefore, evolutionary changes in morphology may be more likely to be symptomatic of populations with altered costs and benefits of migration, rather than to be a direct cause of extinction.

VL  - 266

SP  - 2195-2200
AB  - The low initial fitness of progeny from interspecific crosses in animals and the rarity of interspecific hybridization in natural environments have led to a debate about the evolutionary importance of this phenomenon. Here we directly assess the effects of hybridization between Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii on evolutionary rates. We looked at the effects on laboratory adaptation over 30 generations in two laboratory environments, one of which involved nutrition and temperature stress. Laboratory adaptation occurred over time in both environments as reflected by a marked change in viability. However, whilst hybrid lines at no stage performed poorly relative to parental lines, their rate of adaptation never exceeded that of the parentals. Thus, there was no evidence that hybridization increased evolutionary rates. Instead, hybrid lines converged phenotypically with one of the parental species.

VL  - 223
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-44
AB  - Feedback between life and its environment is ubiquitous but the strength of coupling and its global implications remain hotly debated. Abrupt changes in the abundance of life for small changes in forcing provide one indicator of regulation, for example, when vegetation-climate feedback collapses in the formation of a desert. Here we use a two-dimensional "Daisyworld" model with curvature to show that catastrophic collapse of life under gradual forcing provides a testable indicator of environmental feedback. When solar luminosity increases to a critical value, a desert forms across a wide band of the planet. The scale of collapse depends on the strength of feedback. The efficiency of temperature regulation is limited by mutation rate in an analogous manner to the limitation of adaptive fitness in evolutionary theories. The final state of the system emerging from single-site rules can be described by two global quantities: optimization of temperature regulation and maximization of diversity, which are mathematically analogous to energy and entropy in thermodynamics.

AB  - In this paper we describe "extremophiles" and "survivophiles" and consider their role in the continuity and perpetuity of life throughout Earth's turbulent history. The term "extremophiles" refers to organisms active in what are considered by human beings to be extreme physical or chemical environments. The term "survivophiles" collectively refers to organisms capable of assuming reversible inactive states (suspended or latent), which enable them to survive harsh conditions until what they consider hospitable conditions to metabolic activity return. We present the various biological states of individual organisms (active, inactive, transition) and how these states relate to the dynamic biological-physical-chemical context that makes up an organism's environment. We argue that within these states the special adaptations of extremophiles and survivophiles have allowed life as a phenomenon to withstand global catastrophes, which include massive volcanic eruptions, supernovae explosions, and asteroid impacts. These are the catastrophes that changed the environments on Earth too quickly for organisms to adapt by Darwinian evolution. We suggest that genetic adaptations of extremophiles both allow them to thrive under at least some of the harsh conditions caused by catastrophes and these same adaptations also make them a source of genetic information for intrinsically stable macromolecules. This genetic information for stable macromolecules can be shared with other organisms through lateral gene transfer. Similarly, the adaptations of survivophiles increase survival during catastrophes and provide a source of genes for bio-stabilizing molecules (e.g., heat shock proteins, trehalose and other organic solutes). We conclude that the strategies and the specialized genes for growth and survival of extremophiles and survivophiles impact the continuity and perpetuity of life during global catastrophes by expanding the range of possible réfugia during these events and by providing genetic information to other organisms.

TI  - Keeping pace with fast climate change: Can Arctic life count on evolution?
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
SP  - 140-151
AB  - Adaptations to the cold and to short growing seasons characterize arctic life, but climate in the Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate. Will plant and animal populations of the Arctic be able to cope with these drastic changes in environmental conditions? Here we explore the potential contribution of evolution by natural selection to the current response of populations to climate change. We focus on the spring phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades. We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes. However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from contemporary evolution.

TI  - Adaptive radiation in sand-burrowing amphipod crustaceans
VL  - 11
IS  - 3
SP  - 143-154
AB  - Over millenia of geological history, the highly oxygenated, unstable substratum of wave-exposed intertidal sands has been a physically harsh environment and a challenge to survival for animal life attempting to utilize its relatively rich planktonic and interstitial nutrient resources. The Atlantic Ocean originated presumably in the late Mesozoic, yet since that time, certain endemic groups of gammaridean amphipod crustaceans of different feeding and reproductive morphology and behavior have apparently developed, convergently, two main types of fossorial body form necessary to survival in this environment. The obligate-sand-burrowing subfamilies Pontoporeiinae and Haustoriinae (family Haustoriidae) illustrate the phenomenon of adaptive radiation within these two body forms. The wide-bodied hydraulic-tunnelling subfamily Haustoriinae contains eight distinct genera of which seven genera and approximately 28 known species occur (many sympatrically) along the non-tropical North American Atlantic coast. The species occupy definitive but somewhat overlapping niches of the sandy beach environment. Analysis of amphipod feeding morphology and distribution in the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions indicates that (1) filter-feeding and reproductive mechanisms are most specialized within the Haustoriinae; (2) the most specialized haustoriin species inhabit the highest intertidal and most landward estuarine environments; (3) evolution and adaptive radiation are proceeding most fully and rapidly in warmtemperate (southern) parts of the subfamily range; and (4) the Haustoriinae may be replacing the more primitive and less specialized colder-water Pontoporeiinae in regions from which the former is now excluded by ecological and distributional barriers. © 1970 Estuarine Research Federation.

VL  - 62

SP  - 435-448
AB  - Liolaemus elongatus and Phymaturus patagonicus are viviparous lizards syntopic in the rock promontories of the and Patagonia exposed to seasonal extremes, short activity seasons and long submergence periods. L. elongatus is a slender lizard mainly heliothermic, which occupies a variety of microhabitats and has a widespread distribution. P. patagonicus, instead is a tigmotherm and flat body lizard which lives only in the clefts of rock promontories and has a restricted distribution to the north west Patagonia. In the present work, the field and selected body temperature and their thermal tolerance are explored. L. elongatus shows a higher plasticity than P. patagonicus in the use of the microhabitats, the heat acquisition, and the activity timetables. However both species show low field and selected body temperature compared to most lizards (30 degrees C). These results reinforce the hypothesis between reproduction and body temperature postulated by previous works on reproductive biology of both species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 10

SP  - 1135-1145
AB  - Predicting the spread of invasive species is a challenge for modern ecology. Although many invasive species undergo genetic bottlenecks during introduction to new areas resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, successful invaders manage to flourish in novel environments either because of pre-adaptations or because important traits contain adaptive variation enabling rapid adaptation to changing conditions. To predict and understand invasion success, it is crucial to analyse these features. We assessed the potential of a well-known invader, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), to expand north of its current range in Europe. A short growing season and harsh overwintering conditions are apparent limiting factors for this species' range. By rearing full-sib families from four geographically distinct populations (Russia, Estonia, Poland, Italy) at two fluctuating temperature regimes, we investigated (a) possible differences in survival, development time, and body size among populations and (b) the amount of adaptive variation within populations in these traits. All populations were able to complete their development in cooler conditions than in their current range. A significant genotype-environment interaction for development time and body size suggests the presence of adaptive genetic variation, indicating potential to adapt to cooler conditions. The northernmost population had the highest survival rates and fastest development times on both temperature regimes, suggesting pre-adaptation to cooler temperatures. Other populations had minor differences in development times. Interestingly, this species lacks the classical trade-off between body size and development time which could have contributed to its invasion potential. This study demonstrates the importance of considering both ecological and evolutionary aspects when assessing invasion risk. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

I gave then? two types of artificial food pellets which were different in energy content per weighs in 6 conditions of air temperature. Total energy intake of macaques increased as temperature decreased Intake of low quality pellets increased significantly with decreasing temperature in 3 of 4 subjects. The other macaque, whose food intake was almost constant, decreased his body weight as ambient temperature decreased. These results suggest that energy requirements of macaques change with temperature as a result of changes in energy required for ther thermoregulation. Moreover temperature influenced the selectivity of lower quality food. I discuss the pattern of food selection found in this experiment from the view-point of optimal foraging strategy.

AB  - Starvation resistance (SR) is an important trait for survival of insects in the wild. We used recombinant inbred lines (RIL) to search for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in crosses between intercontinental inbred lines that were originally selected for heat-knockdown resistance. SR was measured as the time of survival under repeated events of starvation. SR was consistently higher in females than in males. Composite interval mapping identified one QTL region (cytological range 64D-66E2) on the left arm of chromosome 3 in males, and no QTL was found in females. Many candidate genes that were identified in previous studies of QTL for stress resistance are included within this QTL region. The QTL-allele that decreased SR was found in the line originating from the colder population (Denmark). We discuss our results with regard to multiple candidate genes, noncolocalization with thermotolerance QTL, and possible geographical variation. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

TI  - Thermal biology of Phymaturus lizards: evolutionary constraints or lack of environmental variation?
VL  - 112

AB  - Several aspects of the biology of Phymaturus lizards including their herbivorous diet, specialized microhabitat use, and viviparous reproductive mode are highly conserved within the group. Here, we explore two aspects of Phymaturus thermal biology and test for the co-evolution among aspects of the thermal biology in these lizards, such as thermal preferenda and critical temperatures. Secondly, we explore correlations among variation in thermal biology with elevation and latitude. To do so, we used phylogenetically based comparative analyses (PCM) together with conventional statistics. Our results show that thermal biology for Phymaturus is conservative and our data do not suggest the co-evolution of thermal variables. Moreover, we detected low levels of variation in the thermal parameters studied, and no clear relationships between climatic and thermal variables. As a significant association between climatic and thermal variables could be demonstrated for a set of syntopic Liolaemus lizards, we suggest that thermal biology in Phymaturus lizards may be evolutionarily or ecologically constrained.

VL  - 4

SP  - 223-233
AB  - Aging research in vertebrates is hampered by the lack of short-lived models. Annual fishes of the genus Nothobranchius live in East African seasonal ponds. Their life expectancy in the wild is limited by the duration of the wet season and their lifespan in captivity is also short. Nothobranchius are popular aquarium fishes and many different species are kept as captive strains, providing rich material for comparative studies. The present paper aims at reviving the interest in these fishes by reporting that: (1) Nothobranchius can be cultured, and their eggs stored dry at room temperature for months or years, offering inexpensive methods of embryo storage; (2) Nothobranchius show accelerated growth and expression of aging biomarkers at the level of histology and behaviour; (3) the species Nothobranchius furzeri has a maximum lifespan of only 3 months and offers the possibility to perform investigations thus far unthinkable in a vertebrate, such as drug screening with life-long pharmacological treatments and experimental evolution; (4) when the lifespan of different species is compared, a general correlation is found between wet season duration in their natural habitat and longevity in captivity; and (5) vertebrate aging-related genes, such as p66Shc and MTP, can be easily isolated in Nothobranchius by homology cloning. These fishes can become excellent models for aging studies. They can be employed to test the effects of experimental manipulation on aging at a pace comparable with that of Drosophila and to probe the effects of natural selection on the evolution of aging-related genes. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland 2005.

VL  - 60

AB  - Many techniques commonly used by herpetologists for monitoring amphibian populations and communities yield censuses of the total adult population size (N). However, for many studies, e.g., of reproductive output, development of populations and potential for evolutionary changes, the effective population size (N-a) must be known. While modern molecular techniques make it possible to measure N-e, they are expensive, work-intensive and may not be possible or necessary for many questions on amphibian reproduction. For females of two species of water frog (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta), we investigate the effectiveness of several techniques to determine the presence or absence of eggs. The direct methods are (1) dissection of dead frogs and (2) a small skin incision into the abdominal side of live females. The indirect methods, all applied to live frogs, include (3) visual inspection of body shape, (4) tactile inspection of the epidermis, (5) transillumination with a strong cold light source, (6) ultrasound, (7) electromagnetic measurement of total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC), (8) calculation of body condition index and (9) analysis of blood plasma testosterone titers. Only two indirect methods were somewhat successful at predicting whether females were gravid. Testosterone titers (9) yielded the best results (ca. 80-90% effective). Body condition (8) was also significantly related to egg presence or absence, but predicted gravidity only weakly. We suggest that a combination of skin incision and hormone analysis provides a fairly good estimate of gravidity. When complemented by mark-recapture techniques and performed on the same individuals at different times of the season, this combination yields estimates not only of the reproductive output of the study population but also of the relative contribution of different females.

VL  - 83

SP  - 228-237
AB  - Hatchling Sceloporus occidentalis from northern populations (central Oregon) grow more slowly than hatchlings from southern populations (southern California) in nature. In this study, I determine whether this difference in growth rate results from differences in thermal environment and/or in thermoregulatory behavior. To determine the degree to which the thermal environment affects growth rate among populations, I reared hatchings from the northern and southern populations in a cycling thermal regime in one of three experimental treatments differing in access to radiant heat (6, 9, or 12 h radiant heat; remainder of 24 h at 15°C). I also measured the body temperature that each individual voluntarily selected over the course of the daily activity cycle. Growth rate varied positively with duration of access to radiant heat. Within the three treatments, individual growth rate was positively correlated with body temperature. Moreover, the difference in growth rate between the northern and southern populations was due in part to differences in behavior - individuals from northern populations selected lower body temperatures. I found that significant variation in body temperature was associated with family membership, suggesting that thermal physiology has a genetic basis. Moreover, growth rate was correlated with body temperature among families in each population suggesting a genetic correlation underlies the phenotypic correlations. Thus, genetically based variation in thermal physiology contributes to differences in growth rate among individuals within a population as well as to differences among populations. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Based on temperature measurements made on the coke cake during pushing, the COTHERM system developed by C. R. M. allows the detection and correction of heating heterogeneities, on one hand, and, on the other, to follow the evolution of the thermal level of the ovens. Non-uniform heating can be demonstrated, in particular, by comparing the temperature of a given flue with that of the oven, or else the mean temperature of a given oven with that of the battery. This control system, used industrially with success for more than three years at COCKERILL-SAMBRE - Marchienne, allowed the operating conditions in the COPPEE 1 battery to be improved, and, as a result, to limit the non-uniformities of temperature distribution and their detrimental effects on coke quality, energy consumption, battery productivity and even, on the environment.

TI  - Thermodynamical interpretation of an adaptive walk on a Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape: Einstein relation-like formula holds in a stochastic evolution
VL  - 225
IS  - 2
SP  - 215-228
AB  - We have theoretically studied the statistical properties of adaptive walks (or hill-climbing) on a Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape in the multi-dimensional sequence space through mathematical analysis and computer simulation. The adaptive walk is characterized by the "mutation distance" d as the step-width of the walker and the "population size" N as the number of randomly generated d-fold point mutants to be screened. In addition to the fitness W, we introduced the following quantities analogous to thermodynamical concepts: "free fitness" G(W) drop W + T x S(W), where T is the "evolutionary temperature" T proportional to rootd/lnN and S(W) is the entropy as a function of W, and the "evolutionary force" X drop d(G(W)/T)/dW, that is caused by the mutation and selection pressure. It is known that a single adaptive walker rapidly climbs on the fitness landscape up to the stationary state where a "mutation-selection-random drift balance" is kept. In our interpretation, the walker tends to the maximal free fitness state, driven by the evolutionary force X. Our major findings are as follows: First, near the stationary point W*, the "climbing rate" J as the expected fitness change per generation is described by J approximate to L x X with L approximate to V/2, where V is the variance of fitness distribution on a local landscape. This simple relationship is analogous to the well-known Einstein relation in Brownian motion. Second, the "biological information gain" (DeltaG/T) through adaptive walk can be described by combining the Shannon's information gain (DeltaS) and the "fitness information gain" (DeltaW/T).

TI  - Evolutionary optimized mold temperature control strategies using a multi-polyline approach
VL  - 2610
SP  - 374-383
AB  - During the machining process the tools for pressure and injection molding have to keep an optimal working temperature. This temperature depends on the workpiece material and allows a safe, efficient and precise machining process. The compact and very expensive steel molds are penetrated with deep hole drilling bores that are combined to form mold temperature control circuits. Today the structure of these circuits are designed manually. Here, a new automatic layout system for mold temperature control strategies is introduced which uses a multiobjective fitness function. The circuits are encoded via a polyline approach. The complex optimization problem is solved using a variation of the evolution strategy. The evolutionary approach as well as first results of the system will be discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Virucidal properties of sunlight and temperature have been identified for a long time. However, it is less well established if virioplankton communities are evenly susceptible or geographically adapted to these environmental factors. Transplant experiments were conducted between a tropical (Senegal) and temperate (France) site to examine the effect of natural daylight conditions and temperature on the persistence of free viruses in water. Fresh- and seawater viruses from both countries were simultaneously subjected to 12 h of full sunlight and dark exposure under their native and "transplanted" latitudes. Consistently, viruses decayed much faster when incubated abroad, regardless of origin (latitude and/or water type). However, viral losses, in most cases, were not significantly different between sunlight exposed and dark samples, implying that ambient radiation does not exert strong negative effects on virioplankton particles. Rather, temperature clearly emerged as the principal determinant of viral survival in all samples. This suggests that viruses, under local temperature, can adapt through an evolutionary process to survive for longer periods of time thus increasing their chances to encounter their hosts.

TI  - The race goes to the swift: Fitness consequences of variation in sprint performance in juvenile lizards
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-75
AB  - Locomotor performance is a fundamental link between an animal and its environment. Considerable evidence has accumulated about the biomechanical, physiological and morphological causes of variation in sprint speed and endurance in animals. Yet little information is available about the ecological role of locomotion and its relationship to fitness. This is largely due to the difficulty of acquiring survivorship data in known demographic populations. To address the selective significance of locomotor performance, I estimated the covariation between sprint speed and survivorship of juveniles in a population of the lizard., Urosaurus ornatus. Selection analyses based on mark-recapture data revealed significant directional selection for burst velocity and stride length. Faster lizards with longer stride lengths realized a survival advantage over slower lizards regardless of size. Significant non-linear selection was detected on initial velocity and mean velocity. The selection surface for initial velocity was concave up, hence juveniles with intermediate values for initial velocity had lower fitness. Conversely, the selection surface for mean velocity was concave down, thus juveniles with intermediate values for mean velocity had higher survivorship. I hypothesize that the differences in sprint performance influence prey capture and predator escape. Faster lizards may also select warmer microhabitats during favourable conditions, which may enhance growth rates but entail higher risks of predation.

VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SP  - 99-105
AB  - Squamate viviparity has evolved on several occasions, and probably independently within the genus Liolaemus itself. Hypotheses about the origin of reptilian viviparity emphasize the advantage of providing an adequate thermal environment for the embryo. At the same time, high latitudes and altitudes limit the availability of heat to perform vitellogenesis and gestation. The genus Liolaemus includes both oviparous and viviparous modes of reproduction, as well as reproductive cycles with great variations in the timing of the events. In the present work maximum juvenile size, sexual dimorphism, gonadal cycle and litter size of viviparous Liolaemus elongatus were studied. Female lizards may have annual or biennial cycles, but males reproduce annually in synchronization with the female cycle. Phenotypic plasticity may be one way that allows the species to cope with environmental constraints, and may be a reproductive adaptation that Liolaemus has evolved in response to the the cold climate in the highlands of southern South America.

VL  - 258
IS  - 1353
SP  - 221-227
AB  - We have studied the relative fitnesses of three genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in 50 environments. Two genotypes, the MA lines, had accumulated mutations in the absence of natural selection over 62 generations. The third was a related strain where selection had continued to act. The environments differed in three factors: parental density, dilution of the medium, and the temperature regime and medium composition. Our measure of fitness assessed fecundity and viability relative to a reference genotype. Both MA lines always had lower fitnesses than the selected line, but the difference increased dramatically with dilution of the medium and, especially, crowding. Under the most severe conditions, the performance of the MA lines approached 0. This increased difference in harsh conditions may be caused both by a uniform increase in the magnitude of deleterious effects of all mutations and by the exposure of mutations which are essentially neutral under benign conditions. If the second cause is important, previous experiments are likely to have underestimated the genomic deleterious mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster more than previously thought.

AB  - A typical industrial thermal processing operation has multifold complexity, with varying charge dimensions, multiple grades and inconsistent loading patterns as well as the absence of in situ sensors. These operational characteristics and restrictions invariably lead to empirical design for the temperature time cycles, which often results in suboptimal operation in terms of higher energy consumption, inconsistent quality and lower productivity. In the present work, a process model is proposed for designing the heating cycles for bundles of packed rods with different rod diameters, bundle diameters and packing fractions in a continuous annealing furnace. The process model has the capability of predicting spatial and temporal evolution of temperature and hardness in the bundle as it traverses through the furnace. Interestingly, the model based process cycles are found to be counterintuitive as compared with the empirically designed cycles normally employed in the plant. It is shown that instead of designing the process cycles on the basis of rod diameters, which is the general practice in the plant, it should be based on bundle characteristics, such as bundle diameter and packing fraction. These concepts have been implemented in an industrial operation resulting in around 20% energy reduction and 15% productivity enhancement. © 2007 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

VL  - 7

SP  - 335-348
AB  - DNA microarray was used as a tool to define the heat- and cold-shock stimulons in Yersinia pestis. Heat shock dramatically enhanced the transcription of genes encoding major heat-shock proteins (MHSPs) that are important for cell survival against the heat. Many other genes were also greatly up-regulated, but their roles in heat-shock response need to be elucidated. Meanwhile, heat shock retarded most of the metabolic processes, i.e. RNA transcription, protein translation, aerobic respiration, energy metabolism, small molecule metabolism, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, sulfate uptake and cysteine biosynthesis. In response to cold shock, Y. pestis has evolved complex adaptive mechanisms by elevating the transcription of a specific set of genes whose protein products are designed to prevent or eliminate cold-induced DNA or RNA structuring, to remodel cell membrane components for maintenance of normal functions, to elevate the energy generation for ensuring ATP-dependent responses during cold adaptation and to synthesize or transport compatible solutes such as cryoprotectants, and at the same time, by repressing the mRNA level of certain genes whose protein products are not needed for bacterial growth at low temperatures, such as the MHSPs. These results provide a set of new candidate genes for hypothesis-based investigations of their roles in stress response, host adaptation and pathogenicity of this deadly pathogen.

VL  - 27

SP  - 523-530
AB  - Of the major physical factors that influence insect seasonal ecology, moisture is least understood and least appreciated. It is our premise that experimental probing of insects from diverse zones and various habitats would reveal general patterns of insect responses to moisture that are as striking as those for photoperiod and temperature. Using the paradigms of photoperiod and temperature as ecophysiological determinants of insect seasonality, we hypothesize that moisture influences insect life cycles via one or more of three mechanisms - as a token stimulus for diapause, modulator of developmental or reproductive rates, or behavioral cue for vital seasonal events. For heuristic purposes, we offer each of these hypotheses in close association with approaches for testing their validity in insects that undergo dry-season dormancy. The approaches appear appropriate for examining the role of moisture in the life histories of terrestrial invertebrates other than insects, as well as plants and microbes that have a seasonal resting stage. Elucidating moisture's role in insect seasonal cycles is critical to the development of comprehensive phenological models, improved insect management systems, and identification of novel evolutionary mechanisms for adaptation to wet-dry seasons, especially in tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean regions.

VL  - 105
IS  - 35
SP  - 12944-12949
AB  - The antifreeze glycoprotein-fortified Antarctic notothenioid fishes comprise the predominant fish suborder in the isolated frigid Southern Ocean. Their ecological success undoubtedly entailed evolutionary acquisition of a full suite of cold-stable functions besides antifreeze protection. Prior studies of adaptive changes in these teleost fishes generally examined a single genotype or phenotype. We report here the genome-wide investigations of transcriptional and genomic changes associated with Antarctic notothenioid cold adaptation. We sequenced and characterized 33,560 ESTs from four tissues of the Antarctic notothenioid Dissostichus mawsoni and derived 3,114 nonredundant protein gene families and their expression profiles. Through comparative analyses of same-tissue transcriptome profiles of D. mawsoni and temperate/tropical teleost fishes, we identified 177 notothenioid protein families that were expressed many fold over the latter, indicating cold-related up-regulation. These up-regulated gene families operate in protein biosynthesis, protein folding and degradation, lipid metabolism, antioxidation, antiapoptosis, innate immunity, choriongenesis, and others, all of recognizable functional importance in mitigating stresses in freezing temperatures during notothenioid life histories. We further examined the genomic and evolutionary bases for this expressional up-regulation by comparative genomic hybridization of DNA from four pairs of Antarctic and basal non-Antarctic notothenioids to 10,700 D. mawsoni cDNA probes and discovered significant to astounding (3-to >300-fold, P < 0.05) Antarctic-specific duplications of 118 protein-coding genes, many of which correspond to the up-regulated gene families. Results of our integrative tripartite study strongly suggest that evolution under constant cold has resulted in dramatic genomic expansions of specific protein gene families, augmenting gene expression and gene functions contributing to physiological fitness of Antarctic notothenioids in freezing polar conditions. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

TI  - Covariation of Larval Gene Expression and Adult Body Size in Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 20
IS  - 11
SP  - 1760-1766
AB  - Understanding adaptive phenotypic variation is one of the most fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. Genes involved in adaptation are most likely those that affect traits most intimately connected to fitness: life-history traits. The genetics of quantitative trait variation (including life histories) is still poorly understood, but several studies suggest that (1) quantitative variation might be the result of variation in gene expression, rather than protein evolution, and (2) natural variation in gene expression underlies adaptation. The next step in studying the genetics of adaptive phenotypic variation is therefore an analysis of naturally occuring covariation of global gene expression and a life-history trait. Here, we report a microarray study addressing the covariation in larval gene expression and adult body weight, a life-history trait involved in adaptation. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster show adaptive geographic variation in adult body size, with larger animals at higher latitudes. Conditions during larval development also affect adult size with larger flies emerging at lower temperatures. We found statistically significant differences in normalized larval gene expression between geographic populations at one temperature (genetic variation) and within geographic populations between temperatures (developmental plasticity). Moreover, larval gene expression correlated highly with adult weight, explaining 81% of its natural variation. Of the genes that show a correlation of gene expression with adult weight, most are involved in cell growth or cell maintenance or are associated with growth pathways.

AB  - Optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements at 9 K were performed on stoichiometric GaRGe2O7 and on R-doped LaGaGe2O7, R = Pr3+, Nd3+, polycrystalline samples. In this monoclinic matrix, space group P2(1)/c (no. 14), the lanthanide ion occupies a single crystallographic point site with symmetry C-1. From the crystal-held analysis of the optical spectra, energy level schemes and an expression of the associated wavefunctions for the 4f(2) and 4f(3) configurations were derived. In both cases, the fitting of experimental Stark level energies and the phenomenological calculation of free-ion as well as crystal-field parameters (CFPs) were performed for the approximate C-s (C-2) symmetry. Despite the low symmetry, very satisfactory correlations between experimental and simulated energy level schemes were obtained, with root mean square deviations sigma = 10.1 and 14.8 cm(-1) for pr(3+) and Nd3+, respectively. Energy levels and the composition of their wavefunctions were checked for both cofigurations through a calculation of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic susceptibility chi, according to the Van Vleck formula. The same calculation was accomplished with CFPs resulting from the semi-empirical simple overlap model (SOM), considering the real point symmetry of R and C-1. Over the whole measured range, 1.7-300 K, a very good reproduction of the observed chi vs. T is yielded by each of the phenomenological and SOM calculated collections of CFPs.

TI  - Molecular evolution in Panagrolaimus nematodes: Origins of parthenogenesis, hermaphroditism and the Antarctic species P. davidi
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Background. As exemplified by the famously successful model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, nematodes offer outstanding animal systems for investigating diverse biological phenomena due to their small genome sizes, short generation times and ease of laboratory maintenance. Nematodes in the genus Panagrolaimus have served in comparative development and anhydrobiosis studies, and the Antarctic species P. davidi offers a powerful paradigm for understanding the biological mechanisms of extreme cold tolerance. Panagrolaimus nematodes are also unique in that examples of gonochoristic, hermaphroditic and parthenogenetic reproductive modes have been reported for members of this genus. The evolutionary origins of these varying reproductive modes and the Antarctic species P. davidi, however, remain enigmatic. Results. We collected nuclear ribosomal RNA gene and mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences from diverse Panagrolaimus species and strains, including newly discovered isolates from Oregon, to investigate phylogenetic relationships in this nematode genus. Nuclear phylogenies showed that the species and strains historically identified as members of Panagrolaimus constitute a paraphyletic group, suggesting that taxonomic revision is required for Panagrolaimus and related nematode lineages. Strain-specific reproductive modes were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny to show a single origin of parthenogenesis from a presumably gonochoristic ancestor. The hermaphroditic strains were all placed outside a major monophyletic clade that contained the majority of other Panagrolaimus nematodes. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences showed that substantial molecular and geographic diversity exists within the clade of parthenogenetic strains. The Antarctic species P. davidi was found to be very closely related to two Panagrolaimus strains from southern California. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses suggested that P. davidi and the California strain PS1579 shared a common ancestor in the very recent evolutionary past. Conclusion. Our study provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the evolutionary origins and diversification patterns of varying reproductive modes within Panagrolaimus and important insights into the origin of the Antarctic species P. davidi. Panagrolaimus offers a powerful nematode model for understanding diverse evolutionary phenomena including the evolution of asexuality and the adaptive evolution of extreme cold tolerance. © 2009 Lewis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Physiological adaptations and the concepts of optimal reproductive strategy and physiological constraint in marine invertebrates
VL  - 39
SP  - 267-300
AB  - The dominant 'demographic' theory of life history evolution supposes that different lifetime patterns of reproduction are the result of selection of alternative optimal solutions for the allocation of limited resources between somatic and reproductive functions. A number of trade-off possibilities have been recognized--those between current reproductive output and residual reproductive value and between fecundity and initial offspring size being considered especially important. Many theoretical studies assume that natural selection will favour the adoption of optimal solutions, but it has been pointed out that such solutions may not be obtainable due to design constraints and the development of physiological adaptations to specific reproductive traits which limit subsequent evolutionary potential. The validity of this idea is examined in this paper through a review of the major reproductive strategies available to marine invertebrates and the physiological adaptations associated with them. The ecologically important distinction between planktotrophic and lecithotrophic development is not necessarily associated with major physiological adaptations in the adults, but the distinction between strictly semelparous and iteroparous life histories is. This is demonstrated in a survey of the endocrinological and environmental control of reproductive processes in related organisms with contrasting modes or reproduction. Particular reference is made to the Polychaeta, in which the contrast between semelparous and iteroparous life histories is particularly marked. A similar contrast is found between cephalopoda and other mollusca, and the discussion of physiological adaptations is extended to include these groups and the Echinodermata.

TI  - Variation, selection and evolution of function-valued traits
VL  - 112
SP  - 87-104
AB  - We describe an emerging framework for understanding variation, selection and evolution of phenotypic traits that are mathematical functions. We use one specific empirical example - thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rates of caterpillars - to demonstrate how models for function-valued traits are natural extensions of more familiar, multivariate models for correlated, quantitative traits. We emphasize three main points. First, because function-valued traits are continuous functions, there are important constraints on their patterns of variation that are not captured by multivariate models. Phenotypic and genetic variation in function-valued traits can be quantified in terms of variance-covariance functions and their associated eigenfunctions: we illustrate how these are estimated as well as their biological interpretations for TPCs. Second, selection on a function-valued trait is itself a function, defined in terms of selection gradient functions. For TPCs, the selection gradient describes how the relationship between an organism's performance and its fitness varies as a function of its temperature. We show how the form of the selection gradient function for TPCs relates to the frequency distribution of environmental states (caterpillar temperatures) during selection. Third, we can predict evolutionary responses of function-valued traits in terms of the genetic variance-covariance and the selection gradient functions. We illustrate how non-linear evolutionary responses of TPCs may occur even when the mean phenotype and the selection gradient are themselves linear functions of temperature. Finally, we discuss some of the methodological and empirical challenges for future studies of the evolution of function-valued traits.

TI  - Fitness effects of the timing of hatching may drive the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in short-lived lizards
VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 281-294
AB  - In several species of short-lived Australian agamid lizards, an individual's sex is determined by the nest temperatures encountered during incubation. The adaptive significance of such systems remains unclear. Here, we explore the hypothesis that (1) the optimal timing of hatching differs between the sexes, and thus (2) temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) enhances maternal and offspring fitness by generating seasonal shifts in offspring sex ratios. Our model predicts that TSD can indeed enhance maternal fitness returns in short-lived lizards if (1) male-male competition is intense, thus reducing mating success of newly-matured males (but not females), and (2) the nesting season is prolonged, such that seasonal effects become significant. Available data on the distribution of TSD in Australian agamid lizards broadly support these predictions. Because both the level of male-male competition and the length of nesting season can vary at small spatial and temporal scales, selective forces on sex-determining mechanisms also should vary. Hence, our model predicts extensive small-scale (intraspecific) variation in sex-determining systems within agamid lizards, as well as among species. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 62

AB  - A concept postulating that aging is a specific biological function that promotes the progressive evolution of sexually reproducing species is reviewed, Death caused by aging clears the population of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful traits. Like any other important function, aging is mediated by several molecular mechanisms working simultaneously. At least three such mechanisms have been postulated thus far: 1) telomere shortening due to suppression of telomerase at early stages of embryogenesis; 2) age-related activation of a mechanism that induces the synthesis of heat shock proteins in response to denaturing stimuli; and 3) incomplete suppression of generation and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS). None of these phenomena call kill the organism, but only weaken it, which becomes crucial under extreme conditions, This mechanism of age-induced death can be compensated for (within certain time limits) by several positive traits that greatly increase the evolutionary potential of species capable of performing this function. Similarly to apoptosis (programmed cell death), the programmed death of the body can be called "phenoptosis". Aging presumably belongs to the category of "soft" (extended in time and allowing a certain degree of compensation) phenoptosis, in contrast to "acute" phenoptosis; the death of salmon females immediately after spawning is a good example of the latter.
