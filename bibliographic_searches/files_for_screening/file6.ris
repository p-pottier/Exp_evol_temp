TI  - Influence of water activity on the heat resistance of Salmonella enterica in selected low-moisture foods
VL  - 334
AB  - Low-moisture foods (LMF with water activity, aw &lt; 0.85) including pet foods and black pepper powder have consistently been associated with foodborne disease caused by Salmonella enterica. Increased heat resistance and prolonged survival at low-moisture conditions, however, remain major challenges to achieve effective inactivation of Salmonella in low-moisture foods. At low water activity (aw) conditions, heat resistance of Salmonella is greatly enhanced when compared to high aw conditions. This study aimed to quantify the effect of aw on the heat resistance of Salmonella enterica in pet food pellets and black pepper powder. Pet food pellets were inoculated with two strains of heat resistant S. enterica and black pepper powder was inoculated with a 5-strain cocktail of Salmonella. Both inoculated food samples were equilibrated at 0.33, 0.54, and 0.75 aw in controlled humidity chambers. Inoculated pet food pellets and black pepper powder in closed aluminum cells were heat treated at specific temperatures for selected times. The results showed that the Weibull model fitted well the inactivation data. At a specific temperature, the rate of inactivation increased with the increase in the aw from 0.33 to 0.75, and the 3-log reduction times decreased for Salmonella in both food samples with the increase in aw. Water adsorption isotherms of pet food pellets and black pepper powder at initial and treatment temperatures were developed to understand the change in aw during heat treatments. The change in aw during heat treatment was dependent on the type of food matrix, which possibly influenced the thermal inactivation of Salmonella in pet food pellets and black pepper powder. The quantitative analysis of heat reduction of Salmonella with respect to aw aids in selection of the appropriate initial aw to develop effective heat treatment protocols for adequate reduction of Salmonella in pet foods and black pepper powder. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sunflower hybrids with high genetic potential for the seed yield, in different environmental conditions
VL  - 2020

SP  - 81-88
AB  - Sunflower breeders, working for a model of sunflower, must know the main characteristics of the environment for which they are developing the hybrids, starting from soil type, potential growing season length, mean, minimum and maximum temperatures (per month) and the amount and distribution of rainfall, during the year. The creation of hybrids with high potential of productivity, must take into consideration the high adaptive potential to the ecological environment. We studied a set of 18 sunflower hybrids, in two years (2018 and 2109), in four locations, situated in different areas of Romania: Cogealac (south Romania), Şimleu Silvaniei (western Romania), Negreşti (eastern Romania) and Mircea Vodă (south-eastern Romania). The hybrids were cultivated in two randomized replications. Comparing the two years, 2018 and 2019, regarding the air temperature and the amount of rainfall, in sunflower vegetation period, year 2018 was generally dryer, compared with 2019. Results showed that the seed yield for the eighteen hybrids was different by year and by location. In 2018 the difference between locations was not so high compared with 2019. The highest seed yield in 2019 was obtained by almost all hybrids, in two locations (Negreşti and Mircea Vodă). The lowest seed yield was obtained by all hybrids in Cogealac location, due to drought and also to the high infestation with broomrape parasite. © 2020, National Agricultural Research and Development Institute.

AB  - Global climate change may detrimentally affect future generations of numerous forest tree species, hampering their long-term sustainability if appropriate evolutionary responses remain lacking. To face these novel threats, conservation biologists are in need of a thorough understanding and identification of adaptive variation in key fitness traits. We here provide an elaborate synthesis of pre-existing and novel analyses of an association mapping, genecological and landscape genomic study integrating genotypic, environmental and phenotypic data to gain insights into the genetic basis of cold-hardiness adaptation in coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). Data were collected across part of the natural range for a total of 643 individuals. A landscape genomic approach revealed 28 putative non-neutral genes, although a variance partitioning analysis indicated only moderate power of this gene set in explaining cold-hardiness-related phenotypic variation, and suggests many important genes await discovery. Integrating these results within the entire phenotype-genotype-environment spectrum allowed us to delineate the six most promising candidate genes under selection. By combining genomic, phenotypic and environmental data, this study attempts to gain insights in the genetic basis of key adaptations, which may ultimately aid forestry managers to establish resilient ecosystems in face of future climate change. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 49

SP  - 1313-1326
AB  - Aim: The expansive spatial scale of pelagic communities and the difficulty in acquiring pelagic species' functional traits have stymied an understanding of marine community dynamics. We assembled and analysed a shark trait database and community phylogeny to identify the major axes of trait variation that define shark functional groups. We tested whether membership to biophysical macroecological strata is related to these functional or phylogenetic relationships. Location: Northeastern Pacific, 180–255°E and 0–50°N. Taxon: Sharks (Class: Chondrichthyes, superorder: Selachimorpha). Methods: We built a community phylogeny and collected habitat, reproductive, somatic growth, trophic and dentition traits. We used principal coordinates analyses to identify axes of trait variation and hierarchical clustering to classify functional groups. We tested whether functional or phylogenetic relatedness determined species' membership to strata from five macroecological gradients: latitude, habitat type, thermal, carbon source and bathymetry. Results: We assembled 38 traits from 1225 records from 130 sources, 260 pictographs from seven sources and 631 teeth from 79 jaw specimens. Life history, r versus K selection, was responsible for the biggest division in the functional dendrogram. Vertical habitat preference, growth rates, diet and dental morphology generated further divisions between r- or K-selected species. Vertical habitat preference, carbon source and biochemical habitat type were significantly dispersed or clustered on the functional dendrogram or phylogram. Main Conclusions: Habitat and reproductive traits were the most important trait suites driving shark functional diversity. Through ordination and clustering, we were able to associate major axes of trait variation to the membership of shark functional groups. The phylogram approximated well the functional dendrogram's backbone but was a poor substitute for the trait diversity at the tips. Given the long evolutionary history of sharks and coincident expansive trait diversity, merging functional and phylogenetic approaches was necessary to capture the dimensions of shark biodiversity. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 9

AB  - Pathogens can manipulate the phenotypic traits of their hosts and vectors, maximizing their own fitness. Among the phenotypic traits that can be modified, manipulating vector behavior represents one of the most fascinating facets. How pathogens infection affects behavioral traits of key insect vectors has been extensively investigated. Major examples include Plasmodium, Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp. manipulating the behavior of mosquitoes, sand flies and kissing bugs, respectively. However, research on how pathogens can modify tick behavior is patchy. This review focuses on current knowledge about the behavioral changes triggered by Anaplasma, Borrelia, Babesia, Bartonella, Rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in tick vectors, analyzing their potential adaptive significance. As a general trend, being infected by Borrelia and TBEV boosts tick mobility (both questing and walking activity). Borrelia and Anaplasma infection magnifies Ixodes desiccation resistance, triggering physiological changes (Borrelia: higher fat reserves; Anaplasma: synthesis of heat shock proteins). Anaplasma infection also improves cold resistance in infected ticks through synthesis of an antifreeze glycoprotein. Being infected by Anaplasma, Borrelia and Babesia leads to increased tick survival. Borrelia, Babesia and Bartonella infection facilitates blood engorgement. In the last section, current challenges for future studies are outlined. © 2020 by the author.

TI  - Cold adaptive potential of pine wood nematodes overwintering in plant hosts
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
AB  - The pine wood nematode (PWN; Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) is the causal agent of pine wilt disease, which results in severe ecological and economic losses in coniferous forests. During overwintering, PWNs undergo morphological and physiological changes to adapt to low temperature environments. Here, the physiological changes of the PWN populations sampled in the summer and winter were compared to analyze the role of low temperatures in their response. The PWN overwinters as third-stage dispersal juveniles, which showed significantly greater survival rates than summer populations (propagative forms) at sub-zero temperatures. The major biochemical compounds in the populations were analyzed by gas chromatography. Eight dominant fatty acids, with stearic acid being the most important, were identified from PWN propagative stage and third-stage dispersal stage. Compared with the propagative stage, the dispersal stage showed significant increases in the fatty acid content and the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Three carbohydrates, trehalose, glycerol and glucose, were detected in the PWN. Compared with the summer population, the levels of trehalose and glycerol increased significantly, while glucose decreased, in the winter population. The modifications in fatty acid composition and cryoprotectant levels, as elements of its changing physiology, play important roles in the overwintering success of the PWN. © 2019.

TI  - Fabrication of a near-infrared excitation surface molecular imprinting ratiometric fluorescent probe for sensitive and rapid detecting perfluorooctane sulfonate in complex matrix
VL  - 413
AB  - Construction of fluorescent probe for highly sensitive and selective detection of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in water and biological samples is a very important strategy in related pollutant monitoring and environmental health risk appraisal. To overcome the drawback of low sensitivity caused by high-back ground signal of the conventional sensor, a molecularly imprinted near-infrared excitation ratiometric fluorescent probe was constructed and employed to determine PFOS. The sensing process was achieved through the selectively recognition of specific cavities in the probe surface with analyte, accompanied by fluorescence quenching due to the photoinduced electron transfer effect between upconversion materials and PFOS. Under optimized experimental conditions, the fluorescence quenching efficiency of the probe has good linearity against the concentrations of PFOS response divided into two segments within linear ranges of 0.001–0.1 nmol/L and 0.1–1 nmol/L, respectively, with low detection limit of 1 pmol/L. Selective experiment results indicate that the C-F chain length plays a dominant role in molecular recognition and high sensitively detection. The fabricated probe shows well detection performance in a wide pH range. Furthermore, real samples analyses indicate that such an efficient fluorescent probe has potentials in PFOS determination in surface water, human serum and egg extract sample analyses. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land supplies multiple goods and services vital to humans and the environment. In the last decades, increasing evidence of growing land degradation are made apparent. A limited and depleting resource base, the reliance on climate-sensitive sectors and its large population, make South Asia highly vulnerable to climate change. Observed changes in climate include increases in temperature and increased monsoon variability and rainfall pattern leading to drought and flooding. Projected changes include increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, increasing cyclonic activity and higher variability of rainfall, all having enormous impacts on farming communities. At the same time, the region is rich in traditional agricultural knowledge (TAK), specialized in managing local agroecosystems to ensure food availability, tackling climatic risks and other ecological uncertainties. Particularly relevant is TAK related to land management to preserve soil fertility and avoid soil erosion. Ethnographic research is a valuable source of TAK, although this is rarely analysed with a climate change perspective. Based on a qualitative systematic review, and an expert's on-line survey, in this paper we review land management TAK and assess its potential for climate change adaptation. The review shows there is a vast amount of untapped TAK ethnographic research with potential for climate change adaptation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Climatic changes are posing serious threats to crop production and food insecurity across the globe. This study explores the dynamic relationship between changing annual temperature and production of major crops such as wheat, rice, bajra, jowar, maize, barley, gram, sugar cane, mastered oil, and cotton in Pakistan from 2000 to 2019 through an eclectic production model. The estimated result of panel econometric analysis revealed a significant negative effect of rising temperature on selected crop production in the long run with an insignificant impact in the short run. Among other explanatory variables, the area under cultivation and fertilizer input have significant positive effects in both the long run and the short run. Improved quality seeds revealed insignificant effects and urging authorities to enhance quality research to develop climate change resilient crops. This study urges Pakistan to improve agriculture technology along with adopting other greenhouse gas mitigation, such as forestation and clean energy, and water conservation policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Thermal preferences of two spider species: an orb-web weaver and a synanthropic funnel-web weaver
VL  - 88

SP  - 824-836
AB  - Temperature, an important factor in the ecological niche, determines the individual fitness, distribution and abundance of many spider species. Typically, spiders from different habitats have different thermal preferences, which vary depending on the season, time of day, and reproductive status. Selected temperatures may also depend on thermal acclimation of animals. The study aimed at determining preferred temperatures of females of two spider species, synanthropic Eratigena atrica and garden Araneus diadematus, exposed to low (14°C) and high (23°C) acclimation temperatures. The mean preferred temperature observed in a thermal gradient varied between the species: E. atrica selected 13.7 ± 1.0°C, while A. diadematus selected 22.5 ± 1.5°C, irrespective of the acclimation temperature. Accordingly, thermal niche overlaps between the species were significantly lower than predicted by the random distribution. E. atrica changed their thermal environment on average 12.8 ± 1.9 times during the test, which made them more mobile than A. diadematus, changing their thermal environment 2.7 ± 0.5 times. On the other hand, the thermal niche breadth of A. diadematus acclimated to warm temperature was wider than that of E. atrica. The female behaviour may be related to the selection of optimal conditions with regard to food availability (location for web construction), shelter and/or, in the case of E. atrica, embryonic development. © 2021 The Author(s).

The CSM-CROPGRO-Canola model was used to simulate the responses of canola to the projected climate change at Brandon on the Prairies, and West Nipissing and Normandin in eastern Canada. Future climate scenarios for the near (2041–2070) and distant (2071–2100) future under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were developed based on climate change simulations by a regional climate model CanRCM4. Seeding dates were estimated from air temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture to account for the potential of earlier seeding as an adaptation measure. Compared to the baseline climate, simulated seed yield reduction was 42, 21, and 24% in the near future and of 37, 27, and 23% in the distant future, under RCP4.5, respectively for Brandon, West Nipissing, and Normandin. A larger reduction was simulated under RCP8.5, especially in the distant future at Brandon and West Nipissing. The simulated seed yield reduction was associated with increases in heat and water stresses under rainfed conditions with current N fertilizer application rates. Coping with heat and water stresses is a big challenge for canola production in Canada under the projected climate change, especially on the Canadian Prairies. © 2018 by the American Society of Agronomy.

AB  - Global change already has a major impact on freshwater (reviews Woodward et al., 2010; Woolway et al., 2021) and marine ecosystems (reviews Molinos et al., 2016; Boyd et al., 2018), as witnessed by long term data series (Wiltshire et al., 2010; Boersma et al., 2016). Crustaceans represent one of the most species-rich groups both in our oceans and freshwater bodies and display a large diversity of sizes, morphologies, lifestyles, and life histories. Crustaceans representatives have colonized habitats extending from the deepest ocean trenches and hydrothermal vents, across the vast water bodies of the world's oceans, through intertidal and supratidal coastal habitats. They also inhabit anchihaline caves, inland freshwater ecosystems including endorheic lakes, and terrestrial habitats such as desert saltpans, epiphytic bromeliads in mountain forests, and rocky plateaus of coastal and oceanic islands (reviews e.g. Schram, 2013; Watling and Thiel, 2015; Wellborn and Thiel, 2018). Crustaceans play central roles in these various habitats, take part in ecosystem functioning by controlling primary production, and transfer energy and nutrients from primary producers to higher trophic levels. Many decapod crustaceans, for example, represent key species in coastal, estuarine, and intertidal habitats where they can have such a high abundance that changes in their population structure may directly influence the structure of the whole ecosystem. Because of their broad distribution and contribution in crucial ecosystem functions, crustaceans are strongly affected by changes of environmental drivers such as temperature, salinity and acidification. Therefore, they are ideal models to study the effects of global change, e.g., on species persistence, genetic adaptation, dispersal and colonization of new habitats but also of the impact of other anthropogenic stressors such as pollution by light, nutrients, toxins, and microplastics. This Special Issue brings together contributions on both laboratory-based and field studies written by experts in analysing the fate of crustaceans in a changing world. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - The relative role of climate and herbivory in driving treeline dynamics along a latitudinal gradient
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 392-402
AB  - Aim: The treeline is an obvious ecotone between forest and tundra ecosystems. Climatic warming is expected to lead to the treeline advancing, although in many cases this has not been observed. This is most likely because other factors can also influence treeline dynamics, notably land use and herbivory in European treelines. In this study, the roles of climate and herbivory as determinants for change in stem number, growth and mortality responses of treeline ecotone trees were investigated. Location: Thirty-six sites along a 1,000 km latitudinal gradient in the Scandes Mountains in Norway (60–69° N). Methods: We recorded changes in stem numbers and height, and mortality between 2008 and 2012. A partial least-squares regression analysis (PLS) was carried out to find the relative importance of groups of variables representing climate, herbivory, site and tree properties for explaining the variation in these three response variables. We also fitted general additive models for each response with selected variables from the PLS analysis. Results: We found an increase in number of stems and tree height for short and medium tall trees. The climatic variables explained the greatest proportion of the variation of the change in stem numbers, while tree height growth and mortality were best predicted by the growth stage of the tree and climate. Conclusions: Our study shows that climate explains more of the variance in treeline performance than herbivory, tree properties or latitude. Relatively weak explanatory power of all variables suggests high context dependency of treeline dynamics between sites. It seems that at large scales, variables known to be important in regulating treeline dynamics within sites are poor predictors of treeline change in the short term. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 73

SP  - 175-187
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is an important mechanism for populations to respond to fluctuating environments, yet may be insufficient to adapt to a directionally changing environment. To study whether plasticity can evolve under current climate change, we quantified selection and genetic variation in both the elevation (RN E ) and slope (RN S ) of the breeding time reaction norm in a long-term (1973–2016) study population of great tits (Parus major). The optimal RN E (the caterpillar biomass peak date regressed against the temperature used as cue by great tits) changed over time, whereas the optimal RN S did not. Concordantly, we found strong directional selection on RN E , but not RN S , of egg-laying date in the second third of the study period; this selection subsequently waned, potentially due to increased between-year variability in optimal laying dates. We found individual and additive genetic variation in RN E but, contrary to previous studies on our population, not in RN S . The predicted and observed evolutionary change in RN E was, however, marginal, due to low heritability and the sex limitation of laying date. We conclude that adaptation to climate change can only occur via micro-evolution of RN E, but this will necessarily be slow and potentially hampered by increased variability in phenotypic optima. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Thermal stress reduces carbonate production of benthic foraminifera and changes the material properties of their shells
VL  - 78
IS  - 9
SP  - 3202-3211
AB  - In shallow marine environments, benthic foraminifera are important foundation species and carbonate producers. Understanding their response to future climate is often drawn from their acclimation potential in short laboratory experiments, thereby limiting our understanding of migration, species replacement, and adaptive potential. To overcome this challenge, we examine two species of benthic foraminifera from a thermally polluted field site mimicking future warming. This site and a control station cover 13-36°C causing both warm and cold stress to the local species. Computer Tomography reveals that under heat stress, even with acclimation, Lachlanella significantly reduced its shell volume. In contrast, Pararotalia calcariformata did not reduce its shell volume but reduced the relative amount of calcite with respect to shell volume and changed its reproduction cycle from twice to once per year. Raman spectroscopy indicates that thermal conditions alter the chemical composition of the calcite shells of both species. Calcification during thermal stress creates alterations in the crystal structure that are unexpectedly more prominent under cold stress than warm stress indicating warming might positively affect the shell's protective function. Supported by previous laboratory experiments and observations from the geological record, our results provide new perspective to the effect of warming on benthic foraminifera. © 2021 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2021.

TI  - The Phenotypic and the Genetic Response to the Extreme High Temperature Provides New Insight Into Thermal Tolerance for the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 7
AB  - Investigating responses of organisms to stressful or new environments with selection pressure is one of the crucial problems in evolutionary biology, and it is of importance to understand the phenotypic and molecular mechanism underlying thermal tolerance under the context of the climate change. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, inhabiting the environment with high variation in temperature, is a worldwide aquaculture species. However, summer mortality relevant to the high temperature is one of the problems challenging the oyster industry. An artificial selective breeding program was initiated to select for the thermal tolerance of oysters in an attempt to increase the summer survival rates since 2017 in our study. Parents of thermotolerance oyster selection is are based on acute thermal tolerance under controlled heat stress to strengthen the selection intensity. Furthermore, the phenotypic and the genotypic response to extreme high temperature were investigated based on the comparison of the F1 progeny of the selected and natural populations in growth, physiology, mortality rate post heat stress, genetic structure, and gene expression. The parameter of growth showed no significant change between the selected and natural populations for the 6-month-old oysters. The selected population exhibited a higher survival rate after exposure to heat stress in the laboratory, which is in line with result of the filed experience that summer mortality of selected population was significantly lower than that of natural population. Further, the respiration rate of the selected population increased at 38°C, while it increased at 35°C in the natural population. Simultaneously, metabolism-related enzymes (PK, SOD) showed higher activity levels in the selected population. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis, population structure, and principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that the selected and natural populations exhibited genetic divergence, with eight genes (IF4A2, IF6, EIF3A, MANBA, DDX43, RECS, CAT2, and BAG4) in the selected regions showing differential expression patterns in response to heat stress in the two populations. This study suggests that artificial selection has a significant effect on phenotype and genome structure for the oyster, our study providing an alternative way to reveal the mechanism underlying thermotolerance that plays an important role to predict the potential adaptation to the climate change. © Copyright © 2020 Ding, Li, Cong, Wang, Wang, Que, Zhang and Li.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are rapidly changing seawater temperature, pH and carbonate chemistry. This study compares the embryonic development under high pCO2 conditions across the south-north distribution range of the marine clam Limecola balthica in NW Europe. The combined effects of elevated temperature and reduced pH on hatching success and size varied strongly between the three studied populations, with the Gulf of Finland population appearing most endangered under the conditions predicted to occur by 2100. These results demonstrate that the assessment of marine faunal population persistence to future climatic conditions needs to consider the interactive effects of co-occurring physico-chemical alterations in seawater within the local context that determines population fitness, adaptation potential and the system resilience to environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Thermal exposure of adult Chinook salmon and steelhead: Diverse behavioral strategies in a large and warming river system
VL  - 13
IS  - 9
AB  - Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed ~500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20–22 °C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were ~2–10 °C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a ~260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 ≤ r ≤ 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 ≤ r ≤ 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature-tolerant phenotypes. © 2018 Keefer et al.

TI  - Viral exposure effects on life-history, flight-related traits, and wing melanisation in the Glanville fritillary butterfly
VL  - 107
SP  - 136-143
AB  - Infections represent a constant threat for organisms and can lead to substantial fitness losses. Understanding how individuals, especially from natural populations, respond towards infections is thus of great importance. Little is known about immunity in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). As the larvae live gregariously in family groups, vertical and horizontal transmission of infections could have tremendous effects on individuals and consequently impact population dynamics in nature. We used the Alphabaculovirus type strain Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and demonstrated that positive concentration-dependent baculovirus exposure leads to prolonged developmental time and decreased survival during larval and pupal development, with no sex specific differences. Viral exposure did not influence relative thorax mass or wing morphometric traits often related to flight ability, yet melanisation of the wings increased with viral exposure, potentially influencing disease resistance or flight capacity via thermal regulation. Further research is needed to explore effects under sub-optimal conditions, determine effects on fitness-related traits, and investigate a potential adaptive response of increased melanisation in the wings due to baculovirus exposure. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Thermosensitive sex chromosome dosage compensation in ZZ/ZW softshell turtles, Apalone spinifera
VL  - 376
IS  - 1833
AB  - Sex chromosome dosage compensation (SCDC) overcomes gene-dose imbalances that disturb transcriptional networks, as when ZW females or XY males are hemizygous for Z/X genes. Mounting data from non-model organisms reveal diverse SCDC mechanisms, yet their evolution remains obscure, because most informative lineages with variable sex chromosomes are unstudied. Here, we discovered SCDC in turtles and an unprecedented thermosensitive SCDC in eukaryotes. We contrasted RNA-seq expression of Z-genes, their autosomal orthologues, and control autosomal genes in Apalone spinifera (ZZ/ZW) and Chrysemys picta turtles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) (proxy for ancestral expression). This approach disentangled chromosomal context effects on Z-linked and autosomal expression, from lineage effects owing to selection or drift. Embryonic Apalone SCDC is tissue- and age-dependent, regulated gene-by-gene, complete in females via Z-upregulation in both sexes (Type IV) but partial and environmentally plastic via Z-downregulation in males (accentuated at colder temperature), present in female hatchlings and a weakly suggestive in adult liver (Type I). Results indicate that embryonic SCDC evolved with/after sex chromosomes in Apalone's family Tryonichidae, while co-opting Z-gene upregulation present in the TSD ancestor. Notably, Apalone's SCDC resembles pygmy snake's, and differs from the full-SCDC of Anolis lizards who share homologous sex chromosomes (XY), advancing our understanding of how XX/XY and ZZ/ZW systems compensate gene-dose imbalance.

TI  - A switched estimation strategy based on Kalman filtering for compensating laser tracker ADM shift
VL  - 56
SP  - 395-403
AB  - Laser Trackers (LTs) are useful metrology tools for quickly acquiring accurate 3D position measurements of a target over long ranges (e.g., up to 100 m). These tools often employ an Absolute Distance Meter (ADM) which is known to have a temporal measurement shift arising from the internal thermal effect. The measured radial distance of a regular target can be compensated by subtracting from it the ADM shift. However, for many LTs currently in service the ADM shift cannot be acquired when an LT is in Operation. In this work, an estimate of the ADM shift is adopted for radial distance compensation when an LT is in Operation. A Switched Estimation (SE) algorithm is proposed to evaluate the validity of the estimate. The SE algorithm leverages the estimation uncertainty given by a Modified Kalman Filter (MKF) and confines the estimation uncertainty within a pair of predefined boundaries. When the estimation uncertainty reaches the upper bound, a regular Kalman Filter (KF) is adopted to calibrate the ADM shift estimate, during which the LT is directed to measure the ADM shift. Once the uncertainty reaches a lower bound, the LT is redirected to be back in Operation. Obviously high estimation accuracy, consequently high compensation accuracy, conflicts with high operation productivity. A tradeoff can be made by selecting an appropriate pair of boundaries. A numerical method is given for the selection of proper boundaries by creating a selection map. Experimental results show that with the proposed SE algorithm, the maximum variation of the radial distance measurement is reduced by more than 70% while the operation productivity is kept at 93.02%. © 2019

TI  - Classifying heatwaves: developing health-based models to predict high-mortality versus moderate United States heatwaves
VL  - 146
IS  - 3
SP  - 439-453
AB  - Heatwaves are divided between moderate, more common heatwaves and rare “high-mortality” heatwaves that have extremely large health effects per day, which we define as heatwaves with a 20 % or higher increase in mortality risk. Better projections of the expected frequency of and exposure to these separate types of heatwaves could help communities optimize heat mitigation and response plans and gauge the potential benefits of limiting climate change. Whether a heatwave is high-mortality or moderate could depend on multiple heatwave characteristics, including intensity, length, and timing. We created heatwave classification models using a heatwave training dataset created using recent (1987–2005) health and weather data from 82 large US urban communities. We built twenty potential classification models and used Monte Carlo cross-validations to evaluate these models. We ultimately identified several models that can adequately classify high-mortality heatwaves. These models can be used to project future trends in high-mortality heatwaves under different scenarios of a changing future (e.g., climate change, population change). Further, these models are novel in the way they allow exploration of different scenarios of adaptation to heat, as they include, as predictive variables, heatwave characteristics that are measured relative to a community’s temperature distribution, allowing different adaptation scenarios to be explored by selecting alternative community temperature distributions. The three selected models have been placed on GitHub for use by other researchers, and we use them in a companion paper to project trends in high-mortality heatwaves under different climate, population, and adaptation scenarios. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Developmental plasticity of thermal ecology traits in reptiles: Trends, potential benefits, and research needs
VL  - 84
SP  - 74-82
AB  - A variety of phenotypic traits in reptiles are affected by conditions during embryonic development, a phenomenon known as developmental plasticity. In particular, many traits in which expression changes with temperature, such as locomotor performance or growth rates, are also developmentally plastic. However, much less is known about the extent to which traits associated with thermal ecology, such as thermal tolerance and behavioral thermoregulation, are developmentally plastic. Here, we review the literature on developmental plasticity in physiological and behavioral traits associated with thermal ecology in reptiles. Most studies on developmental plasticity of thermal traits have assessed plasticity in behavioral traits, such as selected temperature or time spent basking, and these studies have found mixed support for the presence of developmental plasticity in behavioral thermal traits. In contrast, very few studies have assessed developmental plasticity in physiological traits, yet these studies generally support a developmentally plastic basis for thermal tolerance. Most studies have only tested for developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits at the hatchling stage, which limits our understanding of the benefits of developmental plasticity to individuals, or the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in populations. We recommend that research on developmental plasticity in reptile thermal ecology be expanded to include incubation conditions other than mean temperature, consider traits associated with cold-tolerance, and endeavor to understand how developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits is beneficial. In particular, determining how long differences persist over ontogeny, and testing for benefits of developmental plasticity across multiple life stages, are crucial first steps towards understanding the adaptive significance of developmental plasticity in thermal ecology traits. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Genome-wide SNP based species identification of Chinemys reevesii, Ocadia sinensis and their hybrids
VL  - 24
AB  - Freshwater turtles have a long history as medicine and food. Due to the increasing demand, many non-cultured turtles are overfished and endangered. It is difficult to distinguish the commercially cultured Chinemys reevesii, Ocadia sinensis and their hybrid offspring by conventional method, which brings harm to variety protection and market supervision. In order to identify these turtles, we generated genomic resources of the C. reevesii double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRADseq) and O. sinensis re-sequencing libraries. A total of 88,087 SNP loci with high-quality were found in the genomes, and 8,617 pairs of SNP primers were carefully designed, from which 20 SNP markers were randomly selected for experimental verification, among which four markers were confirmed to distinguish C. reevesii, O. sinensis and their hybrid offspring. In order to improve the practical efficiency of the species identification, a method combining multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was established. According to the melting curve, these turtle species can be visually and rapidly distinguished in less than 3 h with the template concentration as low as 0.01 ng/μL. This study laid a foundation for the protection of wild resources and the regulation of turtle market, and also laid a molecular foundation for genetic research of turtles, such as genetic improvement and molecular marker-assisted selection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Warmer incubation temperature influences sea turtle survival and nullifies the benefit of a female-biased sex ratio
VL  - 163
IS  - 2
SP  - 689-704
AB  - Climate change plays a key role in the development and survival of oviparous ectotherms such as sea turtles. Higher environmental temperatures are expected to lead to increased production of female hatchlings and potential feminization of many populations, as well as reduced hatching success and hatchling fitness. We investigated how different sand temperatures affect sea turtle embryo mortality, hatchling phenotype, and hatchling predation during their crawl to the sea. The study was conducted in Cabo Verde, the only rookery of the endangered loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) in the Eastern Atlantic. During three consecutive seasons (2015–2017), 240 loggerhead clutches were exposed to three different incubation temperature regimes created by different sand colours. The warm treatment (mean = 32.3 °C ± 0.5) killed 33% more embryos than the cold treatment (mean = 29.7 °C ± 0.6). Hatchlings from the warm treatment were mostly females, smaller in size, and had lower performance. Hatchling predation by ghost crabs during seaward transit was higher for hatchlings incubated in the warm treatment. Combining embryo mortality and hatchling predation, the rate of female hatchling arrival at the sea was more than twice as high in the cold treatment (34.4 females per 100 eggs) than in the warm treatment (16.0 females per 100 eggs). This increase in mortality caused by warmer incubation temperatures may cancel any potential benefit of a female-biased sex ratio. Conservation planners should consider behavioural adaptations and the potential dispersal of the nesting areas to colder areas to increase resilience of loggerhead turtles to climate change. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment shapes offspring phenotype and performance
VL  - 221
IS  - 20
AB  - Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Huuhtajantie 160, FI-72210 Tervo, Finland The sperm pre-fertilization environment has recently been suggested to mediate remarkable transgenerational consequences for offspring phenotype (transgenerational plasticity, TGB), but the adaptive significance of the process has remained unclear. Here, we studied the transgenerational effects of sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment in a cold-adapted salmonid, the European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus).We used a full-factorial breeding design where the eggs of five females were fertilized with the milt of 10males that had been pre-incubated at two different temperatures (3.5°C and 6.5°C) for 15 h prior to fertilization. Thermal manipulation did not affect sperm motility, cell size, fertilization success or embryo mortality. However, offspring that were fertilized with 6.5°C-exposed milt were smaller and had poorer swimming performance than their full-siblings that had been fertilized with the 3.5°C-exposed milt. Furthermore, the effect of milt treatment on embryo mortality varied among different females (treatment×female interaction) and male-female combinations (treatment×female×male interaction). Together, these results indicate that sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment shapes offspring phenotype and post-hatching performance and modifies both the magnitude of female (dam) effects and the compatibility of the gametes. Generally, our results suggest that short-term changes in sperm thermal conditions may have negative impact for offspring fitness. Thus, sperm thermal environment may have an important role in determining the adaptation potential of organisms to climate change. Detailed mechanism(s) behind our findings require further attention. © 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Ervilia castanea (Mollusca, Bivalvia) populations adversely affected at CO2 seeps in the North Atlantic
VL  - 754
AB  - Sites with naturally high CO2 conditions provide unique opportunities to forecast the vulnerability of coastal ecosystems to ocean acidification, by studying the biological responses and potential adaptations to this increased environmental variability. In this study, we investigated the bivalve Ervilia castanea in coastal sandy sediments at reference sites and at volcanic CO2 seeps off the Azores, where the pH of bottom waters ranged from average oceanic levels of 8.2, along gradients, down to 6.81, in carbonated seawater at the seeps. The bivalve population structure changed markedly at the seeps. Large individuals became less abundant as seawater CO2 levels rose and were completely absent from the most acidified sites. In contrast, small bivalves were most abundant at the CO2 seeps. We propose that larvae can settle and initially live in high abundances under elevated CO2 levels, but that high rates of post-settlement dispersal and/or mortality occur. Ervilia castanea were susceptible to elevated CO2 levels and these effects were consistently associated with lower food supplies. This raises concerns about the effects of ocean acidification on the brood stock of this species and other bivalve molluscs with similar life history traits. © 2020 The Authors

SP  - 33-43
AB  - Chenopodium quinoa (Willd.) is an herbaceous C3 crop originating in the Andean Altiplano. Quinoa possesses a great deal of genetic variability, can adapt to diverse climatic conditions, besides of having seeds with high nutritional properties. An experiment conducted in Burkina Faso has determined the response of two quinoa varieties (Titicaca and Negra Collana) to different planting dates (November vs December), irrigation levels (Potential evapotranspiration-PET, 100, 80 and 60% PET), and N fertilization rates (100, 50 and 25 kg N ha-1). Main research findings have shown that quinoa can be highly performant under drought stress conditions and low nitrogen inputs, besides of coping with high temperatures typically of the Sahel. The highest yields (1.9 t ha-1) were achieved when sown in November at 60 % PET and 25 kg N ha-1. For this location, short cycle varieties, such as Titicaca, were recommended in order to avoid thermic stress conditions occurring prior to the onset of the rainy season (May-October).

TI  - Culturomics remains a highly valuable methodology to obtain rare microbial diversity with putative biotechnological potential from two Portuguese salterns
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
AB  - Background: The high salt concentration is the major factor limiting microbial growth at salterns, along with solar radiation, temperature, and pH. These environmental factors play key roles in the acquisition of unique genetic adaptations for the survival of microorganisms in salterns, which can result in the production of interesting secondary metabolites. The main goal of the present work was to isolate and compare the culturable microbiota from two geographically distant salterns in Portugal and access their biotechnological potential. Methods: Culturomics approaches using different culture media were applied for microbial isolation. All isolates were identified either by 16S rRNA or ITS genes sequencing, and their biotechonological potential was assessed by PCR. Results: Overall, 154 microbial isolates were recovered that were phylogenetically assigned to 45 taxa from 9 different phyla. From these, 26 isolates may represent putative new taxa. The predominant genera obtained were Penicillium (41 isolates, 26.6%), Streptomyces (13 isolates, 8.4%) and Sinomicrobium (11 isolates, 7.1%). Moreover, the polyketide synthase I gene was present in 64 isolates, the nonribosomal peptide synthethase gene in 16 isolates, and both genes in 23 isolates. Conclusions: This study adds up valuable knowledge on the culturable microbiota of Portuguese salterns and on its potential for production of secondary metabolites. In the long run, this study provides a widely diverse microbial collection for future works.

TI  - Development of SNP markers for identification of thermo-resistant families of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas based on RNA-seq
VL  - 539
AB  - The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the most cultivated oyster species around the world. However, massive mortalities linked to high temperatures have been reported in different countries, becoming one of the most significant challenges for oyster culture. High mortality episodes have been reported also in Mexico due to temperature stress, mainly in Sonora and Baja California Sur. In this region, areas with shallow waters can reach 34 °C, causing severe physiological stress, mostly in juvenile oysters. Recently and as a strategy to address this problem in Mexico, a selective breeding program has been implemented, aiming to develop families with high survival at high temperatures through marker-aided selection. The objective of the present study was the identification of SNP markers from the transcriptome of families phenotypically different: thermo-resistant (‘R’) versus thermo-susceptible (‘S’) and analyzing whether these variants were present in transcripts potentially involved in thermal resistance. Several SNP variants were detected between ‘R’ and ‘S’ families, affecting multiple transcripts and molecular pathways. Four SNP markers provided accurate differentiation between ‘R’ and ‘S’ oysters. Additionally, 66 SNPs were suitable for pedigree reconstruction and sibling clustering. The discriminant SNPs were associated with changes in gene transcripts that were related to biological processes such as the activation of HSP90, zinc uptake, collagen biosynthesis, ion transport, and the immune response. The use of SNPs markers associated with thermo-resistant families can help to improve the yields in oyster production at high temperatures, especially in Mexico. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present chapter is a synthesis of the available data related to the management of the reproduction of the Siberian sturgeon under farmed conditions. Some reproduction-related biological characteristics are briefly quoted. Preselection of potential brood fish is related in detail as well as pre-spawning holding regime with a focus on water temperature. Definite selection of reputed ready-to-spawn brood fish is described. As for preselection, the usefulness for the definite selection of the rate of migration of the germinal vesicle towards the animal pole (the polarization index, PI) is presented. The two tools for males (echography and texture of testis) are evoked. With regard to females, plasmatic indicators and observations of ovarian follicles are described with a focus on the powerful of the in vitro maturation competence (IVMC). The different alternatives for hormonal stimulation, including some unusual practices when management somewhat failed, are described in conjunction with time scale working agenda. Collection, observations, stocking and management of gametes are successively presented. The many possibilities for the so-called de-adhesive treatment are described as post-fertilization treatment. Some data on yields and perspectives are discussed. In general, we provide practical comments and a lot of illustration both with photos and graphs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. All rights reserved.

TI  - Plasticity drives extreme cold tolerance of emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) during a polar vortex
VL  - 2
AB  - Invasive species must often survive combinations of environmental conditions that differ considerably from their native range; however, for a given species it is unclear whether improved tolerance is the result of phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation (or both). Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae; the emerald ash borer) is an invasive pest of Fraxinus trees in North America and Europe. Previous studies in SW Ontario, Canada, showed that A. planipennis is freeze avoidant, preventing internal ice formation by accumulating Molar concentrations of glycerol in its hemolymph and depressing its supercooling point (SCP, the temperature at which it freezes). The cold tolerance of these SW Ontario animals was used to predict potential distribution, revealing that some Canadian cities should be too cold to allow populations to persist. However, a small population of A. planipennis has persisted in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, through several severe ‘polar vortex’ events. In 2018/19, we collected A. planipennis larvae and prepupae from Winnipeg, MB and Southern Ontario, and found that individuals from Winnipeg were extremely cold tolerant – with SCPs as low as -52°C in prepupae (compared to -32°C in SW Ontario), and observed survival of unfrozen individuals exposed to -50°C for one hour. This cold tolerance was accompanied by higher hemolymph osmolality and glycerol concentration than in the SW Ontario individuals. To distinguish between phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, in 2020/21 we overwintered Winnipeg-sourced individuals either outdoors in SW Ontario or in a simulated Winnipeg winter. Simulated Winnipeg winter individuals had cold tolerance similar to those overwintered in Winnipeg, while SW Ontario overwintered individuals had cold tolerance similar to those collected previously in the region. The simulated winter individuals had higher hemolymph glycerol concentrations than SW Ontario overwintered animals, at least in part due to greater dehydration. Thus, A. planipennis are cold-tolerant enough to survive some of the harshest winters where their host trees can grow, and most likely attain this cold tolerance via phenotypic plasticity. These findings raise the importance of delineating sensitivity of conclusions to unexpected phenotypic plasticity when predicting potential distributions of new invasives or responses to climate change. © 2022

TI  - Shifting the balance: Heat stress challenges the symbiotic interactions of the Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera, Liviidae)
VL  - 235
IS  - 3
SP  - 195-203
AB  - Global warming may impact biodiversity by disrupting biological interactions, including long-term insect-microbe mutualistic associations. Symbiont-mediated insect tolerance to high temperatures is an ecologically important trait that significantly influences an insect’s life history. Disruption of microbial symbionts that are required by insects would substantially impact their pest status. Diaphorina citri, a worldwide citrus pest, is associated with the mutualistic symbionts Candidatus Carsonella ruddii and Candidatus Profftella armatura. Wolbachia is also associated with D. citri, but its contribution to the host is unknown. Symbiont density is dependent on a range of factors, including the thermosensitivity of the host and/or symbiont to heat stress. Here, we predicted that short-term heat stress of D. citri would disrupt the host-symbiont phenological synchrony and differentially affect the growth and density of symbionts. We investigated the effects of exposing D. citri eggs to different temperatures for different periods of time on the growth dynamics of symbionts during the nymphal development of D. citri (first instar to fifth instar) by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Symbiont densities were assessed as the number of gene copies, using spe- cific molecular markers: 16S rRNA for Carsonella and Profftella and ftsZ for Wolbachia. Statistical modeling of the copy numbers of symbionts revealed differences in their growth patterns, particularly in the early instars of heat-shocked insects. Wolbachia was the only symbiont to benefit from heat-shock treatment. Although the symbionts responded differently to heat stress, the lack of differences in symbiont densities between treated and control late nymphs suggests the existence of an adaptive genetic process to restore phenological synchrony during the development of immatures in preparation for adult life. Our findings contribute tothe understanding of the potential deleterious effects of high temperatures on host-symbiont interactions. Our data also suggest that the effects of host exposure to high temperatures in symbiont growth are highly variable and dependent on the interactions among members of the community of symbionts harbored by a host. Such dependence points to unpredictable consequences for agroecosystems worldwide due to climate change-related effects on the ecological traits of symbiont-dependent insect pests. © 2018 The University of Chicago.

TI  - Reproductive plasticity of Hawaiian Montipora corals following thermal stress
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Ocean warming, fueled by climate change, is the primary cause of coral bleaching events which are predicted to increase in frequency. Bleaching is generally damaging to coral reproduction, can be exacerbated by concomitant stressors like ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and can have lasting impacts to successful reproduction and potential adaptation. We compared morphological and physiological reproductive metrics (e.g., sperm motility, mitochondrial membrane integrity, egg volume, gametes per bundle, and fertilization and settlement success) of two Hawaiian Montipora corals after consecutive bleaching events in 2014 and 2015. Between the species, sperm motility and mitochondrial membrane potential had the most disparate results. Percent sperm motility in M. capitata, which declined to ~ 40% during bleaching from a normal range of 70–90%, was still less than 50% motile in 2017 and 2018 and had not fully recovered in 2019 (63% motile). By contrast, percent sperm motility in Montipora spp. was 86% and 74% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This reduction in motility was correlated with damage to mitochondria in M. capitata but not Montipora spp. A major difference between these species is the physiological foundation of their UVR protection, and we hypothesize that UVR protective mechanisms inherent in Montipora spp. mitigate this reproductive damage. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Relative expression of stress-related genes during acclimation at low temperature of psychrotrophic Oenococcus oeni strains from Patagonian wine
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
AB  - In the present study, we evaluated the transcriptional response of four stress-related genes in three Oenococcus oeni strains after acclimation at two different temperatures. Gene expression was analyzed at time zero and after 48 h acclimation at 18 and 21 °C. After the acclimation period cells were inoculated into sterile Pinot noir wine and MLF was followed for 25 days to investigate if different acclimation temperatures could influence cell survival and MLF performance. l-malic acid consumption, population survival, and transcriptional behavior were different upon the acclimation temperature. rmlB and hsp20 genes presented a considerable increase in their expression level when strains were acclimated at 18 °C particularly in the psychrotrophic strains UNQOe19 and UNQOe4 isolated from Patagonian Pinot noir wine in comparison with the control strain (ATCC 27310). The increase in rmlB and hsp20 expression could account for the better survival of these strains in Pinot noir in comparison with the control strain. In addition, Patagonian populations acclimated at 18 °C were able to consume a higher percentage of l-malic acid in comparison with cells acclimated at 21 °C. Our results suggest that gene expression analysis of cells acclimated at sub-optimal temperatures could benefit the selection of psychrotrophic strains aimed as starter cultures. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - A fully implicit, scalable, conservative nonlinear relativistic Fokker–Planck 0D-2P solver for runaway electrons
VL  - 254
AB  - Upon application of a sufficiently strong electric field, electrons break away from thermal equilibrium and approach relativistic speeds. These highly energetic 'runaway' electrons (similar to MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption physics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop reliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully implicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates) relativistic nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP studies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron-ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz operator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac reaction term. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by (1) ensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, (2) strictly preserving positivity, and (3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel. Key to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the linearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams-Karney potentials (Braams and Karney, 1987), and a novel adaptive technique to determine the associated boundary values. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme with numerical results ranging from small electric-field electrical conductivity measurements to the accurate reproduction of runaway tail dynamics when strong electric fields are applied.

TI  - Quantum Zeno effect in a circuit-QED system
VL  - 99
IS  - 5
AB  - We study the quantum Zeno effect of the circuit-QED system at finite temperature for both selective measurement and nonselective measurement proposals. For the selective measurement proposal, we explicitly show that the counter-rotating terms (CRTs) become as significant as rotating wave terms (RWTs) with increase of temperature. We also derive an analytic expression for the survival probability which correctly captures the leading contribution for both RWTs and CRTs in the frequent measurement limit. Beyond this limit, we observe a nonexponential decay of the survival probability by further considering the effect of the variation of initial states during repeated measurements. For the nonselective measurement proposal, we find that the survival probability demonstrates the same behavior as in the selective measurement case in the short-time regime while it deviates from an exponential form and approaches a nonvanishing value in the long-time scale due to the repopulation effect. © 2019 American Physical Society.

TI  - CeO2 nano-hexagons decorated rGO/CNT heterostructure for high-performance LPG sensing
VL  - 2
IS  - 3
AB  - This paper reports, the improved sensitivity and selectivity of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sensing at room temperature based on ternary heterostructure nanocomposite (CeO2–rGO/CNT). Detection of LPG is required for proper environment monitoring to avoid any health hazards in the household and industrial areas. Towards this, a low-cost, high performance, and high stable room temperature gas sensor was fabricated. CeO2 nanopuzzles was synthesized by Eggshell membrane template assisted hydrothermal method and nanocomposites by sono-chemical route. As-synthesized materials and nanocomposites were analyzed by employing characterizations like XRD, Raman, FT-IR, FESEM, and TEM, which confirmed the formation of shape, size, structure, and functional groups involved. The current study focuses on the fabrication of room temperature LPG sensor based on hybrid nanocomposites coated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate working electrodes for In-house chemiresistive LPG detection unit to study response, stability, and selectivity parameters. The ternary heterostructure nanocomposite gas sensor exhibited good selectivity to LPG at room temperature. This sensor showed the response of 42% at 400 ppm of LPG, which is 2.21 times than pure CeO2 sensor with a short response time 26 s and recovery time of 98 s, and gained 99% response after bending with 95.2% stability and 85.7% periodic stability of the sensor. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Selection and experimentation of the best hybrid green composite using advanced MCDM methods for clean sustainable energy recovery: A novel approach
VL  - 5
IS  - 3
SP  - 556-566
AB  - Relevant and appropriate selection of best hybrid material is a challenging task for the recent industries. The mandatory criterion is to deal with the enhanced productivity with minimum cost. Therefore, this paper highlights on the comparative study between the advanced multi-criteria approaches namely ARAS, MABAC, COPRAS and MOOSRA methods for the selection of the best hybrid composite material using aluminum (Al) as base material varying different reinforcement weights and recycling with various industrial wastes by stir casting. Al/WCE gives superior tribomechanical properties at lower cost than any other reinforcements. These advanced MCDM methods are applied, based on the properties and attributes of the hybrid composites, to compare between the computational and experimental results. The results exactly corroborate with the previous research results, which authenticate the expediency of these methods during the solving of complex hybrid material selection problems for sustainable energy recovery. Out of 48 different samples, A30 is obtained to be the best sample by ARAS approach (rank 1) which is Al+Al2O3 at 12.5%wt. addition. A24 is ranked 2 which is heat treated 12.5%wt. WCE. But the same A30 is obtained to be rank 5 and A24 is obtained to be rank 1 by MABAC method, A30 is obtained to be rank 2 and A24 to be rank 1 by COPRAS method, and A30 is calculated to be rank 1 and A24 to be rank 11 by MOOSRA method. A24 is also obtained to be the best hybrid composite as per the experimentation. This paper also aims for proper recovering of environmental friendly renewable energy for the society by fabricating the best hybrid green composite for sustainable development. © International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

TI  - Effects of commercial formulations of glyphosate on marine crustaceans and implications for risk assessment under temperature changes
VL  - 213
AB  - Glyphosate-based formulations are the most commonly used herbicides worldwide with the risk of potential contamination of aquatic bodies. The present study assessed the response of four marine crustaceans to three different brands of herbicides Roundup (R) Platinum, Efesto (R) and Taifun (R) MK CL.T, under two selected temperatures of 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus fulvus, the anostracan Artemia franciscana, the amphipod Corophium insidiosum and the isopod Sphaeroma serratum were chosen as testing organisms. Effects of herbicides and temperatures were assessed by estimating lethal concentrations. The results showed that the high temperature rises the toxicity of glyphosate with an increase of mortality of all the tested species. This is an important aspect for future risk assessments of pesticides under global climate change scenarios. Efesto (R) resulted the most toxic brand, showing C. insidiosum the most sensitive with 96 h-LC50 values of 3.25 mg/L acid equivalent (a.e.) at 30 degrees C and 7.94 mg/L a.e. at 20 degrees C followed by T. fulvus while A. franciscana and S. serratum were the less sensitive. This study provides important information for assessing the toxic effects of three different brands of glyphosate-based herbicides on non-target marine organisms suggesting that they should be carefully managed to minimize any negative impact on marine organisms.

TI  - Population Viability of Sea Turtles in the Context of Global Warming
VL  - 71
IS  - 8
SP  - 790-804
AB  - Sea turtles present a model for the potential impacts of climate change on imperiled species, with projected warming generating concern about their persistence. Various sea turtle life-history traits are affected by temperature; most strikingly, warmer egg incubation temperatures cause female-biased sex ratios and higher embryo mortality. Predictions of sea turtle resilience to climate change are often focused on how resulting male limitation or reduced offspring production may affect populations. In the present article, by reviewing research on sea turtles, we provide an overview of how temperature impacts on incubating eggs may cascade through life history to ultimately affect population viability. We explore how sex-specific patterns in survival and breeding periodicity determine the differences among offspring, adult, and operational sex ratios. We then discuss the implications of skewed sex ratios for male-limited reproduction, consider the negative correlation between sex ratio skew and genetic diversity, and examine consequences for adaptive potential. Our synthesis underscores the importance of considering the effects of climate throughout the life history of any species. Lethal effects (e.g., embryo mortality) are relatively direct impacts, but sublethal effects at immature life-history stages may not alter population growth rates until cohorts reach reproductive maturity. This leaves a lag during which some species transition through several stages subject to distinct biological circumstances and climate impacts. These perspectives will help managers conceptualize the drivers of emergent population dynamics and identify existing knowledge gaps under different scenarios of predicted environmental change. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Developing sustainable agromining systems in agricultural ultramafic soils for nickel recovery
VL  - 6
AB  - Ultramafic soils are typically enriched in nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), and cobalt (Co) and deficient in essential nutrients, making them unattractive for traditional agriculture. Implementing agromining systems in ultramafic agricultural soils represent an ecological option for the sustainable management and re-valorisation of these low-productivity landscapes. These novel agroecosystems cultivate Ni-hyperaccumulating plants which are able to bioaccumulate this metal in their aerial plant parts; harvested biomass can be incinerated to produce Ni-enriched ash or "bio-ore" from which Ni metal, Ni ecocatalysts or pure Ni salts can be recovered. Nickel hyperaccumulation has been documented in ~450 species, and in temperate latitudes these mainly belong to the family Brassicaceae and particularly to the genus Odontarrhena (syn. Alyssum pro parte). Agromining allows for sustainable metal recovery without causing the environmental impacts associated with conventional mining activities, and at the same time, can improve soil fertility and quality and provide essential ecosystem services. Parallel reductions in Ni phytotoxicity over time would also permit cultivation of conventional agricultural crops. Field studies in Europe have been restricted to Mediterranean areas and these only evaluated the Ni-hyperaccumulator Odontarrhena muralis s.l. Two recent EU projects (Agronickel and LIFE-Agromine) have established a network of agromining field sites in ultramafic regions with different edapho-climatic characteristics across Albania, Austria, Greece and Spain. Soil and crop management practices are being developed so as to optimize the Ni agromining process; field studies are evaluating the potential benefits of fertilization regimes, crop selection and cropping patterns, and bioaugmentation with plant-associated microorganisms. Hydrometallurgical processes are being up-scaled to produce nickel compounds and energy from hyperaccumulator biomass. Exploratory techno-economic assessment of Ni metal recovery by pyrometallurgical conversion of O. muralis s.l. shows promising results under the condition that heat released during incineration can be valorized in the vicinity of the processing facility. © 2018 Kidd, Bani, Benizri, Gonnelli, Hazotte, Kisser, Konstantinou, Kuppens, Kyrkas, Laubie, Malina, Morel, Olcay, Pardo, Pons, Prieto-Fernández, Puschenreiter, Quintela-Sabarís, Ridard, Rodríguez-Garrido, Rosenkranz, Rozpadek, Saad, Selvi, Simonnot, Tognacchini, Turnau, Wazny, Witters and Echevarria.

VL  - 9
IS  - 11
AB  - Rising temperatures can affect fish survival, especially from shallower waters, as temperatures increase faster and more intensively in these areas; thus, species-specific temperature tolerance can be exceeded. Additionally, the amounts of anthropogenic pollutants are higher in coastal waters. Although increasing metabolic activity at higher temperatures could lead to stronger effects of toxins, there are hardly any studies on this topic. Subsequently, the aim was to investigate the response of fish cells upon exposure to industrial solvents (ethanol, isopropanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) in relation to a temperature increase (20◦ C and 25◦ C). Concerning the 3Rs (the replacement, reduction and refinement of animal experiments), in vitro tests were used for two threatened, vulnerable fish species: maraena whitefish (Coregonus maraena) and Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus). Both cell lines exhibited higher proliferation at 25◦ C. However, ecotoxicological results indicated significant differences regarding the cell line, toxin, temperature and exposure time. The evolutionarily older fish lineage, Atlantic sturgeon, demonstrated lower mortality rates in the presence of isopropanol and recovered better during long-term ethanol exposure than the maraena whitefish. Atlantic sturgeon cells have higher adaptation potential for these alcohols. In summary, fish species respond very specifically to toxins and changes in temperature, and new ecotoxicological questions arise with increasing water temperatures. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 36

SP  - 564-575
AB  - The genetic differentiation of teak meta-population in India was investigated in relation to geographical and climatic variations employing dominant ISSR markers followed by Bayesian statistical analysis to understand adaptability of the species. The analysis based on 290 teak genotypes representing 29 locations of its natural distribution and 43 ISSR loci exhibited an insignificant structure and low 2.76% LD (≥ 0.1 R2 values, p &lt; 0.001) in teak meta-population. The genetic and geographical variables despite acting independently with each other resulted in three sub-population clusters in the meta-population. The geographical barrier played a significant role in direction/restriction of gene flow. The integration of spatial/climatic variables altered the clustering pattern of the teak meta-population with signature of the adaptation to the temperature and longitudinal gradients that was also verified by the similar adaptation pattern of meta-population towards predicted global climate modeling for year 2050. The findings can help tackle the sustainable management and conservation of the species and its survival quotient in threat of changing climatic conditions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, an intelligent power package with body size of 40mm× 40mm is proposed. The thermal performance of the package with different material options has been analyzed and the materials which produce best thermal performance have been recommended for the final assembly of the package. The proposed power package consists of two high power rated SiC chips, two temperature sensor chips, one customized lead frame (LF), four pieces of customized metal clips and a flexible printed circuit (FPC). The material options include difference die attach materials, solder joint material (JM), molding compound material (MC) and thermal interface materials (TIM). A 3D thermal model is built to analyze the thermal performance of the proposed power package and different material combinations have been applied to the thermal model. The temperature field in the proposed power package has been simulated and the temperature profile of the package has been obtained. The thermal resistance of the proposed power package with different material options has been extracted. The analysis results show that the TIMs impose the most significant effects on the thermal performance of the power package, while effects of die attach materials, solder joint materials and molding compound material on the thermal performance of the package are negligible. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Establishment of Cajanus cajan (Linn.) Millsp. cell suspension cultures as an effective in vitro platform for the production of pharmacologically active phenolic compounds
VL  - 158
AB  - Phenolic compounds are validated to be the pharmacologically active phytochemicals in Cajanus cajan (Linn.) Millsp. leaves (CCLs) and the medicinal product (Tongluo Shenggu capsules, TSCs) thereof. For the first time, C. cajan cell suspension cultures (CCSCs) were established as an effective in vitro platform for the production of phenolic compounds. Callus was induced from C. cajan leaves by 2.0 mg/L 2,4-D, 5.0 mg/L α-NAA, and 0.1 mg/L Kn, and then subcultured on MS solid medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-D, 3.0 mg/L α-NAA, and 0.25 mg/L Kn. Culture conditions of a selected high-productive callus line (CCCL VII) were systematically optimized in terms of biomass productivity and phenolic yield, and eleven target compounds were identified and quantified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Under the optimal culture conditions (MS liquid medium, sucrose concentration 3.5 %, temperature 26 °C, inoculum size 3.0 %, and time 49 day), CCSCs produced the highest level of total phenolics (3462.99 μg/g DW) along with the maximum biomass productivity (10.03 g/L), which was higher than the phenolic yield in field-grown CCLs (3288.81 μg/g DW). Notably, CCSCs exhibited superiority in the content of the most valuable compound cajaninstilbene acid (2858.76 μg/g DW) as compared with CCLs (2114.60 μg/g DW). Also, CCSCs were discovered to be more abundant in genistin and genistein as against both CCLs and TSCs. This work concluded that CCSCs might be attractive alternative sources for the production of phenolic compounds with potential uses in pharmaceutical/nutraceutical industries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Monitoring Method and Verification of Sturgeon Glucose Sensing Signal at Waterless and Low Temperature Keeping Alive Transportation
VL  - 49

SP  - 305-314
AB  - Waterless and low temperature keeping alive transportation is considered as a kind of promising technology to improve aquatic animals' survival and save the transport costs, and monitoring biological signal is useful to improve the transparency and traceability of transportation process. A monitoring method of glucose was presented, which consisted of three components: a signal conditioning circuit, a software digital filter and a prediction method. The signal conditioning circuit was responsible to sense glucose signal by the implantable glucose sensor and signal pretreatment by a hardware filters; the software digital filter can filter and smooth the amplified signal to provide reliable data for the dynamic character analysis. The time series method served to predict change of glucose. Sturgeons were selected as experimental objectives to validate the reliability of the method. The experiment result showed that the implanted glucose sensor can sense data accurately with sensitivity of 27.047 mV/nA, the zero drift of 722.83 mV and signal output fitting of 0.960 8 after signal conditioning circuit; the average absolute error between the predicted value by autoregressive integrated moving average model(ARIMR)and the real sensed value was -0.014 mmol/L, and the average relative error was -0.117%, which indicated that the ARIMR model had advantages in prediction accuracy and smoothness compared with other prediction models; the proposed monitoring method can be adopted as a reference value to monitor the change of glucose and obtain the change of biological nutrients during waterless keeping alive transportation of the aquatic product. © 2018, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

AB  - Tree species dominate many ecosystems throughout the world and their response to climate, in light of global warming, is a matter of primary concern. This review describes past and ongoing research in Rhododendron, an ecologically important and well-adapted genus of more than 1000 species, occupying diverse habitats. Research to date indicates survival ability and mechanisms, with an emphasis on cold tolerance. The capability of long-distance gene flow in these species increases their genetic variability which in turn enhances their adaptability to newer niches as well as to environmental gradients (mainly temperature). Attempts to explain the molecular basis of morphological and behavioural changes in Rhododendron against cold-induced damage has been made. Gradual advances in ‘omics’ have led to an enriched genomic resource dissecting the role and interaction of multiple molecular factors participating in cold adaptability. However, fewer genetic studies are available on species with an inherent or a default cold-tolerance ability. Considering this fact, understanding specific features of an adapted species can provide insights on overriding the effects of desiccation and determining phase transitions in other plants as well. We propose to integrate ecological and evolutionary studies with functional genomics to improve predictions of tree responses to their environment. © 2020, Northeast Forestry University.

VL  - 28

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity describes the ability of an organism with a given genotype to respond to changing environmental conditions through the adaptation of the phenotype. Phenotypic plasticity is a widespread means of adaptation, allowing organisms to optimize fitness levels in changing environments. A core prerequisite for adaptive predictive plasticity is the existence of reliable cues, i.e. accurate environmental information about future selection on the expressed plastic phenotype. Furthermore, organisms need the capacity to detect and interpret such cues, relying on specific sensory signalling and neuronal cascades. Subsequent neurohormonal changes lead to the transformation of phenotype A into phenotype B. Each of these activities is critical for survival. Consequently, anything that could impair an animal's ability to perceive important chemical information could have significant ecological ramifications. Climate change and other human stressors can act on individual or all of the components of this signalling cascade. In consequence, organisms could lose their adaptive potential, or in the worst case, even become maladapted. Therefore, it is key to understand the sensory systems, the neurobiology and the physiological adaptations that mediate organisms' interactions with their environment. It is, thus, pivotal to predict the ecosystem-wide effects of global human forcing. This review summarizes current insights on how climate change affects phenotypic plasticity, focussing on how associated stressors change the signalling agents, the sensory systems, receptor responses and neuronal signalling cascades, thereby, impairing phenotypic adaptations. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Soil microbial communities have remarkable capacities to cope with ceaseless environmental changes, but little is known about their adaptation potential when facing an unprecedented disturbance. We tested the effect of incremental dose of microwaving on soil bacteria as a model of unprecedented stress. 16S rRNA gene qPCR at both the DNA and cDNA levels was used to characterize the total (DNA) and transcriptionally active (cDNA) fractions of the bacterial community. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene transcripts was performed to decipher tolerance ranges within the community using the concept of functional response groups (FRGs). Increasing microwaving doses resulted in 90% loss in total and transcriptionally active bacterial communities after 6.8 and 4.7 min, respectively. Four distinct FRGs with peculiar phylogenetic signatures were identified, revealing a link between taxonomy and increasing stress doses. FRG1, the most sensitive group, was dominated by Actinobacteria. FRG2 and FRG3, with intermediate tolerance, displayed prevalence of Proteobacteria, while FRG4, the most resistant group, was driven by Firmicutes. While the most sensitive FRGs showed predictable responses linked to changes in temperature and soil water content associated with microwaving, more tolerant FRG4 members exhibited a stochastic response nested within the Firmicutes phylum, potentially revealing bet-hedging strategists. The concept of FRGs based on 16S rRNA gene transcripts stood as an efficient tool for unraveling bacterial survival strategies and tolerance ranges triggered by incremental doses of an unprecedented stress, with regard to phylogeny linkages. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The relative influences of extrinsic compared to intrinsic drivers of evolutionary change have long been theorized and debated in the fossil record. Ecological recoveries from mass extinction events present records in which to examine these contrasts. Competition in a low diversity world, reproductive strategy, reconstruction of trophic systems and ecological specialization represent possible intrinsic controls on diversification. Feedback between diversity and abundance shifts of marine organisms with biogeochemical cycling and environmental conditions act as extrinsic controls on recovery process and rate. Disentangling these evolutionary pressures is a major challenge for understanding evolutionary recovery from mass extinction. The end-Permian mass extinction (251.88 Ma) represents the largest mass extinction in Earth history and led to an extended recovery interval which lasted the duration of the Early Triassic (~ 4.8 Myr) and beyond. Recent analyses suggest that the survivors of the mass extinction were biased toward organisms with higher metabolic rates that were more resilient against the volatile environmental changes that pervaded the Early Triassic including extreme temperature events, low pH, and low oxygen conditions. We use the Early Triassic recovery of gastropods, echinoids, and ammonoids to examine the processes of taxonomic and ecological evolution in response to, or in spite of, extrinsic environmental perturbations. The case studies of benthic gastropods and echinoids, when compared to pelagic ammonoids reflect similarities and differences in recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction. Gastropods and echinoids exhibit evidence of strong extrinsic environmental limitations which implicate the availability of refugia as a control on recovery. Low initial taxonomic diversity of survivors may have also limited the evolutionary recovery of both clades. Abundant and diverse microgastropod assemblages are interpreted as an adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. The morphological diversity of disarticulated echinoid spines and plates described in the southwestern United States, and examination of phylogenetic ghost lineages hints at a significant “hidden diversity” of Early Triassic echinoids. Ammonoids experienced taxonomic resets but are shown to be resilient to repeated environmental perturbations in the Boreal Ocean over the duration of the Early Triassic. Ammonoids may have adapted to persistent latitudinal temperature gradients and oxygen minimum zones that developed in the Early Triassic ocean basins. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sensitivity of silage-maize to climate change in Denmark: A productivity analysis using impact response surface
VL  - 98
SP  - 55-64
AB  - The sensitivity of silage maize to changing climate in Denmark under varying Nitrogen (N) and undersown catch crop (CC) treatments was investigated using a process-based, soil-plant-atmosphere model; Farm Assesment Tool (FASSET), and the impact response surfaces (IRS). The baseline period consisted of an experiment over a 3-year time period from 2009 to 2011 that was carried out in mid Jutland, Denmark (56 degrees 5'N, 9 degrees 56'E 38 m asl). The results indicated that an increase from the average annual temperature (approximate to 6.5 degrees C) of up to 1.5 degrees C is beneficial for maize yield. At approximately 8 degrees C annual average temperature and above, the yield dropped sharply, and any positive impact of varying N treatments and CC was diminished. The maize yield was not as sensitive to precipitation as it was to temperature. The undersown grass in silage maize was not found to be a viable option in relation to warmer climate for all of its benefits were widely overshadowed by the excessive NO3- leaching risk. This study suggested that the warming of the climate along with the projected increase in precipitation in Denmark in the future will greatly challenge the management of N in maize cropping systems. Under changing climate, increasing crop N uptake efficiency by both maize and CC should be targeted as priority. Root growth in this context is an essential feature for the N uptake efficiency. Further research on potential adaptation of different deep-rooted species in the warmer climate that might be suitable as undersown CC is needed.

SP  - 191-202
AB  - Current study was designed to investigate the current susceptibility levels of field collected strains of T. granarium (Everts) from Punjab, Pakistan. T. granarium populations were collected from different areas of Punjab i.e., Lahore, Sheikhupura, Gujranwala, Bahawalpur, Bhakkar and Faisalabad, were evaluated for their relative resistance or susceptibility in comparison to laboratory reared strain against pyrethroids. Filter paper impregnation method was used to assess the contact toxicity of pyrethroids (technical grade deltamethrin, α-cypermethrin, cypermethrin and bifenthrin) against 4th instar larval stage of T. granarium. Mortality responses were evaluated under constant temperature and relative humidity (r.h.) at 32 ± 2 °C and 65 ± 5 r.h. respectively. Data was recorded after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment and completely randomized design (CRD) were used with four replications. Experiments were conducted in Grain Research Training and Storage management cell, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan during year 2018–19. Bioassays showed that field collected strains were resistant to all test insecticides. Very low to moderate level of resistance was found in field strains. Bahawalpur strain showed highest resistance ratios of up-to 12.7, 18.9, 4.63 and 8.27 for deltamethrin, bifenthrin, α-cypermethrin and cypermethrin respectively, after 72 h of exposure to treatment. Bhakkar strain also showed moderate resistance following Bahawalpur strain. Lahore and Faisalabad collected strains were susceptible as compared to other field strains. In-vitro selection for deltamethrin revealed increase in resistance up-to 18.7 folds after selection for 7 generations by maintaining selection pressure at 80% mortality. Reversion in resistance occurred when strain was again reared for next 5 generations without insecticide exposure and resistance values decreased to 7.74 folds at G12. DR value for change in resistance was -0.07. The effectiveness of commonly used pyrethroids for the management of T. granarium was significantly reduced in the field populations exhibiting low to moderate resistance. Long-term use of insecticides with similar mode of action could be the reason for the development of resistance. Multi-tactical approach with integrated pest management (IPM) framework may prolong the effectiveness of pyrethroids in the T. granarium management. © 2021, African Association of Insect Scientists.

AB  - Topshell Tectus pyramis is a coral reef snail of economic and ecological value. This study assessed temperature and salinity tolerance in T. pyramis and the interaction between temperature and salinity on metabolism. The adaptability of T. pyramis was assessed with mortality, respiration, and nitrogen excretion. This study found that snail (T. pyramis) with body sizes of width 60.30 ± 3.46, 40.12 ± 2.34, and 20.02 ± 1.15 mm tolerated temperatures of 15–35, 15–35, and 20–30°C and salinity of 13–38, 18–38, and 23–33‰, respectively. It demonstrates that larger snails can adapt better to variations in temperature and salinity. Temperature and salinity have a significant effect on the metabolism of snails. Smaller snails have a higher metabolism and are more sensitive to changes in temperature and salinity. Overall, results suggest that seawater with 30°C temperature and 33‰ salinity was suitable for T. pyramis. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal adaptation in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) via changes to the structure of malate dehydrogenase
VL  - 223
IS  - 18
AB  - In honeybees there are three alleles of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase gene: F, M and S. Allele frequencies are correlated with environmental temperature, suggesting that the alleles have temperature-dependent fitness benefits. We determined the enzyme activity of each allele across a range of temperatures in vitro The F and S alleles have higher activity and are less sensitive to high temperatures than the M allele, which loses activity after incubation at temperatures found in the thorax of foraging bees in hot climates. Next, we predicted the protein structure of each allele and used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate their molecular flexibility. The M allozyme is more flexible than the S and F allozymes at 50°C, suggesting a plausible explanation for its loss of activity at high temperatures, and has the greatest structural flexibility at 15°C, suggesting that it can retain some enzyme activity at cooler temperatures. MM bees recovered from 2 h of cold narcosis significantly better than all other genotypes. Combined, these results explain clinal variation in malate dehydrogenase allele frequencies in the honeybee at the molecular level. © 2020. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Modeling climate change effects on species and communities is critical especially in isolated islands. We analyzed the potential effects of climate change on 200 plant species in Puerto Rico under two emission scenarios and in four periods over the twenty-first century. Our approach was based on ensemble bioclimatic modeling using eight modeling algorithms and community richness analysis. Our findings showed that the probabilities of environmental suitability decline for wet climate species and increase for drier and warm climate species in the future periods under both emission scenarios, with stronger effects under the higher emission scenario. Expansion of dry climate species to higher elevations appears to be a prominent response of species to climatic change in the island based on changes in environmental suitability but the actual species redistribution will be influenced by their life histories, potential adaptation, dispersal abilities, species introductions, and species interactions. This potential movement leads to a spatial pattern of species richness at site level that shows a positive relationship with elevation, which becomes stronger in the later periods of the century. The spatial pattern of species richness, if combined with single species projections, can provide critical information for conservation management in the island. Conservation management can support island-wide biological diversity by protecting the wet climate species on the uplands. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Optimizing reproductive performance and embryonic development of red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii by manipulating water temperature
VL  - 510
SP  - 32-42
AB  - Aquaculture of red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852), has developed rapidly worldwide in recent years with promising prospects. However, limited knowledge about temperature effects on reproductive performance and embryonic development has hindered the development of crayfish aquaculture. The two present studies were conducted to identify optimal water temperatures (17 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C) for reproductive performance (experiment 1) and embryonic development (experiment 2) of P. clarkii. Totally, there were 12 replicates, with 480 adults and embryos from 60 ovigerous crayfish selected for experiment 1 and 2, respectively. In the first experiment, the survival of adult crayfish was not significantly affected by the temperatures tested. However, significantly higher feeding rates, spawning rates, and fecundity were obtained at 21 degrees C and 25 degrees C when compared to those at 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Polynomial models and loess regression fitted to the experimental data showed that highest spawning rates and fecundity occurred at 21 degrees C while shortest duration from mating to spawning was found at 33 degrees C. In the second experiment, we found that optimal embryonic development was at 25 degrees C with shorter hatching time and no abnormalities observed. However, while embryos showed abnormalities and subsequently died at 29 degrees C and 33 degrees C. We further built a temperature-dependent developmental model for P. clarkii embryos: D (developmental time, days) = 3,140,837(T-2.03)(-3.76). Based on these results, the temperature range 21 degrees C - 25 degrees C was recommended for adult crayfish reproduction and 25 degrees C was recommended for embryonic development. This study indicates that manipulating water temperature is an effective alternative to current artificial reproduction techniques (e.g. eyestalk ablation and injection hormones) to induce spawning and embryonic development and thus provides mass production of juvenile P. clarkii for aquaculture.

TI  - Evolution, not transgenerational plasticity, explains the adaptive divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance across an urban–rural temperature cline
VL  - 12
IS  - 8
SP  - 1678-1687
AB  - Although studies increasingly disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary responses to environmental change, few test for transgenerational plasticity in this context. Here, we evaluate whether phenotypic divergence of acorn ants in response to urbanization is driven by transgenerational plasticity rather than evolution. F2 generation worker ants (offspring of laboratory-born queens) exhibited similar divergence among urban and rural populations as field-born worker ants, suggesting that evolutionary divergence rather than transgenerational plasticity was primarily responsible for shifts toward higher heat tolerance and diminished cold tolerance in urban acorn ants. Hybrid offspring from matings between urban and rural populations also indicated that evolutionary divergence was likely the primary mechanism underlying population differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, thermal tolerance traits were not inherited either maternally or paternally in the hybrid pairings as would be expected for strong parental or grandparental effects mediated through a single sex. Urban–rural hybrid offspring provided further insight into the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation. Heat tolerance of hybrids more resembled the urban–urban pure type, whereas cold tolerance of hybrids more resembled the rural–rural pure type. As a consequence, thermal tolerance traits in this system appear to be influenced by dominance rather than being purely additive traits, and heat and cold tolerance might be determined by separate genes. Though transgenerational plasticity does not appear to explain divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance, its role in divergence of other traits and across other urbanization gradients merits further study. © 2019 The Authors Evolutionary Applications Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Teleconnections and local weather orchestrate the reproduction of tit species in the Carpathian Basin
VL  - 50
IS  - 12
AB  - Variation in climatic conditions is an important driving force of ecological processes. Populations are under selection to respond to climatic changes with respect to phenology of the annual cycle (e.g. breeding, migration) and life-history. As teleconnections can reflect climate on a global scale, the responses of terrestrial animals are often investigated in relation to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation. However, investigation of other teleconnections and local climate is often neglected. In this study, we examined over a 33-year period the relationships between four teleconnections (El Niño-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, East Atlantic Pattern), local weather parameters (temperature and precipitation) and reproduction in great tits Parus major and blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus in the Carpathian Basin, Hungary. Furthermore, we explored how annual variations in the timing of food availability were correlated with breeding performance. In both species, annual laying date was negatively associated with the Arctic Oscillation. The date of peak abundance of caterpillars was negatively associated with local temperatures in December–January, while laying date was negatively related to January–March temperature. We found that date of peak abundance of caterpillars and laying date of great tits advanced, while in blue tits clutch size decreased over the decades but laying date did not advance. The results suggest that weather conditions during the months that preceded the breeding season, as well as temporally more distant winter conditions, were connected to breeding date. Our results highlight that phenological synchronization to food availability was different between the two tit species, namely it was disrupted in blue tits only. Additionally, the results suggest that in order to find the climatic drivers of the phenological changes of organisms, we should analyze a broader range of global meteorological parameters. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Research on fault diagnosis of transformer based on laser induced fluorescence technology
VL  - 1258
AB  - Transformer fault diagnosis is an indispensable part of normal operation of power equipment. Aiming at the problem that traditional gas chromatography and other methods take a long time to detect fault types, this paper proposes a laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIF) technology, combined with differential mutation brainstorm optimization algorithm (DBSO) to optimize the ELM model to identify transformer fault diagnosis types. Four different transformer oils were selected as experimental samples, including thermal fault oil, electrical fault oil, local damp oil and crude oil. LIF technology was used to obtain different spectral images of four oil samples. Firstly, the obtained fluorescence spectra were pretreated by MSC and Normalize, and the dimensionality was reduced by PLS. Then, the data after dimension reduction are input into the ELM model for training, and the BSO algorithm and DBSO algorithm are used to optimize the parameters of ELM. Finally, the experiments show that the DBSO-ELM model preprocessed by MSC has the highest recognition accuracy, the goodness of fit (R2) is 1, and the mean square error (MSE) reaches 3.205e-31, which is higher than that of ELM model and BSO-ELM model. In the case of the same pre-processing, the fitness values based on the mean square error rate of the training set are lower than those of the other types of recognition algorithm models. Therefore, the MSC-PL S-DBSO-ELM model has the best recognition effect, which can be extended to transformer fault diagnosis and improve the accuracy and safety of power equipment detection.

VL  - 187
SP  - 195-202
AB  - This experimental work focuses on the effect of using an internal cooling coil under a cover glass of basin solar still in order to increase solar productivity. The data collected during the climatic conditions of September and October months in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia is used in this work. The average ambient temperature is recorded around 37°C (±2°C) at noon. The passing water through an internal cooling coil is cooled by a radiator heat exchanger, similar to those used in vehicles. The internal cooling coil used as an additional condensation surface with a cover glass. The droplets formed on the internal cooling coil by condensation are collected by a collector pipe in order to run down into a distillation channel. The solar parabolic trough and external film cooling technique is selected in this experimental setup to see its impacts on the internal cooling coil efficiency. Our topic of research on the internal cooling may be regarded as a new experimental technique to improve the productivity of the passive solar still by 25%. The modified solar still using the above techniques combined together increases the efficiency by 20.8% over the conventional solar still. © 2020 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.

TI  - Inter-partner specificity limits the acquisition of thermotolerant symbionts in a model cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
SP  - 2489-2499
AB  - The ability of corals and other cnidarians to survive climate change depends partly on the composition of their endosymbiont communities. The dinoflagellate family Symbiodiniaceae is genetically and physiologically diverse, and one proposed mechanism for cnidarians to acclimate to rising temperatures is to acquire more thermally tolerant symbionts. However, cnidarian-dinoflagellate associations vary in their degree of specificity, which may limit their capacity to alter symbiont communities. Here, we inoculated symbiont-free polyps of the sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida (commonly referred to as ‘Aiptasia’), a model system for the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis, with simultaneous or sequential mixtures of thermally tolerant and thermally sensitive species of Symbiodiniaceae. We then monitored symbiont success (relative proportional abundance) at normal and elevated temperatures across two to four weeks. All anemones showed signs of bleaching at high temperature. During simultaneous inoculations, the native, thermally sensitive Breviolum minutum colonized polyps most successfully regardless of temperature when paired against the non-native but more thermally tolerant Symbiodinium microadriaticum or Durusdinium trenchii. Furthermore, anemones initially colonized with B. minutum and subsequently exposed to S. microadriaticum failed to acquire the new symbiont. These results highlight how partner specificity may place strong limitations on the ability of certain cnidarians to acquire more thermally tolerant symbionts, and hence their adaptive potential under climate change. © 2019, International Society for Microbial Ecology.

TI  - The sensitivity of ginkgo leaf unfolding to the temperature and photoperiod decreases with increasing elevation
VL  - 315
AB  - Climate change substantially affects plant phenology, resulting in earlier vegetation onset across temperate and boreal regions. Phenological shifts caused by warming may alter species interactions across trophic levels because of species-specific responses, and influence the reproductive success of dioecious species if the phenological sensitivity to warming (ST) differs between genders. We used twigs collected from male and female gingko trees at three elevations on Tianmu Mountain in eastern China. The twigs were cultivated in climate chambers to determine the effects of three temperatures (10, 15, and 20 °C) and two photoperiods (8 and 16 h). We observed slightly earlier leaf unfolding dates in male twigs (1 day), and a higher heat requirement (growing degree hours) for leaf unfolding in female (14,334 ± 588 °C) compared to male twigs (13,874 ± 551 °C). Similar responses to temperature (ST = 3.7 days °C−1), photoperiod and elevation were observed across genders. The long photoperiod treatment shortened the time to leaf unfolding by 9.1 days, but temperature and photoperiod effects on leaf unfolding differed significantly depending on the elevation of the donor trees. Specifically, ST was higher (4.17 days °C−1) and the photoperiod effect on ST was larger (decreased by 1.15 days °C−1) at the lowest elevation than at the higher elevations (ST = 3.26 days °C−1; decreased by 0.48 days °C−1). This may be related to environment-induced local adaptations and self-protection mechanisms of trees at high elevations to avoid frost damage. Our results indicate that the photoperiod and genetic adaptations to local environments influenced the warming-induced phenological responses in ginkgo, but these responses were generally similar between the genders. For a given species, individuals in different climates may exhibit different phenological responses to higher temperatures, with individuals in warmer regions likely becoming increasingly limited by the photoperiod as the climate warms further. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nanocomposite of polypyrrol and silica rods-gold nanoparticles core-shell as an ammonia sensor
VL  - 30
IS  - 10
AB  - Ammonia is widely needed in the chemical industry as well as in fertilizers for agriculture. However, in small as well as large quantities, it is not only hazardous for human health but also for our ecosystem. Therefore, ammonia sensing at low concentration with high sensitivity, selectivity and low response time as well as recovery time is important. Here, various nanosensors are fabricated using gold nanoparticles (∼15 nm), silica-gold nanoparticles coreshell particles and coreshell particles embedded in polypyrrol. Comparisons with bare polypyrrol and coreshell particles are also made. In fact, two types of coreshell particles with rod (∼300 nm ×2 μm) shape and spheres (200 nm) of silica were used to anchor gold nanoparticles on them. A comparison showed that silica-gold core-shell particle with silica rods had the highest sensitivity (∼166% @ 130 ppm) amongst all. The sensor is simple to operate (only resistance change is measured), requires no heater as the sensing occurs at room temperature, and showed no response, except for ammonia, to other gases or humidity. It also has a low response time (4 s) and recovery time (10 s) at the lowest (10 ppm) ammonia concentration measured here. Thus, a simple, economical ammonia sensor has been demonstrated here. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Consequences of anthropogenic changes in the sensory landscape of marine animals
VL  - 57
SP  - 229-+
AB  - Human activities are altering a wide range of key marine cues at local and global scales, and it is important to know how animals may respond. Species survival and performance depend on the ability of individuals to successfully extract and interpret information from their environment about preferred abiotic conditions and the presence of prey, predators, competitors, mates and suitable habitats. Such information is made available via a wide range of abiotic and biotic cues that can be detected by organisms through various sensory modalities. Global anthropogenic changes, however, are rapidly altering the sensory landscape (‘cuescape’) and behaviour of animals by modifying the production, transmission and interpretation of critical natural cues, as well as introducing novel anthropogenic cues. To date, most studies have focussed on how animals respond to such changes rather than investigating how the cues themselves are changing. Because the responses that individuals show ultimately depend on factors affecting both the generation and reception of cues, better integration is needed to understand how these factors ultimately affect individual performance. This review provides a holistic assessment of how multiple cues (e.g. sounds, visual cues, chemicals, salinity, temperature and electromagnetism) are being altered at different spatial and temporal scales in marine habitats. Natural cuescapes are being modified by humans and novel anthropogenic cues are being introduced into the ocean, both of which can directly and indirectly alter the diversity and strength of natural cues. Examples are provided of how species might respond to such changes, focussing on what coping and adaptation mechanisms are available for species to persist in a future ocean. While ‘sensory generalist’ species may prevail in marine environments with diminishing or masked natural cues, some ‘sensory specialists’ might sustain themselves via sensory compensation, behavioural plasticity or avoidance of detrimental cues in the short term, or via genetic adaptation in the longer term. Due to the rapid loss of natural cuescapes, alternative research agendas are needed to monitor and measure multicue changes throughout the oceans. Together with mechanistic and field studies of animal responses, such research can inform management by identifying the species most at risk and the areas that may be suitable for cuescape preservation. © S.

TI  - Differences in thermal tolerance between parental species could fuel thermal adaptation in hybrid wood ants
VL  - 198
IS  - 2
SP  - 278-294
AB  - Genetic variability is essential for adaptation and could be acquired via hybridization with a closely related lineage. We use ants to investigate thermal adaptation and the link between temperature and genetic variation arising from hybridization. We test for differences in cold and heat tolerance between Finnish Formica polyctena and Formica aquilonia wood ants and their naturally occurring hybrids. Using workers, we find that the parental individuals differ in both cold and heat tolerances and express thermal limits that reflect their global distributions. Hybrids, however, cannot combine thermal tolerance of parental species as they have the same heat tolerance as F. polyctena but not the same cold tolerance as F. aquilonia. We then focus on a single hybrid population to investigate the relationship between temperature variation and genetic variation across 16 years using reproductive individuals. On the basis of the thermal tolerance results, we expected the frequency of putative F. polyctena alleles to increase in warm years and F. aquilonia alleles to increase in cold years. We find support for this in hybrid males but not in hybrid females. These results contribute to understanding the outcomes of hybridization, which may be sex specific or depend on the environment. Furthermore, genetic variability resulting from hybridization could help hybrid wood ants cope with changing thermal conditions. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Delayed mortality effects of cold fronts during the winter season on Aedes aegypti in a temperate region
VL  - 95
AB  - The expansion of the invasive mosquito Aedes aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae) towards temperate regions in the Americas is causing concern because of its public health implications. As for other insects, the distribution limits of Ae. aegypti have been suggested to be related to minimum temperatures and to be controlled mainly by cold tolerance. The aim of this study was to assess the daily mortality of immature stages of Ae. aegypti under natural winter conditions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in relation to preceding thermal conditions. The experiment was performed outdoors, and one cohort of larvae was started each week for 16 weeks, and reared up to the emergence of the adults. Three times a week, larvae, pupae and emerged adults were counted, and these data were used to calculate the daily mortality of larvae, pupae and adults and to analyze their relationship with thermal conditions. The results showed that mortality was generally low, with a few peaks of high mortality after cold front events. The mortality of pupae and larvae showed a higher correlation with the cooling degree hours of previous days than with the minimum, maximum or mean temperatures. Pupae and adults showed to be more vulnerable to low temperatures than larvae. A delay in mortality was observed in relation to the low temperature events, with a proportion of individuals dying in a later stage after the end of the cold front. These results suggest that thermal conditions during cold fronts in Buenos Aires are close to the tolerance limit of the local Ae. aegypti population. The wide range of responses of different individuals suggests that low winter temperatures may constitute a selective force, leading the population to a higher tolerance to low temperatures, which might favor the further expansion of this species towards colder regions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - High temperature water activity as a key factor influencing survival of Salmonella Enteritidis PT30 in thermal processing
VL  - 98
SP  - 520-528
AB  - Salmonella in low-moisture foods has enhanced thermal tolerance and is difficult to control. The objective of this research was to study relationship between thermal tolerance of Salmonella Enteritidis PT30 and water activity (aw) of food matrices measured at elevated temperatures during thermal processing. Three different foods were selected for this study. They were wheat flour (WF), almond flour (AF) and whey protein (WP), representing carbohydrate-, fat-, and protein-rich food systems, respectively. Pre-equilibrated powders were inoculated independently with S. Enteritidis PT30 and conditioned to aw of 0.25, 0.45, 0.60, and 0.80 at room temperature (∼20 °C). Aluminum thermal death time test cells (TDT cells) and newly designed thermal aw cells (TAC, with controlled aw) were heated at 80 °C to determine D-values (the time needed to active 90% of target bacteria) of S. Enteritidis PT30 in the three powders. Water activities of powders in the TDT cells at 80 °C were calculated to be between 0.41 and 0.89, while in the TAC were controlled to 0.32, 0.50, 0.63, and 0.81, respectively. Results showed that D80°C-values of S. Enteritidis PT30 decreased exponentially with increasing aw of foods at the treatment temperature 80 °C regardless of the food matrices and the testing methods. Thus, it is critical to understand how aw of a food matrix changes with temperature when selecting appropriate treatment conditions for thermal control of Salmonella in low-moisture foods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 168
AB  - Fusel oil was used as a source of isoamyl alcohol in the synthesis of biolubricant by esterification with oleic acid catalyzed by different sources of lipase immobilized on poly(styrene/divinylbenzene) copolymer resin. In preliminary tests, Rhizopus oryzae lipase showed satisfactory performance, providing high molar conversion of the starting materials (&gt;90% in 24 h of reaction), and was selected for subsequent experiments. The optimal conditions for isoamyl oleate production by immobilized R. oryzae lipase were 1:1.5 ratio of fusel oil to oleic acid and reaction temperature of 45°C. Continuous runs were carried out in a two-stage packed-bed reactor coupled to a water extraction column filled with molecular sieves. Each reactor stage was loaded with 2.6 g of immobilized lipase and then fed with fusel oil and oleic acid at a 1:1.5 molar ratio in the presence of isooctane. The performance of the proposed system was tested at a space time of 10.2 h, resulting in a mean ester productivity of 292.20 ± 18.46 µmol g−1 min−1 and biocatalyst half-life of 179.6 h. The properties of purified samples were in accordance with standard requirements for biolubricants. © 2021

TI  - Estimating population size and survival of adult northern pike (Esox lucius) in Lower Green Bay
VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 298-309
AB  - Complex life history behaviours like spawning migrations can complicate population assessments. However, predictable aggregation of populations at certain times of year (e.g. at spawning grounds) presents an effective way to sample species that are otherwise spatially widespread. From 2014 to 2019, a mark-recapture study on Green Bay northern pike (Esox lucius) entering a spawning wetland was used to estimate apparent survival and population size using Bayesian inference and the Cormack–Jolly–Seber model. Population estimates and apparent survival varied from 446 to 1949 and 0.22 (males in 2017) to 0.63 (males in 2015), respectively, among years. Apparent survival also increased with maximum mean daily water temperature. Estimated capture probability was consistently low across years (<30%) despite a sampling method with high capture efficiency of fish present at the wetland, suggesting Green Bay northern pike may be exhibiting low spawning site fidelity or other life history behaviours, like skipped spawning, which reduce their capture probability at a single wetland over time. Further, spawning site selection and timing may respond to water temperatures. Surveying multiple sites could further elucidate important life history traits while refining estimates of population size and structure in large systems. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Hot metal temperature forecasting at steel plant using multivariate adaptive regression splines
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Steelmaking has been experiencing continuous challenges and advances concerning process methods and control models. Integrated steelmaking begins with the hot metal, a crude liquid iron that is produced in the blast furnace (BF). The hot metal is then pre-treated and transferred to the basic lined oxygen furnace (BOF) for refining, experiencing a non-easily predictable temperature drop along the BF–BOF route. Hot metal temperature forecasting at the BOF is critical for the environment, productivity, and cost. An improved multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model is proposed for hot metal temperature forecasting. Selected process variables and past temperature measurements are used as predictors. A moving window approach for the training dataset is chosen to avoid the need for periodic re-tuning of the model. There is no precedent for the application of MARS techniques to BOF steelmaking and a comparable temperature forecasting model of the BF–BOF interface has not been published yet. The model was trained, tested, and validated using a plant process dataset with 12,195 registers, covering one production year. The mean absolute error of predictions is 11.2 °C, which significantly improves those of previous modelling attempts. Moreover, model training and prediction are fast enough for a reliable on-line process control. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Hybrid selection method of feature variables and prediction modeling for municipal solid waste incinerator temperature
VL  - 21
IS  - 23
AB  - It is difficult to establish an accurate mechanism model for prediction incinerator tem-peratures due to the comprehensive complexity of the municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration process. In this paper, feature variables of incineration temperature are selected by combining with mutual information (MI), genetic algorithms (GAs) and stochastic configuration networks (SCNs), and the SCN-based incinerator temperature model is obtained simultaneously. Firstly, filter feature selection is realized by calculating the MI value between each feature variable and the incinerator temperature from historical data. Secondly, the fitness function of GAs is defined by the root mean square error of the incinerator temperature obtained by training SCNs, and features obtained by MI methods are searched iteratively to complete the wrapper feature selection, where the SCN-based incinerator temperature prediction model is obtained. Finally, the proposed model is verified by MSW incinerator temperature historical data. The results show that the SCN-based prediction model using the hybrid selection method can better predict the change trend of incinerator temperature, which proves that the SCNs has great development potential in the field of prediction modeling. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of temperature and salinity stress on DNA methylation in a highly invasive marine invertebrate, the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum
VL  - 2018
IS  - 6
AB  - Environmentally induced epigenetic changes may contribute to phenotypic plasticity, increase adaptive potential in changing environments, and play a key role in the establishment and spread of invasive species in new habitats. In this study, we used methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) to assess environmentally induced DNA methylation changes in a globally invasive clonal ascidian, Didemnum vexillum. We tested the effect of increasing temperature (19, 25 and 27 °C) and decreasing salinity (34, 32, 30, 28 and 26 practical salinity units (PSU)) on global DNA methylation, growth and survival rates. Exposure to 27 °Cresulted in significant changes in DNA methylation over time. Growth also decreased in colonies exposed to high temperatures, suggesting they were under thermal stress. In contrast, no differences in growth nor DNA methylation patterns were observed in colonies exposed to a decreasing salinity gradient, potentially due to prior adaptation. The results of this study show that environmental stress can induce significant global DNA methylation changes in an invasive marine invertebrate on very rapid timescales, and that this response varies depending on the type, magnitude, and duration of the stressor. Changes in genomic DNA methylation and the rate of growth may act to 'buy survival time' under stressful conditions, expanding the distribution limits of this globally invasive species. © 2018 Hawes et al.

TI  - Low-Temperature Conversion of Alcohols into Bulky Nanoporous Graphene and Pure Hydrogen with Robust Selectivity on CaO
VL  - 31
IS  - 16
AB  - The direct conversion of biorenewable alcohols into value-added graphene and pure hydrogen (H 2 ) at benign conditions is an important challenge, especially, considering the open carbon-reduced cycle. In this study, it is demonstrated that inexpensive calcium oxide (CaO, from eggshells) can transform alcohols into bulky nanoporous graphene and pure hydrogen (≈99%) with robust selectivity at the temperature as low as 500 °C. Consequently, the growth of graphene can follow the direction of alcohol flow and uniformly penetrate into bulky nanoporous CaO platelets longer than 1 m without clogging. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that alcohol molecules can be catalytically carbonized on the surface of CaO at low temperature. The concept of the comprehensive utilization of biomass-derived alcohols offers a carbon-negative cycle for mitigating global warming and the energy demand. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Warm developmental temperatures induce non-adaptive plasticity in the intrasexually selected colouration of a dragonfly
VL  - 45
IS  - 3
SP  - 663-670
AB  - 1. When the breeding environment fluctuates across generations, reproductive traits may evolve plasticity that optimises the balance between survival and mating success for the prevailing environment. 2. For sexually selected colouration, this balance can depend on environmental temperatures. Accordingly, breeding colouration often co-varies with temperature through space and time. However, whether such traits exhibit plasticity in response to environmental temperatures is poorly understood. 3. In the present study, a dragonfly (Pachydiplax longipennis) was reared under ambient or experimentally warmed conditions and tested for plasticity in its intrasexually selected wing colouration. Although wing colouration improves male territorial success, these advantages are smaller under warmer conditions than cooler conditions. It was therefore predicted that males reared under the ambient thermal conditions of the study site (Cleveland, Ohio) would develop more wing colouration than those reared under experimentally warmed conditions. 4. Contrary to this prediction, males reared in warm larval temperatures produced more wing colouration. Thus, although the secondary sexual colouration of this species displays some thermal plasticity, it does not appear to be adaptive relative to the known thermal variation of intrasexual selection in this population. 5. Given that the environment often determines the strength and direction of sexual selection, future studies should consider the potential for non-adaptive, and even maladaptive, developmental plasticity in the sexually selected traits of insects. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society

VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SP  - 1122-1136
AB  - Temperature plays a significant role in the survival and transmission of SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2. To reveal the binding differences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at different temperatures at atomic level, 20 molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes at five selected temperatures, i.e. 200, 250, 273, 300 and 350 K. The analyses on structural flexibility and conformational distribution indicated that the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was more stable than that of the SARS-CoV RBD at all investigated temperatures. Then, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area and solvated interaction energy approaches were combined to estimate the differences in binding affinity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2; it is found that the binding ability of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was stronger than that to the SARS-CoV RBD at five temperatures, and the main reason for promoting such binding differences is electrostatic and polar interactions between RBDs and ACE2. Finally, the hotspot residues facilitating the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2, the key differential residues contributing to the difference in binding and the interaction mechanism of differential residues that exist at all investigated temperatures were analyzed and compared in depth. The current work would provide a molecular basis for better understanding of the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and offer better theoretical guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - The role of climate and maternal manipulation in determining and maintaining reproductive mode in Liolaemus lizards
VL  - 317
IS  - 2
SP  - 101-113
AB  - Evolutionary transitions in life-history strategies, such as the shift from egg-laying to live birth (viviparity) are of great interest to evolutionary biologists. In squamate reptiles, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain viviparity including the cold climate hypothesis, maternal manipulation hypothesis, hypoxia hypothesis, and several others. We used two approaches: first we studied 45 species of Liolaemus, a genus where nearly 50% of species are viviparous, using a diverse ecophysiological dataset to examine the cold climate and maternal manipulation hypotheses. We collected environmental thermal data (accounting for elevational differences among species), physiological traits including preferred body temperature and its coefficient of variation as an indicator of precision in thermoregulation. Additionally, we collected standard metabolic rates for 23 of the 45 species. In one clade (the darwinii group of species) with both reproductive modes, we ran our second approach. We tested for differences in thermal physiology and metabolic rates between viviparous and oviparous species during pregnancy and non-pregnancy periods. The cold climate hypothesis received strong support because viviparous species occur in sites with colder air temperatures (including areas at both higher elevations and latitudes) compared with oviparous species. Our detailed analysis showed that the maternal manipulation hypothesis also is supported; pregnant viviparous females show lower variation in their selected temperature. Our evidence suggests that the Andean orogeny is likely to have played a key role in the diversification of Liolaemus lizards and the evolution of viviparity in this clade may have been driven by a variety of physiological advantages accrued at different stages of embryogenesis and over evolutionary time. Thus, historical climate changes may have led to egg retention and may have been accompanied by other adaptations such as thermoregulation precision. © 2022 The Zoological Society of London.

TI  - Anticipated effects of abiotic environmental change on intraspecific social interactions
VL  - 96
IS  - 6
SP  - 2661-2693
AB  - Social interactions are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. A variety of ecological and evolutionary processes are dependent on social interactions, such as movement, disease spread, information transmission, and density-dependent reproduction and survival. Social interactions, like any behaviour, are context dependent, varying with environmental conditions. Currently, environments are changing rapidly across multiple dimensions, becoming warmer and more variable, while habitats are increasingly fragmented and contaminated with pollutants. Social interactions are expected to change in response to these stressors and to continue to change into the future. However, a comprehensive understanding of the form and magnitude of the effects of these environmental changes on social interactions is currently lacking. Focusing on four major forms of rapid environmental change currently occurring, we review how these changing environmental gradients are expected to have immediate effects on social interactions such as communication, agonistic behaviours, and group formation, which will thereby induce changes in social organisation including mating systems, dominance hierarchies, and collective behaviour. Our review covers intraspecific variation in social interactions across environments, including studies in both the wild and in laboratory settings, and across a range of taxa. The expected responses of social behaviour to environmental change are diverse, but we identify several general themes. First, very dry, variable, fragmented, or polluted environments are likely to destabilise existing social systems. This occurs as these conditions limit the energy available for complex social interactions and affect dissimilar phenotypes differently. Second, a given environmental change can lead to opposite responses in social behaviour, and the direction of the response often hinges on the natural history of the organism in question. Third, our review highlights the fact that changes in environmental factors are not occurring in isolation: multiple factors are changing simultaneously, which may have antagonistic or synergistic effects, and more work should be done to understand these combined effects. We close by identifying methodological and analytical techniques that might help to study the response of social interactions to changing environments, highlight consistent patterns among taxa, and predict subsequent evolutionary change. We expect that the changes in social interactions that we document here will have consequences for individuals, groups, and for the ecology and evolution of populations, and therefore warrant a central place in the study of animal populations, particularly in an era of rapid environmental change. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 31

SP  - 2726-2736
AB  - Climate change has emerged as an increasingly important threat to freshwater systems. To cope with rapidly changing thermal regimes, freshwater fishes must either relocate or adjust through genetic adaptation and/or phenotypic plasticity. Short-term responses to elevated water temperature have been well studied in freshwater fishes; however, far less is understood about change induced by long-term exposure. Furthermore, few studies have investigated the effects of temperature on already imperilled species, which may be more sensitive to environmental change. This study investigated the effects of rearing temperature on critical thermal maximum (CTmax), agitation temperature (Tag, temperature at which fish show behavioural signs of thermal stress) and gill size in pugnose shiner, Notropis anogenus, a threatened species in Canada. Juvenile pugnose shiner were reared for 4 months across five different ecologically relevant temperatures. CTmax and Tag were measured under normoxia and acute exposure to hypoxia to test for oxygen sensitivity of the upper thermal limits in this species. CTmax increased with elevated water temperature. Tag also increased with rearing temperature and occurred, on average, 4.3°C above acclimation temperatures. The CTmax and Tag were lower when fish were exposed acutely to hypoxia. Interestingly, gill size (e.g. total gill filament length) increased with rearing temperature, which may increase oxygen uptake capacity and support increased metabolic demands of warmer waters. Overall, pugnose shiner show plasticity in several traits in response to long-term exposure to elevated water temperature that may facilitate persistence in warmer waters. However, acute hypoxia exposure reduced thermal tolerance, stressing the importance of evaluating interactive effects of multiple stressors. Identifying source populations of pugnose shiner with greater thermal tolerance or implementing captive breeding under higher temperature regimes may improve the success of re-introduction efforts in the face of climate change, but the consequences to fitness of increased thermal tolerance should be examined. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The genomic basis for colonizing the freezing Southern Ocean revealed by Antarctic toothfish and Patagonian robalo genomes
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - Background: The Southern Ocean is the coldest ocean on Earth but a hot spot of evolution. The bottom-dwelling Eocene ancestor of Antarctic notothenioid fishes survived polar marine glaciation and underwent adaptive radiation, forming >120 species that fill all water column niches today. Genome-wide changes enabling physiological adaptations and the rapid expansion of the Antarctic notothenioids remain poorly understood. Results: We sequenced and compared 2 notothenioid genomes - the cold-adapted and neutrally buoyant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni and the basal Patagonian robalo Eleginops maclovinus, representing the temperate ancestor. We detected >200 protein gene families that had expanded and thousands of genes that had evolved faster in the toothfish, with diverse cold-relevant functions including stress response, lipid metabolism, protein homeostasis, and freeze resistance. Besides antifreeze glycoprotein, an eggshell protein had functionally diversified to aid in cellular freezing resistance. Genomic and transcriptomic comparisons revealed proliferation of selcys-transfer RNA genes and broad transcriptional upregulation across anti-oxidative selenoproteins, signifying their prominent role in mitigating oxidative stress in the oxygen-rich Southern Ocean. We found expansion of transposable elements, temporally correlated to Antarctic notothenioid diversification. Additionally, the toothfish exhibited remarkable shifts in genetic programs towards enhanced fat cell differentiation and lipid storage, and promotion of chondrogenesis while inhibiting osteogenesis in bone development, collectively contributing to the achievement of neutral buoyancy and pelagicism. Conclusions: Our study revealed a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary changes essential for Antarctic notothenioid cold adaptation and ecological expansion. The 2 genomes are valuable resources for further exploration of mechanisms underlying the spectacular notothenioid radiation in the coldest marine environment. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

TI  - Life cycle of oil palm bagworm, metisa plana walker (Lepidoptera: Psychidae) at different temperatures under controlled environment
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 151-165
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors that affects insect life cycle. Unpredictable local climate changes in Malaysia had caused the outbreak of bagworm, Metisa plana for over five decades. This had led to a major problem of oil palm yield production. Hence, it is significant to study the nature of this pest especially their life cycle to prevent further outbreak. This study is expected to provide M. plana surveillance program planning that can prevent massive damage of defoliation from occurring. The application to control bagworms should be applied at the right time especially during the crucial climate changes that could trigger the bagworm’s life cycle. The main objective in this study is to evaluate the life cycle of oil palm bagworm, M. plana in different degrees of temperature. This study was conducted under controlled conditions in the laboratory from October 2017 until October 2018 with different ranges of temperature between 16°C to 40°C. The duration in days from egg to adult was observed and recorded daily. This study found that bagworms were able to adapt and complete life cycles at a selected temperature between 20°C to 36°C, but did not survive at 16°C and 40°C. The duration observed of the completed life cycle of this species significantly decreased with the increase in temperature. The duration in days of the completed life cycle of temperature at 20ºC, 24ºC, 27.5ºC, 32ºC and 36ºC was approximately about 122.2±0.87, 108.4±1.74, 99.6±1.89, 81.2±1.70 and 64.8±1.25 respectively. The optimum temperature of bagworm’s survival rate was at 32°C with a total percentage at 63.48%. This study provides basic fundamental information on the life cycle of bagworm, M. plana especially for oil palm growers. Hence, growers will have better pest management plans to control this bagworm species related to different temperatures and prevent yield loss of fresh fruit bunch (FBB) of oil palm plantation per acre. © 2021, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Climate impacts agricultural productivity and the distribution of crops grown around the world. Because the United States is a leader in food exports, climate change impacts in the United States have the potential to disproportionately affect the global food supply. Given the change in temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide occurring now and expected into the future, the potential for agroecosystems to produce sufficient quantities of food to meet world demand is in question. To address this question, the concept of yield gaps, as the difference between potential yield (PY) and farm or actual yield (FY), provides a framework for the evaluation of progress in production. Across all crops, there have been increases in both PY (breeding, technological advances) and FY (implementation of improved genetic resources and management practices); however, climate change threatens to diminish those advances due to temperature stresses and more uncertain precipitation patterns. Climate change will not only directly increase the yield gap in the future but also further indirectly widen the yield gap by the degradation of the soil resource due to interactions of climate and management. Modern agricultural systems must adapt to become more resilient to climate change, and the tools to this adaptation involve genetics, environmental monitoring, and evolving management practices. However, progress can only begin once agricultural systems are managed from a more holistic view of providing both quantity and quality of a more diverse mixture of agricultural crops that will provide sustainability, equity, nutrition, and a secure food future. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Wear performance of hydroxyapatite coatings deposited on aisi 304l using detonation gun spray
VL  - 32
SP  - 304-310
AB  - Hydroxyapatite (HA) was obtained from eggshells using selective thermal treatment. The properties like mechanical strength, biocompatibility and adhesion of hydroxyapatite were enhanced by adding titanium oxide (TiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) in two different compositions (HA-10TiO(2)-10Al(2)O(3) (H10T10A) and HA-20TiO(2)-20Al(2)O(3) (H20T20A)). Mechanical performance of the detonation sprayed H10T10A and H20T20A hybrid ceramic powders on AISI 304L SS steel were estimated by pin-on-disc apparatus. A load of 110 N was applied constantly over the pin which slides a linear distance of 2700 m at a linear velocity of 1 m/s at atmospheric temperature. The present investigation shows that the specific wear rate of bare AISI 304L SS was 8.23 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N-m, while those of H20T20A and H10T10A coatings were 0.402 and 0.844 x 10(-5) mm(3)/N-m respectively. The coatings and coating powders were characterized by SEM, XRD and FT-IR, XRD techniques respectively. The results showed that H20T20A coating has higher wear resistance in comparison to HA10T10A.

TI  - Adaptation Potential of Three Psychrotolerant Aquatic Bacteria in the Pan-Okhotsk Region
VL  - 14
IS  - 7
AB  - The Pan-Okhotsk region, which is part of the western North Pacific Ocean, is famous for its active volcanoes, which are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and that enrich the surrounding waters with essential chemicals. Therefore, this region, including the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan, is characterized by rich biota. Bacterioplankton plays a significant part in biological communities and is an indicator of ecosystem function. Analyzing the adaptability of three representatives of the microbiota of the Pan-Okhotsk region was the goal of our investigation. Marinomonas primoryensis KMM3633T (MP), Yersinia ruckeri KMM821 (YR), and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis 598 (YP) from the G.B. Elyakov Pacific Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry were studied by means of genomic and bioinformatic methods. The list of membrane translocator proteins, metabolism pathways, and cold shock and antifreeze proteins that were revealed in the genome of MP characterized this bacterium as being adaptable to free living in marine conditions, even at winter temperatures. The genomic potential of YR and YP makes not only survival in the environment of the Pan-Okhotsk region but also pathogenesis in eukaryotic organisms possible. The data obtained will serve as a basis for further ecosystem monitoring with the help of microbiota research. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Structural and functional responses in widespread distribution of some dominant grasses along climatic elevation gradients
VL  - 289
AB  - The adaptability potential of plants enables them to colonize diverse habitats along elevation gradients. Studying these adaptive traits and linking them to environmental attributes provide useful information to understand limitations imposed by elevation gradients on distribution of plant species. To meet these objectives, six most dominant perennial grass species with broad distributional ranges along an elevation gradient from 300–1400 m a.s.l in northern Punjab (Pakistan) were selected for the present study. Dominance of different grass species were linked to proportion of parenchyma, sclerification of aerial plant parts, size of vascular tissue, leaf thickness, and size and density of trichomes. Chrysopogon serrulatus dominated all elevations except the highest one, which was directly linked to increased root area and high proportion of storage parenchyma, vascular region, large metaxylem vessels, increased sclerification in aerial parts, and size and density of trichomes. Cymbopogon jwarancusa dominated lower and middle elevations (300–1000 m) and exhibited increased sclerification in stem and leaves, higher vascular bundle area, and, increased leaf sheath thickness. Lognormal distribution exhibited a non-linear response for eco-morphological and physiological characteristics with decreasing pattern along increase in elevation. Physiological traits responded negatively in response to climatic variables. Root anatomical traits exhibited nonlinear response at lower elevation, while stem traits responded positively at medium elevational gradients (700–1000 m). Leaf sheath showed positive response with elevation and temperature. In conclusion, morpho-physiological and anatomical modifications were specific to grasses studied, which contributed differently towards growth and survival along elevation gradient. © 2022

TI  - Episodic bimodal magmatism at an active continental margin due to Paleo-Pacific Plate subduction: A case study from the southern segment of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone, eastern China
VL  - 328
SP  - 159-181
AB  - Volcanic rocks in the southern part of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ), eastern China, provide key evidence for the connection between spatially and temporally related pulses of Cretaceous magmatism, activity on the TLFZ, and the dynamics of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. We identify two stages of bimodal volcanism in the Chaohu-Lujiang segment, southern TLFZ, based on lithological assemblages and precise isotopic ages. The Early Cretaceous (125-121 Ma) volcanic rocks are fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites and basalts, whereas the Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks (97-83 Ma) range in composition from porphyritic andesites and trachydacites to rhyolites. The Early Cretaceous rhyolites display strongly negative Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -16.3 to -16.1, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -24.1 to -17.9). The most likely source rocks of the fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites are metaigneous rocks of the Feidong Complex. The Early Cretaceous potassic basalts (K2O/Na2O = 1.5-3.4, epsilon(Nd)(t) = 9.0) exhibit more enriched isotopic compositions than the Late Cretaceous sodic porphyritic andesites (K2O/Na2O = 0.6-0.8, epsilon(Nd)(t) = -5.6, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -15.1 to -6.8), indicating derivation from heterogeneously enriched lithospheric mantle. This heterogeneity is ascribed to derivation from more fertile and isotopically enriched mantle sources with lower solidus temperatures. Modeling of selected elements reveals that the Late Cretaceous trachydacites (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -12.2 to -8.2, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -16.5 to -6.4) originated by mixing between coeval mafic and felsic magmas. The most negative (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -18.8 to -17.1, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -20.5 to -4.7) isotopic compositions, along with Neoproterozoic inherited zircons within the Late Cretaceous rhyolites, indicate derivation from lower crust of the South China Block. We suggest that the Early Cretaceous bimodal volcanic rocks formed in an extensional backarc setting induced by retreat of the subducting Izanagi slab. However, the TLFZ became a focus of Late Cretaceous bimodal volcanism due to weak far field extension caused by the slow northward motion of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Moreover, the high velocity and low angle of subduction of the Izanagi slab were the main driving mechanisms behind an Early Cretaceous transpressional event that separated the two stages of bimodal volcanism.

AB  - In seasonally variable environments, phenotypic plasticity in phenology may be critical for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions. Using an 18-generation longitudinal dataset from natural damselfly populations, we show that phenology has strongly advanced. Individual fitness data suggest this is likely an adaptive response towards a temperature-dependent optimum. A laboratory experiment revealed that developmental plasticity qualitatively matches the temperature dependence of selection, partially explaining observed advance in phenology. Expanding our analysis to the macroevolutionary level, we use a database of over 1-million occurrence records and spatiotemporally matched temperature data from 49 Swedish Odonate species to infer macroevolutionary dynamics of phenology. Phenological plasticity was more closely aligned with adaptation for species that have recently colonised northern latitudes, but with higher phenological mismatch at lower latitudes. Our results show that phenological plasticity plays a key role in microevolutionary dynamics within a single species, and such plasticity may have facilitated post-Pleistocene range expansion in this insect clade. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Additional carbon inputs to reach a 4 per 1000 objective in Europe: Feasibility and projected impacts of climate change based on Century simulations of long-term arable experiments
VL  - 18
IS  - 13
SP  - 3981-4004
AB  - The 4 per 1000 initiative aims to maintain and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks for soil fertility, food security, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. One way to enhance SOC stocks is to increase carbon (C) inputs to the soil. In this study, we assessed the amount of organic C inputs that are necessary to reach a target of SOC stocks increase by 4 parts per thousand yr(-1) on average, for 30 years, at 14 long-term agricultural sites in Europe. We used the Century model to simulate SOC stocks and assessed the required level of additional C inputs to reach the 4 per 1000 target at these sites. Then, we analyzed how this would change under future scenarios of temperature increase. Initial stocks were simulated assuming steady state. We compared modeled C inputs to different treatments of additional C used on the experimental sites (exogenous organic matter addition and one treatment with different crop rotations). The model was calibrated to fit the control plots, i.e. conventional management without additional C inputs from exogenous organic matter or changes in crop rotations, and was able to reproduce the SOC stock dynamics. We found that, on average among the selected experimental sites, annual C inputs will have to increase by 43.15 +/- 5.05 %, which is 0.66 +/- 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard error), with respect to the initial C inputs in the control treatment. The simulated amount of C input required to reach the 4 %0 SOC increase was lower than or similar to the amount of C input actually used in the majority of the additional C input treatments of the long-term experiments. However, Century might be overestimating the effect of additional C inputs on SOC stocks. At the experimental sites, we found that treatments with additional C inputs were increasing by 0.25 % on average. This means that the C inputs required to reach the 4 per 1000 target might actually be much higher. Furthermore, we estimated that annual C inputs will have to increase even more due to climate warming, that is 54 % more and 120 % more for a 1 and 5 degrees C warming, respectively. We showed that modeled C inputs required to reach the target depended linearly on the initial SOC stocks, raising concern on the feasibility of the 4 per 1000 objective in soils with a higher potential contribution to C sequestration, that is soils with high SOC stocks. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks at a large scale and in a future with a warmer climate.

VL  - 33

AB  - Population-scale responses of key ecological traits to local environmental conditions provide insight into their adaptive potential. In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), short-term, individual developmental responses to the incubation environment have long-term consequences for populations. We took a model-based approach to study within- and among-population variation in the physiological components of TSD in 12 populations of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We used laboratory and field incubation data to quantify variation in thermal reaction norms at both population and clutch scales, focusing on the pivotal temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio (P) and the transitional range of incubation temperatures (TRTs) that produce mixed sex ratios. Defying theoretical expectations, among-population variation in P was not convincingly explained by geography or local thermal conditions. However, within some populations, P varied by '5°C at the clutch scale, indicating that the temperature sensitivity of gonadal differentiation can vary substantially among individual nesting females. In addition, the TRT was wider at lower latitudes, suggesting responsiveness to local incubation conditions. Our results provide a potential explanation for discrepancies observed between constant-temperature experimental results and outcomes of fluctuating incubation conditions experienced in natural nests, exposing important knowledge gaps in our understanding of local adaptation in TSD and identifying shortcomings of traditional laboratory studies. Understanding individual variation and the timing of gonadal differentiation is likely to be far more useful in understanding local adaptation than previously acknowledged.

TI  - Uncovering the contribution of epigenetics to plant phenotypic variation in Mediterranean ecosystems
VL  - 20
SP  - 38-49
AB  - Epigenetic signals can affect plant phenotype and fitness and be stably inherited across multiple generations. Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in the mechanisms of plant response to the environment, without altering DNA sequence. As plants cannot adapt behaviourally or migrate instantly, such dynamic epigenetic responses may be particularly crucial for survival of plants within changing and challenging environments, such as the Mediterranean-Type Ecosystems (MTEs). These ecosystems suffer recurrent stressful events (warm and dry summers with associated fire regimes) that have selected for plants with similar phenotypic complex traits, resulting in similar vegetation growth forms. However, the potential role of epigenetics in plant adaptation to recurrent stressful environments such as the MTEs has generally been ignored. To understand the full spectrum of adaptive processes in such contexts, it is imperative to prompt study of the causes and consequences of epigenetic variation in natural populations. With this purpose, we review here current knowledge on epigenetic variation in natural populations and the genetic and epigenetic basis of some key traits for plants in the MTEs, namely those traits involved in adaptation to drought, fire and oligotrophic soils. We conclude there is still much to be learned about ‘plant epigenetics in the wild’ and, thus, we propose future research steps in the study of natural epigenetic variation of key traits in the MTEs at different scales. © 2017 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands

TI  - Finding rising stars through hot topics detection
VL  - 115
SP  - 798-813
AB  - Topic modeling methods have usually been applied in the past to identify the research interests of researchers. Observing the scientific growth, the trending topics can be identified as Stable, Hot, or Cold. Finding rising stars (junior researchers, who are at the start of their career) from a bibliometric network is a challenging task, specifically if the researchers have an interest in multiple sub-domains or are working on diverse topics. Existing methods for finding rising stars explore the co-author networks or citation networks, and ignore the textual content, which may help in finding rising stars through hot topics detection over time. A publication contributing to a hot topic can be an indication that the author of that publication may be a rising star and can become an expert in that domain in the future. This study proposes the Hot Topics Rising Star Rank (HTRS-Rank) method for finding rising stars by detecting hot topics. HTRS-Rank finds the junior scholars, who contribute to hot topics at the start of their career and ranks them based on the presence of hot topics in their publications. AMiner five years dataset ranging from 2005-2009 is selected for experimentation. Top 10 researchers are considered to measure the association strength using rank correlation among HTRS-Rank and baseline methods. Experimental results show the efficiency of HTRS-Rank in comparison to the baseline methods. The proposed HTRS Rank (TF-IDF) provides low standard deviation for productivity, citations and sociality as compared to baseline methods for more social and highly cited authors. It is identified that HTRS-Rank (WordNet) emphasizes the semantic similarity of two sentences, whereas HTRS-Rank (TF-IDF) scheme emphasizes the uniqueness or importance of each term, therefore TF-IDF approach performs better than WordNet approach due to having higher correlation with StarRank and WMIRank.

SP  - 174-183
AB  - Leaf anatomical structures of seven Sorbus species at Longcanggou National Forest Park in Sichuan Province were observed by paraffin section method，and the relationship between leaf anatomical structure and environment was discussed in this study. The results showed that：the leaves of seven species were all of typical dorsal-ventral pattern；leaf thickness ranged from 108.16-208.21 μm，significant differences（P<0.01）were observed in the studied species；upper epidermis thickness was greater than the lower，furthermore，papillae were observed in the lower epidermis of pinnate-leaved species；palisade parenchyma was composed of 1-2 layers of cells，the ratio of palisade parenchyma to spongy parenchyma in thickness of S. prattii var. aestivalis was 1.93，and the rest of six species were less than 1 respectively；the vascular bundles of the midrib were all heart-shaped，which were typical collateral vascular bundle；the differences of midrib protuberant degree among species were extremly significant（P<0.01）. Among the anatomical structures，the plasticity of the upper and lower epidermis was the largest，which had strong potential adaptability in the habitat；the midrib had the least plasticity and the overall structure was relatively stable. Palisade parenchyma，spongy parenchyma and midrib were the most different anatomical structures among the seven species. Correlation analysis between leaf anatomical structures and environmental variables indicated that palisade parenchyma thickness，the ratio of palisade parenchyma to spongy parenchyma and cell tense ratio were positively correlated with annual precipitation，precipitation of warmest quarter and altitude（P<0.05），and were negatively correlated with temperature seasonality（P<0.05）；diameter and protuberant degree of midrib were positively correlated with seasonal temperature（P<0.01），and were negatively correlated with annual precipitation，precipitation of warmest quarter and altitude（P<0.05）. The adaptability of leaf anatomical characteristics reflect the survival strategies of seven Sorbus species at Longcanggou National Forest Park. © 2022, Editorial Board of Bulletin of Botanical Research.

TI  - Non-traditional alley tree species for urban conditions
VL  - 1331
SP  - 151
AB  - Changing environmental conditions and various sources of stress have negative impacts on the growth, survival, and functionality of urban trees. Growing attention is being paid to the selection of tree species that are resilient and adaptable to urban conditions. The presented research investigates Pyrus pyraster (L.) Burgsd. and Sorbus domestica L. These taxa are not classified as traditional alley tree species. However, in the extreme environments of urban settlements with a high risk of soil drought, their plasticity and adaptive potential can be exploited. Long-lived and wind-pollinated tree species are generally presumed to have broad phenotypic plasticity. According to the results of our previous research, these species are tolerant to drought and high temperatures that are considered to be significant stressors for woody plants in urban settlements. The aims of this study were to present the growth forms of the studied species, as well as the possibilities for on-site maintenance of urban trees. In 2017, young plants of generative origin (96 from each taxon) were planted in the experimental area. In 2019, the height, form, and overall survival of these young trees were evaluated. Different tree forms were presented for both species, and different approaches for maintenance and regulation of their growth were investigated. In the coming years, research on tree growth models and the influence of pruning applied to correct young tree defects will be carried out. We expect that wider utilization of these species and their active management will support biodiversity in urban ecosystems. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science.

TI  - Genomic mechanisms of climate adaptation in polyploid bioenergy switchgrass
VL  - 590
IS  - 7846
SP  - 438-444
AB  - Long-term climate change and periodic environmental extremes threaten food and fuel security1 and global crop productivity2–4. Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience5, these approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie productivity and adaptation6—knowledge that has been limited to a small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). Analysis of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate–gene–biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene–trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Comparative Genomic Analyses of the Genus Nesterenkonia Unravels the Genomic Adaptation to Polar Extreme Environments
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - The members of the Nesterenkonia genus have been isolated from various habitats, like saline soil, salt lake, sponge-associated and the human gut, some of which are even located in polar areas. To identify their stress resistance mechanisms and draw a genomic profile across this genus, we isolated four Nesterenkonia strains from the lakes in the Tibetan Plateau, referred to as the third pole, and compared them with all other 30 high-quality Nesterenkonia genomes that are deposited in NCBI. The Heaps’ law model estimated that the pan-genome of this genus is open and the number of core, shell, cloud, and singleton genes were 993 (6.61%), 2782 (18.52%), 4117 (27.40%), and 7132 (47.47%), respectively. Phylogenomic and ANI/AAI analysis indicated that all genomes can be divided into three main clades, named NES-1, NES-2, and NES-3. The strains isolated from lakes in the Tibetan Plateau were clustered with four strains from different sources in the Antarctic and formed a subclade within NES-2, described as NES-AT. Genome features of this subclade, including GC (guanine + cytosine) content, tRNA number, carbon/nitrogen atoms per residue side chain (C/N-ARSC), and amino acid composition, in NES-AT individuals were significantly different from other strains, indicating genomic adaptation to cold, nutrient-limited, osmotic, and ultraviolet conditions in polar areas. Functional analysis revealed the enrichment of specific genes involved in bacteriorhodopsin synthesis, biofilm formation, and more diverse nutrient substance metabolism genes in the NES-AT clade, suggesting potential adaptation strategies for energy metabolism in polar environments. This study provides a comprehensive profile of the genomic features of the Nesterenkonia genus and reveals the possible mechanism for the survival of Nesterenkonia isolates in polar areas. © 2022 by the authors.

SP  - 109-125
AB  - Centuries ago, natural medicines were used to diagnose and reduce human diseases. In recent years, natural products derived from plant origin are major sources for drug development, therefore playing a dominant role in different spheres of human life. The amounts of bioactive phytoconstituents in various plant extracts appear to be consistently low. To improve the qualitative and quantitative features of plant extracts, a highly precise and accurate extraction protocol is required for the selective and effective extraction of photo components from raw materials. In recent years, greener extraction methods such as supercritical fluid extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-assisted extraction, and microwave-assisted extraction have been highlighted. Different parameters such as temperature, pressure, extraction duration, selection and concentration of enzymes, pH, etc., are key factors for better productivity. This chapter enlightens the critical aspects of various extraction protocols used in the herbal-based pharmaceutical sector in the manufacturing of herbal medicines. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 27

AB  - Long-term experimental investigations of transgenerational plasticity (TGP) and transgenerational acclimatization to global change are sparse in marine invertebrates. Here, we test the effect of ocean warming and acidification over a 25-month period of Echinometra sp. A sea urchins whose parents were acclimatized at ambient or one of two near-future (projected mid and end of the 21st century) climate scenarios for 18 months. Several parameters linked to performance exhibited strong effects of future ocean conditions at 9 months of age. The Ambient-Ambient group (A-A, both F0 and F1 at ambient conditions) was significantly larger (21%) and faster in righting response (31%) compared to other groups. A second set of contrasts revealed near-future scenarios caused significant negative parental carryover effects. Respiration at 9 months was depressed by 59% when parents were from near-future climate conditions, and righting response was slowed by 28%. At 10 months, a selective pathogenic mortality event led to significantly higher survival rates of A-A urchins. Differences in size and respiration measured prior to the mortality were absent after the event, while a negative parental effect on righting (29% reduction) remained. The capacity to spawn at the end of the experiment was higher in individuals with ambient parents (50%) compared to other groups (21%) suggesting persistent parental effects. Obtaining different results at different points in time illustrates the importance of longer term and multigeneration studies to investigate effects of climate change. Given some animals in all groups survived the pathogenic event and that effects on physiology (but not behavior) among groups were eliminated after the mortality, we suggest that similar events could constitute selective sweeps, allowing genetic adaptation. However, given the observed negative parental effects and reduced potential for population replenishment, it remains to be determined if selection would be sufficiently rapid to rescue this species from climate change effects. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The neonatal period corresponds to the first 28 days of life. It is a period of intense maturation and changes, allowing changes in the organism from fetal to pediatric physiology. Neonates are a vulnerable, with very specific biological and physiological characteristics. Neonates have also very heterogeneous profiles related to term, age, birth weight, organ maturation, and comorbidities. In order to provide the most secure and adequate anaesthesia, it is critical to be familiar with the anatomical, physiological and pharmacological specificities of the first weeks of life. The perioperative management of neonates should be performed in dedicated centers with a high level of expertise: the morbidity and mortality rates within this population remain important, including hypoxia, cerebral ischaemia, myocardial ischemia, cerebral haemorrhage or renal failure. The main organ systems are anatomically present at birth but are still functionally immature. The ability of the organism to face any aggression or stress is very limited compared to adults. Central nervous system, cardiovascular and renal systems are particularly vulnerable to blood pressure variations, hypoxaemia and homeostatic changes (carbon dioxide, glycaemia, natremia, pH, temperature) that might occur during general anaesthesia. The metabolic demand and basal oxygen consumption are relatively important in neonates, their adaptive potential is blunted or even abolished by the anaesthetic agents. Maintaining an adequate heart rate, normovolemia, normoglycemia, adequate oxygenation and positive expiratory pressure are key determinants of a safe anesthetic management. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: One of the dangers of global climate change to wildlife is distorting sex ratios by temperature-induced sex reversals in populations where sex determination is not exclusively genetic, potentially leading to population collapse and/or sex-determination system transformation. Here we introduce a new concept on how these outcomes may be altered by mate choice if sex-chromosome-linked phenotypic traits allow females to choose between normal and sex-reversed (genetically female) males. Results: We developed a theoretical model to investigate if an already existing autosomal allele encoding preference for sex-reversed males would spread and affect demographic and evolutionary processes under climate warming. We found that preference for sex-reversed males (1) more likely spread in ZW/ZZ than in XX/XY sex-determination systems, (2) in populations starting with ZW/ZZ system, it significantly hastened the transitions between different sex-determination systems and maintained more balanced adult sex ratio for longer compared to populations where all females preferred normal males; and (3) in ZW/ZZ systems with low but non-zero viability of WW individuals, a widespread preference for sex-reversed males saved the populations from early extinction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that climate change may affect the evolution of mate choice, which in turn may influence the evolution of sex-determination systems, sex ratios, and thereby adaptive potential and population persistence. These findings show that preferences for sex-linked traits have special implications in species with sex reversal, highlighting the need for empirical research on the role of sex reversal in mate choice. © 2021, The Author(s).

VL  - 91

AB  - Climate influences population genetic variation in marine species. Capturing these impacts remains challenging for marine fishes which disperse over large geographical scales spanning steep environmental gradients. It requires the extensive spatial sampling of individuals or populations, representative of seascape heterogeneity, combined with a set of highly informative molecular markers capable of revealing climatic-associated genetic variations. We explored how space, dispersal and environment shape the genomic patterns of two sympatric fish species in the Mediterranean Sea, which ranks among the oceanic basins most affected by climate change and human pressure. We hypothesized that the population structure and climate-associated genomic signatures of selection would be stronger in the less mobile species, as restricted gene flow tends to facilitate the fixation of locally adapted alleles. To test our hypothesis, we genotyped two species with contrasting dispersal abilities: the white seabream Diplodus sargus and the striped red mullet Mullus surmuletus. We collected 823 individuals and used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to detect 8,206 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the seabream and 2,794 for the mullet. For each species, we identified highly differentiated genomic regions (i.e. outliers) and disentangled the relative contribution of space, dispersal and environmental variables (climate, marine primary productivity) on the outliers' genetic structure to test the prevalence of gene flow and local adaptation. We observed contrasting patterns of gene flow and adaptive genetic variation between the two species. The seabream showed a distinct Alboran sea population and panmixia across the Mediterranean Sea. The mullet revealed additional differentiation within the Mediterranean Sea that was significantly correlated to summer and winter temperatures, as well as marine primary productivity. Functional annotation of the climate-associated outlier SNPs then identified candidate genes involved in heat tolerance that could be examined to further predict species' responses to climate change. Our results illustrate the key steps of a comparative seascape genomics study aiming to unravel the evolutionary processes at play in marine species, to better anticipate their response to climate change. Defining population adaptation capacities and environmental niches can then serve to incorporate evolutionary processes into species conservation planning. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Molecular Characterization and Functional Analysis of the Hb-hsp90-1 Gene in Relation to Temperature Changes in Heterorhabditis bacteriophora
VL  - 12
AB  - Understanding how entomopathogenic nematodes respond to temperature changes and have adapted to the local environment is crucial to improve their potential as biocontrol agents. In order to improve understanding of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora’s potential adaptability to future climate changes, full-length cDNA and the corresponding gene of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) were isolated and fully characterized. The reproductive potential of the Apulian strain of H. bacteriophora increased when the temperature rose from 23 to 30°C, but no reproduction was found at 12°C. Expression analyses revealed that Hb-hsp90-1 was differentially expressed in Infective Juveniles (IJs) and adults (hermaphrodites, females and males). Up-regulation of Hb-hsp90-1 was higher during the recovery process in Galleria mellonella larvae than adults, thus confirming the protective role of Hb-hsp90-1 in coping with the host environment. Silencing of Hb-hsp90-1 resulted in a significant reduction (76%) in the expression level. Silenced IJs took longer than untreated nematodes to infect G. mellonella, showing that Hb-hsp90-1 could be also involved in chemosensation. Furthermore, the number of adults and IJs recovered from G. mellonella infected with silenced nematodes and incubated at 30°C was higher than that obtained from G. mellonella infected with untreated nematodes. These data confirm the crucial role of Hb-hsp90-1 allowing acclimation to increased temperatures and modulation of the recovery process. © Copyright © 2021 Fanelli, Troccoli, Tarasco and De Luca.

TI  - Phenotypic response of male and neomale of O. mykiss parr subjected to 8º and 16 ºC water temperature during early life stage
VL  - 22
AB  - Water temperature is an important modulator of variation of phenotype in poikilothermic fish and therefore of body shape. The present study explores the phenotypic response of commercial O. mykiss parr when they are subjected to rearing temperatures of 8º and 16ºC under controlled conditions with the aim of demonstrating, with the use of Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics, the influence of rearing temperature on body shape. O. mykiss males and neomales from eggs to parr stages, belonging to the same family and strain, were reared at different temperatures (8ºC and 16ºC) and grouped according to: Group 16ºC/neomales (n = 15), Group 16ºC/males (n = 15), Group 8ºC/neomales (n = 15) and Group 8ºC/males (n = 15). Differences in body shape among sex and rearing temperatures were examined by geometric morphometrics and traditional morphometry. At 16 weeks, geometric morphometric analysis revealed a dimorphism, which was not detected by traditional morphometry, mainly in the dorsal and caudal fin area. This dimorphism was not observed in neomales. This difference may be the product of the potential for phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to genetically controlled environmental and local fluctuations, which affects to indicators of adaptation in unfavorable environmental conditions such a biomechanical action of swimming and propulsion. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the differential effect of 8º and 16ºC water temperature on lateral body shape in male O. mykiss parr during the early stages of body development and in controlled conditions. © 2021

VL  - 187
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-45
AB  - Temperature variability is predicted to increase in the coming century due to climate change. However, the biological impact of increased temperature variability on animals remains largely unexplored. Here, we experimentally exposed gravid viviparous lizards (Eremias multiocellata) to two thermal environments [constant daily maximum (CDM) versus variable daily maximum (VDM) treatment with the same average temperature] to address maternal and offspring responses to increased variability in ambient temperature. Females from the VDM treatment delayed parturition, but produced similar litter sizes and litter masses as did CDM females. Offspring from the VDM treatment selected higher body temperatures, had higher metabolic rates and higher growth rates, and grew to a similar size as those from the CDM treatment despite having a shorter growth period prior to hibernation. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity may be critical for lizards to respond effectively to climate change, and its role in responding to increasingly variable temperatures warrants further attention. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Temperature and soil fertility as regulators of tree line Scots pine growth and survival—implications for the acclimation capacity of northern populations
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - e545-e559
AB  - The acclimation capacity of leading edge tree populations is crucially important in a warming climate. Theoretical considerations suggest that adaptation through genetic change is needed, but this may be a slow process. Both positive and catastrophic outcomes have been predicted, while empirical studies have lagged behind theory development. Here we present results of a 30-year study of 55,000 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees, planted in 15 common gardens in three consecutive years near and beyond the present Scots pine tree line. Our results show that, contrary to earlier predictions, even long-distance transfers to the North can be successful when soil fertility is high. This suggests that present northern populations have a very high acclimation capacity. We also found that while temperature largely controls Scots pine growth, soil nutrient availability plays an important role—in concert with interpopulation genetic variation—in Scots pine survival and fitness in tree line conditions. These results suggest that rapid range expansions and substantial growth enhancements of Scots pine are possible in fertile sites as seed production and soil nutrient mineralization are both known to increase under a warming climate. Finally, as the ontogenetic pattern of tree mortality was highly site specific and unpredictable, our results emphasize the need for long-term field trials when searching for the factors that control fitness of trees in the variable edaphic and climatic conditions of the far North. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Smaller adult fish size in warmer water is not explained by elevated metabolism
VL  - 25
IS  - 5
SP  - 1177-1188
AB  - Fish and other ectotherms living in warmer waters often grow faster as juveniles, mature earlier, but become smaller adults. Known as the temperature-size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30°C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30°C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Biocarbon, biomethane and biofertilizer from corn residue: A hybrid thermo-chemical and biochemical approach
VL  - 165
SP  - 370-384
AB  - In this research a hybrid thermochemical and biochemical approach is proposed to produce biocarbon, biomethane and biofertilizer from corn residue using the concept of resource recovery from biowaste. In this approach, corn residue is first pretreated in hydrothermal carbonization process to produce solid biocarbon. Hydrothermal process water, a co-product of hydrothermal carbonization process underwent fast anaerobic digestion to produce biomethane and biofertilizer. Effects of operating conditions (process temperature and residence time) on both biocarbon and hydrothermal process water contents were studied. Four selected hydrothermal temperatures of 200 degrees C, 220 degrees C, 240 degrees C and 260 degrees C and their three corresponding residence times of 10 min, 20 min and 30 min were considered. Among these 12 hydro thermal processes, 240 degrees C for 30 min process produced hybrid bioenergy of 14.26 MJkg(-1) of raw corn residue with an overall energy yield of 78.65%. Biocarbon produced at 240 degrees C for 30 min and 260 degrees C for 10 -30 min were comparable to pulverized coal used in power plants, which contained high heating values of 23.01 MJkg(-1) to 24.70 MJkg(-1). All anaerobic digestion digestate are nutrient enriched and useable as liquid fertilizer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can native geographical range, dispersal ability and development rates predict the successful establishment of alien ladybird (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) species in Europe?
VL  - 6
AB  - A list of alien ladybird (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) species to Europe was prepared and the history and circumstances of their introductions were determined. Currently there are 12 alien ladybird species in Europe, originating from Australian, Oriental, Nearctic, Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. All of the species were intentionally released as biological control agents and most are coccidophagous species. The aphidophagous Harmonia axyridis is the only ladybird regarded as invasive in Europe. The main factors leading to successful establishment were food relationship, living in different habitats in different geographical regions and geographic origin. We found that successful invaders, in their native areas, showed adaptability to a wide range of conditions compared to non-invasive species. Larger aphidophagous alien ladybirds were found to develop as fast as native species. Characteristics that did not differ between native and alien species are thermal requirements for development, fecundity and body size. However, unlike other alien ladybirds, H. axyridis had higher potential dispersal ability. © 2018 Soares, Honek, Martinkova, Brown and Borges.

VL  - 154
SP  - 268-279
AB  - The augmented exposure of both environment and human being to electromagnetic waves and the concomitant lack of an unequivocal knowledge about biological consequences of these radiations, raised public interest on electromagnetic pollution. In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the biological effects on zebrafish (ZF) embryos of 100 MHz radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure through a multidisciplinary protocol. Because of the shared synteny between human and ZF genomes that validated its use in biomedical research, toxicology and developmental biology studies, ZF was here selected as experimental model and a measurement protocol and biological analyses have been set up to clearly discriminate between RF-EMF biological and thermal effects. The results showed that a 100 MHz EMF was able to affect ZF embryonic development, from 24 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) in all the analyzed pathways. Particularly, at the 48 hpf stage, a reduced growth, an increased transcription of oxidative stress genes, the onset of apoptotic/autophagic processes and a modification in cholesterol metabolism were detected. ZF embryos faced stress induced by EMF radiation by triggering detoxification mechanisms and at 72 hpf they partially recovered from stress reaching the hatching time in a comparable way respect to the control group. Data here obtained showed unequivocally the in vivo effects of RF-EMF on an animal model, excluding thermal outcomes and thus represents the starting point for more comprehensive studies on dose response effects of electromagnetic fields radiations consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Acclimation to Water Restriction Implies Different Paces for Behavioral and Physiological Responses in a Lizard Species
VL  - 93
IS  - 2
SP  - 160-174
AB  - Chronic changes in climate conditions may select for acclimation responses in terrestrial animals living in fluctuating environments, and beneficial acclimation responses may be key to the resilience of these species to global changes. Despite evidence that climate warming induces changes in water availability, acclimation responses to water restriction are understudied compared with thermal acclimation. In addition, acclimation responses may involve different modes, paces, and trade-offs between physiological and behavioral traits. Here, we tested the dynamical acclimation responses of a dry-skinned terrestrial ectotherm to chronic water restriction. Yearling common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) were exposed to sublethal water restriction during 2 mo of the summer season in laboratory conditions, then released in outdoor conditions for 10 additional months. Candidate behavioral (exploration, basking, and thermal preferences) and physiological (metabolism at rest and standard water loss rate) traits potentially involved in the acclimation response were measured repeatedly during and after water restriction. We observed a sequential acclimation response in water-restricted animals (yearlings spent less time basking during the first weeks of water deprivation) that was followed by delayed sex-specific physiological consequences of the water restriction during the following months (thermal depression in males and lower standard evaporative water loss rates in females). Despite short-term negative effects of water restriction on body growth, annual growth, survival, and reproduction were not significantly different between water-restricted and control yearlings. This demonstrates that beneficial acclimation responses to water restriction involve both short-term flexible behavioral responses and delayed changes in thermal and water biology traits.

TI  - Joint impact of competition, summer precipitation, and maternal effects on survival and reproduction in the perennial Hieracium umbellatum
VL  - 32
IS  - 5
SP  - 529-545
AB  - Most studies on consequences of environmental change focus on evolutionary and phenotypic plastic responses, but parental effects represent an additional mechanism by which organisms respond to their local environment. Parental effects can be adaptive if they enhance offsprings ability to cope with environments experienced by their parents, but can also be non-adaptive for instance when offspring from benign environments are just better provisioned and hence perform better than offspring from less benign environments. Parental effects originate from both the abiotic and biotic environmental variation. However, the effects of the parental abiotic and biotic environment are rarely studied together. We make use of an experimental set-up containing plots in a natural heath land, where summer precipitation was manipulated to reflect either ambient or drought conditions. In both plot types, competition from grasses was prevalent. We assessed survival and reproduction of Hieracium umbellatum offspring originating from ambient and drought plots grown in a factorial design with two levels of moisture (control and drought) and two levels of competition (grown with and without a local perennial grass). The maternal environment strongly affected offspring performance. Biomass and reproduction was higher in offspring from ambient plots in agreement with the hypothesis of a better maternal provisioning in the most benign environment. However, adding competition revealed potentially adaptive responses to survival, and altered allocation to reproduction in offspring from maternal drought plots. Under combined competition and drought (mimicking maternal drought plots), survival was only reduced in offspring from ambient plots, and offspring from drought plots survived best. When grown in competition under control watering conditions mimicking maternal ambient plots, offspring from drought plots (growing in an environment different from their maternal one) showed a 25% reduction in reproduction. Potential adaptive responses to the home maternal environment were only revealed when jointly manipulating levels of competition and water availability. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Accessment of the Potential Application of Copper(I) Sulfide as Carrier Selective Contact on Silicon Bottom Cell for III/V-Si Tandem Solar Cells
VL  - 2020
SP  - 0380-0383
AB  - With advantages such as being dopant-free and with relatively low thermal budgets, carrier selective contacts (CSCs) are gaining more attention recently. Among CSC materials Copper(I) Sulfide (Cu2S) is nontoxic and earth-abundant, but rarely investigated in this field. In this report, we present an assessment of the viability of applying Cu2S(through thermal evaporation) as hole selective contacts (HSCs) on silicon (Si) bottom sub-cell for III-V/Si tandem solar cells. A band alignment profile of Si/Cu2S stack is presented, based on characterization results for layers deposited by evaporation on n-type Si (n-Si), that suggests a dipole junction is formed at their interface and hole-selectivity and electron-blocking should be evident. Moreover, a characterization of passivation quality associated with structures of CU2S/Si and CU2S/a-Si:H/Si is presented. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Immersed membranes configuration for the microfiltration of fruit-based suspensions
VL  - 216
SP  - 25-33
AB  - Microfiltration is widely used to ensure the a thermal stabilization, clarification and concentration of various fruit-based suspensions (e.g. fruit juices, food by-products, wine). However, the performances of membrane filtration remain highly challenged by membrane fouling. To prevent membrane fouling, cross-flow filtration is generally performed. Nevertheless, this intensive working mode is considered as highly energy consuming due to the intensive pumping required to circulate the suspension at high velocities. In the light of this, immersed membranes configurations have been developed in many fields, as they allow working in energy-friendly operating conditions. Thus, this work investigated for the first time the performances of an immersed membranes configuration for fruit-based suspensions microfiltration, in terms of productivity (membrane fouling, permeate flux) and selectivity (clarification, concentration of bioactive compounds). This study focused on three fruit-based suspensions: a grapefruit juice and two winery by-products. Concerning the process selectivity, pilot-scale experiments showed that immersed membranes filtration allowed producing retentate and permeate of quality as least as good as the one related to conventional cross-flow filtration. Concerning the process productivity, cross-flow filtration allowed reaching higher fluxes compared to immersed membranes filtration, in accordance with the conventional order of magnitude specific to each configuration. Immersed membranes configuration could find interesting applications within small production units of fruit juices and/or industries dealing with the valorization of low added-value byproducts thanks to its various advantages (high compactness, easy handling and mobility, low investment and operational costs). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Early Diverging and Core Bromelioideae (Bromeliaceae) Reveal Contrasting Patterns of Genome Size Evolution and Polyploidy
VL  - 11
AB  - The subfamily Bromelioideae is one of the most diverse groups among the neotropical Bromeliaceae. Previously, key innovations have been identified which account for the extraordinary radiation and species richness of this subfamily, especially in the so-called core Bromelioideae. However, in order to extend our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms, the genomic mechanisms (e.g. polyploidy, dysploidy) that potentially underlie this accelerated speciation also need to be tested. Here, using PI and DAPI staining and flow cytometry we estimated genome size and GC content of 231 plants covering 30 genera and 165 species and combined it with published data. The evolutionary and ecological significance of all three genomic characters was tested within a previously generated dated phylogenetic framework using ancestral state reconstructions, comparative phylogenetic methods, and multiple regressions with climatic variables. The absolute genome size (2C) of Bromelioideae varied between 0.59 and 4.11 pg, and the GC content ranged between 36.73 and 41.43%. The monoploid genome sizes (Cx) differed significantly between core and early diverging lineages. The occurrence of dysploidy and polyploidy was, with few exceptions, limited to the phylogenetically isolated early diverging tank-less lineages. For Cx and GC content Ornstein–Uhlenbeck models outperformed the Brownian motion models suggesting adaptive potential linked to the temperature conditions. 2C-values revealed different rates of evolution in core and early diverging lineages also related to climatic conditions. Our results suggest that polyploidy is not associated with higher net diversification and fast radiation in core bromelioids. On the other hand, although coupled with higher extinction rates, dysploidy, polyploidy, and resulting genomic reorganizations might have played a role in the survival of the early diverging bromelioids in hot and arid environments. © Copyright © 2020 Paule, Heller, Maciel, Monteiro, Leme and Zizka.

TI  - Impact of industrial effluent on water, soil and Rice production in Bangladesh: a case of Turag River Bank
VL  - 18

SP  - 825-834
AB  - Purpose: It is almost a common practice in Bangladesh to indiscriminately discharge effluent into the nearby wetlands, crop fields and water bodies. So, contamination occurs from water to food chain through soil and field crops. This study therefore assesses the impact of industrial effluent on water, soil and rice production taking Turag river bank as a case study, which located in the most thickly industrialized area of Bangladesh. Methods: The descriptive and diagnostic research design was used in the present study. Eighty farmers were selected as respondents using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The data were collected using an interview schedule. Impact of industrial effluent contamination was measured based on the extent of change that occurred in soil and water quality, level of insect infestation and, quantity and quality of rice before and after the establishment of industries. Similarly, water samples were collected to examine water quality parameters. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percent, mean and standard deviation were used to describe and interpret the data, while paired t-test was used to test significant difference. Results: The results revealed that the quality of water and soil, and quality and quantity of rice have differed significantly after the establishment of industries. Surface water was mostly affected (t-value 90.25). Almost all of the respondents (97.5%) stated that there was high insect infestation after the establishment of industries which negatively affects rice production. The water quality parameters test revealed that temperature, total dissolved salts, pH and salinity were within the acceptable limits, while electrical conductivity and heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Ni) were above the acceptable limits. The majority of respondents (77.6%) had favourable to highly favourable perception on the negative impact of industrial effluent contamination on rice production. The major problems faced due to the industrial effluent contamination were pollution, low fertility, increase attack of insect, dermal diseases and low yield. Conclusions: The establishment of industries has quiet negatively altered soil, water and rice production as buttressed by the evidence based viewpoints of the respondents. Proper treatment of industrial effluent and implementation of environmental act would certainly help overcome the problem. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The presented method selects optimal inputs for compensation models based on the Thermal Adaptive Learning Control methodology. The number of inputs and the individual inputs for each considered thermal error are automatically adapted. The intelligent combination of k-means clustering and Time Series Cluster Kernel enables the approach to handle time series of thermal error measurements with missing data due to operational reasons. The results show that the adaptive sensor selection approach, tested on a 5-axis-machine tool, significantly increases the robustness of the used compensation model. The productivity loss due to on-machine measurements is reduced by approximately 40 percent. (C) 2020 CIRP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Grey Based Taguchi Method for Optimization of TIG Process Parameter in Improving Tensile Strength of S30430 Stainless Steel
VL  - 404
AB  - Tungsten inert gas welding is popular known welding technique for ferrous & nonferrous. Stainless steel grade 3HQ (S30430) is a specialized wire grade with very wide usage for manufacturer of stainless steel fastener. It has now totally replaced Grade 384 and 305 for heading application. The stable austenitic structure makes 302HQ nonmagnetic, even after substantial cold work, and also results in excellent toughness, even down to cryogenic temperatures. This paper attempts in optimizing the Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) welding process parameter. The effect of various parameters and their influence is important to determine the strength of welded joint. To obtain a good quality weld, it is therefore, essential to control the input welding parameters. Therefore appropriate selection of input welding parameter is necessary in order to obtain a good quality weld and subsequently increase the productivity of manufacturing industry. This paper present multi objective optimization using grey relation analysis (GRA) for S30430 with TIG process to determine the suitable selection of parameters Experiment were conducted according to Taguchi's design of experiments (DOE) with orthogonal array L9 is used, mathematical model was developed using parameters such as speed (mm/min), current (Amp), voltage (V), depth of penetration (mm). After conducting experiment and collecting data, signal to noise ratio were determined by using Minitab18 and it is used to obtain optimum level for every input parameter. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 61
IS  - 14
SP  - 1396-1407
AB  - The Cu–CHA zeolite today represents an attractive platform to design catalysts for deNOx applications by NH3-assisted selective catalytic reduction (NH3–SCR) and for the low-temperature selective oxidation of methane to methanol (MTM). Accessing a quantitative understanding of Cu–speciation in this material is a key step to unveil structure–performance relationships for these high-impact processes. Herein, we select Cu–CHA as a case study to demonstrate the potential of chemometric approaches, such as multivariate curve resolution (MCR) applied in combination with principal component analysis (PCA). We employ these methods to assist the interpretation of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments in the near-edge (XANES) region, determining the spectroscopic signatures and concentration profiles of the pure Cu–species formed. We pinpoint the composition impact on the material reducibility and highlight Cu–speciation–productivity relationships for the MTM process. Furthermore, we report novel insights on the formation of O2-derived species in Cu–CHA, obtained from MCR analysis of high energy resolution fluorescence detected (HERFD) XANES data collected during thermal treatment of Cu–CHA in both He and O2 gas flow. Multivariate analysis, in combination with the superior energy resolution adopted, allows us to identify an additional Cu(II) species. This component, different from the previously characterized Z[Cu(II)OH] moiety, is only formed at significant concentrations in O2 and it is envisaged to play an important role in the MTM conversion. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Chinese mitten crabs are widely distributed from Fujian in southern China to Liaoning in northern China, and they are able to adapt to a range of temperatures. The study focused on the behavioral responses of juvenile mitten crabs sampled from the Yangtze River to changes in water temperature. This is an important stage of the life cycle of this species that often has low disease resistance and high mortality rates. A temperature gradient was established across the shuttlebox to enable the preference of juvenile crabs for either temperature to be established. The shuttlebox system ensures the stability of the temperature on either side of the box. Established experimental groups were set as follws: Group (8℃ and 14℃), Group Ⅱ (14℃ and 21℃), Group Ⅲ (21℃ and 28℃), and Group Ⅳ (28℃ and 35℃). Results showed that the juvenile Chinese mitten crab had a preferred temperature (Tpref) of 28℃. Neither time of day nor gender had any significant effects on the temperature preference. Further more, there were significant differences in the swimming velocity of the juvenile crabs in different groups under the same experimental temperatures. The juvenile crabs increased their swimming velocity to escape suboptimal water temperature, and there was a positive relationship between swimming velocity and the degree of temperature deviation from Tpref. Water temperature with an inverted Ushaped swimming parabolic rate. The fitting equation for temperature (x) and swimming velocity (y), y=0.0027x2– 0.1045x+1.5875, R²=0.8615. The impact of gender differences in swimming speed was not significant (P>0.05), and there was no significant difference between day and night swimming rate (P>0.05). Thus, the results of this study will be useful for enhancing the survival and growth rates of this species in aquaculture settings as well as for controlling and protecting them in the wild. © 2022, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Bacterial communities of novaya zemlya archipelago ice and permafrost
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - The study of bacterial communities associated with extreme ecosystems is one of the most important tasks in modern microbial ecology. Despite a large number of studies being performed, the ecosystems that have not been sufficiently explored from the microbiological point of view still exist. Such research is needed for improving the understanding of the limits and mechanisms of bacterial survival under extreme conditions, and for revealing previously undescribed species and their role in global biospheric processes and their functional specifics. The results of the complex microbiological characteristics of permafrost and ice—collected on the Severniy Island in the northern part of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago—which have not previously been described from microbiological point of view, are presented in this article. The analysis included both culture-independent and culture-dependent methods, in particular, the spectra of metabolic activity range analysis in vitro under different temperature, pH and salinity conditions. High values for the total number of prokaryotes in situ (1.9×108–3.5×108 cells/g), a significant part of which was able to return to a metabolically active state after thawing, and moderate numbers of culturable bacteria (3.3×106– 7.8×107 CFU/g) were revealed. Representatives of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were dominant in situ; Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in vitro. Physiological assays revealed the mesophilic and neutrophilic optima of temperature and pH of culturing conditions, respectively, and wide temperature and pH ranges of culturable communities’ reproduction activity. Isolated strains were characterized by moderate halotolerant properties and antibiotic resistance, including multiple antibiotic resistance. It was found that almost all cultured bacterial diversity revealed (not just a few resistant species) had extremotolerant properties regarding a number of stress factors. This indicates the high adaptive potential of the studied microbial communities and their high sustainability and capability to retain functional activity under changing environmental (including climatic) conditions in wide ranges. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Early developmental stages of native populations of Ciona intestinalis under increased temperature are affected by local habitat history
VL  - 224
IS  - 5
AB  - Temperature modulates marine ectotherm physiology, influencing survival, abundance and species distribution. While native species could be susceptible to ocean warming, thermal tolerance might favour the spread of non-native species. Determining the success of invasive species in response to climate change is confounded by the cumulative, synergistic or antagonistic effects of environmental drivers, which vary at a geographical and temporal scale. Thus, an organism's acclimation or adaptive potential could play an important evolutionary role by enabling or conditioning species tolerance to stressful environmental conditions. We investigated developmental performance of early life stages of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis (derived from populations of anthropogenically impacted and control sites) to an extreme weather event (i.e. marine heatwave). Fertilization rate, embryo and larval development, settlement, metamorphosis success and juvenile heart rate were assessed as experimental endpoints. With the exception of fertilization and heart rates, temperature influenced all analysed endpoints. C. intestinalis derived from control sites were the most negatively affected by increased temperature conditions. By contrast,C. intestinalis from anthropogenically impacted sites showed a positive response to thermal stress, with a higher proportion of larvae development, settlement and metamorphosis success being observed under increased temperature conditions. No differences were observed for heart rates between sampled populations and experimental temperature conditions. Moreover, interaction between temperature and populations was statistically significant for embryo and larvae development, and metamorphosis. We hypothesize that selection resulting from anthropogenic forcing could shape stress resilience of species in their native range and subsequently confer advantageous traits underlying their invasive potential. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - A reinforcement learning approach for optimal placement of sensors in protected cultivation systems
VL  - 9
SP  - 100781-100800
AB  - Optimal placement of sensors in protected cultivation systems to maximize monitoring and control capabilities can guide effective decision-making toward achieving the highest levels of productivity and other desirable outcomes. Reinforcement learning, unlike conventional machine learning methods such as supervised learning does not require large, labeled datasets thereby providing opportunities for more efficient and unbiased design optimization. With the objective of determining the optimal locations of sensors in a greenhouse, a multi-arm bandit problem was formulated using the Beta distribution and solved by the Thompson sampling algorithm. A total of 56 two-in-one sensors designed to measure both internal air temperature and relative humidity were installed at a vertical distance of 1 m and a horizontal distance of 3m apart in a greenhouse used to cultivate strawberries. Data was collected over a period of seven months covering four major seasons, February (winter), March, April, and May (spring), June and July (summer), and October (autumn) and analyzed separately. Results showed unique patterns for sensor selection for temperature and relative humidity during the different months. Furthermore, temperature and relative humidity each had different optimal location selections suggesting that two-in-one sensors might not be ideal in these cases. The use of reinforcement learning to design optimal sensor placement in this study aided in identifying 10 optimal sensor locations for monitoring and controlling temperature and relative humidity. © 2013 IEEE.

VL  - 37

SP  - 1259-1271
AB  - In light of recent declines in scleractinian communities worldwide, research on the genetic structure of and connectivity among coral populations has assumed importance. However, the genetic structure of corals in the South China Sea (SCS) has remained largely neglected by studies. The genetic structure of the broadcast spawning coral Porites lutea was examined using 482 specimens from 20 sites in the SCS spanning 13° of latitude. Analyses of two nuclear markers congruently revealed that genetic diversity was high in most populations, with relatively lower diversity in Daya Bay (DY). However, we identified a recent bottleneck in P. lutea populations, which may be in accordance with recent coral community declines. Pairwise FST values and principal coordinates analyses indicated large-scale (~ 1500 km) genetic homogeneity among SCS P. lutea populations, possibly attributed to their reproductive strategy (spawning vs. brooding) and historical changes in population sizes. However, populations in DY were highly differentiated from the others, which may reflect the genetic-level adaptation of corals there to lower winter temperatures. Coalescent migration analyses of ITS rDNA markers revealed high levels of gene flow (Nm &gt; 100) among all adjacent populations except between DY and Taiwan. Additionally, universally asymmetrical northward gene flow was identified, possibly reflecting the northward migration of the species in response to global warming. We concluded that populations of P. lutea in the SCS comprise one large panmictic meta-population. However, the lower-diversity, more differentiated northern marginal populations in DY are probably more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of anthropogenic activities. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 23
IS  - 5
SP  - 837-846
AB  - Sharks have maintained a key role in marine food webs for 400 million years and across varying physicochemical contexts, suggesting plasticity to environmental change. In this study, we investigated the biochemical effects of ocean acidification (OA) levels predicted for 2100 (pCO 2 ~ 900 μatm) on newly hatched tropical whitespotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum). Specifically, we measured lipid, protein, and DNA damage levels, as well as changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic ROS scavengers in juvenile sharks exposed to elevated CO 2 for 50 days following hatching. Moreover, we also assessed the secondary oxidative stress response, i.e., heat shock response and ubiquitin levels. Newly hatched sharks appear to cope with OA-related stress through a range of tissue-specific biochemical strategies, specifically through the action of antioxidant enzymatic compounds. Our findings suggest that ROS-scavenging molecules, rather than complex enzymatic proteins, provide an effective defense mechanism in dealing with OA-elicited ROS formation. We argue that sharks’ ancient antioxidant system, strongly based on non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., urea), may provide them with resilience towards OA, potentially beyond the tolerance of more recently evolved species, i.e., teleosts. Nevertheless, previous research has provided evidence of detrimental effects of OA (interacting with other climate-related stressors) on some aspects of shark biology. Moreover, given that long-term acclimation and adaptive potential to rapid environmental changes are yet experimentally unaccounted for, future research is warranted to accurately predict shark physiological performance under future ocean conditions. © 2018, Cell Stress Society International.

TI  - Dietary discrimination using a dual-choice self-feeding system in seabream (Sparus aurata)
VL  - 559
AB  - Self-feeding systems have been extensively used to study animal behaviour and food preferences in vertebrates. In this study, we used a dual-choice self-feeding system to explore feeding behaviour and dietary discrimination based on organoleptic cues. Experimental tanks were provided with 2 self-feeders activated by string sensors and connected to a computer system. In the first experiment (E1) [6 tanks, 10 animals/tank, body weight (BW) 266 g ± 19.4 g], both feeders delivered the same control standard diet to evaluate the potential preference for one feeder. E1 had 3 phases: 1st, animals were allowed to demand from both feeders; 2nd, from only one feeder and 3rd from both feeders again. The second experiment (E2) (11 tanks, 15 animals/tank, BW range 25–50 g) examined whether seabream can discriminate between 3 isoenergetic diets: the control diet; a positive/palatable diet containing high levels of fish, squid and krill meal; and a negative diet in which 1.5% quinine hydrochloride was added to the control diet. E2 had 3 phases: 1st acclimation with control diet; 2nd dual-choice; 3rd dual-choice with reversal of feeders. The third experiment (E3) (8 tanks, 10 animals/tank, BW range 25-50 g) was performed using a single self-feeder per tank, with each tank being fed either control or quinine diet, to corroborate the aversive response to quinine in the absence of dietary choice. E1 demonstrated that animals demanded significantly less when only one feeder/sensor was available. E2 shows that seabream can easily discriminate a bitter compound (quinine) in the diet, showing negative preference (P < 0.05) in both phases, 2nd and 3rd. When no choice was available (E3), seabream equally demanded control or quinine diet, presumably driven by its energy requirements. However, the presence of the bitter substance increased feed refusals, 14.3% rejection of demanded feed in quinine diet, versus 2.6% in control diet, indicating a role of sensory systems in assessing food quality. A positive conditioning with a palatable diet was not effective and no positive choices were measured over a basal diet, although results were possibly influenced by the previous familiarization with the basal diet and by the experimental conditions (fast growing juveniles at high temperature). This poor dietary selection during active feeding periods could partly explain the easy adaptation of this species to substitution diets. Finally, results suggest that food intake is conditioned by agonistic behaviour in an age-dependent manner. The information will be useful for diet and feeding strategy design in seabream. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Climate change and invasive species: A physiological performance comparison of invasive and endemic bees in Fiji
VL  - 224
IS  - 1
AB  - Anthropogenic climate change and invasive species are two of the greatest threats to biodiversity, affecting the survival, fitness and distribution of many species around the globe. Invasive species are often expected to have broad thermal tolerance, be highly plastic, or have high adaptive potential when faced with novel environments. Tropical island ectotherms are expected to be vulnerable to climate change as they often have narrow thermal tolerance and limited plasticity. In Fiji, only one species of endemic bee, Homalictus fijiensis, is commonly found in the lowland regions, but two invasive bee species, Braunsapis puangensis and Ceratina dentipes, have recently been introduced into Fiji. These introduced species pollinate invasive plants and might compete with H. fijiensis and other native pollinators for resources. To test whether certain performance traits promote invasiveness of some species, and to determine which species are the most vulnerable to climate change, we compared the thermal tolerance, desiccation resistance, metabolic rate and seasonal performance adjustments of endemic and invasive bees in Fiji. The two invasive species tended to be more resistant to thermal and desiccation stress than H. fijiensis, while H. fijiensis had greater capacity to adjust their CTmax with season, and H. fijiensis females tended to have higher metabolic rates than B. puangensis females. These findings provide mixed support for current hypotheses for the functional basis of the success of invasive species; however, we expect the invasive bees in Fiji to be more resilient to climate change because of their increased thermal tolerance and desiccation resistance. © 2021.

TI  - Climate-related geographical variation in performance traits across the invasion front of a widespread non-native insect
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 405-414
AB  - Aim: Invasive species are ideal systems for testing geographical differences in performance traits and measuring evolutionary responses as a species spreads across divergent climates and habitats. The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a generalist forest defoliator introduced to Medford, Massachusetts, USA in 1869. The invasion front extends from Minnesota to North Carolina and the ability of this species to adapt to local climate may contribute to its continuing spread. We evaluated the performance of populations along the climatic gradient of the invasion front to test for a relationship between climate and ecologically important performance traits. Location: Eastern United States of America. Taxon: Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae). Methods: Insects from 14 populations across the US invasion front and interior of the invasive range were reared from hatch to adult emergence in six constant temperature treatments. The responses of survival, pupal mass and larval development time were analysed as a function of source climate (annual mean normal temperature), rearing temperature and their interaction using multiple polynomial regression. Results: With the exception of female development time, there were no significant interactions between source climate and rearing temperature, indicating little divergence in the shape of thermal reaction norms among populations. Source population and rearing temperature were significant predictors of survival and pupal mass. Independent of rearing temperature, populations from warmer climates had lower survival than those from colder climates, but attained larger body size despite similar development times. Larval development time was dependent on rearing temperature, but there were not consistent relationships with source climate. Main Conclusions: Thermal adaptation can be an important factor shaping the spread of invasive species, particularly in the context of climate change. Our results suggest that L. d. dispar is highly plastic, but has undergone climate-related adaptation in thermal performance and life-history traits as it spread across North America. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Associations between metabolic traits and growth rate in brown trout (Salmo trutta) depend on thermal regime
VL  - 288
IS  - 1959
AB  - Metabolism defines the energetic cost of life, yet we still know relatively little about why intraspecific variation in metabolic rate arises and persists. Spatio-temporal variation in selection potentially maintains differences, but relationships between metabolic traits (standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope) and fitness across contexts are unresolved. We show that associations between SMR, MMR, and growth rate (a key fitness-related trait) vary depending on the thermal regime (a potential selective agent) in offspring of wild-sampled brown trout from two populations reared for approximately 15 months in either a cool or warm (+1.8°C) regime. SMR was positively related to growth in the cool, but negatively related in the warm regime. The opposite patterns were found for MMR and growth associations (positive in warm, negative in the cool regime). Mean SMR, but not MMR, was lower in warm regimes within both populations (i.e. basal metabolic costs were reduced at higher temperatures), consistent with an adaptive acclimation response that optimizes growth. Metabolic phenotypes thus exhibited a thermally sensitive metabolic 'floor' and a less flexible metabolic 'ceiling'. Our findings suggest a role for growth-related fluctuating selection in shaping patterns of metabolic variation that is likely important in adapting to climate change. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Population history and ecology, in addition to climate, influence human stature and body proportions
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Worldwide variation in human stature and limb proportions is widely accepted to reflect thermal adaptation, but the contribution of population history to this variation is unknown. Furthermore, stature and relative lower limb length (LLL) show substantial plastic responses to environmental stressors, e.g., nutrition, pathogen load, which covary with climate. Thus ecogeographic patterns may go beyond temperature-based selection. We analysed global variation in stature, sitting height and absolute and relative LLL using large worldwide samples of published anthropometric data from adult male (n = 571) and female (n = 268) populations in relation to temperature, humidity, and net primary productivity (NPP). Population history was modeled using spatial eigenvector mapping based on geographic distances reflecting the hypothesized pattern for the spread of modern humans out of Africa. Regression models account for ~ 50% of variation in most morphological variables. Population history explains slightly more variation in stature, sitting height and LLL than the environmental/climatic variables. After adjusting for population history, associations between (usually maximum) temperature and LLL are consistent with Allen's "rule" and may drive similar relationships with stature. NPP is a consistent negative predictor of anthropometry, which may reflect the growth-limiting effects of lower environmental resource accessibility (inversely related to NPP) and/or pathogen load. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis of a high-temperature multi-layered sensible-latent thermal energy storage
VL  - 2303
AB  - The present work provides a thorough literature review of the main high temperature sensible and latent materials suitable for a multilayered thermal energy storage system to be integrated into innovative concentrated solar power applications. Furthermore, a thermodynamic comparative analysis of six different multilayered packed-bed thermal energy storage configurations, including three selected high-temperature metallic phase change materials (Al-12.2Si, Al-20Si, and Cu-Si27-Mg17) is presented. For each multilayered storage configuration, the overall impact of the phase change material layer thickness on the performance has been analyzed. As expected, the major improvements are enabled by the addition of a high-temperature phase change material at the top of the multi-layered thermal energy storage. Indeed, the discharge phase duration could be extended for 2 hours, while the energy output increases by about 5%. Furthermore, the addition of a lower melting temperature phase change material layer below the topping high temperature one grants a further slight energy output enhancement. However, this seems to be not valuable enough when considering the increased level of complexity and costs induced by such a storage unit design. The study confirms that a larger amount of phase change materials leads to a lower discharge efficiency due to a wider temperature difference between the heat transfer fluid and the storing media during phase change. The performed study reveals that the Cu-17Mg-27Si/rock multilayered thermal energy storage is worth continuing exploring, especially in terms of experimental tests to assess possible corrosion issues and different encapsulation and coating solutions that might considerably affect the lifetime of the system. Techno-economic analyses should be also performed to assess the economic viability of the integration of multilayered TES systems in innovative concentrated solar power plant layouts. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

TI  - Ability of adult dermacentor reticulatus ticks to overwinter in the temperate climate zone
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Dermacentor reticulatus ticks, one of the most important vectors and reservoirs of tick‐borne diseases in Europe, are widespread in the temperate climate zone and in some localities in the subtropical climate zone of the western Palaearctic region. These ticks occur in a large area characterised by a varied climate type, vegetation, and availability of potential hosts. Hence, they exhibit high ecological plasticity and adaptability to periodically adverse conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of D. reticulatus adults to overwinter in the natural habitat. Specimens marked with a permanent oil marker on the festoons were placed in their natural habitats for the winter. Concurrently, tick survival in laboratory conditions at a temperature of 5 °C and 18 °C was assessed as a control. The groups were compared with each other by determination of the weight of fat bodies. In the field conditions, 67.9% females and 60.0% males survived the winter. There was no significant difference in the survival of ticks in the laboratory. A significantly lower fat body weight was found in the group of ticks overwintering in the field conditions and exhibiting questing activity between spring and late autumn during the following year. On the population scale, adult D. reticulatus ticks are able to survive the winter in temperate climate conditions at a level ensuring a further increase in their population size. In adverse weather conditions, ticks enter diapause, thus maximally reducing the utilisation of the content of their fat bodies. This facilitates long‐term survival in the environment. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 31
IS  - 46
AB  - 2D materials display very promising intrinsic material properties, with multiple applications in electronics, photonics, and sensing. In particular layered platinum diselenide has shown high potential due to its layer-dependent tunable bandgap, low-temperature growth, and high environmental stability. Here, the conformal and area selective (AS) low-temperature growth of layered PtSe2 is presented defining a new paradigm for 2D material integration. The thermally-assisted conversion of platinum which is deposited by AS atomic layer deposition to PtSe2 is demonstrated on various substrates with a distinct 3D topography. Further the viability of the approach is presented by successful on-chip integration of hybrid semiconductor devices, namely by the manufacture of a highly sensitive ammonia sensors channel with 3D topography and fully integrated infrared-photodetectors on silicon photonics waveguides. The presented methodologies of conformal and AS growth therefore lay the foundation for new design routes for the synthesis of more complex hybrid structures with 2D materials. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Production of liquid hydrocarbons via Fischer–Tropsch synthesis on a pilot-scale reactor using a cobalt-based mesoporous catalyst
AB  - The main objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of a typical proprietary catalyst for the Fischer–Tropsch reaction, in the form of cylindrical pellet on a pilot-scale fixed bed reactor for the production of n-paraffins. The catalyst was identified that the support is mesoporous, showing the active phase (cobalt) a good dispersion. The tests were carried out at a pressure of 20 bar, varying the temperature (210 ºC and 230 ºC) and the space velocity. The results showed a reduction in the conversion of H2 and CO with the increase in space velocity and temperature, as evidenced in the literature. In addition, it was observed that selectivity to CH4 increased with the increase in temperature, maintaining the ratio H2/CO (1.6). Regarding hydrocarbon productivity, it was noticed that there was a significant increase in the yield of heavy oil and water at 230 ºC. At this temperature, the selectivity to C19 + was reduced when compared to 210 ºC, indicating that in order to produce paraffins of high molecular weight, it is advisable to carry out the reaction at a lower temperature. The results obtained in the laboratory were compared to those obtained in the pilot plant. As a matter of fact, although the catalyst and the operating conditions were the same, different results were observed, indicating mass transfer effects play an important role. The diffusion of H2 and CO to the active site depends on mass transfer effects, mainly impacting on the selectivity to CH4. © 2021, Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Química.

TI  - Temperature-sensitive development shapes insect phenological responses to climate change
VL  - 52
AB  - Phenological shifts vary within and among insect species and locations based on exposure and sensitivity to climate change. Shifts in environmental conditions and seasonal constraints along elevation and latitudinal gradients can select for differences in temperature sensitivity that generate differential phenological shifts. I examine the phenological implications of observed variation in developmental traits. Coupling physiological and ecological insight to link the environmental sensitivity of development to phenology and fitness offers promise in understanding variable phenological responses to climate change and their community and ecosystem implications. A key challenge in establishing these linkages is extrapolating controlled, laboratory experiments to temporally variable, natural environments. New lab and field experiments that incorporate realistic environmental variation are needed to test the extrapolations. Establishing the linkages can aid understanding and anticipating impacts of climate change on insects. © 2022

TI  - Emersion survival manipulation in Greenshell™ mussels (Perna canaliculus): Implications for the extension of live mussels’ shelf-life
VL  - 500
SP  - 597-606
AB  - Farmed adult Greenshell™ mussels were exposed to a range of conditions immediately after harvest to evaluate the effects on emersion survival and the implications for live transport. Two experiments were performed, coinciding with the mussel harvest season during summer and winter 2017. In the summer experiment, a wide range of conditions were tested to identify alternatives to be evaluated in more detail during the winter experiment. The postharvest experimental conditions selected included transient re-immersion at different temperatures, cold and heat-shock, tidal simulation, and packing with ice. These treatments aimed to either reduce postharvest stress and/or give the mussels a potentially beneficial physiological and behavioural advantage to help them cope with emersion. The mussels’ responses in terms of gaping and survival differed between summer and winter, and among and within treatments. Sub-ambient temperature seawater exposure after harvest tended to improve the survival time of the mussels in both seasons, the effect being dependent on both temperature and duration of the exposure. Some of the differences observed could be explained by the conditions (in the wild and in the laboratory) to which the mussels were exposed before emersion and the different capability that each mussel has to cope with stress. However, the exact mechanisms driving these changes are not fully understood and require further investigation. This study, nevertheless, indicates that emersion survival (i.e. live mussel shelf-life) could be extended by re-immersion after harvest combined with a sub-lethal cold-shock followed by immersed recovery before transportation. If the commercial shelf-life of live product can be significantly extended, the implications for food quality and safety will also need to be evaluated. A similar approach could be applied in other shellfish such as other species of mussels as well as oysters or clams to improve shelf-life, considering their physiological capabilities and behaviour and how those are affected by environmental conditions in different seasons or regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Techno-economic preferability of cost-performance effective draw solutions for forward osmosis and osmotic anaerobic bioreactor applications
VL  - 410
AB  - Cost and performance efficient integrations of biological treatments with membrane processes are very worthy for water and resource recovery among of which osmotic anaerobic digestion suffers from exactly elucidating desirable techno-economic features of key operating factors. Cost-performance effective draw solutions (DSs) were ascertained for forward osmosis (FO) and its anaerobic bioreactor (AnBR) configurations, anaerobic osmotic membrane bioreactor (AnOMBR) and [FO/AnBR]. In case study comprising literature data pre-screening, selected DS experiments, and preferability analysis, dual modeling was executed for prioritizing DSs eligible to osmotic AnBRs by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Through AHP screening of 29 DSs' FO data, NaNO3, NaCl, MgCl2, CaCl2, NH4H2PO4, HCOONa and CH3COONa were established between the best 10% worth researching for osmotic AnBRs. Experiments showed that isothermally varied temperatures hardly affected DS performances in submerged, but DS concentration raises led to those distinguished by reverse solute fluxes. Reverse solute flux selectivity was differed significantly by DS kinds and FO configurations because of varying interactions among predominant inorganic ion and soluble organics. Submerged FO fed by distilled water provided better performance than sidestream but not by wastewater. Anaerobic bioactivities showed longer acclimation times increased by alkalinity unlike seawater (SW) and better CH4 productivity of organics enhanced by DS concentration. Upon AHP analyses, CaCl2, MgCl2, both organics, and SW were more techno-economically favorable DS kinds. Irrespective of technological alternatives, CaCl2 and MgCl2 were found as top two except just SW was the best for AnOMBR by low-cost supply. It was finally proved that eligible DSs should be designated technology-dependently due to their distinctive performances and replenishment costs, and topmost priority to SW should be attributed in sustainable wastewater reclamations by AnOMBR in coastal countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Seabream larval physiology under ocean warming and acidification
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - The vulnerability of early fish stages represents a critical bottleneck for fish recruitment; therefore, it is essential to understand how climate change affects their physiology for more sustainable management of fisheries. Here, we investigated the effects of warming (OW; +4◦C) and acidification (OA; ∆pH = 0.5) on the heart and oxygen consumption rates, metabolic enzymatic machinery—namely citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ß-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HOAD), of seabream (Sparus aurata) larvae (fifteen days after hatch). Oxygen consumption and heart rates showed a significant increase with rising temperature, but decreased with pCO2 . Results revealed a significant increase of LDH activity with OW and a significant decrease of the aerobic potential (CS and HOAD activity) of larvae with OA. In contrast, under OA, the activity levels of the enzyme LDH and the LDH:CS ratio indicated an enhancement of anaerobic pathways. Although such a short-term metabolic strategy may eventually sustain the basic costs of maintenance, it might not be adequate under the future chronic ocean conditions. Given that the potential for adaptation to new forthcoming conditions is yet experimentally unaccounted for this species, future research is essential to accurately predict the physiological performance of this commercially important species under future ocean conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Estimation of heat-attributable mortality using the cross-validated best temperature metric in Switzerland and south Korea
VL  - 18

AB  - This study presents a novel method for estimating the heat-attributable fractions (HAF) based on the cross-validated best temperature metric. We analyzed the association of eight temperature metrics (mean, maximum, minimum temperature, maximum temperature during daytime, minimum temperature during nighttime, and mean, maximum, and minimum apparent temperature) with mortality and performed the cross-validation method to select the best model in selected cities of Switzerland and South Korea from May to September of 1995–2015. It was observed that HAF estimated using different metrics varied by 2.69–4.09% in eight cities of Switzerland and by 0.61–0.90% in six cities of South Korea. Based on the cross-validation method, mean temperature was estimated to be the best metric, and it revealed that the HAF of Switzerland and South Korea were 3.29% and 0.72%, respectively. Furthermore, estimates of HAF were improved by selecting the best city-specific model for each city, that is, 3.34% for Switzerland and 0.78% for South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to observe the uncertainty of HAF estimation originated from the selection of temperature metric and to present the HAF estimation based on the cross-validation method. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Methanol synthesis: Optimal solution for a better efficiency of the process
VL  - 6

AB  - In this research, an ANOVA analysis and a response surface methodology are applied to analyze the equilibrium of methanol reaction from pure carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In the ANOVA analysis, carbon monoxide composition in the feed, reaction temperature, recycle and water removal through a zeolite membrane are the analyzed factors. Carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol productivity and methanol selectivity are the analyzed responses. Results show that main factors have the same effect on responses and a common significant interaction is not present. Carbonmonoxide composition and water removal have a positive effect, while temperature and recycle have a negative effect on the system. From central composite design, an optimal solution is found in order to overcome thermodynamic limit: the reactor works with amembrane at lower temperature with carbon monoxide composition in the feed equal to 10 mol % and without recycle. In these conditions, carbon conversion, methanol yield, methanol selectivity, and methanol production are, respectively, higher than 60%, higher than 60%, between 90% and 95% and higher than 0.15mol/h when considering a feed flow rate of 1 mol/h. A comparison with a traditional reactor is also developed: the membrane reactor ensures to have a carbon conversion higher of the 29% and a methanol yield higher of the 34%. Future researches should evaluate an economic analysis about the optimal solution. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Changes in energy reserves and gene expression elicited by freezing and supercooling in the antarctic midge, Belgica antarctica
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Freeze-tolerance, or the ability to survive internal ice formation, is relatively rare among insects. Larvae of the Antarctic midge Belgica antarctica are freeze-tolerant year-round, but in dry environments, the larvae can remain supercooled (i.e., unfrozen) at subzero temperatures. In previous work with summer-acclimatized larvae, we showed that freezing is considerably more stressful than remaining supercooled. Here, these findings are extended by comparing survival, tissue damage, energetic costs, and stress gene expression in larvae that have undergone an artificial winter acclimation regime and are either frozen or supercooled at −5°C. In contrast to summer larvae, winter larvae survive at −5°C equally well for up to 14 days, whether frozen or supercooled, and there is no tissue damage at these conditions. In subsequent experiments, we measured energy stores and stress gene expression following cold exposure at −5°C for either 24 h or 14 days, with and without a 12 h recovery period. We observed slight energetic costs to freezing, as frozen larvae tended to have lower glycogen stores across all groups. In addition, the abundance of two heat shock protein transcripts, hsp60 and hsp90, tended to be higher in frozen larvae, indicating higher levels of protein damage following freezing. Together, these results indicate a slight cost to being frozen relative to remaining supercooled, which may have implications for the selection of hibernacula and responses to climate change. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Temperature-Specific and Sex-Specific Fitness Effects of Sympatric Mitochondrial and Mito-Nuclear Variation in Drosophila obscura
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - Simple Summary Does variation in the mitochondrial DNA sequence influence the survival and reproduction of an individual? What is the purpose of genetic variation of the mitochondrial DNA between individuals from the same population? As a simple laboratory model, Drosophila species can give us the answer to this question. Creating experimental lines with different combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear genomic DNA and testing how successful these lines were in surviving in different experimental set-ups enables us to deduce the effect that both genomes have on fitness. This study on D. obscura experimentally validates theoretical models that explain the persistence of mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. Our results shed light on the various mechanisms that maintain this type of variation. Finally, by conducting the experiments on two experimental temperatures, we have shown that environmental variations can support mitochondrial DNA variation within populations. The adaptive significance of sympatric mitochondrial (mtDNA) variation and the role of selective mechanisms that maintain it are debated to this day. Isofemale lines of Drosophila obscura collected from four populations were backcrossed within populations to construct experimental lines, with all combinations of mtDNA Cyt b haplotypes and nuclear genetic backgrounds (nuDNA). Individuals of both sexes from these lines were then subjected to four fitness assays (desiccation resistance, developmental time, egg-to-adult viability and sex ratio) on two experimental temperatures to examine the role of temperature fluctuations and sex-specific selection, as well as the part that interactions between the two genomes play in shaping mtDNA variation. The results varied across populations and fitness components. In the majority of comparisons, they show that sympatric mitochondrial variants affect fitness. However, their effect should be examined in light of interactions with nuDNA, as mito-nuclear genotype was even more influential on fitness across all components. We found both sex-specific and temperature-specific differences in mitochondrial and mito-nuclear genotype ranks in all fitness components. The effect of temperature-specific selection was found to be more prominent, especially in desiccation resistance. From the results of different components tested, we can also infer that temperature-specific mito-nuclear interactions rather than sex-specific selection on mito-nuclear genotypes have a more substantial role in preserving mtDNA variation in this model species.

The study involved the simultaneous evaluation of the influence of the main reaction parameters affecting the performance of the selected catalyst, including temperature, catalyst loading, furfural concentration, and reaction time. An experimental design methodology was applied, aiming to maximize the performance of the catalyst in terms of GVL selectivity and efficient use of the biomass resource (minimizing the undesired products), herein denoted as "selective productivity". The effects of the studied reaction parameters on each response factor have been obtained and discussed. The ratio furfural/catalyst appears as the key parameter governing the performance of the catalyst system. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the maximum value achieved for GVL selective productivity is 0.61, corresponding to an SGVL of 70.0% and a productivity of 0.88 gGVL·gCAT -1. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Respiration Measurements of Individual Tardigrades of the Species Richtersius cf coronifer as a Function of Temperature and Salinity and Termination of Anhydrobiosis
VL  - 21

SP  - 853-865
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that tardigrades in a resting state (tun state) are very resistant to exceptional stress levels in comparison with the resistance observed in multicellular organisms in general. The types of stress include desiccation and radiation, which are also relevant in astrobiological research, and therefore, tardigrades are used as multicellular model organisms. For example, tardigrades have been investigated in the TARSE, TARDIS, RoTaRad, and TARDIKISS projects; their survival has been evaluated according to stressful conditions that prevail in low earth orbit, including the effects of cosmic radiation and microgravity. Despite this interest, the study of tardigrade biology has been severely hampered by the sparsity of appropriate quantitative techniques that inform at the single-organism level. In this study, we present results on mass-specific respiration rates as a function of termination of anhydrobiosis and variations in temperature and salinity, including Mars-analog perchlorate solutions, by using microsensor technology to measure respiration. Based on our results for Richtersius cf coronifer, we estimated the activation energy (50.8 kJ/mole O-2) for its metabolism as well as Q10 for selected temperature intervals. Q10 was constant-similar to 1.5-between 2 degrees C and 33 degrees C, except for the interval 11-16 degrees C, where Q10 was 5.5. The steady-state mass-specific respiration rate of individuals of Richtersius cf coronifer increased with increasing salinity below the lethal limit, likely representing the energy requirements of its osmoregulatory response. We report the first quantitative data of a tardigrade's metabolic dynamics during the termination of anhydrobiosis, revealing significant variation between individuals. However, we observed a general trend, that is, a high initial metabolic rate after exposure to water. Our approach would allow us to carry out quantitative physiological studies of tardigrades on board of the International Space Station, and thus significantly extend the possibility of studying the response of multicellular organisms in space. Summary statement This article reports on first measurements of mass-specific respiration rates of individual tardigrades of the species Richtersius cf coronifer during termination of anhydrobiosis as well as measurements of the impact of temperature and salinity on oxygen uptake rates.

AB  - Formation of particle deposit in the reactor cyclone of the commercial residue fluidized catalytic cracking (RFCC) process is one of the major problems causing serious catalyst carryover into the fractionators and process shutdown. This problem has been considered as an unavoidable issue in sustainable operations and required an accurate forecasting model. The particle deposition model in the cyclone dipleg of RFCC process is developed considering both of mathematical particle deposit factors and actual operating data. The model for particle deposition was researched in the viewpoint of transport phenomenon of particle. Verification of the model is conducted with actual plant data using parameter estimation method. Optimization model of RFCC process is developed by combining particle deposition model and cracking reaction model to find optimal operating conditions. The optimal operating conditions are found by selection of reaction temperature, catalyst/oil ratio and feed rate, to minimize particle deposit thickness. As a result, the operating cycle time is increased from 31 to 47 months (52%) by the decreasing particle deposition rate and the productivity of gasoline is increased at about 46% by increasing RFCC operation period. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 26

SP  - 2974-2986
AB  - The possibility of Miscanthus×giganteus cultivation as an energy crop on the different types of mining rocks was studied. It was revealed that a loess-like loam and red-brown clay with the added black soil were the most suitable for plant growing. The yield of dry above-ground biomass ranged from 4.3 to 6.8 t DM ha −1 after the first year of cultivation and from 8.9 to 9.7 t DM ha −1 after the second year while using these substrates. The application of amendments stimulated the growth and development of plants and increased productivity from 50 to 140%. M.×giganteus showed sufficient tolerance and good enough growth on the geochemically active dark-gray schist clay with yield from 2 to 3 t DM ha −1 after the first year of cultivation already. For plants grown on the different strata of dark-gray schist clay, the thermal decomposition of the biomass took place in four stages in the temperature range from 30 to 640 °C. The samples grown on stratum 0–20 cm showed the highest reactivity with a peak 30.6%/min at 290 °C. There were differences in the concentrations of determined heavy metals: iron, zinc, copper, and lead in the plant tissues depending on the layer depth of dark-gray schist clay from 0 to 20 cm to 40–60 cm. The relatively limited content of heavy metals in the above-ground biomass was due to the preferential accumulation in the roots. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Thermal ecology of Northern Water Snakes (Nerodia sipedon) in a northern wetland in central Michigan
VL  - 105
AB  - Semi-aquatic north-temperate reptiles experience challenging environmental conditions for thermoregulation on both seasonal and daily bases. We studied the thermal biology of north-temperate Northern Water Snakes (Nerodia sipedon) in central Michigan by remote radiotelemetry monitoring of snake body temperature (T-b) using surgically implanted thermally-sensitive radio-transmitters and by measuring operative temperatures (T-e) across a range of microhabitats using biophysical models. Our goals included evaluation of thermoregulatory capabilities at a locality that we viewed to be a fine-grained thermal environment, seasonal variations in patterns of thermoregulation, and the effects of sex on thermoregulation. During summer, snakes showed diel T-b cycling apparently using the open Sphagnum mat for late morning warming and shuttling among different microhabitats until early evening when a monotonic decline in T-b ensued and continued through the early morning hours. Snakes attained T-b within their laboratory-determined preferred body temperature range (T-set = 28-33 degrees C) mostly during late afternoon and with average percentages of T-b values for individual snakes within T-set range when permitted by operative temperatures (E-x) between 68 and 70% of the time depending on method of measurement. Relatively high investment in thermoregulation when thermal conditions were poor occurred only during September but declined thereafter as snakes prepared to overwinter. We did not detect differences in thermoregulation among reproductive females, non-reproductive females, and males. Relative to a population of N. sipedon at a higher latitude in Ontario our snakes showed a relatively high T-set range and thermoregulated more effectively, particularly during the daylight hours. It remains unclear how much inter-population variation in thermoregulation is due to potential adaptations to latitude, to habitat differences, or variations in methodologies.

TI  - The narrowing down of inoculated communities of coagulase-negative staphylococci in fermented meat models is modulated by temperature and pH
VL  - 274
SP  - 52-59
AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are involved in colour and flavour formation of fermented meats. Their communities are established either spontaneously, as in some artisan-type products, or using a starter culture. The latter usually consists of Staphylococcus carnosus and/or Staphylococcus xylosus strains, although strains from other CNS species also have potential for application. However, it is not entirely clear how the fitness of alternative starter cultures within a fermented meat matrix compares to conventional ones and how this may be affected by processing conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the influence of two key processing conditions, namely temperature and acidity, on the competitiveness of a cocktail of five different strains of CNS belonging to species that are potentially important for meat fermentation (Staphylococcus xylosus 2S7-2, S. carnosus 833, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Staphylococcus equorum DFL-S19, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus FPS1). To this end, fermented meat models consisting of cured meat batters with initial pH values of 5.3, 5.5, or 5.7 were inoculated with these strains, stuffed in containers, and incubated at 23, 30, or 37 °C. Both the pH level and the temperature influenced the composition of the CNS communities, giving a competitive advantage to the best adapted species. Staphylococcus xylosus preferred low temperature and mild acidity, whereas an elevated temperature selected for S. epidermidis and a low pH for S. carnosus. Under the conditions tested, S. saprophyticus and S. equorum were outcompeted by the three other CNS species. Hence, CNS communities in fermented meats are not only established based on the initial presence of specific species in the meat batter but also by their subsequent adaptation to the processing conditions during fermentation, potentially overruling the use of starter cultures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim. To study the influence of weather conditions on the formation of the spring barley crop under prevailing climatic changes. Material and Methods. The object of research was varieties and lines of spring barley of the FITZ Nemchinovka selection, which were studied annually in 2001-2020 in a competitive test in the conditions of the Moscow region. According to the meteorological data for the FITZ Nemchinovka, the average monthly indicators of precipitation, air temperature and GTCM were calculated. Mathematical processing of yield data was undertaken on a computer using the Excel programme. Results. A significant increase in the average monthly air temperature during the spring-summer season, an increase in the amount of precipitation in May and a decrease in other months of the growing season indicate a change in the climatic conditions of the region. In favorable years, with a GTCM value from 1.32 to 2.34, the average yield of barley was 5.88 t/ha and in dry years with GTCM values from 0.48 to 1.26 – 3.28 t/ha. In the spring-summer period, there was a relatively stable variability in yield from the dynamics of precipitation and GTCM (r= 0.346...0.572). The negative correlation dependence of the yield of varieties on the average monthly air temperature throughout the season had a relatively unstable character and manifested itself as very weak or medium (r= -0.021...-0.372). Conclusion. The positive yield trend observed in the conditions of the Moscow region with the annual use of the same agricultural machinery is due to an increase in the adaptive potential of new varieties and breeding lines of FITZ Nemchinovka. © 2022 The authors.

TI  - Differentiation, evolution and utilization of natural alleles for cold adaptability at the reproductive stage in rice
VL  - 18

SP  - 2491-2503
AB  - Genetic studies on cold tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice could lead to significant reductions in yield losses. However, knowledge about the genetic basis and adaptive differentiation, as well as the evolution and utilization of the underlying natural alleles, remains limited. Here, 580 rice accessions in two association panels were used to perform genome-wide association study, and 156 loci associated with cold tolerance at the reproductive stage were identified. Os01g0923600 and Os01g0923800 were identified as promising candidate genes in qCTB1t, a major associated locus. Through population genetic analyses, 22 and 29 divergent regions controlling cold adaptive differentiation inter-subspecies (Xian/Indica and Geng/Japonica) and intra-Geng, respectively, were identified. Joint analyses of four cloned cold-tolerance genes showed that they had different origins and utilizations under various climatic conditions. bZIP73 and OsAPX1 differentiating inter-subspecies evolved directly from wild rice, whereas the novel mutations CTB4a and Ctb1 arose in Geng during adaptation to colder climates. The cold-tolerant Geng accessions have undergone stronger selection under colder climate conditions than other accessions during the domestication and breeding processes. Additive effects of dominant allelic variants of four identified genes have been important in adaptation to cold in modern rice varieties. Therefore, this study provides valuable information for further gene discovery and pyramiding breeding to improve cold tolerance at the reproductive stage in rice. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 21

SP  - 245-260
AB  - Biotic resistance by native predators can limit the geographic range and abundance of non-native species following introduction into an ecosystem. Here we tested the hypothesis that the strength of predation pressure varies with latitude and limits the abundance and northward expansion of the non-native green porcelain crab, Petrolisthes armatus, whose northern range is also hypothesized to be limited by physical tolerances to cold temperatures. We quantified the predation risk of P. armatus across 400 km of the crab’s invasive range along the coastline of the southeastern US. In addition, we measured the density of large P. armatus, habitat quality, and other environmental factors that may affect the crab’s predation risk. Finally, we conducted a size-selective predator exclusion experiment to determine the predator species and size classes that may be consuming P. armatus. Results indicated that neither the density of large P. armatus nor its predation risk varied systematically with latitude. Instead, variation in predation risk was best explained by local site-level differences in habitat quality, the density of large P. armatus, and the mean abundance of predators. The predator exclusion experiment indicated that both small and large size classes of predators are capable of equally strong rates of predation on P. armatus. Together, our results suggest that although native predators readily consume P. armatus, they do not provide biotic resistance against its northward expansion. Instead, it seems likely that other latitudinally differential factors like low winter temperatures that decrease P. armatus survival are more influential in limiting the crab’s northern expansion. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Large-scale genome-wide study reveals climate adaptive variability in a cosmopolitan pest
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Understanding the genetic basis of climatic adaptation is essential for predicting species’ responses to climate change. However, intraspecific variation of these responses arising from local adaptation remains ambiguous for most species. Here, we analyze genomic data from diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) collected from 75 sites spanning six continents to reveal that climate-associated adaptive variation exhibits a roughly latitudinal pattern. By developing an eco-genetic index that combines genetic variation and physiological responses, we predict that most P. xylostella populations have high tolerance to projected future climates. Using genome editing, a key gene, PxCad, emerged from our analysis as functionally temperature responsive. Our results demonstrate that P. xylostella is largely capable of tolerating future climates in most of the world and will remain a global pest beyond 2050. This work improves our understanding of adaptive variation along environmental gradients, and advances pest forecasting by highlighting the genetic basis for local climate adaptation. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Average and extreme temperatures will increase in the near future, but how such shifts will affect mortality in natural populations is still unclear. We used a dynamic model to predict mortality under variable temperatures on the basis of heat tolerance laboratory measurements. Theoretical lethal temperatures for 11 Drosophila species under different warming conditions were virtually indistinguishable from empirical results. For Drosophila in the field, daily mortality predicted from ambient temperature records accumulate over weeks or months, consistent with observed seasonal fluctuations and population collapse in nature. Our model quantifies temperature-induced mortality in nature, which is crucial to study the effects of global warming on natural populations, and analyses highlight that critical temperatures are unreliable predictors of mortality. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

VL  - 15

SP  - 3741-3754
AB  - Pharmaceutical cocrystals have attracted increasing attention over the past decade as an alternative way to modify the physicochemical properties and hence improve the bioavailability of a drug, without sacrificing thermodynamic stability. Our previous work has demonstrated the viability of in situ formation of ibuprofen/isonicotinamide cocrystal suspensions within a matrix carrier via a single-step hot melt extrusion (HME) process. The key aim of the current work is to establish optimized processing conditions to improve cocrystal yield within extruded matrices. The solubility of each individual cocrystal component in the matrix carrier was estimated using two different methods, calculation of Hansen solubility parameters and Flory-Huggins solution theory using a melting point depression measurement method, respectively. The latter was found to be more relevant to extrusion cocrystallization because of the ability to predict miscibility across a range of temperatures. The predictions obtained from the F-H phase diagrams were verified using ternary extrusion processing. Temperatures that promote solubilization of the parent reagents during processing and precipitation of the newly formed cocrystal were found to be the most suitable in generating high cocrystal yields. The incorporation of intensive mixing/kneading elements to the screw configuration was also shown to significantly improve the cocrystal yield when utilizing a matrix platform. This work has shown that intensive mixing, in combination with appropriate temperature selection, can significantly improve the cocrystal yield within a stable and low viscosity carrier during HME processing. Most importantly, this work reports, for the very first time in the literature, the use of the F-H phase diagrams to guide the most appropriate HME processing window to drive higher cocrystal yield. © 2017 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 46

SP  - 459-471
AB  - The productivity zoning at the landscape level can help forest managers on land use decision making, based on correct area selection for the crop. The goal of this research was to estimate and generate a Eucalyptus productivity zoning of Sao Paulo state northeast and to determine the main limiting factors to growth based on model (temperature, frost, vapor deficit pressure, available soil water, and soil fertility). Productivity estimation was done using the model 3-PG, using as inputs estimated rainfall, maximum a minimum temperatures and soil maps. To validate the model, were compared the mean annual increment at 7 years (MAI 7) estimated by 3-PG with the inventory projection (forest with 5 to 8 years), corresponding around 58,000 ha. The average of all validated area was similar between the 3-PG estimation (41.9 m3 ha-1ano-1) and inventory projection, (44.1 m3 ha-1ano-1). However, when the comparison of the IMA7 between measured and predicted, stratified by soil type and farm was done, we found high data dispersion, probably because of the average climatic data used as model input, soil type detailing reflecting the soil water content, genetic material adaptation and silviculture management, or interaction of those factors. The results suggested that increase the analytical scale reduce the precision of the estimates. It was possible to make the zoning of the real productivity of Eucalyptus in the northeastern state of Saõ Paulo. The most productivity areas were located at south. The main growth constraints were vapor pressure deficit and soil water content. © 2018 University of Sao Paolo. All rights reserved.

TI  - New genes involved in mild stress response identified by transposon mutagenesis in Lactobacillus paracasei
VL  - 9
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are associated with various plant, animal, and human niches and are also present in many fermented foods and beverages. Thus, they are subjected to several stress conditions and have developed advanced response mechanisms to resist, adapt, and grow. This work aimed to identify the genes involved in some stress adaptation mechanisms in LAB. For this purpose, global reverse genetics was applied by screening a library of 1287 Lactobacillus paracasei transposon mutants for mild monofactorial stresses. This library was submitted independently to heat (52°C, 30 min), ethanol (170 g.L-1, 30 min), salt (NaCl 0.8 M, 24 h), acid (pH 4.5, 24 h), and oxidative (2 mM H2O2, 24 h) perturbations which trigger mild monofactorial stresses compatible with bacterial adaptation. Stress sensitivity of mutants was determined either by evaluating viability using propidium iodide (PI) staining, or by following growth inhibition through turbidity measurement. The screening for heat and ethanol stresses lead respectively to the identification of 63 and 27 genes/putative promoters whose disruption lead to an increased sensitivity. Among them, 14 genes or putative promoters were common for both stresses. For salt, acid and oxidative stresses, respectively 8, 6, and 9 genes or putative promoters were identified as essential for adaptation to these unfavorable conditions, with only three genes common to at least two stresses. Then, RT-qPCR was performed on selected stress response genes identified by mutant screenings in order to evaluate if their expression was modified in response to stresses in the parental strain. Eleven genes (membrane, transposase, chaperone, nucleotide and carbohydrate metabolism, and hypothetical protein genes) were upregulated during stress adaptation for at least two stresses. Seven genes, encoding membrane functions, were upregulated in response to a specific stress and thus could represent potential transcriptomic biomarkers. The results highlights that most of the genes identified by global reverse genetics are specifically required in response to one stress and that they are not differentially transcribed during stress in the parental strain. Most of these genes have not been characterized as stress response genes and provide new insights into the adaptation of lactic acid bacteria to their environment. © 2018 Palud, Scornec, Cavin and Licandro.

TI  - Pool-GWAS on reproductive dormancy in Drosophila simulans suggests a polygenic architecture
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - The genetic basis of adaptation to different environments has been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. Dormancy is a well-studied adaptation to facilitate overwintering. In Drosophila melanogaster, a moderate number of genes with large effects have been described, which suggests a simple genetic basis of dormancy. On the other hand, genome-wide scans for dormancy suggest a polygenic architecture in insects. In D. melanogaster, the analysis of the genetic architecture of dormancy is complicated by the presence of cosmopolitan inversions. Here, we performed a genome-wide scan to characterize the genetic basis of this ecologically extremely important trait in the sibling species of D. melanogaster, D. simulans that lacks cosmopolitan inversions. We performed Pool-GWAS in a South African D. simulans population for dormancy incidence at 2 temperature regimes (10 and 12℃, LD 10:14). We identified several genes with SNPs that showed a significant association with dormancy (P-value < 1e-13), but the overall modest response suggests that dormancy is a polygenic trait with many loci of small effect. Our results shed light on controversies on reproductive dormancy in Drosophila and have important implications for the characterization of the genetic basis of this trait. © The Author(s) 2022

TI  - Microbial diversity and adaptive strategies in the Mars-like Qaidam Basin, North Tibetan Plateau, China
AB  - The Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau, China, is one of the driest deserts at high elevations, and it has been considered a representative Mars analogue site. Despite recent advances in the diversity of microbial communities in the Qaidam Basin, our understanding of their genomic information, functional potential and adaptive strategies remains very limited. Here, we conducted a combination of physicochemical and metagenomic analyses to investigate the taxonomic composition and adaptive strategies of microbial life in the regolith across the Qaidam Basin. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-based and metagenomic analyses both reveal that microbial communities in the Qaidam Basin are dominated by the bacterial phylum Actinobacteria. The low levels of moisture and organic carbon contents appear to have essential constraints on microbial biomass and diversity. A total of 50 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes were reconstructed and analysed. Our results reveal the potential of microorganisms to use ambient trace gases to meet energy and carbon needs in this nutrient-limited desert. Furthermore, we find that DNA repair mechanisms and protein protection are likely essential for microbial life in response to stressors of hyperaridity, intense ultraviolet radiation and tremendous temperature fluctuations in this Mars analogue. These findings shed light on the diversity and survival strategies of microbial life inhabiting Mar-like environments, which provide implications for potential life on early Mars. © 2022 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Survival of the feces: Does a nematode lungworm adaptively manipulate the behavior of its cane toad host?
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SP  - 4606-4618
AB  - Parasites can enhance their fitness by modifying the behavior of their hosts in ways that increase rates of production and transmission of parasite larvae. We used an antihelminthic drug to experimentally alter infections of lungworms (Rhabdias pseudosphaerocephala) in cane toads (Rhinella marina). We then compared subsequent behaviors of dewormed toads versus toads that retained infections. Both in the laboratory and in the field, the presence of parasites induced hosts to select higher body temperatures (thereby increasing rates of lungworm egg production), to defecate in moister sites, and to produce feces with higher moisture content (thereby enhancing survival of larvae shed in feces). Because those behavioral modifications enhance rather than decrease parasite fitness, they are likely to have arisen as adaptive manipulations of host behavior rather than as host adaptations to combat infection or as nonadaptive consequences of infection on host physiology. However, the mechanisms by which lungworms alter cane toad thermal preference and defecation are not known. Although many examples of host manipulation by parasites involve intermediate hosts facilitating their own demise, our findings indicate that manipulation of definitive hosts can be as subtle as when and where to defecate. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptive thermal plasticity enhances sperm and egg performance in a model insect
VL  - 8
AB  - Rising and more variable global temperatures pose a challenge for biodiversity, with reproduction and fertility being especially sensitive to heat. Here, we assessed the potential for thermal adaptation in sperm and egg function using Tribolium flour beetles, a warm-temperate-tropical insect model. Following temperature increases through adult development, we found opposing gamete responses, with males producing shorter sperm and females laying larger eggs. Importantly, this gamete phenotypic plasticity was adaptive: thermal translocation experiments showed that both sperm and eggs produced in warmer conditions had superior reproductive performance in warmer environments, and vice versa for cooler production conditions and reproductive environments. In warmer environments, gamete plasticity enabled males to double their reproductive success, and females could increase offspring production by one-third. Our results reveal exciting potential for sensitive but vital traits within reproduction to handle increasing and more variable thermal regimes in the natural environment. © Vasudeva et al.

VL  - 63
IS  - 1
AB  - In the last decade it has been shown that disruptions on the ionospheric parameters have the most important impact in the studies related to the prediction of earthquakes. Therefore, researches in the field of ionospheric perturbations have particular importance in recent years. In this paper, the density of positive ions of oxygen, hydrogen, helium and ion temperature have been selected among the ionospheric parameters. Since solar activities and geomagnetic noises were at high level during early months of 2005 (especially in January) and late month of 2006, so sampling of the four components is performed during those periods. In this paper the main source of sampling is IAP sensor of Demeter satellite which is considered as measurement source. The error between Demeter measurement source and IRI model will be considered as disturbance occurred by solar activities. It is shown that Nakagami statistical model fits very well on the disturbances functions, and by using ML (Maximum Likelihood) method, Nakagami distribution parameters have been estimated. Finally we confirm the accuracy of Nakagami statistical model by using Pearson-Chi-Square goodness of fitness test. © 2018 Institute of Thermomechanics CAS, v.v.i.

TI  - Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) Cage-Site Distribution, Behavior, and Physiology During a Newfoundland Heat Wave
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Climate change is leading to increased water temperatures and reduced oxygen levels at sea-cage sites, and this is a challenge that the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry must adapt to it if it needs to grow sustainably. However, to do this, the industry must better understand how sea-cage conditions influence the physiology and behavior of the fish. Method: We fitted ~2.5 kg Atlantic salmon on the south coast of Newfoundland with Star-Oddi milli-HRT ACT and Milli-TD data loggers (data storage tags, DSTs) in the summer of 2019 that allowed us to simultaneously record the fish's 3D acceleration (i.e., activity/behavior), electrocardiograms (and thus, heart rate and heart rate variability), depth, and temperature from early July to mid-October. Results: Over the course of the summer/fall, surface water temperatures went from ~10–12 to 18–19.5°C, and then fell to 8°C. The data provide valuable information on how cage-site conditions affected the salmon and their determining factors. For example, although the fish typically selected a temperature of 14–18°C when available (i.e., this is their preferred temperature in culture), and thus were found deeper in the cage as surface water temperatures peaked, they continued to use the full range of depths available during the warmest part of the summer. The depth occupied by the fish and heart rate were greater during the day, but the latter effect was not temperature-related. Finally, while the fish generally swam at 0.4–1.0 body lengths per second (25–60 cm s−1), their activity and the proportion of time spent using non-steady swimming (i.e., burst-and-coast swimming) increased when feeding was stopped at high temperatures. Conclusion: Data storage tags that record multiple parameters are an effective tool to understand how cage-site conditions and management influence salmon (fish) behavior, physiology, and welfare in culture, and can even be used to provide fine-scale mapping of environmental conditions. The data collected here, and that in recent publications, strongly suggest that pathogen (biotic) challenges in combination with high temperatures, not high temperatures + moderate hypoxia (~70% air saturation) by themselves, are the biggest climate-related challenge facing the salmon aquaculture industry outside of Tasmania. © Copyright © 2021 Gamperl, Zrini and Sandrelli.

TI  - Multifunctional-imprinted nanocomposite membranes with thermo-responsive biocompatibility for selective/controllable recognition and separation application
VL  - 582
SP  - 991-1002
AB  - Inspired by the biomimetic modification strategy of dopamine self-polymerization technique, molecularly imprinted nanocomposite membranes (MINCMs) with thermo-responsive rebinding and separation perfor-mance were synthesized and evaluated. Herein, the Au/SiO2-based multilevel structure had been successfully obtained onto the polydopamine (pDA) modified membrane surfaces. Afterward, the poly(Nisopropylacrylamide)-based biomolecule-imprinted sites were adequately constructed by developing a photoinitiated atom transfer radical polymerization (pATRP) imprinting strategy using the high-biocompatible ovalbumin (Ova, pI 4.6) as template molecule. Therefore, thermo-responsive 'specific recognition sites' toward Ova were then achieved on the as-prepared MINCMs after the well-designed imprinting process. When the external temperature was set at 37 degrees C, excellent ovalbumin rebinding capacity (33.26 mg/g), selectivity factor (3.06) and structural stability were obtained. Importantly, as to the controllable biocompatibility research of this work, the bare glass and Ova-bound-MINCMs (the MINCMs were bound with Ova) showed basically the same cell adhesion behaviors and viability, indicating the excellent biocompatibility of the Ovabound-MINCMs. Additionally, efficient and rapid regulation of cell adhesion/detachment on ovalbuminbound MINCMs could be still obtained even after 10 cycles of temperature-switch process, which indicated that the as-prepared MINCMs had strong ability to work under high intensity and long continuous operation.

VL  - 23

AB  - Today the Russian Federation has one of the worst indicators in the world in terms of morbidity and mortality from stroke. Currently, two methods are used to treat ischemic stroke: thrombolysis and thrombextraction. However, despite their effectiveness, the methods have limited use due to the presence of strict indications and contraindications. In this regard, the search for new methods of treating ischemic stroke, which can be effective both with independent use and as an addition to already existing methods, is an urgent task. The purpose of this paper is to review research studies on the use of hypothermia in ischemic stroke. Hypothermia has a proven neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia. In this context, interest is the method of intracarotid selective cerebral hypothermia, which, according to a number of preclinical studies, significantly reduces the volume of cerebral infarction after ischemic stroke. The advantage of this method is the rapid achievement of the target temperature, a targeted effect on the brain and a minimal effect on the system temperature. Thus, intracarotid selective cerebral hypothermia is a very promising method for the treatment of ischemic stroke and deserves further study. In this regard, the authors decided to conduct a preclinical study on this subject. © 2019 Fartakov et al

TI  - Temperature-dependent effects of house fly proto-Y chromosomes on gene expression could be responsible for fitness differences that maintain polygenic sex determination
VL  - 30
IS  - 22
SP  - 5704-5720
AB  - Sex determination, the developmental process by which sexually dimorphic phenotypes are established, evolves fast. Evolutionary turnover in a sex determination pathway may occur via selection on alleles that are genetically linked to a new master sex determining locus on a newly formed proto-sex chromosome. Species with polygenic sex determination, in which master regulatory genes are found on multiple different proto-sex chromosomes, are informative models to study the evolution of sex determination and sex chromosomes. House flies are such a model system, with male determining loci possible on all six chromosomes and a female-determiner on one of the chromosomes as well. The two most common male-determining proto-Y chromosomes form latitudinal clines on multiple continents, suggesting that temperature variation is an important selection pressure responsible for maintaining polygenic sex determination in this species. Temperature-dependent fitness effects could be manifested through temperature-dependent gene expression differences across proto-Y chromosome genotypes. These gene expression differences may be the result of cis regulatory variants that affect the expression of genes on the proto-sex chromosomes, or trans effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on genes elswhere in the genome. We used RNA-seq to identify genes whose expression depends on proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature in adult male house flies. We found no evidence for ecologically meaningful temperature-dependent expression differences of sex determining genes between male genotypes, but we were probably not sampling an appropriate developmental time-point to identify such effects. In contrast, we identified many other genes whose expression depends on the interaction between proto-Y chromosome genotype and temperature, including genes that encode proteins involved in reproduction, metabolism, lifespan, stress response, and immunity. Notably, genes with genotype-by-temperature interactions on expression were not enriched on the proto-sex chromosomes. Moreover, there was no evidence that temperature-dependent expression is driven by chromosome-wide cis-regulatory divergence between the proto-Y and proto-X alleles. Therefore, if temperature-dependent gene expression is responsible for differences in phenotypes and fitness of proto-Y genotypes across house fly populations, these effects are driven by a small number of temperature-dependent alleles on the proto-Y chromosomes that may have trans effects on the expression of genes on other chromosomes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Hypoxia causes woodlice (Porcellio scaber) to select lower temperatures and impairs their thermal performance and heat tolerance
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
AB  - Environmental temperatures and oxygen availability are important for the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Terrestrial organisms are generally perceived to be less limited by access to oxygen than their aquatic counterparts. Nevertheless, even terrestrial environments can be deficient in oxygen, especially for organisms occurring in soil, litter, wood, rotten fruit or at high elevations. While isopods are the best adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle among crustaceans, many species, including woodlice, occupy environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen. To investigate whether mismatches between oxygen supply and demand can result in a loss of performance in a terrestrial organism, we studied the effects of atmospheric oxygen concentration on the thermal performance of the common rough woodlouse (Porcellio scaber). We compared the thermal preference, thermal sensitivity of running speed, and tolerance to extreme temperatures of woodlice exposed to one of two oxygen concentrations (21% - normoxia, 7% - hypoxia). Under hypoxia, P. scaber preferred microhabitats with temperatures that were on average 3C lower than those preferred under normoxia. The running speed tended to reach its maximum at a lower temperature under hypoxia than under normoxia (25.13C vs 28.87C, respectively, although p was equal to 0.09), and normoxic woodlice ran approximately 1.5-fold faster than hypoxic woodlice at the point of maximum speed. Heat tolerance was significantly lower under hypoxia (38.9C) than under normoxia (40.7C), but there was no difference in cold tolerance (5.81C under normoxia and 5.44C under hypoxia). Overall, our results indicate that environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen may shape the physiological performance of terrestrial ectotherms, likely via their effects on the balance between oxygen supply and demand, which may have fitness consequences for these organisms in nature. © 2019 Antoł et al.

TI  - Optimal construction site conditions for concrete operations
VL  - 2018
SP  - 602-610
AB  - Concrete usually undergoes stringent quality controls during its fabrication in a batching plant or when made in situ. However, there are several conditions in the construction site that may affect concrete quality and operations. Reduction in compressive strength, increment in costs of concrete fabrication and low productivity are among the consequences of adverse jobsite conditions. In this study, construction site conditions including crew experience, compaction method, mixing time, curing humidity, and curing temperature were selected as variables to conduct a full 25 factorial experimental design for quantifying their effect on concrete. Cylindrical concrete samples were fabricated and evaluated under each factor combination. Concrete compressive strength as a quality metric, costs, and production rates were measured as the experimental responses. Significant affecting factors and their effects on concrete were identified through the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and used to predict concrete compressive strength, cost, and production effects. A multi-objective optimization problem based on compromised solutions was formulated to maximize both concrete quality and production rates, and to minimize operation costs. The results show that high curing humidity and temperature have a positive effect on compressive strength while high mixing times increases concrete cost and reduces productivity. The proposed optimization model provides construction managers with a tool that allows finding in-situ construction conditions to reach desired goals. Further, understanding the possible impacts of these site conditions on concrete allows taking preventive actions. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.

TI  - Nociception and hypersensitivity involve distinct neurons and molecular transducers in Drosophila
VL  - 119
IS  - 12
AB  - Acute nociception is essential for survival by warning organisms against potential dangers, whereas tissue injury results in a nociceptive hypersensitivity state that is closely associated with debilitating disease conditions, such as chronic pain. Transient receptor potential (Trp) ion channels expressed in nociceptors detect noxious thermal and chemical stimuli to initiate acute nociception. The existing hypersensitivity model suggests that under tissue injury and inflammation, the same Trp channels in nociceptors are sensitized through transcriptional and posttranslational modulation, leading to nociceptive hypersensitivity. Unexpectedly and different from this model, we find that in Drosophila larvae, acute heat nociception and tissue injury-induced hypersensitivity involve distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms. Specifically, TrpA1-D in peripheral sensory neurons mediates acute heat nociception, whereas TrpA1-C in a cluster of larval brain neurons transduces the heat stimulus under the allodynia state. As a result, interfering with synaptic transmission of these brain neurons or genetic targeting of TrpA1-C blocks heat allodynia but not acute heat nociception. TrpA1-C and TrpA1-D are two splicing variants of TrpA1 channels and are coexpressed in these brain neurons. We further show that Gq-phospholipase C signaling, downstream of the proalgesic neuropeptide Tachykinin, differentially modulates these two TrpA1 isoforms in the brain neurons by selectively sensitizing heat responses of TrpA1-C but not TrpA1-D. Together, our studies provide evidence that nociception and noncaptive sensitization could be mediated by distinct sensory neurons and molecular sensors. Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

TI  - In situ growth and bioerosion rates of Lophelia pertusa in a Norwegian fjord and open shelf cold-water coral habitat
VL  - 2019
IS  - 9
AB  - Coral reef resilience depends on the balance between carbonate precipitation, leading to reef growth, and carbonate degradation, for example, through bioerosion. Changes in environmental conditions are likely to affect the two processes differently, thereby shifting the balance between reef growth and degradation. In cold-water corals estimates of accretion-erosion processes in their natural habitat are scarce and solely live coral growth rates were studied with regard to future environmental changes in the laboratory so far, limiting our ability to assess the potential of cold-water coral reef ecosystems to cope with environmental changes. In the present study, growth rates of the two predominant colour morphotypes of live Lophelia pertusa as well as bioerosion rates of dead coral framework were assessed in different environmental settings in Norwegian cold-water coral reefs in a 1-year in situ experiment. Net growth (in weight gain and linear extension) of live L. pertusa was in the lower range of previous estimates and did not significantly differ between inshore (fjord) and offshore (open shelf) habitats. However, slightly higher net growth rates were obtained inshore. Bioerosion rates were significantly higher on-reef in the fjord compared to off-reef deployments in- and offshore. Besides, on-reef coral fragments yielded a broader range of individual growth and bioerosion rates, indicating higher turnover in live reef structures than off-reef with regard to accretion-bioerosion processes. Moreover, if the higher variation in growth rates represents a greater variance in (genetic) adaptations to natural environmental variability in the fjord, inshore reefs could possibly benefit under future ocean change compared to offshore reefs. Although not significantly different due to high variances between replicates, growth rates of orange branches were consistently higher at all sites, while mortality was statistically significantly lower, potentially indicating higher stress-resistance than the less pigmented white phenotype. Comparing the here measured rates of net accretion of live corals (regardless of colour morphotype) with net erosion of dead coral framework gives a first estimate of the dimensions of both processes in natural cold-water coral habitats, indicating that calcium carbonate loss through bioerosion amounts to one fifth to one sixth of the production rates by coral calcification (disregarding accretion processes of other organisms and proportion of live and dead coral framework in a reef). With regard to likely accelerating bioerosion and diminishing growth rates of corals under ocean acidification, the balance of reef accretion and degradation may be shifted towards higher biogenic dissolution in the future.

VL  - 74
IS  - 5
AB  - Abstract: Many species of bats live in dynamic associations in which individuals aggregate or split into smaller or larger groups, moving between roost sites, but factors influencing group size and roost switching decisions in bats living in fission-fusion societies are poorly understood. To test the extent to which fission-fusion dynamics are species-specific and shaped by environmental factors, we radio-tracked two closely related species: noctule bats Nyctalus noctula and Leisler’s bats N. leisleri in well-preserved, old-growth stands of the Białowieża Forest, where roost availability and diversity is high and bats can potentially freely exhibit fission-fusion behaviour. We estimated the number of bats per roost and noted the tree species selected as roost sites. We evaluated the influence of ambient temperature and roost tree species on bat group size and the process of roost switching, and their seasonal component. Our results revealed that bat group size showed species-specific differences in seasonal variation, relationship to ambient temperature and tree species. The number of noctule bats emerging from a roost was relatively stable with a weak tendency to decrease during the breeding season while the number of Leisler’s bats emerging from a roost increased when the juveniles started to be volant. Group size of noctule bats increased with ambient temperature. Leisler’s bats formed smaller colonies in oaks and ashes than in other tree species. Roost switching rate was associated with ambient temperature and tree species selected by the bats. The bats changed roosts more frequently when the minimum ambient temperature increased, and less often in ashes than in oaks and other tree species. Our results show that bat group size and roost switching behaviour are shaped by both environmental factors and the stage of reproduction. Significance statement: Environmental factors may affect group size and roost switching behaviour of bats forming fission-fusion associations, but this is expected to vary depending on body size, environmental conditions, as well as seasonally. Few studies have explored this behaviour in tree-dwelling bats and examined how it differs between species. Here, we studied the group size dynamics and the process of roost switching in closely related bat species living in well-preserved, European old-growth forests, for which the knowledge of these patterns is particularly poor. We demonstrate for the first time that bat group size and roost switching rate relates to roost tree species selected by bats, the ambient temperature and varies seasonally, and that these effects are species-specific. The results point out the importance of the availability of suitable roost trees providing a range of microclimatic conditions for maintaining efficient fission-fusion dynamics throughout the reproductive period. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Plasticity and climatic sensitivity of wood anatomy contribute to performance of eastern Baltic provenances of Scots pine
VL  - 452
AB  - The efficiency of water use and transport are among the main factors affecting competitiveness, growth, and distribution of trees under warming climate. The phenotypical and genetic plasticity of tree populations is considered as an indicator of their adaptive capacity under changing environment. Climatic changes are expected to affect growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and selection of reproductive material among the populations suitable for future climates has been advised for sustaining productivity of stands. In this regard, provenance trials can serve as source of comprehensive information about growth plasticity and climate-growth interactions of diverse populations. Quantitative wood anatomy can provide detailed information about xylogenesis and factors affecting it, which are crucial for long-term predictions. Wood anatomy of two top- (Gustrow and Rytel), two low-performing (Eibenstock and Dippoldiswalde), and one local (Kalsnava) provenances of Scots pine from the eastern Baltic region growing in three provenance trials in Latvia was studied using mixed models, accounting for the experimental design, as well as using the time-series approach. Provenance had a significant effect on the studied wood anatomical proxies, indicating genetic adaptation of xylogenesis. The top-performing provenances, which originated from warmer and drier conditions, had tracheids with larger lumens and thinner walls, thus indicating adaptation to water deficit. The top-performing Rytel provenance showed the highest phenotypical plasticity of lumen cross-section area and cell wall thickness of stemwood tracheids. The studied low-performing provenances, which originated from the Orr Mountains, had tracheids with thicker wall and smaller lumens, likely to ensure mechanical durability. The local provenance showed intermediate values of the studied wood anatomical proxies. The effect of provenance on wood anatomical proxies showed some variations among the trials, which differed by continentality, likely due to ecological transfer distance. The studied anatomical proxies were affected by weather conditions prior and during formation of a tree ring, yet these relationships differed by trial and provenance. In general, wood anatomy of earlywood was affected by temperature in the dormant period and beginning of summer, as well as precipitation in the end of the previous vegetation period. Proxies of latewood showed correlation with temperature (negative) and precipitation (positive) in summer, suggesting response to the availability of water. Considering the observed relationships, the top-performing provenances, particularly Rytel, have a high potential to sustain productivity of stands within the region in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Laser Pre-cut and Its Effect on the Leadframe Warpage
AB  - ATSLP, a package in QFN type family, was introduced by Infineon using Molded Interconnect Substrate (MIS) leadframe. The MIS leadframe contain materials such as, copper, pre-mold, solder mask, and etc. With combination of MIS leadframe and high temperature flip chip die bond cause high CTE mismatch, thus, effect in higher warpage. The higher warpage affects the processability along the assembly processes which has direct relation with productivity performance and quality concerns. Stress relieve concept is introduced to improve productivity and quality, whereby warpage was reduced by separating the pre-mold and copper materials. By doing this, shrinkage of the materials was separated from each other along the change of assembly process temperature. Laser is selected as the source to perform cutting of pre-mold array. Polyimide tape is attached to the leadframe to hold the separated pre-mold array. Laser with non-contact cutting method, low thermal influence as well as having clean cut edges without burr or dust formation is ideal solution for this separation method. Through the laser precut on array method, productivity, material consumption, and output quality were improved as the warpage is significantly reduced. This paper further describe the selection of laser type, reaction of laser to polyimide tape, cutting process methods, and as well as the challenges faced along the assembly process. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen of a variety of aquatic animals that displays extreme diversity in drug resistance, phenotypes, virulence genes, and virulence. In this study, eight pathogenic A. hydrophila strains were isolated from diseased Amur sturgeons and investigated for their sensitivity to select antibiotics, their phenotype, virulence genes, and virulence. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the DNA gyrase subunit B protein, the eight isolates formed a single branch in the A. hydrophila group. The antibiotics ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime appeared effective against them. All of the isolates possessed the virulence genes for aerolysin, flagellin, heat-stable cytotonic enterotoxin, heat-labile cytotonic enterotoxin, hemolysin, and elastase, while only one isolate, HZ8, possessed the gene for lateral flagella. The cytolytic enterotoxin and lipase genes were present in all isolates, except in ZJ10 and ZJ12. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR indicated that the eight A. hydrophila isolates could be divided into four types. Isolates YW2, TR3, HZ8 and ZJ10, each representing a different type, were selected for challenge experiments. The challenge tests revealed that isolate HZ8 had the lowest lethal dose, causing 50% mortality at 2.30 × 104 colony forming units (cfu)/ml. The isolate ZJ10 had the highest LD50, 1.25 × 106 cfu/ml. Knowledge of the characteristics of the A. hydrophila isolates obtained from Amur sturgeon will be beneficial in developing potential disease control strategies. ©2018 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

VL  - 11

AB  - Temperature is a critical single factor influencing insect population dynamics, and is foundational for improving our understanding of the phenology of invasive species adapting to new agroecosystems or in the process of range expansion. An age-stage, two-sex life table was therefore developed to analyze fundamental demographic features such as development, survival, and reproduction of a Minnesota-acclimated population of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys), in the north central USA. All salient life history parameters were estimated to better understand the population growth potential of H. halys at the current limit of its northern range in North America. We examined the effect of selected constant temperatures on immature development and survival (15–39 °C), and adult reproduction longevity (17–36 °C) of H. halys in the laboratory. The Minnesota population developed faster and survived at higher rates relative to a population that had previously established in Pennsylvania, USA. Mean generation time for the Minnesota population was minimized at 30 °C, while survival and fecundity were maximized at 27 and 23 °C, respectively. Given these findings, we assessed the effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of increase (rm), the life table parameter that integrates the effects of temperature on development, survival, and reproduction. A Ratkowsky model predicted rm was maximized (0.0899) at 27.5 °C. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding population growth rates for H. halys in the context of a warming climate, and potential to emerge as a serious crop pest in the Midwest U.S. region. © 2020 by the authors.

VL  - 34

SP  - 129-136 and 226
AB  - Egg white is rich in proteins and has high biological values and biological activities, which has been served as an excellent food resource. However, the egg white protein products have not yet been fully developed. Here, orthogonal experiment was designed by selecting four factors, including hydrolysis time, hydrolysis temperature, pH and enzyme dosage based on single factor experiments. The solubility and dispersibility of egg white protein powder were traced as evaluation indicators for optimizing enzymatic process. The results showed that the optimal solubility and dispersion time of egg white protein powder reached 96.6% and 39.6 s, respectively when the ratio of neutral protease to papain, the enzyme amount, the hydrolysis temperature, enzymatic hydrolysis time and pH being of 1:2, 800 U/g, 53.5 ℃, 90 min and 5.5, respectively. Furthermore, the effects of simulate gastrointestinal digestion products (SGDP) derived from highly soluble egg white protein powder on the RAW264.7 macrophages was studied by cell experiment. The results showed that SGDP significantly increased the level of acid phosphatase (ACP) and lysozyme (LZM) intracellular. Meanwhile, the role of SGDP in immunoregulation was confirmed by the enhanced proliferation potential (proliferation index 1.28) and cytokine release. This study can provide an important reference for the development of egg protein products with highly soluble and function. © 2018, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

TI  - Methane-to-Methanol: Activity Descriptors in Copper-Exchanged Zeolites for the Rational Design of Materials
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
SP  - 6293-6304
AB  - The direct conversion of methane to methanol in a stepwise process over copper-exchanged zeolites is currently one of the most-studied reactions. Despite these studies and the partial identification of the active species and reaction mechanism, it has not been possible to design the best material and determine the ideal process conditions for industrial implementation. This study shows how to design a significantly better performing material and the reaction parameters to enhance the methanol yield. This led to the highest methanol productivity to date, using a material that until recently was considered to be inactive, opening an original direction for the design of active materials. It is shown that the zeolite framework affects the structure and redox properties of copper species, formed during ion exchange and treatment procedures. In turn, these CuII-oxo species demonstrate different redox properties, which correlate with the methanol productivity and selectivity: high temperature of copper reduction leads to low activity in the reaction with methane, while low reduction temperature results in overoxidation of methanol to carbon monoxide and formate species. This relationship enables the prediction of the optimal operation temperature of copper-exchanged zeolite, as illustrated for CuFAU, which had been considered to be inactive in methane conversion to methanol. Its multicyclic operation in the isothermal regime at 633 K and ambient pressure gave a stable methanol yield of 90 μmol/g and 92% selectivity, while an increase in the copper loading and methane pressure resulted in the unprecedented yield of 360 μmol/g. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - New insights in enumeration methodologies of probiotic cells in finished products
VL  - 175
AB  - The number of bacterial cells is currently recognized as the most important parameter for the efficacy and quality of finished probiotic or live biotherapeutic products (LBP). Cell enumeration is generally performed by culture-dependent methodologies like plate count (PC). These techniques are able to reveal the number of viable cells able to replicate and generate a colony. However, they are limited by their dependence on the combination of culture conditions (e.g. nutrients, temperature) selected for cell recovery. Additionally, they do not provide information on the heterogeneity of a bacterial culture, namely they do not detect the cells in a viable but not cultivable (VBNC) status. Flow-cytometry (FC) is a culture-independent methodology having the potential to enumerate selectively live and damaged or dead cells. FC relies on the use of specific probes for different cell targets (e.g. membrane, enzymes) to unveil information on the cell structure and physiological statuses within a bacterial population. In this context, we monitored three batches of freeze-dried Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) during a 3 year of storage at different conditions of temperature and relative humidity, according to ICH guidelines, by means of PC and FC. The Arrhenius model was applied to assess the suitability of the model to predict the mortality of probiotic cells in finished products. The higher destruction rate (k) obtained by PC data compared to FC data suggests a faster reduction of cultivability compared to membrane integrity, probably representing a dynamic shift of the bacterial population into a VBNC/dormant status during storage time. Interestingly, this mechanistic approach works both for PC and FC methodologies increasing the chances to monitor biological phenomenon within a mathematical modelling. The combined use of PC and FC shed lights on the true bacterial potency within a closed system like a finished product and the complexity of its heterogeneity. © 2020 The Authors

TI  - A Deterministic Model for Understanding Nonlinear Viral Dynamics in Oysters
VL  - 88
IS  - 8
AB  - The fate of viruses in contaminated oysters has received a significant amount of attention in the fields of oyster aquaculture, food quality control, and public health. However, intensive studies through laboratory experiments and in situ observations are often conducted under a narrow range of experimental conditions and for a specific purpose in their respective fields. Contamination of oysters with a variety of viruses is one key pathway to trigger outbreaks of massive oyster mortality as well as human illnesses, including gastroenteritis and hepatitis. Much effort has gone into examining the fate of viruses in contaminated oysters, yet the current state of knowledge of nonlinear virus-oyster interactions is not comprehensive because most studies have focused on a limited number of processes under a narrow range of experimental conditions. A framework is needed for describing the complex nonlinear virus-oyster interactions. Here, we introduce a mathematical model that includes key processes for viral dynamics in oysters, such as oyster filtration, viral replication, the antiviral immune response, apoptosis, autophagy, and selective accumulation. We evaluate the model performance for two groups of viruses, those that replicate in oysters (e.g., ostreid herpesvirus) and those that do not (e.g., norovirus), and show that this model simulates well the viral dynamics in oysters for both groups. The model analytically explains experimental findings and predicts how changes in different physiological processes and environmental conditions nonlinearly affect in-host viral dynamics, for example, that oysters at higher temperatures may be more resistant to infection by ostreid herpesvirus. It also provides new insight into food treatment for controlling outbreaks, for example, that depuration for reducing norovirus levels is more effective in environments where oyster filtration rates are higher. This study provides the foundation of a modeling framework to guide future experiments and numerical modeling for better prediction and management of outbreaks. IMPORTANCE The fate of viruses in contaminated oysters has received a significant amount of attention in the fields of oyster aquaculture, food quality control, and public health. However, intensive studies through laboratory experiments and in situ observations are often conducted under a narrow range of experimental conditions and for a specific purpose in their respective fields. Given the complex interactions of various processes and nonlinear viral responses to changes in physiological and environmental conditions, a theoretical framework fully describing the viral dynamics in oysters is warranted to guide future studies from a top-down design. Here, we developed a process-based, in-host modeling framework that builds a bridge for better communications between different disciplines studying virus-oyster interactions.

VL  - 8

SP  - 431-438
AB  - The effects of five levels of osmolality and pH as well as three temperatures on Awassi ram sperm motility parameters assessed by computer-aided sperm analyzer (CASA) in tyrode albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) and egg-yolk-tris (YET) media were studied. Semen obtained from five adult Awassi rams were pooled and diluted in the above two media at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mOsm/kg at temperatures of 4°, 20° and 37° degree celsius and also at pH levels of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 at the same temperatures. The osmolality, pH and temperature had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on the percent motility (MOT %) and the percent of sperm showing progressive motility (PMOT %). With the exception of lateral head displacement, all the other CASA motility parameters were also significantly affected (P < 0.05). Semen incubated in YET was able to tolerate osmolarities within 200 to 400 mOsm/kg range for MOT %. Alkaline condition at pH 9 had higher negative effect than acidic condition at pH 5. Compared to the 20 °C and 37 °C, the 4 °C had negatively affected MOT % and PMOT % and this was more obvious in TALP medium. In conclusion, our results suggest: 1) the significant effects of osmolality, pH and temperature on Awassi sperm incubated in both TALP and YET media and 2) the need for careful selection of temperature by which the semen may be manipulated during artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization experiments in these two media. © 2010 by Islamic Azad Univerty, Rasht Branch, Rasht, Iran.

VL  - 35

SP  - 2635-2646
AB  - Phenotypic variation within populations is influenced by the environment via plasticity and natural selection. How phenotypes respond to the environment can vary among traits, populations and life stages in ways that can influence fitness. Plastic responses during early development are particularly important because they can affect components of fitness throughout an individual's life. Consequently, how natural selection shapes developmental plasticity could be influenced by fitness consequences across different life stages. Moreover, spatial variation in selection pressures could generate differences in plastic responses among populations. To gain insight into sources of variation in phenotypes and survival, we used a laboratory egg incubation experiment using brown anole lizards Anolis sagrei from mainland (ancestral) and island (descendent) populations, combined with a mark–release–recapture experiment in the field. Our study was designed to (a) quantify the effects developmental temperature on embryo development and offspring morphology, (b) assess how developmental temperature influences offspring survival across different life stages and (c) quantify how thermal reaction norms vary among ancestral and descendant populations. Developmental temperature influenced offspring morphology, but thermal reaction norms of embryos showed little variation among populations. Developmental temperature influenced offspring survival, but the patterns differed between embryo and hatchling stages; the optimal temperature for embryos was about 5℃ lower than that for hatchlings. High temperatures were thermally stressful to embryos, but they reduced incubation duration and led to early hatching. In turn, earlier hatching increased the probability of survival to adulthood. Moreover, the effect of developmental temperature on hatchling survival was most pronounced for offspring that hatched late in the season. The difference in optimal developmental temperatures between life stages may be driven by physiological tolerance for embryos and by ecological factors for hatchlings. Moreover, the fitness consequences of the developmental environment depend on the phenology of hatching. Overall, these results highlight how the developmental environment can differentially affect fitness across life stages and show that temporal thermal heterogeneity can influence survival of embryos, but the consequences on post-hatching stages may vary at different times of the season.

VL  - 97

SP  - 1124-1132
AB  - Family-based selective breeding can be an effective strategy for controlling diseases in aquaculture. This study aimed to estimate (co)variance components for resistance to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) and columnaris disease (CD) in two unrelated rainbow trout nucleus breeding populations: the USDA, ARS, National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture odd-year line (ARS-Fp-R), which has been subjected to five generations of selection for improved resistance to BCWD, and the Troutlodge, Inc., May-spawning odd-year line (TLUM), which has been selected for improved growth performance but not for disease resistance. A total of 46,805 and 27,821 pedigree records were available from both populations, respectively. Between 44 and 138 families per generation and population were evaluated under controlled BCWD and CD challenges, providing 32,311 and 17,861 phenotypic records for BCWD resistance, and 13,603 and 9,413 for CD resistance, in the ARS-Fp-R and TLUM populations, respectively. A two-trait animal threshold model assuming an underlying normal distribution for the binary survival phenotypes was used to estimate (co)variance components separately for each population. Resistance to BCWD (h 2 = 0.27 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.08) and CD (h 2 = 0.23 ± 0.07 and 0.34 ± 0.09) was moderately heritable in the ARS-Fp-R and TLUM populations, respectively. The genetic correlation between the resistance to BCWD and CD was favorably positive in the ARS-Fp-R (0.40 ± 0.17) and TLUM (0.39 ± 0.18) populations. These findings suggest that both disease resistance traits can be improved simultaneously even if genetic selection pressure is applied to only one of the two traits. © 2019 The Author(s).

VL  - 33

AB  - Pancreas transplant achieves consistent long-term euglycemia in type 1 diabetes. Allograft thrombosis (AT) causes the majority of early graft failure. We compared outcomes of four anticoagulation regimens administered to 95 simultaneous kidney-pancreas or isolated pancreas transplanted between 1/1/2015 and 11/20/2018. Early postoperative anticoagulation regimens included the following: none, subcutaneous heparin/aspirin, with or without dextran, and heparin infusion. The regimens were empirically selected based on each surgeon's assessment of hemostasis of the operative field and personal preference. A sonographic-based global scoring system of AT is presented. The 47-month recipients and graft survival were 95% and 86%, respectively. Recipients with or without AT had similar survival. Five and four grafts were lost due to death and AT, respectively. Outcomes of prophylaxis regimens correlated with intensity of anticoagulation. Compared with no anticoagulation, an increase in hemorrhagic complications occurred exclusively with iv heparin. The higher arterial AT score found in regimens lacking antiplatelet therapy highlights the importance of early antiaggregants therapy. Abnormal fibrinolysis was associated with an increase in AT score. Platelet dysfunction, warm ischemia time, and enteric drainage were predictive of AT and, along with other known risk factors, were incorporated into an algorithm that matches intensity of early postoperative anticoagulation to the thrombotic risk. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Optimal sensors placement in controlled environment agriculture using a reinforcement learning approach
AB  - Optimal placement of sensors in protected cultivation systems to maximize monitoring and control capabilities can guide effective decision-making toward achieving the highest productivity levels and other desirable outcomes. Unlike conventional machine learning methods such as supervised learning, Reinforcement learning does not require large, labeled datasets, thereby providing opportunities for more efficient and unbiased design optimization. A multi-arm bandit problem was formulated using the Beta distribution and solved by the Thompson sampling algorithm to determine the optimal locations of sensors in a protected cultivation system (greenhouse). A total of 56 two-in-one sensors designed to measure both internal air temperature and relative humidity were installed at a vertical distance of 1 m and a horizontal distance of 3m apart in a greenhouse used to cultivate strawberries. Data was collected over seven months covering four major seasons, February (winter), March, April, and May (spring), June and July (summer), and October (autumn), and analyzed separately. Results showed unique patterns for sensor selection for temperature and relative humidity during the other months. Furthermore, temperature and relative humidity each had different optimal location selections suggesting that two-in-one sensors might not be ideal in these cases. The use of reinforcement learning to design optimal sensor placement in this study aided in identifying 10 optimal sensor locations for monitoring and controlling temperature and relative humidity. © 2022 ASABE.

TI  - Does Heat Tolerance Explain Female Polymorphism in Damselflies?
VL  - 34
IS  - 1
SP  - 41-48
AB  - Morphological variation is widespread, and one case is that of female morphs in damselfly insects. Current knowledge indicates that these female morphs are maintained by a fitness balance whereby male-like, clear-colored females (i.e. andromorphs) are more likely to “escape” from male harassment given their male mimicking compared to dark females (i.e. gynomorph). However, males can learn to distinguish the more frequent morph, leading to a frequency-dependent selection. Alternative to frequency-dependent selection, we tested whether temperature plays a role in driving female morph activity and survival. We used Ischnura denticollis damselflies to test for differences between female morphs and males in: (a) daily activity; (b) time to resume activity following a chilling event (10°C); and, (c) survival at 30, 35 and 40°C. There was no difference in activity among groups after a chilling event. However, gynomorph females were more active early in the day (ca. 17°C) and less active by 1600 hrs (after reaching 32°C), and had lower thermal tolerance than andromorph females. Thus, high temperatures may act against gynomorph females. This implies a role for high temperatures in the maintenance of female polymorphism. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Hydrothermal regime variation and ecological effects on fish reproduction in the yangtze river
VL  - 18
IS  - 22
AB  - Water temperature, as one of the important water environment impact factors, has a sig-nificant impact on the survival and development of aquatic organisms. We selected water temperature data (1959–2017) from four key hydrological stations in the Yangtze River: Cuntan, Yichang, Hankou, and Datong. We analyzed the characteristics and variability of the Yangtze River hydrothermal regime by the Mann-Kendall method, wavelet analysis, and by the IHA-RVA method to analyze hydrothermal regime variations of the Yangtze River, and the response mechanisms of fish to variations in hydrothermal regimes were explored. The results show that (1) The annual average water temperature of the Yangtze River is warming, and Cuntan Station, Yichang Station, Hankou Station, and Datong Station have a sudden increase in temperature in 2002, 1995, 2003, and 2004, and the periodicity analysis demonstrates that Cuntan, Yichang, and Datong stations all have main periods of 24~32 years; (2) The overall variations of 32 hydrothermal indicators at Cuntan Station and Yichang Station reached 65% and 61%, which are close to the height variation; (3) With the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the stagnant cooling effect caused the arrival date of the upper reproduction water temperature of “The four major fish species” to be delayed by about 23 days, and the stagnant heat effect caused the arrival date of the Chinese sturgeon reproduction upper limit water temperature to be delayed by about 30 days. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Post-prandial changes in digestive enzymes and chyme characteristics of bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana)
VL  - 548
AB  - Bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana) is a candidate squid species that has potential to be utilized in aquaculture on a commercial scale. Although this species has been successfully cultured over multiple generations, appropriate feeding strategies are still limited due to a lack of understanding of its digestive physiology. The present study focused on digestive enzymes and chyme characteristics in terms of time response profiles following feeding. Squids (1.78 ± 0.05 g body weight) were serially collected at different post-prandial times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h) and the specimens were used in the analysis of digestive enzymes (n = 10) and chyme characteristics (n = 5). Food provided to the animals substantially transited to the gastrointestinal tract and peaked at 1 h after feeding, and then dramatically decreased with post-prandial time (P < 0.05). The digestion process was initiated shortly after the food arrived and exhibited the same pattern over 24 h of observation. The highest activities of protein-, carbohydrate- and lipid-digesting enzymes were observed within a range of 0.5 to 4 h after feeding and reached basal levels as observed in fasted squids post-prandially within 8 h. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a highly significant relationship between digestive enzyme activity and digestosomatic index across post-prandial times (r = 0.660–1.000, P < 0.01). These responses matched well with chyme characteristics, in terms of thermal properties of nutrients, microstructure, and molecular weight patterns of the relevant proteins. Findings from the current study have thus provided basic information on the digestive physiology of bigfin reef squids that can be applied when designing specimen-harvesting strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Life-stage related responses to combined effects of acclimation temperature and humidity on the thermal tolerance of Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)
VL  - 79
SP  - 85-94
AB  - Adaptive thermal plasticity plays a key role in mitigating the effects of seasonal and diurnal thermal fluctuations among ectotherms at various life-stages. While the role of thermal history in conferring such plasticity is widely documented, its interaction with relative humidity (RH), another important driver of ectotherm survival and activity, is relatively underexplored. Yet the potential responses to these combinational stressors across ontogeny remain largely neglected. Against this background, we used a full-factorial design to test the combined acclimation effects of RH (45%, 65% and 85%) and temperature (23, 28 and 33 degrees C) on various indices of thermal sensitivity of laboratory reared spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) following acclimation beginning at larval, pupal and adult life-stages. Traits measured included critical thermal limits (CTLs), supercooling points (SCPs), chill coma recovery time (CCRT) and heat knockdown time (HKDT). Larval acclimation at 23 degrees C; 85% RH recorded the lowest critical thermal minima (CTmin) whereas adult acclimation at 28 degrees C; 45% RH recorded the highest critical thermal maxima (CTmax. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in SCPs across all temperature x RH acclimations. Larval and pupal acclimations at 23 degrees C; 85% RH and adult acclimation at 23 degrees C; 45% RH significantly improved CCRT. Similarly, commencing acclimation at larval, pupal and adult stages at 28 degrees C; 85% RH improved HKDT whereas larval and pupal acclimations at 33 degrees C; 45% RH impaired it. Our results indicate that combinational interactions of temperature and RH have significant thermal fitness costs and benefits and are dependent on the life-stage acclimation timing. Results also imply that both the vulnerability and adaptive potential of C. partellus populations under rapid climate variability varies with ontogeny. This therefore calls for the consideration of the role of ontogeny and multi-factors in better understanding the impact of environmental stress on ectotherms.

TI  - Assessment and selection of M3 generation of wheat mutants adaptive in lowland
VL  - 157
AB  - Wheat is a sub-tropical plant which adaptability in the tropics in areas with altitudes over 1000 m above sea level (asl). Cultivation on the highlands is in competition with vegetables and fruits in terms of land use, therefore, it is essential to have wheat genotypes adaptive to the lowlands. This study aimed to test and select offspring of three adaptive mutant on lowland with high temperature ranged from 28 to 33°C. The benefit of the research is to obtain a potential strain of adaptive wheat mutants in the lowlands. The experiment was conducted at Experimental farm of Agriculture Faculty, Hasanuddin University Makassar at an altitude below 50 m from sea level. The study was conducted from March to June 2017. The experimental study applied a randomized block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of 20 mutants of wheat with 4 varieties used for comparison. They were Nias, Selayar, Dewata, and Munal. Results showed that the wheat mutant N.300 4.3.6 (1.92 t per hectare) gave highest growth and production and was significantly different from all other mutants and comparing varieties. The mutant genotypes that gave higher growth and production than all comparing varieties were N.350 3.1.4 (1.86 t per hectare), N.200 2.3.3 (1.67 t per hectare), N. 250 4.2.1 (1.48 t per hectare), N.200 2.4.B.6 (1.36 t per hectare), N.250 4.5.2 (1.26 t per hectare), N.350 3.2.2 (1.26 t per hectare), and N.350 3.1.3 (1.22 t per hectare). Mutants that produce higher yields than the three comparing varieties (Dewata, Selayar and Munal) with yields > 1 t per hectare, yet lower than Nias varieties (1.15 t per hectare) are N.200 2.5.2 (1.11 t per hectare), N.250 4.6.2 (1.14 t per hectare), and N.350 3.6.2 (1.07 t per hectare. In conclusion, there are 11 potential mutant genotypes for further experiment in order to develop adaptive wheat to lowlands. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 48

SP  - 991-1000
AB  - Aim: Polyploids have been theorized to occur more frequently in environments that are subjected to severe conditions or sudden disruptions. Here we test the expectation that polyploid taxa occur more frequently in extreme or disrupted environments than their diploid counterparts, whether due to increased adaptive potential, environmental resilience or cross-ploidy competition. Location: South America. Taxon: All frog genera in the area with both polyploid and diploid member species (Ceratophrys, Chiasmocleis, Odontophrynus, Phyllomedusa and Pleurodema). Methods: In all, 13,556 occurrence records of 82 frog species were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Species distribution models, range overlap estimates, statistical tests and principal component analyses were used to estimate and compare environments between diploid and polyploid species within and across genera using several categorical and quantitative variables taken from multiple publicly available sources. Results: Almost all polyploid occurrences are found within southeastern South America, largely to the exclusion of diploids. Polyploid species occur more closely with intergeneric polyploids than they do with congeneric diploids. Southeastern South America is more temperate, seasonal and less forested when compared to the tropical environments more commonly inhabited by diploids. The habitat ranges of polyploid species are subject to greater temperature fluctuations than diploid species. This region has also experienced major transformations in the modern era, owing to an agriculture boom over the last century. Polyploid occurrences are more likely to be found in areas with greater cropland usage, fertilizer application and pesticide application than diploids. Main Conclusions: Across species, temperature seasonality was the only variable with strong statistical differences between diploids and polyploids. Greater annual fluctuations in temperature may lead to more established polyploid species due to reasons mentioned above; however, extreme temperature differences are also known to contribute to polyploid gamete formation, providing a possible non-selective explanation. Polyploid occurrences are also more likely to be found in areas of high agricultural impact, providing support for the hypothesis that polyploids are more resilient to environmental disruptions than diploids. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Towards Heat Tolerant Runner Bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.) by Utilizing Plant Genetic Resources
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - Climate change and its extreme heat waves affect agricultural productivity worldwide. In the cultivation of beans, heat stress during the reproductive phase may lead to complete crop failures, as recently was documented for runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.) in Austria. Developing better adapted varieties utilizing plant genetic resources is of utmost importance in such conditions. Our study aimed at identifying heat tolerant accessions and developing associated genetic markers for their application in marker assisted selection. For this, we assessed the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of 113 runner bean genotypes (101 of Austrian origin) grown in the glasshouse under heat stress conditions during two years. In particular three accessions showed a higher yield than the reference variety Bonela under heat stress in both years. The phenotypic data complemented with genetic data based on 1190 SNPs revealed high performing pure genotypes that may serve as good candidates to be included in breeding programs. In addition, the genome-wide association analysis resulted in 18 high quality SNPs that were subsequently used for the calculation of an estimated heat tolerance using the MassARRAY® system. Overall, our study represents first steps towards breeding heat tolerant runner bean to withstand global warming. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Rising floor and dropping ceiling: organ heterogeneity in response to cold acclimation of the largest extant amphibian
VL  - 289
IS  - 1984
SP  - 20221394
AB  - Low temperature imposes strong selective pressure on ectotherms. To maximize their overall fitness under cold conditions, the ectotherms may either try to maintain their physiological activities through metabolic compensation or enter into metabolic depression; however, some species adopt both strategies to cope with different degrees of cold. Nevertheless, how these two seemingly opposite strategies are coordinated has rarely been elucidated. Here, we investigated the molecular strategy underlying the cold acclimation of Andrias davidianus, the largest extant amphibian, using multi-organ metabolomics and transcriptomics. The results showed remarkable organ heterogeneity in response to cold. While most organs showed transcriptional upregulation of metabolic processes, the heart exhibited downregulation. This heterogeneity explained the adaptive reorganization in resource allocation, which compensates for metabolic maintenance by compromising growth. Importantly, the cardiac function might constitute a 'ceiling' to constrain the space for compensation, especially under colder conditions. Additionally, the opposite transcriptional regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and other pathways might also shape the overall metabolic capacity under cold conditions. The heterogeneity in cold responses may have directed a shift in cold adaptive strategy from compensation to depression with a drop in temperature. These results provide a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms underlying cold survival strategies of ectotherms.

TI  - A Molecular View of Plant Local Adaptation: Incorporating Stress-Response Networks
VL  - 70
SP  - 559-583
AB  - Ecological specialization in plants occurs primarily through local adaptation to different environments. Local adaptation is widely thought to result in costly fitness trade-offs that result in maladaptation to alternative environments. However, recent studies suggest that such trade-offs are not universal. Further, there is currently a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for fitness trade-offs associated with adaptation. Here, we review the literature on stress responses in plants to identify potential mechanisms underlying local adaptation and ecological specialization. We focus on drought, high and low temperature, flooding, herbivore, and pathogen stresses. We then synthesize our findings with recent advances in the local adaptation and plant molecular biology literature. In the process, we identify mechanisms that could cause fitness trade-offs and outline scenarios where trade-offs are not a necessary consequence of adaptation. Future studies should aim to explicitly integrate molecular mechanisms into studies of local adaptation. © 2019 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multigenerational exposure to warming and fishing causes recruitment collapse, but size diversity and periodic cooling can aid recovery
VL  - 118
IS  - 18
AB  - Global warming and fisheries harvest are significantly impacting wild fish stocks, yet their interactive influence on population resilience to stress remains unclear. We explored these interactive effects on early-life development and survival by experimentally manipulating the thermal and harvest regimes in 18 zebrafish (Danio rerio) populations over six consecutive generations. Warming advanced development rates across generations, but after three generations, it caused a sudden and large (30-50%) decline in recruitment. This warming impact was most severe in populations where size-selective harvesting reduced the average size of spawners. We then explored whether our observed recruitment decline could be explained by changes in egg size, early egg and larval survival, population sex ratio, and developmental costs. We found that it was most likely driven by temperature-induced shifts in embryonic development rate and fishing-induced male-biased sex ratios. Importantly, once harvest and warming were relaxed, recruitment rates rapidly recovered. Our study suggests that the effects of warming and fishing could have strong impacts on wild stock recruitment, but this may take several generations to manifest. However, resilience of wild populations may be higher if fishing preserves sufficient body size diversity, and windows of suitable temperature periodically occur. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Research Status of Single Atom Catalyst in Hydrogen Production by Photocatalytic Water Splitting
VL  - 45
IS  - 5
SP  - 551-568
AB  - The emission of carbon dioxide caused by the depletion of fossil fuel source led to global warming and affected the survival and development of human beings. Photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution was a potential means of achieving converting the solar energy into hydrogen energy and had obtained promising practical applications in hydrogen powered vehicles, it was considered as an effective method of solving the problems of energy shortage and global warming. Human beings' ability to convert the solar energy into hydrogen energy would influence the industrial development, which were significantly depended on the catalytic activity of catalysts. As for the photocatalytic activity of hydrogen production mainly depended on several aspects: the spectral response range of the catalyst, the number of active sites and the kinetic process of photo-generated carriers. As a type of emerging photocatalyst, single-atom catalysts (SACs), defined as a dispersed metal anchored on the supports, had attracted aroused extensive attention in the field of catalysis over the past few years due to atomically dispersed active sites and the usage of precious metal with a 100% atomic utilization efficiency. Moreover, the unique geometric structure and electronic properties of single-atom centers by metal/support interactions on catalytic could effectively improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of each active site. In the area of the photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution, SACs could also develop its unique advantages, such as providing ideas and methods for further optimizing the activity of photocatalysis materials for photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution. In recent years, a great deal of researches about single-atom photocatalysts had been done. Our understanding of SACs had deepened by advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations. However, there were still some problems in the development of SACs. For example, surface energy of isolated metal atoms increased dramatically with the metal nanoparticles turn into single atom. And it made single atoms tend to agglomerate during reactivation and under reaction procedures, and thus induced low catalytic activity. To solve the problem, various strategies for their chemical synthesis have been developed by improving the distribution and chemical bonding of active sites on supports. In this review, we introduced several strategies for preparing single atoms and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each method, for instance: defect design strategy, ligand design, space confinement strategy, atomic layer deposition, etc. And it was still a huge challenge to develop a useful method to fabricate SACs with high activity, good stability and maximized metal atom efficiency. For photocatalysts with the introducing of single atoms, the physicochemical property and internal electronic structure of the substrate material, which would change the absorption activity of reactants on metal atoms and improve the activity of SACs for water splitting for hydrogen evolution. Therefore, it was very important to precisely design and modulate the coordination number and local atomic structure of the active center of SACs. In this review, we summarized the synthesis strategies and the practical application strategies of SACs in the area of photocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen evolution. Besides, we mainly discussed the changes of intrinsic properties of catalysts by the introduction of single atoms from the aspects of the spectral response range, the kinetics of charge transfer, and the coordination environment of the active site. Moreover, the controllable surface structures of SACs were conducive to enhancing the absorption and activation capability toward water molecules. And the unsaturated coordination sites and unique electronic structures of SACs could modify adsorption mode and strength of the water molecules and H* intermediates, facilitating hydrogen production. Therefore, the structure-activity relationship of photocatalysts and the possible catalytic mechanism were discussed with some remarkable cases of SACs. However, the development of SACs was still faced with severe limitations. Over the past few years, the explanation of the possible photocatalytic mechanisms of SACs for water splitting for hydrogen evolution was mainly depends on theoretical simulation calculations due to the limitations of characterization techniques. It was impossible to directly monitor the dynamic changes of single-atom during the process of catalytic reaction. So, the internal mechanism and the true active site of SACs for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution had not been thoroughly explored. Therefore, we summarized in this review with a look into the remaining challenges and future perspectives of SACs based on experiments and literature. Some possible solutions were proposed, for example, it was necessary to combine in-situ electron microscopy and in-situ synchrotron radiation technique to monitor the changes in the coordination environment and valence state of single atoms in the catalytic reaction. The action of active sites could help to understand deeply the photocatalytic mechanisms in reaction process. So, it was possible to combine with theoretical calculations to reveal the relationship between the structure and catalytic activity of SACs. Finally, we hoped that this review could provide some inspiration for preparing SACs and promoting the development of photocatalytic water splitting. © Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

TI  - Effect of Thermal Management Approaches on Geometry and Productivity of Thin-Walled Structures of ER 5356 Built by Wire plus Arc Additive Manufacturing
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
AB  - The present paper aimed at assessing the effect of two thermal management approaches on geometry and productivity of thin-walled structures built by Wire + Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM). Thin-walls of ER 5356 (Al5Mg) with different lengths and the same number of layers were deposited via the gas metal arc (GMA) process with the aid of an active cooling technique (near-immersion active cooling—NIAC) under a fixed set of deposition parameters. Then, the same experiment was performed with natural cooling (NC) in air. To characterize the thermal management approaches, the interpass temperature (i.e., the temperature at which subsequent layers are deposited) were monitored by a trailing/leading infrared pyrometer during the deposition time. Finally, thin walls with a fixed length were deposited using the NC and NIAC approaches with equivalent interpass temperatures. As expected, the shorter the wall length the more intense the deposition concentration, heat accumulation, and, thus, geometric deviation. This behavior was more evident and premature for the NC strategy due to its lower heat sinking effectiveness. The main finding was that, regardless of the thermal management technique applied, if the same interpass temperature is selected and maintained, the geometry of the part being built tends to be stable and very similar. However, the total deposition time is somewhat shorter with the NIAC technique due its greater heat sinking advantage. Thus, the NIAC technique facilitates the non-stop manufacturing of small parts and details via WAAM. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism scan suggests adaptation to urbanization in an important pollinator, the red-tailed bumblebee (Bombus lapidarius L.)
VL  - 285
IS  - 1877
AB  - Urbanization is considered a global threat to biodiversity; the growth of cities results in an increase in impervious surfaces, soil and air pollution, fragmentation of natural vegetation and invasion of non-native species, along with numerous environmental changes, including the heat island phenomenon. The combination of these effects constitutes a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using 110 314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the genomewide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator, Bombus lapidarius, collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall, genetic differentiation among siteswas lowand therewas no obvious genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly mobile insect pollinator. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 89-99
AB  - The number of new cases of melanoma is increasing every year. Due to its specific-ity of treatment, plasma medicine has been claimed to be a novel adjunctive procedure. We evalu-ated the effects of a direct low-temperature plasma (LTP) device for selective tumor eradication, comparing between melanoma and normal keratinocyte cell lines. Human melanoma (G-361) and normal keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell lines were subjected to LTP treatment. Different powerlevels and exposure durations of LTP were compared in both groups. After the treatment, a MTT assay was used to determine cell viability. The physical plasma characteristics of the three powers were also evaluated. It was found that low power (intensity 1 with frequency 10 Hz) was 0.25 watts, while medium power (intensity 5 with frequency 50 Hz) and high power (intensity 10, with frequency 100 Hz) were 0.94 and 3.0 watts, respectively. Higher powers and longer durations of LTP treatment increased the incidence of cell death in both the HaCaT and G-361 cell lines. LTP eliminated slightly more G-361 than HaCaT cells at 10 and 30 seconds of exposure. At 60 seconds or more, LTP showed a decrease of more than 50% in both the HaCaT and G-361 survival. Medium LTP power with 10-second exposure demonstrated a statistically significant differencebetween HaCaT and G-361 viabilities (77.1% and 66.3%, respectively; P = 0.01). LTP treatment at medium power (intensity 5 with frequency 50 Hz, equal to 0.94 watts) at 10-second duration showed a specificity for cancer eradication. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.

TI  - Viability of public spaces in cities under increasing heat: A transdisciplinary approach
VL  - 59
AB  - Cities are particularly sensitive to the effects of climate change, causing an increasing incidence of heat waves. Extreme temperatures can impair the use of public spaces in cities, as heat stress endangers human well-being and health. Identifying suitable adaptation measures to maintain the full functionality of public spaces requires a multidimensional approach, accounting for interrelated scientific, social, and practical aspects. As one result we introduce an inter- and transdisciplinary concept that addresses the challenge of adapting public spaces to climate change. Additionally we present a pilot study from Heidelberg, Germany, where a new, sustainable urban quarter experienced more pronounced heat stress than the historic city centre in the hot and dry summer of 2018. The study shows the suitability of our approach to identify appropriate heat adaptation measures. Solar potential modelling and mental map surveys proved to be particularly effective methods. We find that adaptation measures generate synergy effects by improving both climatic and social conditions. © 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Cold tolerance and performance of selected Nile tilapia for suboptimal temperatures
VL  - 52
IS  - 3
SP  - 1071-1077
AB  - This study evaluated the performance and cold tolerance of different Nile tilapia stocks, selected at suboptimal temperature and identified alleles of microsatellite markers associated with cold tolerance. After 67 days of rearing at average temperature of 22.4 degrees C, tilapia juveniles from different stocks were evaluated, tagged with a transponder and acclimated to 16 degrees C. Subsequently, the temperature was reduced 1 degrees C per day until 11 degrees C and from that temperature decreases of 0.5 degrees C per day were made until total mortality. A caudal fin sample was collected, and their genetic profile was characterized through the microsatellite markers UNH879, UNH916 and UNH999. Tilapias of stocks S3, S6 and S7 showed higher growth at suboptimal temperatures, 42 to 47% higher than base population. In the cold tolerance assay, tilapias from stocks S5 and S7 showed lower mean death temperature. Through molecular analysis, it is stated that allele 186 bp of UNH879 and 147 bp of UNH916 were more frequently found in animals cold-tolerant. Artificial selection for final weight during winter in southern Brazil can assist in the selection of tilapias improved to rearing in suboptimal temperatures. Finally, using microsatellite markers, it is possible to direct selective breeding to obtain tilapias more adapted to low temperatures.

TI  - Cocoa agroforestry is less resilient to sub-optimal and extreme climate than cocoa in full sun
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 273-286
AB  - Cocoa agroforestry is perceived as potential adaptation strategy to sub-optimal or adverse environmental conditions such as drought. We tested this strategy over wet, dry and extremely dry periods comparing cocoa in full sun with agroforestry systems: shaded by (i) a leguminous tree species, Albizia ferruginea and (ii) Antiaris toxicaria, the most common shade tree species in the region. We monitored micro-climate, sap flux density, throughfall, and soil water content from November 2014 to March 2016 at the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana with climate and drought events during the study period serving as proxy for projected future climatic conditions in marginal cocoa cultivation areas of West Africa. Combined transpiration of cocoa and shade trees was significantly higher than cocoa in full sun during wet and dry periods. During wet period, transpiration rate of cocoa plants shaded by A. ferruginea was significantly lower than cocoa under A. toxicaria and full sun. During the extreme drought of 2015/16, all cocoa plants under A. ferruginea died. Cocoa plants under A. toxicaria suffered 77% mortality and massive stress with significantly reduced sap flux density of 115 g cm−2 day−1, whereas cocoa in full sun maintained higher sap flux density of 170 g cm−2 day−1. Moreover, cocoa sap flux recovery after the extreme drought was significantly higher in full sun (163 g cm−2 day−1) than under A. toxicaria (37 g cm−2 day−1). Soil water content in full sun was higher than in shaded systems suggesting that cocoa mortality in the shaded systems was linked to strong competition for soil water. The present results have major implications for cocoa cultivation under climate change. Promoting shade cocoa agroforestry as drought resilient system especially under climate change needs to be carefully reconsidered as shade tree species such as the recommended leguminous A. ferruginea constitute major risk to cocoa functioning under extended severe drought. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Coastal water quality impact on community structure and genotoxicity of marine zooplankton
VL  - 39
AB  - The present study emphasizes the possible impact of coastal water quality on marine zooplankton community from six different sampling sites of south India (Kalpakkam, Nemmeli, Muttukadu, Kasimedu, Ennore and Kattupalli). Water Samples were collected in the sampling sites and physicochemical parameters were studied. The results showed significant variations in the concentration and distribution pattern of selected physicochemical parameters (temperatures, pH, salinity, DO, NO-3, NO-2, NH3, PO43- and SiO2) and heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, Mg, Co, and Cr). The concentration of nutrients and trace elements were reported high at site IV (Kasimedu) and low at site II (Nemmeli). Further, diversity indices showed maximum Shannon_H and Simpson_1-D indexes (H = 3.492; D = 0.966) at site IV (Kasimedu). Similarly, low diversity indices (H = 3.128; D = 0.9508) was registered at site II (Nemmeli) and site III (Muttukadu), indicating plankton population was attracted by high concentration of nutrients loads in the study areas. Finally, genotoxicity (genomic integrity) was assessed by DNA fragmentation and alkaline comet assay, which resulted in maximum genomic integrity loss for the sample collected from Kalpakkam (42.84 +/- 08.38), Ennore (41.44 +/- 06.59), and Kasimedu (39.5 +/- 09.68) sites. The results revealed that the maximum heavy metal concentration has impact on the zooplankton population as evidence from DNA fragmentation compared with that of freshly hatched out Artemia nauplii as control. Hence, the present investigation documents the alarming threat in coastal water quality which will have an impact on the zooplankton community in selected coastal zones.

TI  - How repeatable is CTmax within individual brook trout over short- and long-time intervals?
VL  - 89
AB  - As stream temperatures increase due to factors such as heated runoff from impervious surfaces, deforestation, and climate change, fish species adapted to cold water streams are forced to move to more suitable habitat, acclimate or adapt to increased thermal regimes, or die. To estimate the potential for adaptation, a (within individual) repeatable metric of thermal tolerance is imperative. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) is a dynamic test that is widely used to measure thermal tolerance across many taxa and has been used in fishes for decades, but its repeatability in most species is unknown. CTmax tests increase water temperature steadily over time until loss of equilibrium (LOE) is achieved. To determine if CTmax is a consistent metric within individual fish, we measured CTmax on the same lab-held individually-marked adult brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis at three different times (August &amp; September 2016, September 2017). We found that CTmax is a repeatable trait (Repeatability ± S.E.: 0.48 ± 0.14). CTmax of individuals males was consistent over time, but the CTmax of females increased slightly over time. This result indicates that CTmax is a robust, repeatable estimate of thermal tolerance in a cold-water adapted fish. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Experimental and numerical study for direct powder bed selective laser processing (sintering/melting) of silicon carbide ceramic
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - The study was carried out to investigate the manufacturing possibility of Silicon Carbide (SiC) by direct Powder Bed Selective Laser Processing (PBSLP) experimentally and numerically. The experimental study was carried out by means of PBSLP while the numerical study was accomplished by developing a CFD model. The CFD model simulates accurately realistic conditions of the PBSLP process. A user-defined code, that describes the process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, scanning strategies, and hatching distance has been developed and compiled to ANSYS FLUENT 2020 R1. Also, the model was validated with the available published data from the literature. The model was used to deeply analyse and support the results obtained through the experimental runs. Different values of laser power and scanning speeds with scanning strategy in the form of a continuous linear pattern and rotated by 90 degrees between layers were studied. The laser power is ranging from 52W to 235 W while the scanning speed is ranging from 300 to 3900 mm s−1. The results showed that the direct PBSLP of SiC is possible with the optimization of the process parameters. Layer thickness and hatching distance are the most important parameters that needed to be optimized. Also, the laser power and scanning speed needed to be adjusted so that the scanning temperature was between the sintering and the decomposition limits. The good agreement between experimental and simulation results proved the power and ability of the developed CFD model to be a useful tool to analyse and optimize future experimental data. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Thermal tolerance of cyprinids along an urban-rural gradient: Plasticity, repeatability and effects of swimming and temperature shock
VL  - 100
AB  - Urbanization changes the thermal profile of streams in much the same way that climate change is predicted to with higher temperatures, more varied flow and rapid temperature pulses with precipitation events. Whether exceptional tolerance to these altered thermal conditions is a pre-requisite for a fish species to inhabit urban streams or if urbanization has changed the thermal physiology of those fish species that persist in urban streams is unknown, but could help predict the outcome of future climate disruption. To test whether residence in urban streams is associated with altered thermal tolerance, we compared thermal tolerance (CTMax) and phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance (ΔCTMax/Δ acclimation temperature) in five populations of an urban-tolerant cyprinid, the blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus), from multiple watersheds along an urban/rural gradient. Thermal tolerance of these stream fish was tested while swimming at 10 cm*s−1 but also in static water and after thermal shocks of 4°–6 °C simulating precipitation events. To test whether blacknose dace as a species has unusual thermal tolerance or thermal plasticity, we also compared two blacknose dace populations with two co-resident, co-familiars (creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) and rosyside dace (Clinostomus funduloides), that don't persist in urban streams at three different acclimation temperatures. Thermal tolerance of blacknose dace, as measured by a critical thermal maximum test (CTMax), was independent of size and activity level, i.e. individuals had identical thermal tolerance whether swimming or resting and CTMax was significantly repeatable across two levels of activity. Although there was some variance among populations, blacknose dace from streams of varied urbanization generally exhibited comparable thermal tolerances, ability to acclimate to different temperatures and were unaffected by thermal shocks. Rosyside dace had significantly lower thermal tolerance than the other two species but plasticity of thermal tolerance was uniform across the three cyprinid species. Our conclusions are that exceptional thermal tolerance or ability to thermally acclimate are not pre-requisite characters for a given cyprinid species to survive in urban streams, nor has thermal tolerance undergone directional selection in this urban environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Synthesis of Biodiesel from Waste Cooking Oil by Alkali Doped Calcinated Waste Egg Shell Powder Catalyst and Optimization of Process Parameters to Improve Biodiesel Conversion
VL  - 2020
AB  - Our present work concentrates on the preparation of low-cost heterogeneous catalyst from egg shell, for the waste cooking oil biodiesel production, optimization and evaluation of its impact on a compressed ignition engine. The egg shell catalyst was prepared by calcination at the temperature range of 300-900°Cand categorized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The transesterification process was catalysed by calcinated egg shell catalyst and the biodiesel yield percentage was optimized by varying the parameters such as reaction temperature, time, catalyst weight, and methanol to oil molar ratio. The L9 orthogonal array was selected for the Taguchi optimization. Among the selected parameters temperature and methanol to oil ratio were found to be maximum influencing parameters. The maximum biodiesel yield% was 94.3 and this was obtained at the temperature of 60 °C, 6wt% catalyst weight%, 4 hr time and 12:1 methanol to oil ratio levels. The egg shell catalyst calcinated at 900°C has shown good regeneration capacity. The biodiesel % yield was 76% even after the five transesterification cycles. This is additional advantage of the egg shell heterogeneous catalyst from the commercialization point of view. Five different test fuels were prepared and used to operate the diesel engine namely WCOB20 (Waste Cooking oil biodiesel blend 20), WCOB30, WCOB40, WCOB50 and WCOB 100. The blend WCOB20 has resulted in better brake thermal efficiency and fuel consumption than the other test fuels. © 2020 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - The Macroecology of Chemical Communication in Lizards: Do Climatic Factors Drive the Evolution of Signalling Glands?
VL  - 45
IS  - 3
SP  - 259-267
AB  - Chemical communication plays a pivotal role in shaping sexual and ecological interactions among animals. In lizards, fundamental mechanisms of sexual selection such as female mate choice have rarely been shown to be influenced by quantitative phenotypic traits (e.g., ornaments), while chemical signals have been found to potentially influence multiple forms of sexual and social interactions, including mate choice and territoriality. Chemical signals in lizards are secreted by glands primarily located on the edge of the cloacae (precloacal glands, PG) and thighs (femoral glands), and whose interspecific and interclade number ranges from 0 to > 100. However, elucidating the factors underlying the evolution of such remarkable variation remains an elusive endeavour. Competing hypotheses suggest a dominant role for phylogenetic conservatism (i.e., species within clades share similar numbers of glands) or for natural selection (i.e., their adaptive diversification results in deviating numbers of glands from ancestors). Using the prolific Liolaemus lizard radiation from South America (where PG vary from 0 to 14), we present one of the largest-scale tests of both hypotheses to date. Based on climatic and phylogenetic modelling, we show a clear role for both phylogenetic inertia and adaptation underlying gland variation: (i) solar radiation, net primary productivity, topographic heterogeneity and precipitation range have a significant effect on PG variation, (ii) humid and cold environments tend to concentrate species with a higher number of glands, (iii) there is a strong phylogenetic signal that tends to conserve the number of PG within clades. Collectively, our study confirms that the inertia of niche conservatism can be broken down by the need of species facing different selection regimes to adjust their glands to suit the demands of their specific environments. © 2018, The Author(s).

VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - This study aimed to assess the acute and delayed cytotoxicity of three, popular light-cured methacrylate-based restorative resins (MRs): Charisma (C), Estelite (E), and Filtek (F), to human gingival fibroblasts in culture. Cells were grown for up to 24 h with light-cured (or pre-cured) resins. We evaluated resin cytotoxicity, redox imbalance, necrosis/apoptosis, miR-9, and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). The role of resin-induced oxidative stress (damage) in HSP70-response (repair) was assessed using binary fluorescence labeling. All MRs decreased viable cell numbers and cell proliferation and damaged cell membranes, and their 24 h-delayed toxicity was lower (C), higher (F), or similar (E) to that induced by freshly-cured resins. Cell membrane damage induced by C and E decreased with time, while F produced a linear increase. All resins generated intracellular oxidative stress with the predominant necrotic outcome, and produced heterogeneous responses in miR-9 and HSP70. The double fluorescence (damage/repair) experiments pointed to common features of E and F but not C. In the subset of cells, the binary response induced by E and F was different from C, similar to each other, and positively interrelated. Experimental data show that selective MR cytotoxicity should be taken into account when considering repetitive use or massive reconstruction. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 75

AB  - Parental care is predicted to evolve to mitigate harsh environments, thus adaptive plasticity of care may be an important response to our climate crisis. In biparental species, fitness costs may be reduced by resolving conflict and enhancing cooperation among partners. We investigated this prediction with the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, by exposing them to contrasting benign and harsh thermal environments. Despite measurable fitness costs under the harsh environment, sexual conflict persisted in the form of sex-specific social plasticity. That is, females provided equivalent care with or without males, whereas males with partners deserted earlier and reduced provisioning effort. The interaction of social condition and thermal environment did not explain variation in individual behavior, failing to support a temperature-mediated shift from conflict to cooperation. Examining selection gradients and splines on cumulative care revealed a likely explanation for these patterns. Contrary to predictions, increased care did not enhance offspring performance under stress. Rather, different components of care were under different selection regimes, with optimization constrained due to lack of coordination between parents. We suggest that the potential for parenting to ameliorate the effects of our climate crisis may depend on the sex-specific evolutionary drivers of parental care, and that this may be best reflected in components of care. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 11
IS  - 17
SP  - 12064-12074
AB  - Rapidly changing environments may weaken sexual selection and lead to indiscriminate mating by interfering with the reception of mating signals or by increasing the costs associated with mate choice. If temperature alters sexual selection, it may impact population response and adaptation to climate change. Here, we examine how differences in temperature of the mating environment influence reproductive investment in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis). Mate preference in this species is known to be related to pheromone usage, with assortative mating occurring between genetically distinct E and Z strains that differ in the composition of female and male pheromones. We compared egg production within and between corn borer lines derived from four different populations that vary in pheromone composition and other traits. Pairs of adults were placed in a mating environment that matched the pupal environment (ambient temperature) or at elevated temperature (5°C above the pupal environment). At ambient temperature, we found that within-line pairs produced eggs sooner and produced more egg clusters than between-line pairs. However, at elevated temperature, between-line pairs produced the same number of egg clusters as within-line pairs. These results suggest that elevated temperature increased investment in matings with typically less preferred, between-line mates. This increased investment could result in changes in gene flow among corn borer populations in warming environments. © 2021 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

SP  - 397-400
AB  - Evaluating the high-temperature creep behaviour of the Al alloys used in the automotive industries has attracted a great deal of attention from researchers over the last decade. However, very little investigation into the high-temperature tertiary creep of Al alloys has been published to date. In this study, in-situ neutron diffraction analysis was employed in order to evaluate the tertiary creep behaviour of A206 aluminum alloy under tensile load at 225 °C. The selected pressure and temperature was chosen to simulate actual in-service condition experienced by the automotive powertrain components; e.g. cylinder block and engine head. The results of the in-situ neutron diffraction revealed the tertiary creep behaviour of the selected {111} planes in A206 via monitoring the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak and creep strain (%). This technique is first of a kind, which provides a method to observe damage accumulation during tertiary creep prior to actual observed material failure (fracture) in the A206 alloy at high temperature. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2018.

TI  - Influence of seasonal variation on phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) hybrids
VL  - 295
AB  - This study presents an assessment of seasonal variation of biochemical traits for twenty one eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) hybrids. Data of five traits, ascorbic acid, total sugar, total anthocyanin, total phenolics content and total antioxidant capacity were recorded in kharif (August 2017– February 2018) and summer (February 2018 – June 2018) season and analyzed using univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (PCA) analysis. Seasonal variations influenced expression of all traits, but the ranking of hybrids for total phenolics and anthocyanin content was very consistent between seasons. The highest phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity was observed during summer months, when monthly average temperature was highest of the year. Total antioxidant capacity of the hybrids varied from 3.42 to 9.77 μ mol trolox equivalent/g in summer season, which is a 2.9 fold difference and total phenolic contents ranging from 18.63 to 40.38 mg/100 g, a 2.2 fold difference. Overall results indicate that in future breeding program of H8 (Muktakeshi × Swarna Mani), all the five traits are important for primary selection under high temperature stress. H16 (BRBL-02 × BRBL-04) has potential for improvement of traits like, total phenolics content and total antioxidant capacity under high and low temperature conditions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of sinter feed are important factors that determine the productivity and quality of sinter product. In this study the feasibility of treating sinter feed by high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) is investigated for selective cracks generation exploiting weak zones along grain boundaries of poor quality iron ores without generating much fines. The pre-treated sinter feed was characterized for size distribution, surface area, contact angle, and SEM analyses. The characterization results indicated that surface area of the pre-treated sinter feed sample increased about 20%. Pot-grate sintering tests results also indicated improvement on cold permeability, sintering yield and productivity, sinter Tumbler index, and low temperature degradation index (LTD) after HPGR pre-treatment. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society 2018.

AB  - Biofilm formation is an important process for marine bacterial communities because this mechanism favors adaptation to variations in environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the biofilm formation of bacteria isolated from marine sediments under in vitro conditions. For this, biofilm quantification assays were performed using two methods, violet crystal and reduction of the XTT dye; In addition, the viability of the bacteria was evaluated by Live / Dead staining. Subsequently, the strains evaluated were identified using the 16S RNA marker. The results showed that the isolates belong to the genus Bacillus, all in different ranges were able to form films and strains B. safensis 64181 and Bacillus sp 64186 were selected which indicated greater production of this. Tests at different temperatures showed that for the strains selected the best temperature was 28°C. In addition, a mixed culture was carried out with these isolates, resulting in differences in the density of the biofilm and less changes in its metabolic activity in temperature variation experiments. From the results we can infer that bacterial consortiums can favor resistance to environmental variations in biofilms formed by bacteria of the genus Bacillus. © 2019 INVEMAR. All rights reserved.

TI  - Progress in extreme heat management and warning systems: A systematic review of heat-health action plans (1995-2020)
VL  - 76
AB  - In recent decades, rising trend in the number of heat waves (HWs) has exacerbated the risk of heat-related mortality and morbidity. The frequent deadly HWs precipitated a multitude of national and sub-national heat-health prevention and research efforts. In 2008, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed and published guidance on heat-health action plans (HHAPs). This provided a blueprint for countries to design heat-related prevention efforts. Since then, a large corpus of new evidences and implementation experiences has emerged around adaptive measures, alert systems and urban planning interventions. The present study conducts a systematic review to critically assess the advent and development of HHAPs with a special focus on its integration with urban planning policies. It reviews the concept of threshold, indicators for heat event determination and measurement of HWs to understand trigger setting mechanisms. The results show that implementation of core elements of HHAPs varies significantly in the areas of long-term urban planning, real-time surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. Moreover, low levels of inclusion of HHAPs with national policies hinder the overall potential of adaptation measures. The growing impacts of HWs emphasize the urgent need to address spatial heat vulnerability and build urban heat resilience into implementable action plans. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Thermal adaptation rather than demographic history drives genetic structure inferred by copy number variants in a marine fish
VL  - 30
IS  - 7
SP  - 1624-1641
AB  - Increasing evidence shows that structural variants represent an overlooked aspect of genetic variation with consequential evolutionary roles. Among those, copy number variants (CNVs), including duplicated genomic regions and transposable elements (TEs), may contribute to local adaptation and/or reproductive isolation among divergent populations. Those mechanisms suppose that CNVs could be used to infer neutral and/or adaptive population genetic structure, whose study has been restricted to microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA and Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in the past and more recently the use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Taking advantage of recent developments allowing CNV analysis from RAD-seq data, we investigated how variation in fitness-related traits, local environmental conditions and demographic history are associated with CNVs, and how subsequent copy number variation drives population genetic structure in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We collected 1538 DNA samples from 35 sampling sites in the north Atlantic Ocean and identified 6620 putative CNVs. We found associations between CNVs and the gonadosomatic index, suggesting that six duplicated regions could affect female fitness by modulating oocyte production. We also detected 105 CNV candidates associated with water temperature, among which 20% corresponded to genomic regions located within the sequence of protein-coding genes, suggesting local adaptation to cold water by means of gene sequence amplification. We also identified 175 CNVs associated with the divergence of three previously defined parapatric glacial lineages, of which 24% were located within protein-coding genes, making those loci potential candidates for reproductive isolation. Lastly, our analyses unveiled a hierarchical, complex CNV population structure determined by temperature and local geography, which was in stark contrast to that inferred based on SNPs in a previous study. Our findings underline the complementarity of those two types of genomic variation in population genomics studies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Trans-generational effects on diapause and life-history-traits of an aphid parasitoid
VL  - 121
AB  - Transgenerational effects act on a wide range of insects’ life-history traits and can be involved in the control of developmental plasticity, such as diapause expression. Decrease in or total loss of winter diapause expression recently observed in some species could arise from inhibiting maternal effects. In this study, we explored transgenerational effects on diapause expression and traits in one commercial and one Canadian field strain of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. These strains were reared under short photoperiod (8:16 h LD) and low temperature (14 °C) conditions over two generations. Diapause levels, developmental times, physiological and morphological traits were measured. Diapause levels increased after one generation in the Canadian field but not in the commercial strain. For both strains, the second generation took longer to develop than the first one. Tibia length and wing surface decreased over generations while fat content increased. A crossed-generations experiment focusing on the industrial parasitoid strain showed that offspring from mothers reared at 14 °C took longer to develop, were heavier, taller with wider wings and with more fat reserves than those from mothers reared at 20 °C (8:16 h LD). No effect of the mother rearing conditions was shown on diapause expression. Additionally to direct plasticity of the offspring, results suggest transgenerational plasticity effects on diapause expression, development time, and on the values of life-history traits. We demonstrated that populations showing low diapause levels may recover higher levels through transgenerational plasticity in response to diapause-induction cues, provided that environmental conditions are reaching the induction-thresholds specific to each population. Transgenerational plasticity is thus important to consider when evaluating how insects adapt to changing environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Potentials for Adapting Danish Sustainable Houses to Climate Change: Simulation Study on the Effects of Climate Change in Low-Rise Sustainable Houses
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
AB  - Climate change is a threat. Houses we inhabit should conform to changes in the environment. The housing sector is vulnerable to climate changes, since the inhabitants are more exposed than in commercial buildings. Studies find modern sustainable buildings are at risk from thermal changes due to lower resilience from a focus on energy savings. Through simulation studies of three sustainable houses in Denmark, their viability to climate change is tested. Four thermal adaptation strategies were simulated: defensive, reactive, embedded, and air conditioning. The operative temperature and energy use for heating is registered for occupancy rooms in the buildings. The simulations show a tendency that adaptation through passive means use the same or up to 5% less energy as the unmodified buildings in the simulations but are unable to uphold thermal comfort, where active technologies use 25%-260% more energy than the baseline in 2080. Reactive strategies provided best thermal comfort in most rooms and scenarios, balancing energy and thermal environment. Air conditioning removed most thermal discomfort but increased the energy use with 45%-260% by 2080. The recommendation would be to enable upscaling of mechanical ventilation by a factor of two over the minimum regulation of 0.3 l/s/m2 with the ability to bypass heat recovery, aided by passive solutions such as strategic planting of deciduous trees and solar shading to reduce energy use further. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Highly selective synthesis of methanol from methane over carbon materials supported Pd-Au nanoparticles under mild conditions
VL  - 352
SP  - 104-110
AB  - As one of the Holy Grail reactions in C1 chemistry, direct selective oxidation of methane to methanol under mild and non-harsh conditions remains a big challenge. Hydroperoxide (H2O2), as a primary oxidant, applied widely in the low-temperature direct selective conversion of methane to methanol. Moreover, the hydrogen and oxygen mixture gas achieves better reaction activity and higher methanol selectivity than H2O2 when using palladium-gold (Pd-Au) bimetallic nanoparticles as the catalyst. In this paper, we studied the key roles of the physical and chemical characteristics of Pd-Au nanoparticles in this direct selective oxidation reaction with hydrogen and oxygen as the oxidant at 50 °C. Au metal shows an indispensable role in direct methane to methanol process in this study. High methanol productivity and selectivity are achieved when Au of 0.5–2.5% is added into the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported Pd catalyst. Moreover, the loading amount of Pd-Au nanoparticles also affect the methane activation ability and the methanol selectivity obviously. Much more active and stable Pd-Au nanoparticles are generated in CNTs supported 2.5% Pd-2.5% Au nanoparticles catalyst than those in lower metal content catalysts. In addition, the Pd bivalent state is proved to be the most active content in the Pd-Au nanoparticles catalyst, achieving much higher methanol selectivity and productivity when compared to Pd metallic state. For further clarifying the physical and chemical characteristics of catalysts, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Hydrogen-Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and CO pulse adsorption measurement (CO-PULSE) analysis methods are also measured. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 128

SP  - 271-278
AB  - Species distributed across climatic gradients will typically experience spatial variation in selection, but gene flow can prevent such selection from causing population genetic differentiation and local adaptation. Here, we studied genomic variation of 415 individuals across 34 populations of the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) in central Italy. This species is highly abundant throughout this region and populations belong to a single genetic lineage, yet there is extensive phenotypic variation across climatic regimes. We used redundancy analysis to, first, quantify the effect of climate and geography on population genomic variation in this region and, second, to test if climate consistently sorts specific alleles across the landscape. Climate explained 5% of the population genomic variation across the landscape, about half of which was collinear with geography. Linear models and redundancy analyses identified loci that were significantly differentiated across climatic regimes. These loci were distributed across the genome and physically associated with genes putatively involved in thermal tolerance, regulation of temperature-dependent metabolism and reproductive activity, and body colouration. Together, these findings suggest that climate can exercise sufficient selection in lizards to promote genetic differentiation across the landscape in spite of high gene flow. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Laser cutting path optimization with minimum heat accumulation
VL  - 105
IS  - 5
SP  - 2569-2579
AB  - A new approach for minimizing both cutting path and heat accumulation in laser cutting process is presented in this paper. The proposed algorithm was based on a memetic algorithm combining a powerful genetic algorithm with an adaptive large neighborhood search. The cutting path problem was modeled and solved in accordance with generalized traveling salesman problem. A heat conduction model was incorporated into the cutting path optimization by assigning a critical radius of heat-affected zone as a constraint. A penalty was given to the cutting paths overlapping the heat-affected zone to minimize the heat accumulation in workpiece. A heat map indicating thermal gradient around the laser piercing points was also presented together with the optimum cutting path to visualize the level of heat accumulation. By comparing to the approach without the heat constraint, the algorithm incorporating with the heat effect was capable of determining the laser cutting path with minimum travel distance and heat accumulation in workpiece. The presented method could further be applied for other thermal-related processes such as surface hardening, welding, and additive manufacturing, whose processing distance and heat issue need to be optimized for gaining their productivity and final product quality. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Influence of climate and thinning on Quercus pyrenaica Willd. coppices growth dynamics
VL  - 140
IS  - 1
SP  - 187-197
AB  - Many oak stands (Quercus spp.) have been managed as coppices for firewood production for centuries in the Mediterranean area. After the abandonment of firewood production during the 1980s, current management practices attempt to convert coppices into coppices-with-standards through thinning and promoting forest regeneration via sexual reproduction. In this work, we used long-term data from repeated forest inventories and dendrometers in a thinning trial to assess the effects of thinning and climate on the intra- and inter-annual growth dynamics of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. coppices. Our results revealed that thinning favored the growth of Q. pyrenaica trees, especially when the stand density reduction was high (ca. 50% of the basal area extracted). Unthinned plots displayed more natural mortality i.e., self-thinning. Growth was enhanced with low vapor pressure deficit. Intense thinning treatments displayed higher intra-annual growth rates and interacted positively with rainfall to induce higher growth. We conclude that thinning, especially intensive thinning, may alleviate the negative effects of dry years and thus could provide a potential measure to adapt these stands to the different climatic scenarios with higher temperatures and less precipitation within the framework of sustainable forest management. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 8

SP  - 939-943
AB  - Image segmentation is an important study in pattern recognition. The objective of segmentation techniques is to split the image into segments which are easier to understand and analyze. There are various methods available for the image segmentation among them thresholding is simplest method. Thresholding function is used to covert a gray-scale image into its equivalent binary image. In this paper, Thermal images are taken for processing. Thermal Imaging is a technique used for viewing the objects in dark, foggy and smoky environment. Otsu method is used for thresholding which is automatic clustering-based method. Pixels are divided into two classes such that inter-class variance is maximum and intra-class variance is minimum. Histogram of grayscale image is generated and then attempt to find thresholds at which the image could optimally be segregated into pixels belonging to the foreground of the image vs pixels belonging to the background of the image. The differential evolution keeps generating threshold values within the range of 1 to 256 and evaluating the fitness of the threshold using Otsu criteria for the image. Using mutations and crossovers, more optimal thresholds are selected generation after generation. The segmented image is shown along with the histogram and the location of the thresholds. © 2019 IJSTR.

TI  - Metabonomic Analysis Provides New Insights into the Response of Zhikong Scallop (Chlamys farreri) to Heat Stress by Improving Energy Metabolism and Antioxidant Capacity
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - Temperature is an important factor affecting the growth, development and survival of marine organisms. A short episode of high temperature has been proven to be a severe threat to sustainable shellfish culture. Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), a shellfish with broad economic and biological value in North China, has frequently experienced heat stress in summer in recent years. To understand the effects of heat stress on shellfish, the metabolism of C. farreri was analyzed after exposure to 27◦ C for either 6 h or 30 d. After 6 h of heat stress exposure, a total of 326 and 264 significantly different metabolites (SDMs) were identified in gill and mantle tissues, respectively. After 30 d of heat stress exposure, a total of 381 and 341 SDMs were found in the gill and mantle tissues, respectively. These SDMs were mainly related to the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides. A decline in pyruvic acid, and an increase in citric acid and fumaric acid in the gills and mantle of C. farreri indicated an alteration in energy metabolism, which may be attributed to increased ATP production in order to overcome the heat stress. Among the SDMs, 33 metabolites, including pyruvic acid, glycine and citric acid, were selected as potential biomarkers for heat stress response in C. farreri. In addition, a decline in glutamine and β-Alanine levels indicated oxidative stress in C. farreri exposed to heat, as well as an increase in the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC). Our findings suggested C. farreri have the potential to adapt to heat stress by regulating energy metabolism and antioxidant capacity. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Hypoxia but not shy-bold phenotype mediates thermal preferences in a threatened freshwater fish, Notropis percobromus
VL  - 84
SP  - 479-487
AB  - For ectothermic animals, ambient temperature strongly influences developmental growth rate and individual fitness. While many ectotherms live in environments that are spatially hetero-thermal, the coupling between behavioural phenotypes (e.g., shy or bold behaviour) and thermal preferences remains uncertain. Relative to shy counterparts, bolder phenotypes may exert higher preference for ambient temperatures that are closer to their thermal optimum, thereby accelerating development. In addition, ectotherms should select colder temperatures in low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) according to the oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis. Using wild caught carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus), this study examined thermoregulatory behaviour in individuals exhibiting consistent behavioural phenotypes along the shy-bold continuum and between ecologically relevant normal oxygen concentration (normoxic) and hypoxic treatments. Furthermore, the behaviour observed in the laboratory was compared to environmental data from the natal stream. Results demonstrated that individual shy-bold behavioural phenotype was consistent before and after a simulated aerial predator attack, indicating consistency of behaviour across situations. Individual preferred and avoidance temperatures varied substantially, but were unrelated to shy-bold behavioural phenotypes. In contrast, individual preferred and maximum avoidance temperatures were significantly reduced in hypoxia, consistent with the OCLTT hypothesis. These findings might indicate suppressed development rates in hypoxia, not only by the limited oxygen for aerobic metabolism, but also by the preference for colder water in hypoxia. Furthermore, the tolerated thermal ranges were reduced in hypoxia. Using test conditions confirmed by field data, our study demonstrates the strong influence of oxygen availability on thermoregulatory behaviours and preferences in aquatic environments. © 2019

TI  - Metformin-induced endocrine disruption and oxidative stress of Oryzias latipes on two-generational condition
VL  - 367
SP  - 171-181
AB  - Metformin has been treated for diabetes (type 2). Nowadays, this compound is frequently found in ambient water, influent/effluent of a wastewater treatment plant. To evaluate the metformin aquatic toxicity under a multi-generational exposure regimen, we exposed Oryzias latipes to metformin for two generations (133 d) and investigated its adverse effects. In the F0 generation, metformin significantly elevated gene expression for cytochrome P450 19a (CYP19a) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) in male fish; in female fish, the treatment decreased gene expression of vitellogenin (VTG2) and ERβ1, suggesting endocrine disruption (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.05). Intersex occurrence of F0 female fish were found in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no significant changes in fecundity and hatching rate were observed (p < 0.05). Metformin increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, and decreased the glutathione (GSH) content in F0 male fish compared with those of the control (one-way ANOVA, p > 0.05). In F0 female fish, metformin increased catalase activity compared with that of the control (p > 0.05). The results demonstrated that metformin leads to oxidative stress and two-generation endocrine disruption in O. latipes. These results may be useful for better understanding metformin toxicity mechanism. © 2018

TI  - Effects of Consecutive Moderately Cold Days on Cardiovascular Disease Mortality in Shenzhen, China: A Preliminary Study
VL  - 2018
SP  - 1148-1151
AB  - Despite traditional risk factors such as aging and hyperlipemia for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, many studies have also confirmed that both hot and cold ambient temperatures are associated with CVD mortality. This paper aims to explore the effects of consecutive moderately cold days on CVD mortality in the warm city Shenzhen during relatively cold months from 2011 to 2015. In this study, totally there were 4589 CVD death cases among the residents during a total of 24 relatively cold months. Effects of consecutive cold days on CVD mortality was evaluated by the daily percent increase of CVD mortality. Three temperature thresholds were selected, which were 15°, 14°, and 13°, respectively. The results showed that when the cold weather lasted 5 days and onwards, CVD mortality showed a continuous increment. When the temperature thresholds were 15°, 14°, or 13°, percent increase of CVD mortality at the consecutive 6th cold day reached 22%, 21%, and 24% respectively, and 26%, 38%, 33% at the consecutive 10th cold day, respectively. Thus, the consecutive moderately cold days in warm regions had continuous and accumulative negative effects on CVD mortality. The study may help local government to take timely prevention measures for moderately cold temperatures and thus to protect the wellbeing for the public. © 2018 IEEE.

SP  - 72-80
AB  - Various stresses are commonly encountered by probiotics in their ecological niches. Effects of adaptation treatments on the heat tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum KLDS 1.0628 were evaluated. Cells pre-adapted to heat, cold, oxidative, acid, bile salt, and osmotic stresses were evaluated for tolerance and cross-protection against subsequent challenge. Except for cold, pre-adaptation to sublethal levels of stress significantly improved the cell viability after heat challenge compared to the control. Heat-adapted cells showed the highest heat stress tolerance, with their tolerance factor against heat challenge reaching 31.38-fold after pre-adaptation at 45°C for 1 h. Moreover, adaptation treatments improved tolerance to the same stress and evoked cross-protection against heterologous challenges, inducing a significantly lower ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acid content in the cell membrane of L. plantarum KLDS 1.0628. The results indicated that adaptation treatments are potential strategies for enhancing the survival rate of probiotics and exerting their functional properties. © 2021 The Author(s).

VL  - 40

AB  - In the light of the production fluctuation caused by the increasing isobutylene content in butene resources and the change of C4 raw material compositions for alkylation, the liquid phase alkylation characteristics of 1-butylene, 2-butylene, isobutylene and isobutane in the range of -10℃-50℃ are analyzed by means of thermodynamic method.Results show that alkylation reactions are all irreversible exothermic reactions, the heat release increases slightly with the higher temperature, heat release for target product is slightly greater than that for by-product, and the alkylation reaction of isobutylene release the least heat.The equilibrium conversion rates of different butylenes are all above 99.9%, and that of isobutylene are slightly lower than other two butylenes.The equilibrium conversion rates of main and side alkylation reactions all drop slightly when the temperature goes up.The selectivity of TMP with higher octane number decreases with the increasing temperature, while that of DMH and MH increases with higher temperature.With the increase of isobutylene content in C4 raw materials, the selectivity of alkylation target products decreases slightly, and the decreasing trend enhances with the increasing temperature. Temperature can generate sensitive influence on octane number of alkylation products, and the effective control and stability of reaction temperature can make up for the loss in quality of alkylation products. © 2020, China National Chemical Information Center.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to explore the effect of automatic transmission fluid (ATF) temperature on the dynamic friction-wear properties of the friction component in a wet multi-disc clutch during the running-in process. Design/methodology/approach: The running-in evolution was explored in terms of global friction performance and instantaneous friction characteristics. The variation of friction torque of the initial 300 engagement cycles was obtained by wet-clutch tests. Finally, an optical microscope was used to detect the wear mechanism of friction surfaces. Findings: The ATF temperature showed a significant effect on the friction-wear performance in the clutch running-in process. The mean coefficient of friction decreased with the increase of the ATF temperature and decreased rapidly in the approximately initial 60 clutch engagements. The higher the ATF temperature was, the thinner the ATF film was, and more asperity summits were cut, thus leading to a smoother surface. Considering the slightly instantaneous friction fluctuation and the wear performance, a proper ATF temperature is necessary. Originality/value: The results provide theoretical guidance for selecting the optimal ATF temperature during the running-in process. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Techno-economic-environmental assessment for optimal utilisation of CO2 in the Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid process
VL  - 49
SP  - 139
AB  - Considering the un-declining emissions of CO2, which is a major contributor to global warming, carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) has been promoted as a potential CO2 reduction pathway, generating economic benefits and reduced environmental burdens. The integration of CCU with power plants and chemical industries drives the potential of adapting a CO2 capture and utilisation scheme. Chemical synthesis such as gas-to-liquids (GTL) process using the Fischer-Tropsch technology is a promising pathway in this configuration. The objective of this study is to assess the techno-economic-environmental viability of maximising the production of wax, diesel, gasoline and LPG in an FT-GTL plant, while optimizing the utlisation of different variables such as steam, oxygen, CO2, and the syngas recycle to purge ratio. The effect of reforming techniques and syngas recycle ratio on the production capacity are analysed upon supplementing the process with additional CO2 at a range of 1000-2000 t/d. The methodology is based on the maximum production of syngas in the reforming units, which include steam-based methane reforming (SMR) and oxygen/steam-based auto-thermal reforming (ATR). Aspen HYSYS is used to model the GTL production flowsheets. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the total refined products capacity for all scenarios based on variable function of raw material flow rate of CO2, steam, oxygen and split ratio of syngas to the purge. The sensitivity analyses demonstrate the feasibility of the ATR and SMR options to provide significant enhancement when integrated with CO2. The total refined product of hydrocarbons increase significantly when the decision variables are optimized. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 214
SP  - 85-97
AB  - Winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, were collected from three fishery stocks in the United States (U.S.) during 2009–2013 to describe spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis included rapid, synchronous transitions during autumn from mitotic spermatogonia to meiotic spermatocytes, then to haploid spermatids, and the release of spermatozoa into lobule lumen. As these transitions occurred several months prior to the spring spawning season, maturity of the testes are a poor indicator of spawning season, however, individuals can be readily evaluated prior to the spawning season for evidence of skipped spawning. Throughout this process, the gonad weight increased dramatically, with spawning-season maxima from 11 to 17% relative to individual somatic weight, suggesting considerable reproductive investment relative to other flatfishes. Fish condition also cycled seasonally, which indicated that males follow a capital breeding pattern that has been reported for female winter flounder. The timing of spermiogenesis was very similar in the fish among each U.S. stock (Southern New England [SNE], Georges Bank [GB], and the Gulf of Maine [GOM]) and published data from coastal Newfoundland, even though U.S. winter flounder spawned earlier in spring than fish in the Canadian stock. Male maturity varied in relation to both size and age, and over time, in patterns similar to those reported for female winter flounder, but at smaller and younger sizes than females. These intra-specific variations in reproductive seasonality, maturation, and skipped spawning suggest that winter flounder have the potential to adaptively respond to a dynamic environment in a region where ocean warming is occurring rapidly. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Adapting agriculture to climate change via sustainable irrigation: Biophysical potentials and feedbacks
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - Irrigated agriculture accounts for 1/490% of anthropogenic freshwater consumption, is deployed on 22% of cultivated land, and provides 40% of global food production. Expanding irrigation onto currently underperforming rainfed croplands is crucial to meet future global food demand without further agricultural expansion and associated encroachment of natural ecosystems. Establishing irrigation is also a potential climate adaptation solution to alleviate heat- and water-stress to crops and reduce climate variability and extremes. Despite irrigation being one of the land management practices with the largest environmental and hydroclimatic impacts, the role of irrigation to adapt agriculture to climate change and achieve global sustainability goals has just started to be quantified. This study reviews biophysical opportunities and feedbacks of 'sustainable irrigation'. I describe the concept of sustainable irrigation expansion - where there are opportunities to increase agricultural productivity over currently water-limited rainfed croplands by adopting irrigation practices that do not deplete freshwater stocks and impair aquatic ecosystems. Expanding sustainable irrigation may avert agricultural expansion but create additional externalities that are often neglected. This review highlights major gaps in the analysis and understanding on the role of sustainable irrigation expansion to adapt agriculture to climate change. This study reviews the implications of a potential sustainable irrigation expansion on (a) global food security, (b) hydroclimatic conditions, (c) water quality, (d) soil salinization, (e) water storage infrastructure, and (f) energy use. These implications help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in irrigated agriculture and thus also point toward solutions and future research needs. © 2022 The Author(s).

VL  - 9

SP  - 80-87
AB  - Ovalbumin (OVA), the main protein in egg white, affects most of the functional properties of egg white protein in food processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of spray drying (SD) and microwave freeze drying (MFD) on the preparation of hydrolyzed/glycosylated ovalbumin (HGOVA) and provide useful information on the applications of egg protein powders in the food industry. Results demonstrated that the structure of HGOVA was considerably changed, and its functional properties were improved compared with those of native OVA. SD and MFD processing did not lead to dissociation of HGOVA subunits. SD-HGOVA exhibited higher protein solubility, emulsifying activity, foaming capacities, and gel hardness than MFD-HGOVA. However, MFD-HGOVA was better than the SD-HGOVA in terms of color, emulsion stability, foam stability, water/oil absorption capacity, and thermal stability. Selection of an appropriate drying method could enhance the potential applications of HGOVA in the food industry. © 2020 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd

TI  - Landscape of Stress Response and Virulence Genes Among Listeria monocytogenes Strains
VL  - 12
AB  - The pathogenic microorganism Listeria monocytogenes is ubiquitous and responsible for listeriosis, a disease with a high mortality rate in susceptible people. It can persist in different habitats, including the farm environment, the food production environments, and in foods. This pathogen can grow under challenging conditions, such as low pH, low temperatures, and high salt concentrations. However, L. monocytogenes has a high degree of strain divergence regarding virulence potential, environmental adaption, and stress response. This review seeks to provide the reader with an up-to-date overview of clonal and serotype-specific differences among L. monocytogenes strains. Emphasis on the genes and genomic islands responsible for virulence and resistance to environmental stresses is given to explain the complex adaptation among L. monocytogenes strains. Moreover, we highlight the use of advanced diagnostic technologies, such as whole-genome sequencing, to fine-tune quantitative microbiological risk assessment for better control of listeriosis.

TI  - Natural radioactivity in thermal waters: A case study from poland
VL  - 14
IS  - 3
AB  - A natural radioactivity in thermal water was investigated based on 19 selected thermal waters from Poland. The analysed results show that the radionuclides’ concentrations in the study waters vary over a wide range. The temperature of the waters varies from above 20◦C to above 80◦C. The waters are characterised by different mineralisation, chemical compositions, and belong to different hydrochemical types. There is a good correlation between the water temperature and the depths of the aquifer formations occurrence, suggesting the thermal energy originates from the thermal geogradient. The concentration of radium is well correlated with the water mineralisation. The ratio of radium activity (226Ra/228Ra) in groundwater relates not only the ratio of uranium activity to that of thorium (238U/232Th) in aquifer formation, but also depends on the physical and chemical water properties. Based on the concentration of radon and its transport model, the radiation exposures due to inhalation of222Rn and its progeny for employees and clients of the spa were assessed. The use of the thermal waters as a drinking resource may be problematic due to the possibility of exceeding the recommended annual committed effective dose 0.1 mSv. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Genetic differences in thermal tolerance among colonies of threatened coral Acropora cervicornis: Potential for adaptation to increasing temperature
VL  - 646
SP  - 45-68
AB  - Climate change is resulting in warmer temperatures that are negatively impacting corals. Understanding how much individuals within a population vary in their thermal tolerance and whether this variation is heritable is important in determining whether a species can adapt to climate change. To address this, Acropora cervicornis fragments from 20 genetically distinct colonies collected from the Coral Restoration Foundation Tavernier nursery (Florida, USA) were kept at either ambient (28 1C) or elevated (32 1C) temperatures, and mortality was monitored for 26 d. Both broad-sense (H2) and narrow-sense (h2) heritability of thermal tolerance were estimated to determine the amount of genetic variation underlying survival to elevated temperature. To understand the physiological basis of thermal tolerance, tissue from both treatments was taken 12 h after the start of the experiment to investigate gene expression at the mRNA and protein level between tolerant and susceptible colonies. Results revealed that this population has considerable total genetic variation in thermal tolerance (H 2 = 0.528), but low variance in relatedness among colonies prevented us from making any conclusions regarding h2. Despite high transcriptomic variability among and within colonies, 40 genes were consistently and significantly different between tolerant and susceptible colonies, and could be potential biomarkers for thermal tolerance should they be verified in a larger sample. Overall, the results suggest that this population has substantial genetic variation for traits that directly impact thermal tolerance; however, their response to projected increases in temperature will depend on more precise estimates of the additive components of this variation (h2). © 2020 Inter-Research.

TI  - Green synthesis of highly fluorescent nitrogen – Doped carbon dots from Lantana camara berries for effective detection of lead(II) and bioimaging
VL  - 178
SP  - 330-338
AB  - Here, we developed a simple green approach for the synthesis of highly fluorescent nitrogen doped carbon dots (NCDs) using Lantana camara berries. Optical and physicochemical properties of as synthesized NCDs were extensively studied by using various analytical techniques. NCDs exhibited bright fluorescence with Quantum yield as high as 33.15%, which is stable to various effects like heat, pH, ionic strength and continuous irradiation. Furthermore, the NCDs presented highly selective and sensitive fluorescence response towards Pb2 + which explored their potential to serve as a label-free fluorescent probe for the effective detection of Pb2 +. As developed NCDs based probe exhibited a great linear response (R2 = 0.998) towards Pb2 + in the concentration range of 0–200 nM with a detection limit of 9.64 nM. The probe further presented high precision without any interference and was successfully applied for the detection of Pb2 + in the real water and human sera (serum and urine) samples. Cytotoxicity studies on both cancerous (human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7) and normal (Human embryonic kidney HEK-293) cell lines revealed their excellent biocompatibility. With their low cytotoxicity, strong fluorescence and excitation-dependent emission, NCDs were successfully applied as multi-colour bioimaging agents and Pb2 + detection capabilities were further evaluated in live cells. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 2267-2274
AB  - Multi kilowatt single mode lasers are increasingly being used in Selective Laser Melting (SLM), typically with the aim of improving productivity. However, the high power densities present in the optical path lead to a thermally induced focal shift i.e. thermal lensing. Whilst thermal lensing has been studied for many processes, its impact on parts produced by SLM is currently unknown. Therefore this work discusses the characteristics of a thermally induced focal shift supplemented by a method for the compensation of this effect. In addition, SLM parts with and without thermal lensing compensation are compared in order to show the effect on final part quality. © Solid Freeform Fabrication 2018: Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - An Additive Manufacturing Conference, SFF 2018.

TI  - Effect of plateau pika disturbance and patchiness on ecosystem carbon emissions in alpine meadow in the northeastern part of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
VL  - 16
IS  - 6
SP  - 1097-1109
AB  - Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) disturbance and patchiness intensify the spatial heterogeneous distribution of vegetation productivity and soil physicochemical properties, which may alter the ecosystem carbon emission process. Nevertheless, previous research has mostly focused on the homogeneous vegetation patches rather than heterogeneous land surface. Thus, this study aims to improve our understanding of the difference in ecosystem respiration (Re) over heterogeneous land surface in an alpine meadow grassland. Six different land surface types, namely large bald patches, medium bald patches, small bald patches, intact grassland, above pika tunnel and pika pile, were selected to analyze the response of Re to pika disturbance and patchiness and the key controlling factors. The results showed that (1) Re in intact grassland was 0.22-1.07 times higher than pika pile and bald patches, (2) soil moisture (SM) of intact grassland was 2%-11% higher than that of pika pile and bald patches, despite the fact that pika disturbance increased the water infiltration rate while soil temperature (ST) in intact grassland was 1-3 ° less than pika pile and bald patches, (3) soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in intact grassland were approximately 50% and 60% less than above pika tunnel, whereas they were 10%-30% and 22%-110% higher than pika pile and bald patches, and (4) Re was significantly correlated with SM, TN and vegetation biomass (P<0.05). Our results suggested that pika disturbance and patchiness altered the ecosystem carbon emission pattern, which was mainly attributed to the reduction in soil water and supply of substrates. Given the wide distribution of pikas and the large area of bald patches, the varied Re in heterogeneous land surfaces should not be neglected in the estimation of ecosystem carbon emissions at the plot or regional scale. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Movement rule selection through eco-genetic modeling: Application to diurnal vertical movement
VL  - 478
SP  - 128-138
AB  - Agent-based, spatially-explicit models that incorporate movement rules are used across ecological disciplines for a variety of applications. However, appropriate movement rules may be difficult to implement due to the complexity of an individual's response to both proximate and ultimate cues, as well as the difficulty in directly assessing how organisms choose to move across their environment. Environmental cues may be complex and dynamic, and therefore, movement responses may require tradeoffs between preferred levels of different environmental variables (e.g., temperature, light level, and prey availability). Here, we present an approach to determine appropriate movement rules by setting them as heritable traits in an eco-genetic modeling framework and allowing movement rules to evolve during the model rather than setting them a priori. We modeled yellow perch, Perca flavescens, movement in a simulated environment and allowed perch to move in response to high-resolution vertical gradients in temperature, dissolved oxygen, light, predators, and prey. Evolving movement rules ultimately increased fish growth and survival over generations in our model, indicating that evolving movement rules led to improved individual performance. We found that emergent movement rules were consistent across trials, with evolved movement rules incorporating different weights of these environmental factors and the most rapid selection on temperature preference. This case study presents a flexible method using ecogenetic modeling to determine appropriate movement rules that can be applied to diverse scenarios in spatially-explicit ecological modeling.

TI  - Pd/BN catalysts for highly efficient hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride
VL  - 630
AB  - A 0.33 wt% Pd/BN catalyst has been proved highly active for the liquid-phase selective hydrogenation of maleic anhydride (MA) to succinic anhydride (SA) at room temperature and highly selective to SA within a wide temperature range, far beyond the Pd/Al2O3 and Pd/MgO catalysts. An SA productivity of 6000 KgSA KgPd−1 h−1 and a high TOF value of 9.0 s−1 can be achieved at room temperature on the Pd/BN, and the high SA selectivity over 99.7% can be retained at the reaction temperature up to 150 ºC. Detailed structural characterizations and reactant-adsorption/desorption tests have demonstrated that the support effect on MA hydrogenation is related not only to the adsorption configurations of MA on Pd, which exhibits the indirect effect of the support via the electronic interaction with Pd, but also to the direct adsorption of MA on the support itself. In particular, for our catalysts with the low Pd loading, the difference of metal centers is largely masked by the adsorption of the support itself. For the Pd/BN, the predominant MA adsorption on Pd through a di-σ mode, the weak MA adsorption with a small amount on BN, and a high H-spillover ability are responsible for its high activity and selectivity. Moreover, it has been also revealed that the catalyst prereduction temperature can change the catalytic performance of the Pd/BN through an integrated effect including the removal of residual chlorine on Pd and the growth of Pd particles. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Do Covariances between Maternal Behavior and Embryonic Physiology Drive Sex-Ratio Evolution under Environmental Sex Determination?
VL  - 110
IS  - 4
SP  - 411-421
AB  - Fisherian sex-ratio theory predicts sexual species should have a balanced primary sex ratio. However, organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD) are particularly vulnerable to experiencing skewed sex ratios when environmental conditions vary. Theoretical work has modeled sex-ratio dynamics for animals with ESD with regard to 2 traits predicted to be responsive to sex-ratio selection: 1) maternal oviposition behavior and 2) sensitivity of embryonic sex determination to environmental conditions, and much research has since focused on how these traits influence offspring sex ratios. However, relatively few studies have provided estimates of univariate quantitative genetic parameters for these 2 traits, and the existence of phenotypic or genetic covariances among these traits has not been assessed. Here, we leverage studies on 3 species of reptiles (2 turtle species and a lizard) with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) to assess phenotypic covariances between measures of maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway. These studies quantified maternal behaviors that relate to nest temperature and sex ratio of offspring incubated under controlled conditions. A positive covariance between these traits would enhance the efficiency of sex-ratio selection when primary sex ratio is unbalanced. However, we detected no such covariance between measures of these categories of traits in the 3 study species. These results suggest that maternal oviposition behavior and thermal sensitivity of sex determination in embryos might evolve independently. Such information is critical to understand how animals with TSD will respond to rapidly changing environments that induce sex-ratio selection. © 2019 The American Genetic Association .

TI  - Effects of larval diets and temperature regimes on life history traits, energy reserves and temperature tolerance of male Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae): optimizing rearing techniques for the sterile insect programmes
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Producing high quality sterile males is vital in Aedes aegypti rear-and-release birth control strategies. Larval diets, rearing temperatures, and their interactions determine the accumulation rates of essential nutrients in larvae, but these factors have been understudied in relation to mass-rearing techniques for producing eminent males. Methods: We compared the effects of two larval diets, a cereal-legume-based diet (Khan's diet) and a standard larval diet developed in the FAO/IAEA Insect Pest Control Laboratory (IAEA 2 diet). Diets were tested at selected temperatures for both larval and male adult life history traits, adult extreme temperature tolerance, and mating capacity relative to energy reserves of reared male adult Ae. aegypti. Results: Khan's diet resulted in shorter immature development time at each test temperature (except for 25 degrees C) than an IAEA 2 diet. Larvae reared at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C with Khan's diet demonstrated low pupation rates (c.80%). We accounted for these phenomena as secondary sex ratio manipulation, because a higher proportion of male adults emerged at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C than that for the IAEA 2 diet. In general, the pupal development time shortened as temperature increased, resulting in higher teneral energy reserves in male mosquitoes. High energy reserves allowed male mosquitoes reared with Khan's diet to have higher adult longevity (5-6 days longer when sugar-fed and 2-3 days longer when water-fed) and tolerance of heat stress than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. The IAEA 2 diet produced larger male mosquitoes than Khan's diet did: mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet were 1.03-1.05 times smaller than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C. No evidence indicated reduced mating capacity for small mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet. Conclusions: Larvae reared at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C with Khan's diet were characterized by shorter immature development time compared with those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. Adult mosquitoes produced from that larval rearing condition exhibited a significant male bias, long lifespan, and better endurance against extreme temperatures relative to energy reserves. Thus, the larval diet at rearing temperature of 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C optimized rearing techniques for the sterile insect programmes. However, mating competitiveness and flight performance of adult males require further investigation.

TI  - Discrete Spawning Aggregations of the Loliginid Squid Doryteuthis gahi Reveal Life-History Interactions of a Dwarf Morphotype at the Center of Its Distribution Range
VL  - 7
AB  - Heterogeneous environmental conditions along the Humboldt Current System (HCS) influence the life-history strategy of a variety of species in different ways. There is limited information on latitudinal traits of coastal cephalopods as part of the interacting species in pelagic and benthic environments. The present study used the loliginid squid Doryteuthis gahi as a model organism to: (1) evaluate latitudinal traits on egg laying patterns, (2) characterize a particular spawning ground, (3) quantify the isotopic variation from different tissues, (4) evaluate potential trophic ontogenetic changes, (5) determinate trophic position, and (6) isotopically estimate the relative importance of putative preys in the squid’s assimilated diet. Results evidenced that egg-masses collected between 2014 and 2020 presented similar patterns along northern-central Chile (27–36°S), with females attaching small egg-capsules (10–50 mm length) through the year and over a variety of anthropogenic and natural substrates. At a small scale (Coquimbo; 29°S), early life history traits showed distinct patterns depending on SST, with warmer collection periods (∼18°C) evidencing larger capsules and smaller embryos, although small paralarvae were obtained over the 4-year sampling period. In this site, sampling of older ontogenetic stages supported the constant presence of small-sized squids (19–77 mm ML). Males had larger mean sizes compared to females and undetermined specimens, with a high proportion of mature stages. Observations in captivity were extended for up to 110 d, validating that small females (45–64 mm ML) spawn the small egg-capsules typically observed in the field. Differences in stable isotope composition between beaks and soft tissues of adult squids were lower for δ13C values (1.1 vs. 1.4‰, respectively) and higher for δ15N values (5.3 vs. 4.7‰, respectively). Isotopic composition through ontogeny found similar δ13C and δ15N values, suggesting that carbon sources (pelagic origin) and trophic position did not change significantly, with copepods, euphausiids and nereid polychaetes being the most important preys. This study unveils the permanent occurrence of a small reproductive morphotype of D. gahi in shallow coastal habitats of northern-central Chile (i.e., center of the distribution range), providing the first insights for understanding the species’ potential adaptations to heterogeneous conditions in the HCS and the unexplored distribution gap between the two centers of abundance (Peru and the Falkland/Malvinas islands). © Copyright © 2021 Carrasco, Bravo, Ibáñez and Zapata-Hernández.

TI  - Elevated seawater pCO(2) affects reproduction and embryonic development in the pygmy squid, Idiosepius pygmaeus
VL  - 153
AB  - The oceans are absorbing additional carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and projected future CO2 levels and ocean acidification could have negative implications for many marine organisms, especially during early life stages. Cephalopods are ecologically important in marine ecosystems, yet the potential effects of increased partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in seawater on cephalopod reproduction and embryonic development are little studied. We allowed adult two-toned pygmy squid (Idiosepius pygmaeus) to breed in ambient control (similar to 445 mu atm; similar to 8.05 pH(T)) or elevated pCO(2) conditions (similar to 940 mu atm; similar to 7.78 pH(T)) and compared reproductive traits in adults and developmental characteristics of their eggs, which remained in control or elevated pCO(2) treatments until hatching. Breeding pairs at elevated pCO(2) produced clutches with 40% fewer eggs, vitelli that were 14% smaller directly after spawning, embryos that were 5% smaller upon hatching, and eggs with an 8% increase in late-stage egg swelling compared with pairs at control conditions. Elevated pCO(2) did not affect fertility, time to hatch, or hatching success. Eggs were laid 40% closer together in elevated pCO(2) compared with control conditions, indicating a possible effect of elevated pCO(2) on reproductive behaviour. These results show that elevated pCO(2) can adversely affect reproduction and embryonic development of the two-toned pygmy squid. As the potential for adaptation is influenced by reproductive success, testing the capacity for squid to adapt to future ocean conditions should be a priority for future research.

TI  - Growth and survival among Hawaiian corals outplanted from tanks to an ocean nursery are driven by individual genotype and species differences rather than preconditioning to thermal stress
VL  - 10
AB  - The drastic decline in coral coverage has stimulated an interest in reef restoration, and various iterations of coral nurseries have been used to augment restoration strategies. Here we examine the growth of two species of Hawaiian Montipora that were maintained in mesocosms under either ambient or warmed annual bleaching conditions for two consecutive years prior to outplanting to determine whether preconditioning aided coral restoration efforts. Using coral trees to create a nearby ocean nursery, we examined whether: (1) previous ex situ mesocosm growth would mirror in situ coral tree nursery growth; and (2) thermal ex situ stress-hardening would predict future success during natural warming events in situ for corals moved from tanks to trees. For Montipora capitata, we found that variation in growth was explained primarily by genotype; growth rates in the mesocosms were similar to those in situ, irrespective of preconditioning. Variation in M. flabellata growth, however, was explained by both genotype and culture method such that an individual M. flabellata colony that grew well in the tanks did not necessarily perform as well on the coral trees. For both species, previous exposure to elevated temperatures in the mesocosms provided no benefit to either growth or survival during a warming event in the coral tree nursery compared to those grown in ambient temperatures. Overall, M. capitata performed better in the tree nursery with higher net growth, lower mortality, and was subject to less predation than M. flabellata. Our results show little benefit of the additional cost and time of stress-hardening these corals prior to outplanting because it is unlikely to aid resilience to future warming events. These results also suggest that selecting corals for restoration based on long-term genotype growth performance may be more effective for optimal outcomes but should be weighed against other factors, such as coral morphology, in situ nursery method, location, and other characteristics. © 2022 Henley et al.

TI  - Reproductive plasticity in the invasive -Xenostrobus securis (Bivalvia: Mytiloidea) in northwestern Spain
VL  - 159
AB  - The invasive mussel Xenostrobus securis was first recorded from Galicia (NW Spain) in 2007, within an area characterized by the commercial culture of Mytilus galloprovincialis. This study investigated the spatial variability in reproduction of X. securis at three adjacent locations over a period of twelve months and the temporal variation at one location over two consecutive years. This is the first such study conducted outside its native range and in which the influences of temperature and salinity on the reproductive cycle were also tested. The invader exhibited rapid gametogenesis, accumulation of mature gametes and an extended spawning period interspersed with gonad recovery, without resting periods. The onset of gametogenesis varied both spatial and temporally, starting 15-days later at the innermost location than at the outermost one. Such spatial variability resulted in an almost continuous breeding season (10 months), in contrast to the 7–8 months observed in the native range. Although the spatial variability in maturation and spawning in the native location is mainly attributable to variations in salinity, the variability in the Ría de Vigo was probably caused by temperature acting as a trigger for maturation and spawning. The almost continuous breeding season exhibited by X. securis potentially results in planktotrophic larvae being present in the water column for almost 10 months of the year. The reproductive plasticity of X. securis and the potential to adapt to local environmental conditions highlight the need for specific monitoring programmes focused on early detection in potential invasion hotspots. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Some like it hot: Factors impacting thermal preferences of two Ponto- Caspian amphipods Dikerogammarus villosus (Sovinsky, 1894) and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841)
VL  - 2018
IS  - 5
AB  - Temperature is a crucial factor determining biology and ecology of poikilothermic animals. It often constitutes an important barrier for invasive species originating from different climate zones but, on the other hand, may facilitate the invasion process of animals with wide thermal preferences and high resistance to extreme temperatures. In our experimental study, we investigated the thermal behaviour of two Ponto-Caspian amphipod crustaceans-Dikerogammarus villosus and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes. Both species are known to live under a wide range of thermal conditions which may promote their invasion. Moreover, both these amphipods are hosts for microsporidian parasites which co-evolved with them within the Ponto-Caspian region and spread in European waters. As the presence of a parasite may influence the thermal preferences of its host, we expected to observe behavioural changes in infected individuals of the studied amphipods leading to (1) behavioural fever (selecting a warmer habitat) or (2) anapyrexia (selecting a colder habitat). The experiment (N D20) was carried out for 30 min in a 100 cm. 20 cm from boths sides were not avaliable for amphipods long thermal gradient (0-40 °C), using 30 randomly selected adult amphipod individuals of one species. At the end of each trial, we checked the position of amphipods along the gradient and determined their sex and infection status (uninfected or infected by one of microsporidium species). D. villosus was infected with Cucumispora dikerogammari whereas D. haemobaphes was a host for C. dikerogammari, Dictyocoela muelleri or D. berillonum. Thermal preferences of amphipods depended on their species and sex. Females of D. villosus preferred warmer microhabitats (often much above 30 °C) than conspecific males and females of D. haemobaphes, whereas no significant differences were found among males of both species and both sexes of D. haemobaphes. Moreover, infected males of D. villosus stayed in warmer water more often than uninfected males of this species, selecting temperatures higher than 30 °C, which may be explained either as a behavioural fever constituting a defence mechanism of a host against the infection, or as a parasite manipulation of the host behaviour increasing the parasite fitness. On the other hand, none of the parasite species affected the thermal preferences of D. haemobaphes, including also C. dikerogammari, changing the behaviour of D. villosus. Our research presents the complexity of the thermal behaviour of studied amphipods and the evidence that microsporidia may trigger a change in temperature preferendum of their host species and those observations may be the result of different host-parasite coevolution time which may vary for the two host species (Poulin, 2010). © 2018 Rachalewski et al.

VL  - 32

SP  - 2520-2530
AB  - A major goal of seasonal biology is to understand how selection on phenology and the physiological niche interact. In oviparous species, fitness variation across the growing season suggests that phenological shifts will alter selective environments experienced by embryos. We hypothesize that physiology could become co-adapted with phenology; such that embryos perform better in the environmental conditions they are adapted to compared to embryos adapted to other environments (temporal matching). Here, we tested for temporal matching to seasonal changes in the environmental temperatures with toad-headed lizard, Phrynocephalus przewalskii, which inhabits the temperate desert steppe of China. We used a split-clutch reciprocal experiment, by incubating eggs from early- and late-breeding females at rising and falling temperature regimes, respectively, to separate the influence of intrinsic (genetic and parental) vs. extrinsic factors (developmental plasticity or acclimatization) on the performance and fitness of offspring. Eggs from early-breeding females were with higher quality than those from late-breeding females, likely due to better maternal provisioning. Offspring from early-breeding females had higher selected body temperatures and metabolic rates than those from late-breeding females. Falling temperatures that may indicate the end of the growing season, reduced incubation duration and increased metabolic rates for both early and late eggs, compared to rising temperatures. Late hatchlings had higher growth rates when incubated at falling compared to rising temperatures, while growth rates of early hatchlings were not sensitive to incubation temperature. Thus, growth and survival rates of late embryos were similar to early embryos under falling temperatures, despite early embryos being of generally higher quality. Overall, our study confirms that “early is higher quality.” Intrinsic factors dominate offspring performance and fitness, with a general advantage for early embryos throughout the season. We found some support for temporal matching, demonstrating that late embryos with lower quality have physiological strategies that are specialized to late-season environments, allowing them to attain similar fitness in late-season environments to that of early embryos.

TI  - Effects of hypoxia on the thermal physiology of a high-elevation lizard: Implications for upslope-shifting species
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
AB  - Montane reptiles are predicted to move to higher elevations in response to climate warming. However, whether upwards-shifting reptiles will be physiologically constrained by hypoxia at higher elevations remains unknown. We investigated the effects of hypoxic conditions on preferred body temperatures (T pref) and thermal tolerance capacity of a montane lizard (Phrynocephalus vlangalii) from two populations on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Lizards from 2600 m a.s.l. were exposed to O 2 levels mimicking those at 2600 m (control) and 3600 m (hypoxia treatment). Lizards from 3600 m a.s.l. were exposed to O 2 levels mimicking those at 3600 m (control) and 4600 m (hypoxia treatment). The T pref did not differ between the control and hypoxia treatments in lizards from 2600 m. However, lizards from 3600 m selected lower body temperatures when exposed to the hypoxia treatment mimicking the O 2 level at 4600 m. Additionally, the hypoxia treatment induced lower critical thermal minimum (CT min) in lizards from both populations, but did not affect the critical thermal maximum (CT max) in either population. Our results imply that upwards-shifting reptiles may be constrained by hypoxia if a decrease in T pref reduces thermally dependent fitness traits, despite no observed effect on their heat tolerance. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Smart polymeric biomaterials have been the focus of many recent biomedical studies, especially those with adaptability to defects and potential to be implanted in the human body. Herein we report a versatile and straightforward method to convert non-thermoresponsive hydrogels into thermoresponsive systems with shape memory ability. As a proof of concept, a thermoresponsive polyurethane mesh was embedded within a methacrylated chitosan (CHTMA), gelatin (GELMA), laminarin (LAMMA) or hyaluronic acid (HAMA) hydrogel network, which afforded hydrogel composites with shape memory ability. With this system, we achieved good to excellent shape fixity ratios (50-90%) and excellent shape recovery ratios (∼100%, almost instantaneously) at body temperature (37 °C). Cytocompatibility tests demonstrated good viability either with cells on top or encapsulated during all shape memory processes. This straightforward approach opens a broad range of possibilities to convey shape memory properties to virtually any synthetic or natural-based hydrogel for several biological and nonbiological applications. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

TI  - An overview of fused deposition modelling (FDM): research, development and process optimisation
VL  - 27
IS  - 3
SP  - 562-582
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review research studies on process optimisation and machine development that lead to the enhancement of final products in various aspects of the fused deposition modelling (FDM) process. Design/methodology/approach: An overview of the literature, focussing on process parameters, machine developments and material characterisations. This study investigates recent research studies that studied FDM capabilities in printing a vast range of materials from thermoplastics to metal alloys. Findings: FDM is one of the most common techniques in additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Many parameters in this technology have effects on three-dimensional printed products. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the optimum elements, for example, build orientation, layer thickness, nozzle diameter, infill pattern and bed temperature. By selecting a proper variable range of parameters, the layers adhere strongly and building end-use products of high quality are achievable. A vast range of materials and their properties from polymers to composite-based polymers are presented. Novel techniques to print metal alloys and composites are examined to increase the productivity of the FDM process. Additionally, defects such as shrinkage and warpage are discussed to eliminate the system’s limitations and improve the quality of final products. Multi-axis and mobile machines brought enhancements throughout the process to eliminate obstacles such as staircase defects in the conventional FDM process. In brief, recent developments were identified and a summary of major improvements was discussed in this study for future research. Originality/value: This paper is an overview that provides information about research and developments in FDM. This review focusses on process optimisation and obstacles in printing polymers, composites, geopolymers and novel materials. Therefore, machine characteristics were examined to find out the accessibility of printing novel materials for different applications. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Post-glacial re-colonization and natural selection have shaped growth responses of silver fir across Europe
VL  - 779
AB  - Warmer climate and more frequent extreme droughts will posemajor threats to forest ecosystems. Past demography processes due to post-glacial recolonization and adaptation to local environmental conditions are among themain contributors to genetic differentiation processes among provenances. Assessing the intra-specific variability of tree growth responses to such changes is crucial to explore a species' potential to cope with climate warming. We combined growth-related traits derived from tree-ring width series with neutral genetic information of 18 European provenances of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) growing in two common garden experiments in Switzerland. Analyses based on neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the studied provenances grouped into three longitudinal clusters. These three genetic clusters showed differences in growth traits (height and DBH), with the provenances from the eastern cluster exhibiting the highest growth. The Pyrenees cluster showed significantly lower recovery and resilience to the extreme drought of 2003 as well as lower values of growth autocorrelation. QST-FST and correlation analyseswith climate of provenance origin suggest that the differences among provenances found in some traits result from natural selection. Our study suggests that the last post-glacial re-colonization and natural selection are themajor drivers explaining the intra-specific variability in growth of silver fir across Europe. These findings highlight the importance of combining dendroecology and genetic analyses on fitness-related traits to assess the potential of a species to cope with global environmental change and provide insights to support assisted gene flow to ensure the persistence of the species in European forests.

TI  - Gamete Collection and In Vitro Fertilization of Astyanax mexicanus
IS  - 147
AB  - Astyanax mexicanus is emerging as a model organism for a variety of research fields in biological science. Part of the recent success of this teleost fish species is that it possesses interfertile cave and river-dwelling populations. This enables the genetic mapping of heritable traits that were fixed during adaptation to the different environments of these populations. While this species can be maintained and bred in the lab, it is challenging to both obtain embryos during the daytime and create hybrid embryos between strains. In vitro fertilization (IVF) has been used with a variety of different model organisms to successfully and repeatedly breed animals in the lab. In this protocol, we show how, by acclimatizing A. mexicanus to different light cycles coupled with changes in water temperature, we can shift breeding cycles to a chosen time of the day. Subsequently, we show how to identify suitable parental fish, collect healthy gametes from males and females, and produce viable offspring using IVF. This enables related procedures such as the injection of genetic constructs or developmental analysis to occur during normal working hours. Furthermore, this technique can be used to create hybrids between the cave and surface-dwelling populations, and thereby enable the study of the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptations to different environments.

VL  - 30

SP  - 1503-1512
AB  - Temperature has a range of effects on population demographic rates and physiology of microalgae for potential bioenergy application. The changes in microalgal growth, stoichiometry and cellular lipid contents of 14 different microalgae species with high bioenergy potentials in response to different temperature between 10 and 35 °C were investigated. For most of the chosen microalgae, the specific growth rate increased with temperature over most of the range. On the other hand, the biomass density of most of the selected species declined with temperature at stationary phase. Certain cyanobacteria failed to grow below 20 °C, while eukaryotes had a wider temperature range. Lipid content, by contrast, showed different responses to temperature among the 14 species. Nine of the species showed a positive response with increased temperature, while others showed neural or unimodal response. Cellular C:N and C:P ratios were mostly unimodally related to temperature. Some eukaryotic species showed the lowest total lipid contents but the highest C:N and C:P ratios, the fastest growth, and the highest biomass density at their stationary phases. The results indicated that the responses of the life history and cellular stoichiometry to temperature were more consistent across microalgae than that of total lipid content. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 102

SP  - 1557-1566
AB  - Different process parameters can alter the temperature during machining. Consequently, selecting process parameters that lead to a desirable cutting temperature would help to increase the tool life, decrease the tensile residual stress, and controls the microstructure evolution of the workpiece. An inverse computational methodology is proposed to design the process parameters for a specific cutting temperature. A physics-based analytical model is used to predict the temperature induced by cutting forces. The shear deformation and chip formation model is implemented to calculate machining forces as functions of process parameters, material properties, and etc. To calculate the temperature induced by the deformation in the shear zone, a moving point heat source approach is used. The proposed model uses an iterative non-linear regression to predict the cutting process parameters based on the desirable temperature which is assigned by the user. In order to achieve the cutting process parameters, an iterative gradient search is used to adaptively approach the specific temperature by the optimization of process parameters such that an inverse reasoning can be achieved. Experimental data are used to illustrate the implementation and validate the viability of the computational methodology. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Effect of temperature and oxygen regime on growth and physiology of juvenile Salvelinus fontinalis × Salvelinus alpinus hybrids
VL  - 522
AB  - Effect of oxygen saturation and thermal regimes on growth and selected physiological indicators of juvenile Salvelinus fontinalis x Salvelinus alpinus hybrids were investigated in separate experiments. Hybrid status of tested fish, with S. fontinalis as the maternal species, was confirmed by sequence analysis. During both experiments fish doubled their initial weight in most tested groups. In experiment 1, fish (n = 516, 70.6 +/- 1.5 g) were exposed to one of four oxygen regimes (normal, hyperoxic, 12 h alternating normal/hyperoxic, and 24 h alternating normal/hyperoxic) in triplicate (12 rearing tanks of four separate RAS) for 63 days. More favourable growth parameters were observed under normoxic conditions (85-95%) in comparison with hyperoxia (120-130%). Oxygen saturation was not associated with final feed conversion ratio, size variation, condition factor, selected somatic indices, or overall mortality rate. Oxygen saturation was significantly positively associated with leukocyte count and negatively associated with mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration. Gills showed slight to moderate atypia in groups exposed to hyperoxia compared to the normoxia group. In experiment 2, fish (n. = 560, 21.7 +/- 0.3 g) were held in 7, 10, 13, or 16 degrees C water in four repetitions (16 rearing tanks of four separate RAS) for an 84-day period. Selected growth parameters were significantly higher at 13 degrees C than at 7, 10, and 16 degrees C. Feed conversion ratio was the lowest at 13 and 16 degrees C. Size variation and somatic indices exhibited no differences among treatments, while condition factor was significantly higher at 10 and 13 degrees C. Mortality rate increased from 1.4% to 30.5% with rise in temperature, with highest mortality recorded at 16 degrees C. Hyperoxia showed no advantage on growth of tested hybrids, while 13 degrees C was optimal water temperature for their culture.

VL  - 46

SP  - 366-375
AB  - Fish stocking programs designed for species rehabilitation aim to match the strains being stocked with the environments the fish will inhabit. The ability of different lake trout Salvelinus namaycush populations to adjust their physiological performance over a broad range of environmental conditions will be advantageous as water temperatures rise with climate warming. This study compares the adaptive physiological potential of 6 strains of lake trout stocked within the Laurentian Great Lakes by comparing growth, metabolic and cardiovascular performance, and organ-system tradeoffs across a temperature gradient. Using a common garden design, lake trout were raised from the embryonic stage until 2 years of age, when they were acclimated to temperatures of 8, 11, 15 and 19 degrees C before undergoing experiments to test their metabolic performance. For all strains, growth rates showed a dome-shaped response with temperature, peaking at 11 degrees C and reaching negative rates at 19 degrees C. For 5 of 6 strains, metabolic rates increased while in all strains cardiovascular performance declined with increasing temperature. Higher metabolic rates at higher temperatures generally came at the cost of slower growth, less investment into gastrointestinal mass, and reduced cardiovascular fitness and investment. Importantly, though, the Seneca strain was unique by showing a reduction of aerobic scope at the highest temperature, possibly indicating increased costs as temperature rises in this smaller-sized, potentially slower pace-of-life strain. However, the overall low interpopulation variability in our study suggests limited diversity in the physiological responses to temperature in strains stocked across the Great Lakes basin.

VL  - 22

SP  - 3267-3289
AB  - Agriculture in South Asia is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing variability in rainfall and rising temperatures leading to the incidence of extreme climatic events such as floods, droughts, heat/cold waves, and storms. Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Thermal control analysis on a 6U CubeSat equipped with a high-power laser
VL  - 10769
AB  - A satellite in orbit is exposed to external radiation from space, including: solar radiation, reflected light and earth emission. Heat is also generated through its internal components. Thermal design considerations are necessary to prevent any component from being damaged by excessive heating and to guarantee its performance. This paper explores options for thermal control mechanisms onboard a 6U CubeSat that includes a high-power laser. The CubeSat mission represents a space environment demonstration of a NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project for determining asteroid composition. A Low Earth Orbit (LEO) CubeSat mission is simulated at 650 km altitude, and the sensor system will determine through spectrometric detection the composition of a cold target heated by an on-board laser. An intuitive interface was created using MATLAB's tool GUIDE, where orbit, altitude and satellite position are input parameters that result in the average temperature at each orbit point, presented on a globe. The challenge is to find devices capable of controlling the temperature on the surfaces of the nanosatellite, and to be efficient enough to handle the heat generated by the laser when it is activated, requiring dissipation and expulsion of approximately 200 W. Mechanical designs tested include thermal straps, heat pipes, passive radiative surfaces and active schemes such as thermal louvres. Based on thermal gradients from analytical simulations and state-of-the-art in CubeSat thermal control, some of the tested thermal control schemes maintain the equipment within its working temperature range. The viability of selected thermal control schemes is discussed in this article. © 2018 SPIE.

TI  - Investigating Outdoor Heat Stress Using Environmental Parameters and Selected Thermal Indices in Northern India
SP  - 293
AB  - Heat stress is often an unacknowledged occupational health hazard especially in developing countries. Climatic zones like tropical and subtropical regions having higher air temperature, humidity and radiant temperature values may impose greater risks of heat-related illness and safety threats to users employed in developing countries having low and medium incomes. Present study aimed at assessing the environmental variables followed by evaluating the heat stress exposures levels at different time periods during the hot summer season utilizing widely used indices, i.e. wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), discomfort index (DI), humidex (HD), heat index (HI), tropical summer index (TSI); so to have better insights of the stressful thermal climatic conditions experienced by the users engaged in outdoor work activities. Results revealed higher heat stress exposure levels attributable to noon and afternoon periods, indicating stressful climatic conditions, with respective indices exceeding the threshold limit values (TLVs). For WBGT, strong relationship was observed with TSI (R2-value = 0.918) and DI (R2-value = 0.891) indices, although least association with HI (R2-value = 0.644) and HD (R2-value = 0.566) indices. However, highest association was observed among HI and HD indices (r-value = 0.995; p-value &amp;lt; 0.01). From results, it may be concluded that noon and afternoon time periods could impose excessive heat strain on user’s work capabilities as compared to morning and evening periods, which could cause greater risks of heat-related morbidities and safety threats to workers/users employed, with consequent negative impacts on productivity and financial burden. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Exploring the synergistic potential of response surface methodology based multi-objective optimization in the performance–emission-stability trade-off envelope of an existing diesel engine
AB  - The present study reveals synergistic possibilities of split-injection techniques under different exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) profiles to meet the emission-performance-stability trade-off from existing diesel engines under the Bharat Stage constraints. The coefficient of variance for indicated mean effective pressure (COVIMEP) and Exergy efficiency was selected as engine stability and performance indicators. At the same time, emission responses are marked by nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon-particulate matter (NHC-PM) profile. The study undertook a comprehensive design-of-experiment (DoE) effort to identify operational limitations and subsequently determine the parametric design space. Trade-off zones have been optimized by meta-model-based objective function formation and desirability maximization approach. It seeks to find a robust optimization by reducing the level of uncertainty and standard errors of estimation during model generation based on the DoE selection and response surface methodology (RSM) approach. The study attempts to create a niche in the archetypical DoE-RSM-based engine response calibration endeavors by invoking several robustness fitness metrics. From the pilot experimental results, EGR has shown its potential as a reducing agent of NHC emission. Whereas in the case of split injecting strategies, the NHC-PM-exergy trade-off can be observed. The response parameters subsequent to the best Pareto solution corresponding to the highest desirability obtained from the optimization study were registered 5.2 g/kW-hr of NOx, 0.9 g/kW-hr of Soot, 23% of Exergy efficiency with the COVIMEP of 4.9. Optimum predicted sets obtained from optimization strategies have been compared with the respective pilot experimentation and concluded that the multifactor at a time (MFAT) strategy through RSM showed a significantly better result than the one factor at a time (OFAT) strategy.

TI  - Respiration rates of herring larvae at different salinities, and effects of previous environmental history
VL  - 650
SP  - 141-152
AB  - Metabolic rates of early life history stages of marine fishes show considerable inter-individual differences, and are highly influenced by extrinsic factors like temperature or food availability. Measuring oxygen uptake rates is a proxy for estimating metabolic rates. Still, the relationship between respiration rates and ambient or previous salinity conditions as well as parental and developmental acclimation to changes in salinity remains largely unexplored. In the present study, we conducted experiments to investigate the effects of salinity on the routine metabolic rates (RMR) of euryhaline Atlantic herring Clupea harengus larvae at 3 levels of salinity: low (6 psu), intermediate (16 psu) and high (35 psu), reflecting ecologically relevant conditions for herring populations in the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea. The larvae originated from different genetic backgrounds and salinity adaptations to account for cross-generation effects on metabolic rates. Closed respirometry carried out over 24 h on individual fish larvae generally confirmed near isometric respiration rates at all salinity regimes, with rates being 15.4% higher at 6 psu and 7.5% higher at 35 psu compared to 16 psu conditions. However, transgenerational acclimation to different salinity regimes of the parents had no effect on the salinity-specific metabolic rates of their offspring. Our study demonstrates the ability of herring to cope with a wide range of salinity conditions, irrespective of parental environmental history and genetic origin. This phenotypic plasticity is considered to be one of the main contributing factors to the success of herring as a widely distributed fish species in the North Atlantic and adjacent waters. © Inter-Research 2020

TI  - Last-mile distribution planning for fruit-and-vegetable cold chains
VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 862-886
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to formulate and solve a last-mile distribution plan problem with concern for the quality of fruits and vegetables in cold chains. Design/methodology/approach: The vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW) is extended based on the characteristics of fruit-and-vegetable cold chains. The properties of multiple perishable foods, continuing decline in quality, various requirements for quality levels and optimal temperature settings during vehicle transportation are considered in the VRPTW. The product quality level is defined by the estimation of residual shelf life, which changes with temperature, and is characterized by a stepped decrease during the transportation process as time goes on. A genetic algorithm (GA) is adapted to solve the problem because of its convincing ability to solve VRPTW-related problems. For this purpose, solution encoding, a fitness function and evolution operators are designed to deal with the complicated problem herein. Findings: A distribution plan including required fleet size, vehicle routing sequence and what quality level should be shipped out to account for the quality degradation during vehicle transportation is generated. The results indicate that the fulfillment of various requirements of different customers for various fruits and vegetables and quality levels can be ensured with cost considerations. Originality/value: This study presents a problem for last-mile delivery of fresh fruits and vegetables which considers multiple practical scenarios not studied previously. A solution algorithm based on a GA is developed to address this problem. The proposed model is easily applied to other types of perishable products. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Adsorbent Characteristic Regulation and Performance Optimization for Pressure Swing Adsorption via Temperature Elevation
VL  - 33
IS  - 3
SP  - 1767-1773
AB  - Physical adsorbents are conventionally supposed to work at a normal temperature (298 K). However, elevating the working temperature can also restrain the adsorption of effective gas and may improve the adsorbent performance. Temperature variation is demonstrated to be a way to regulate the adsorbent performance. In this study, a coal-based activated carbon was synthesized and characterized. The CO2 and H2 adsorption capacities are inversely associated with the adsorption temperature, and a larger adsorption heat does not mean a higher adsorption capacity. Although the CO2 adsorption capacity is much higher than that of H2, sometimes the H2 adsorption capacity is more sensitive to the temperature. The adsorption selectivity for CO2 over H2 improves when the temperature rises from 298 to 353 K. A four-bed pressure swing adsorption (PSA) model was developed on the basis of an on-site pilot-scale PSA apparatus to determine the practical separation performance of adsorbents under different working conditions. The simulation results showed that, when the product gas purity is the same, the recovery rate at 353 K is approximately 2% higher than that at 298 K, indicating that the improvement in adsorption selectivity can make up for the declining adsorption capacity. More importantly, the improvement in gas recovery implies a higher energy efficiency or higher productivity. This phenomenon also exists in some other adsorbents reported before, including chemical adsorbents and composite adsorbents. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.

TI  - De novo transcriptome analysis of differentially expressed genes in the liver of pampus argenteus under temperature stress
VL  - 53
IS  - 9
SP  - 1156-1161
AB  - Pampus argenteus is an aquatic cold-blooded animal, and its growth and survival are greatly affected by ambient temperature. During aquaculture, a sudden change in water temperature may be caused by climate change or other human factors, resulting in acute temperature stress. In this study, de novo transcriptome sequencing technology was used to analyze changes in the gene expressions in the liver of P. argenteus under temperature stress to understand the mechanisms of temperature regulation in P. argenteus. The results showed that 72447398, 69534310, 63698204, 78876728 and 53969050 clean reads were obtained from four cDNA libraries (A: 27°C (control group), B: 22°C and 6 h, C: 32°C and 6 h, D: 22°C and 12 h, E: 32°C and 12 h) of the P. argenteus by Illumina sequencing technology. In A\B, A\C, A\D and A\E pairwise comparison, 353, 431, 1303 and 343 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, respectively. Of these genes, 67 genes were identified among all the pairwise comparisons as the common DEGs. Four genes related to metabolic adaption to temperature were randomly selected to validate the DEGs results by real time PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated some vital genes and pathways associated with metabolism in response to temperature challenge. These results will help us to understand the molecular mechanism underlying temperature regulation in P. argenteus and provide a theoretical basis for the study of related molecular mechanisms in fish under temperature stress. © 2019 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

TI  - Evidence for Cogradient Growth and Survival Between Two Geographically Distinct Stocks of Muskellunge
VL  - 38
IS  - 4
SP  - 922-929
AB  - Intraspecific genetic variation across the distribution of Muskellunge Esox masquinongy suggests the existence of divergent stocks among major river drainages. Often, stocks differentiate in response to latitudinal variation in thermal regime. Genetic variation and thermal adaptation may drive fish to either maximize growth during brief growing seasons at higher latitudes (counter-gradient growth) or experience longer periods of slower growth at lower latitudes (cogradient growth). The strength and direction of these genetic effects matter for fish stocked outside of their native drainage and for populations experiencing changes to regional thermal regimes. We used a replicated pond experiment with uniform initial fish size and environmental conditions to compare the survival and growth of stocked age-0 Ohio River drainage (OH) Muskellunge with those of the more northerly upper Mississippi River drainage (MISS) stock following their first winter and a year after introduction into a common environment. Both stocks had similarly high winter survival, though the MISS stock had a slower growth rate overwinter than the OH stock. Survival during the latter spring-to-fall period was greatly reduced for the MISS stock, however, with the differences in growth rate persisting. These findings suggest that cogradient adaptation to temperatures experienced during early life stages in native environments results in a disadvantage for high-latitude stocks of Muskellunge in thermal regimes warmer than those they have historically experienced in their native drainages. © 2018 American Fisheries Society

TI  - Hepatic Gene Expression Profiling of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua) Liver after Exposure to Organophosphate Flame Retardants Revealed Altered Cholesterol Biosynthesis and Lipid Metabolism
VL  - 40
IS  - 6
SP  - 1639-1648
AB  - Since the phasing out and eventual ban on the production of organohalogen flame retardants, the use of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has increased rapidly. This has led to the detection of OPFRs in various environments including the Arctic. Two of the most prevalent OPFRs found in the Arctic are tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP). The impacts of exposure to OPFRs on Arctic organisms is poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of exposure to TCPP, EHDPP, and a mixture of OPFRs on gene expression patterns in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Precision-cut liver slices from Atlantic cod in vitro were exposed to either TCPP or EHDPP alone or in a mixture and sampled at 2 different time points to quantify gene expression patterns using RNA sequencing. We exposed the liver slices to 2 concentrations of TCPP and EHDPP, one of which was chosen based on the levels found in the Arctic environment. The RNA sequencing results demonstrated differential expression of hundreds of genes in response to exposure. The genes representing cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism pathway were significantly enriched in all the treatment groups. Almost all the cholesterol biosynthesis genes were significantly down-regulated in response to OPFR exposure. The effects on these pathways could involve various physiological processes including reproduction, growth, and behavior as well as adaptation to changing temperatures. Membrane fluidity is an important adaptive mechanism among aquatic organisms. Altered cholesterol homeostasis could have long-term consequences by altering the adaptive potential of aquatic organisms to changing water temperatures, particularly those living in polar environments. These results suggest that OPFRs could have unique effects on the organisms living in the Arctic compared with other environments. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts of exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations using laboratory and field-based studies.

TI  - Selective behavioral response of Trichoplax (Placozoa) to RGB-light stimuli
VL  - 101
IS  - 1
SP  - 6-13
AB  - Introduction. The marine animal Trichoplax (Placozoa), which has the animalcular organization among invertebrates, but with outstanding social behaviour and specific movement of the body and its cells, is a model animal for studying various biophysical and chemical processes, including responses to external stimuli. In the articles of specialists from many universities, the problem of Trichoplax phototaxis (Placozoa) is covered in a hypothetical and declarative form. However, there are no specific studies on the behavioural response of these protozoa and their cells to monochrome light signals with different wavelengths that are characteristic of its light habitat at a depth of 5 to 20 meters. Materials and methods. The studies were conducted on laboratory animals Trichoplax sp. H2. Studies of the behavioural response of Trichoplax were performed using modern methods of optical microscopy: Nikon Eclipse Ts2R-Fl Optical Microscope; optical microscopes: Nikon SMZ-1270, Stemi 305; An optical microscope “Leonardo 3.0“(specially designed for the project) allows simultaneously observing the behaviour of a group of Trichoplax and each Trichoplax of this group at a low level of illumination and a stable temperature of its aquatic habitat. Two web cameras were used in the microscope-the upper one with a 1.9 Mp matrix and the lower one - 5 Mp). Results. The theoretical analysis of the spectral composition of light and the degree of its polarization in the marine habitat of the protozoan multicellular animal Trichoplax (Placozoa) and the features of its gene-cell structure is carried out. Based on the laws of hydrooptics and the survival strategy (“food-prey”), the coordinate axes of the light-medium for Trichoplax are determined (the light vertical (395 nm) and two horizontal light axes - the reflected horizontal light from the food (green - 532 nm) and the fluorescent light coming from the aragonite shell of the predator mollusc (red - 630 nm). Based on the animal's responses to these RGB light stimuli, the hypothesis of RGB phototaxis in Trichoplax and the kinesis of its cells was expressed and confirmed. The monochrome light signals red - 630 nm, green - 532 nm and blue - 395 nm are selected for Trichoplax control. Limitations of the study. In the study of Trichoplax (Placozoa), the behavioural response of this animal and its cells to monochrome light signals with different wavelengths was studied using modern optical microscopy methods, which make it possible to simultaneously observe the behaviour of both the Trichoplax group and each animal of this group at a low level of illumination and stable temperature of its aquatic environment. Conclusion. For the first time, the behaviour of Trichoplax and its cells was controlled using light signals, and the presence of RGB phototaxis and kinesis in its cells was also proved in Trichoplax. The discovery of the RGB-taxis Trichoplax (Placozoa) changed the established scientific ideas in the evolution of colour vision in animals Trichoplax (Placozoa) and the human visual analyzer functioning of its pineal gland. The presented method can be used in hygienic studies of the influence of external pollutants on the environment and the effect of light on the human pineal gland. © 2022 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

AB  - Introduced European genotypes of Phragmites australis are invasive and widespread in North America. Decades of management using herbicide and other means have failed to control the species and its range and populations continue to expand. Allowing continued invasion threatens native wetland biota and an endemic North American subspecies Phragmites australis americanus. The lack of conventional management to control introduced P. australis triggered research to assess host specificity of two European noctuid moths, Archanara geminipuncta and Archanara neurica. These two species are considered particularly promising potential biocontrol agents for introduced P. australis. Here we provide the complete and approved list of test plants used to assess host specificity of A. geminipuncta and A. neurica. This includes data on neonate larval acceptance and survival under no-choice conditions, and oviposition tests for all plant species tested, including for different Phragmites subspecies currently occurring in North America. We further provide temperature profiles of select cities in the temperate native European distribution of the two noctuids and those in southern US climates. We used these long-term temperature records to assess whether overwintering eggs of A. geminipuncta and A. neurica can survive under climate conditions typical for the Gulf Coast region in North America.

TI  - Life History of the Gray Snapper at the Warm Edge of Its Distribution Range in the Caribbean
VL  - 11

SP  - 315-327
AB  - Knowledge of the life history of populations at the warm edge of their distributional range can provide a better understanding of how they will adapt to climate warming, including potential poleward redistribution. The range of Gray Snapper Lutjanus griseus has the potential to expand along its northern temperate fringe, but little is known about this species in the warmest portion of its range. We studied the age, growth, reproduction, and mortality of commercially caught Gray Snapper in the Guatemalan Caribbean, where sea surface temperature consistently exceeds 26°C. Longevity was estimated as 10 years, and von Bertalanffy growth parameters that were consolidated through Bayesian estimation incorporating earlier estimates from the Caribbean region were as follows: asymptotic length (L∞) was 35 cm, the growth coefficient (K) was 0.56 year−1, and the theoretical age at zero length (t0) was −0.7 year. Gray Snapper grew slowest in April, prior to the rainy season, and at the onset of the reproductive season, which lasted to September. Fifty percent of the Gray Snapper matured at 31 cm and at 3.5 years of age. Gray Snapper had a lower maximum size, longevity, and peak reproductive investment, a protracted spawning season and reproductive life span, and elevated natural mortality at the warm edge of their distribution relative to temperate climates. Despite the plasticity in life history of Gray Snapper observed in this study, their potential to further adapt to warming remains unknown. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) is considered to be a very hazardous and difficult to handle component of mineral fertilizers. Differential thermal analysis coupled with thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry was used to determine the possible inhibiting effect of selected magnesium compounds on thermal decomposition of AN. Each additive was mixed with AN to create samples with AN:magnesium compound mass ratios of 4:1, 9:1 and 49:1. Most of analyzed compounds enhanced thermal stability of ammonium nitrate, increasing the temperature of the beginning of exothermic decomposition and decreasing the amount of generated heat. Magnesium chloride hexahydrate was determined to accelerate the decomposition of AN while magnesium sulphate, sulphate heptahydrate, nitrate hexahydrate together with magnesite and dolomite minerals were defined as inhibiting agents. © 2020 Józef Hoffmann et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Ocean warming is causing declines of coral reefs globally, raising critical questions about the potential for corals to adapt. In the central equatorial Pacific, reefs persisting through recurrent El Niño heatwaves hold important clues. Using an 18-year record of coral cover spanning three major bleaching events, we show that the impact of thermal stress on coral mortality within the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) has lessened over time. Disproportionate survival of extreme thermal stress during the 2009–2010 and 2015–2016 heatwaves, relative to that in 2002–2003, suggests that selective mortality through successive heatwaves may help shape coral community responses to future warming. Identifying and facilitating the conditions under which coral survival and recovery can keep pace with rates of warming are essential first steps toward successful stewardship of coral reefs under 21st century climate change. © 2021.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA content in eggs as a maternal effect
VL  - 289
IS  - 1967
AB  - The transmission of detrimental mutations in animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the next generation is avoided by a high level of mtDNA content in mature oocytes. Thus, this maternal genetic material has the potential to mediate adaptive maternal effects if mothers change mtDNA level in oocytes in response to their environment or body condition. Here, we show that increased mtDNA abundance in mature oocytes was associated with fast somatic growth during early development but at the cost of increased mortality in three-spined sticklebacks. We also examined whether oocyte mtDNA and sperm DNA damage levels have interacting effects because they can determine the integrity of mitochondrial and nuclear genes in offspring. The level of oxidative DNA damage in sperm negatively affected fertility, but there was no interacting effect of oocyte mtDNA abundance and sperm DNA damage. Oocyte mtDNA level increased towards the end of the breeding season, and the females exposed to warmer temperatures during winter produced eggs with increased mtDNA copies. Our results suggest that oocyte mtDNA level can vary according to the expected energy demands for offspring during embryogenesis and early growth. Thus, mothers can affect offspring development and viability through the context-dependent effects of oocyte mtDNA abundance. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Symbiodinium IN CORAL REEFS AND ITS ADAPTATION RESPONSES TOWARD CORAL BLEACHING EVENTS: A REVIEW
VL  - 51
IS  - 3
SP  - 1-15
AB  - Symbiodinium is a category of symbiotic dinoflagellates commonly associated with various reef-building corals. Detrimental impacts of global climate change worsen the mutualistic association of coral-Symbiodinium, endangering the reefs to the bleaching and mass mortality phenomenon. Destruction of coral reef ecosystems has adverse effects not only on marine life but also on the human population. It has been proposed that to protect the coral reefs, an exclusive selection of thermal-tolerance traits in Symbiodinium will increase the survivability of coral reefs. However, there are still limited findings on the coral-endosymbiont resistance under adverse environments. Thus, this review aims to introduce shortly the coral reefs, Symbiodinium, and coral bleaching events, as well as to provide brief reviews of cellular and molecular responses in Symbiodinium to tackle thermal stress. Considering the potential applications of this knowledge to confront the threat of coral bleaching prevalence, more study especially in terms of cellular and molecular responses by omics approaches is needed to enhance the understanding of coral-Symbiodinium tolerance toward climate change, particularly heat stress. © 2022, Malaysian Society of Applied Biology.

TI  - Migratory locust habitat analysis with PB-AHP model using time-series satellite images
VL  - 8
SP  - 166813-166823
AB  - The outbreak of Oriental Migratory Locust(Locusta migratoria manilensis) causes devastating disasters to agriculture. With the impact of climate changes and human activities, the distribution of locust habitat (locust habitat is the environment in which locusts live and survive) in China is constantly changing. Monitoring and extracting locust habitat are of great significance for guiding large-scale agricultural production. The occurrence of the locust is closely related to their habitat. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of habitat factors that affect locust survival is carried out to monitor locust habitat distribution. Besides, the landscape structure also affects distribution. This study explored a model for analyzing multitemporal Landsat and MODIS images, which combined multiple habitat factors and landscape structure to analyze locust habitat. The locust habitat near North Dagang Reservoir in Tianjin is the research object. First, the habitat factors that affect locust oviposition and growth were analyzed, and vegetation coverage, land cover class, soil moisture, soil salinity, and land surface temperature were selected as five habitat factors. The weights of five habitat factors were evaluated according to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. Then, considering the impact of landscape structure on locust habitat, a moving-window was used to correlate locust habitat factors at pixel scale with locust habitat at patch scale. Finally, the distribution map of the locust habitat at patch scale was generated. The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) was used to compare and test the results. Our research shows that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) can monitor locust habitat. The overall accuracy reached 88%, which is 10% higher than the result based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP). These results show that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) model has strong robustness and generalization ability in identifying locust habitat and can provide scientific guidance for locust monitoring and control. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

VL  - 14

AB  - Local adaptation is important when predicting arthropod-borne disease risk because of its impacts on vector population fitness and persistence. However, the extent that vector populations are adapted to the environment generally remains unknown. Despite low population structure and high gene flow in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes across Panama, excepting the province of Bocas del Toro, we identified 128 candidate SNPs, clustered within 17 genes, which show a strong genomic signal of local environmental adaptation. This putatively adaptive variation occurred across fine geographical scales with the composition and frequency of candidate adaptive loci differing between populations in wet tropical environments along the Caribbean coast and dry tropical conditions typical of the Pacific coast. Temperature and vegetation were important predictors of adaptive genomic variation in Ae. aegypti with several potential areas of local adaptation identified. Our study lays the foundations of future work to understand whether environmental adaptation in Ae. aegypti impacts the arboviral disease landscape and whether this could either aid or hinder efforts of population control. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Heat stress, labour productivity and adaptation in Europe - A regional and occupational analysis
VL  - 16
IS  - 10
AB  - Labour exposure to heat stress driven by climate change will increase significantly with the rising global temperatures. Under heat stress, workers have to reduce work intensity and take longer breaks from work to prevent occupational illness and injuries. This study explores how the global warming and the resulting increase in heat stress can directly affect productivity of workers and indirectly impact upon the broader economy. Occupational statistics for 269 European regions are combined with daily heat stress indicator derived from a set of high-resolution climate scenarios. The novel approach, enabled by using a set of published exposure-response functions, assesses workers productivity losses differentiated by occupations. A macro econometric model of the European economy is then used to asses implications of change in productivity in monetary terms. The study finds that, compared to nowadays, productivity of labour can be 1.6% lower in Europe in 2080s, with a clear geographical gradient showing that southern and eastern regions are much more affected (e.g. up to 5.4% productivity loss in Greece). Furthermore, regions where the dominant occupations have relative lower earnings would also experience higher productivity loses. The analysis also focuses on the potential role of adaptation to reduce the productivity and economic losses, via air conditioning and a preliminary assessment of the potential of wearable robotics, which can reduce damages by 30%-40%. © 2021 The Author(s).

VL  - 37

SP  - 2361-2371
AB  - Freshwater organisms are increasingly exposed to combinations of stressors. However, because it is time-consuming and costly, research on the interaction of stressors, such as compound toxicity and global warming on vertebrates, is scarce. Studies on multigenerational effects of these combined stressors are almost nonexistent. In the present study, we tested the combined effects of 4 °C warming and cadmium (Cd) exposure on life-history traits, biomarkers, bioaccumulation, and multigenerational tolerance in the turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri. The extremely short life cycle of this vertebrate model allows for assessment of sublethal and multigenerational effects within 4 mo. The applied Cd concentrations had only limited effects on the measured endpoints, which suggests that N. furzeri is more resistant to Cd than fathead minnow and rainbow trout. In contrast, the temperature increase of 4 °C was stressful: it delayed female maturation and lowered adult mass and fecundity. Finally, indications of synergistic effects were found on peak fecundity and embryonic survival. Overall, these results indicate the importance of studying chronic and multigenerational effects of combined stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2361–2371. © 2018 SETAC. © 2018 SETAC

TI  - Limited evidence for local adaptation to salinity and temperature variability in San Juan Island populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker)
VL  - 554
AB  - Local adaptation has been studied in a broad range of taxa for decades. However, we have limited understanding of how often it occurs in variable environments. Whether phenotypic plasticity can evolve in distinct ways among populations experiencing different patterns of abiotic variability is unclear. Abiotic conditions in coastal marine habitats can be highly heterogeneous at small spatial scales, which might promote local adaptation. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912) has become a model system for testing whether phenotypic differences among populations are a result of local adaptation. To identify potential selective pressures in the field, temperature and salinity were measured in high shore pools for six months at three sites on San Juan Island in Washington, USA. A common garden experiment with factorial combinations of seven temperature and two salinity (32, 55 ppt) treatments was conducted on these distinct populations. Two temperature treatments varied daily, both with an average of 20 °C, but different ranges (low amplitude: 15–25 °C, high amplitude: 10–30 °C). The other five treatments were the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures held constant. Fecundity, survivorship, and development were characterized across two generations. There were strong interactive effects of temperature and hypersalinity on copepod culture dynamics, but these effects differed among populations. Abiotic patterns in the field were correlated with few observed differences in population phenotypes, thus limited evidence for local adaptation was found. For these populations, differences in selective pressures among sites might not be strong enough to overcome the influence of genetic drift. © 2022

VL  - 54
IS  - 1
SP  - 117-127
AB  - The perceived temperature has been changing rapidly under global warming, and its related extremes have significant impacts on labor productivity and human health. Although numerous thermal indices have been developed to quantify the perceived temperature, impact assessments have not been conducted comprehensively. The lack of exploring the nonlinearity and linearity inherent in thermal indices will lead to biased conclusions. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of 161 indices to create an ensemble of selected thermal indices that represent the linear and nonlinear relationships of climatic conditions and quantify the changes in the perceived temperature and related extremes. Here we find that the increase in the mean perceived temperature can be strongly exaggerated by using nonlinear indices or linear indices that only consider the combined effect of high temperature and humidity. Wind speed incorporated into the schemes of linear indices can largely offset the increase in the perceived temperature induced by the high relative humidity. These two divergent changes can be further enhanced in future exposure to heat stress. Furthermore, our findings reveal an amplification of heatwave durations induced by the combined effects of multiple variables for all thermal indices. Such an amplification leads to a cascade of relatively short-duration heatwaves evolving into super long-lasting heatwaves which are particularly pronounced over low-latitude areas. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - CPO Complete, a novel test for fast, accurate phenotypic detection and classification of carbapenemases
VL  - 14
IS  - 12
AB  - Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are Gram-negative bacteria that are typically resistant to most or all antibiotics and are responsible for a global pandemic of high mortality. Rapid, accurate detection of CPOs and the classification of their carbapenemases are valuable tools for reducing the mortality of the CPO-associated infections, preventing the spread of CPOs, and optimizing use of new β-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem/relebactam. The current study evaluated the performance of CPO Complete, a novel, manual, phenotypic carbapenemase detection and classification test. The test was evaluated for sensitivity and specificity against 262 CPO isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii and 67 non-CPO isolates. It was also evaluated for carbapenemase classification accuracy against 205 CPOs that produced a single carbapenemase class. The test exhibited 100% sensitivity 98.5% specificity for carbapenemase detection within 90 minutes and detected 74.1% of carbapenemases within 10 minutes. In the classification evaluation, 99.0% of carbapenemases were correctly classified for isolates that produced a single carbapenemase. The test is technically simple and has potential for adaptation to automated instruments. With lyophilized kit storage at temperatures up to 38oC, the CPO Complete test has the potential to provide rapid, accurate carbapenemase detection and classification in both limited resource and technologically advanced laboratories. © 2019 Thomson et al.

TI  - Examining the effects of chronic, lake-wide elevated temperatures on behavioural expression in largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides
VL  - 97
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-50
AB  - Many behaviours have differential fitness consequences across thermal and ecological contexts, indicating that both ecological shifts and warming temperatures induced by climatic change may alter how organisms behave. However, empirical evidence of temperature-driven behavioural selection in natural systems is lacking. We compared behaviours and behavioural syndromes related to activity, exploration, boldness and aggression in populations of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from ambient lakes to the those from artificially warmed, power plant cooling lakes to investigate changes in behaviours associated with warmer environments. Activity, exploration, boldness and aggression of juvenile largemouth bass were assessed in laboratory conditions using a novel environment assay and a risky situation assay. We found that activity and exploratory behaviours were higher and decreased through first year ontogeny in populations from heated lakes, whereas these behaviours were lower and showed no relationship through ontogeny in populations from ambient lakes. We attribute these differences to the changes in food source availability in heated lakes associated with temperature-driven ecological effects. Bold and aggressive behaviours tended to differ between populations, as did correlations between behaviours, but did not differ between ambient and heated lakes. The findings of this work identify that large ecological changes associated with warming environments, such as food availability, may drive changes in some aspects of behavioural expression in largemouth bass but that other aspects of behavioural expression may be driven by lake-specific factors not related to warming. © 2020 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB  - SLM process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, layer thickness and hatch spacing play a crucial role in the quality of the processed product. In order to find the parameters suitable for SLM process, a finite element model was established to simulate the distribution of temperature field of selective laser melting (SLM) stainless steel 316L (SS316L) parts. After finite element simulation, the optimum factor levels for SLM processing SS316L were as follows: laser power of 100–200 W, scanning speed of 500–1500 mm/s, hatch spacing of 0.04–0.12 mm, and layer thickness of 0.03–0.06 mm. Then, based on a series of experiments, different laser energy densities were divided into three regions corresponding to three melting mechanisms: the partial melting zone (37.88–75.76 J/mm3), the full melting zone (75.76–151.52 J/mm3), and the over-melting zone (larger than 151.52 J/mm3). The surface roughness, density, microstructure and mechanical properties of the SLM SS316L were strongly dependent on the laser energy density. The results showed that an excellent SS316L part with a relative density higher than 99.66% and good mechanical properties could be obtained at a laser energy density of 119.05 J/mm3 with a laser powder of 200 W, a scanning speed of 700 mm/s, a hatch spacing of 0.08 mm and a layer thickness of 0.03 mm. © 2020, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.

TI  - Long-term increase in growth of an estuarine predator, mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus, predicted to continue under future warming scenarios
VL  - 688
SP  - 1-17
AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on fish biology and ecology is crucial for effective management of fisheries resources. Estuaries are warming at a faster rate than nearby oceans in south-eastern Australia, yet there is little understanding of how this may impact the growth of estuarine fish. We examined long-term changes and drivers of growth in an ecologically and economically important estuarine fish in this region, the mulloway Argyrosomus japonicus, using a growth chronology spanning 39 yr (1980−2018). The chronology was developed using 3112 otoliths collected over 12° of latitude. Mixed effects models identified a long-term increase in the growth rate of A. japonicus spanning nearly 3 decades in south-eastern Australia and a positive growth response to temperature. Temperature during the months of November−February best explained this growth response, likely representing a specific growing season for the species. However, there also remained some variation in growth not explained by increasing temperature over the period. We also found evidence of faster growth in individuals sampled at both younger and older ages, potentially caused by selectivity mechanisms. Regional climate forecasts predict that, based upon the observed response to temperature, the mean annual growth rate of A. japonicus in south-eastern Australia may increase by up to 8.9% by 2099. These results add to the growing body of literature demonstrating positive growth responses by marine species in warming environments and highlight the value of understanding the drivers of long-term growth variation in exploited fish stocks in order to predict future productivity under a range of environmental and fisheries management scenarios. © The authors 2022.

TI  - Microporous carbon derived from cotton stalk crop-residue across diverse geographical locations as efficient and regenerable CO2 adsorbent with selectivity
VL  - 60
AB  - Six porous carbons (PCs) were prepared via thermochemical methodology from cotton-stalk crop residue, collected from diverse geographical locations in India. Although similar in nature, the precursor collection sites majorly influenced the properties of the generated PCs, possibly due to variations in soil characteristics and fertilizer usage patterns. The microstructures were characterized by a series of analytical data, including FT-IR and Raman Spectra, XRD, TGA, SEM imaging, and in-depth XPS studies. Nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K of all PCs revealed well-defined microporosity and high specific surface area, varying from 1706 to 2438 m2/g under similar synthetic conditions. Further, gaseous CO2 adsorption studies showed that the PCs exhibited diverse uptake performances at 1 bar under varied temperatures. The maximum uptake capacity of 6.23 mmol/g (273 K), 3.85 mmol/g (298 K), and 3.28 mmol/g (313 K) defined superior values over contemporary adsorbents. A critical-point drying technique was employed further to enhance the CO2 uptake capacity of these carbons. Importantly, all the carbons revealed moderate to good CO2/N2 separation selectivity at low temperature (~25 at 273 K) that experienced a unique enhancement under elevated temperature, as calculated from ideal adsorbed solution theory. After vacuum regeneration, the activated carbons exhibited stable CO2 adsorption up to five cycles, validating their potential reusability for CO2 capture. Precisely, the cotton stalk crop residue-derived PCs represent one-of-a-kind low cost, eco-friendly, abundant, and scalable absorbents for regenerable CO2 capture with moderate heat of adsorption and selectivity values, with promises of practical usability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Detection of shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus by recombinase polymerase amplification assay
VL  - 49
AB  - Shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV), which was first identified in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in China in 2014, can cause extensive shrimp mortality and major economic losses in the shrimp farming industry in China. In this study, a novel real-time isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was developed using a TwistAmp exo kit for SHIV detection. First, five primers and a probe were designed for the major capsid protein gene (GenBank: KY681039.1) according to the TwistDx manual; next, the optimal primers were selected by a comparison experiment. The primers and probe were specific for SHIV and did not react with shrimp white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), shrimp infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), shrimp enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), and macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) samples, as well as pathogens of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). The RPA assay reached a detection limit of 11 copies per reaction according to probit regression analysis. In addition, RPA assay detected the positive plasmid samples at concentration of 1000 copies/μL within 16.04 ± 0.72 min at a single low operation temperature (39 °C). The results proved that the proposed RPA method was an accurate, sensitive, affordable, and rapid detection tool that can be suitably applied for the diagnosis of SHIV in field conditions and in resource-poor settings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Asexual reproduction in bad times? The case of Cladocora caespitosa in the eastern Mediterranean Sea
VL  - 40
IS  - 2
SP  - 663-677
AB  - We analysed the patterns of genetic variability of eastern Mediterranean populations of the scleractinian coral Cladocora caespitosa, from the Aegean and Levantine seas, using 19 polymorphic microsatellite loci, 11 of which were newly characterized. The observed genetic pattern reflects a scenario of isolation by environment: FST comparisons showed a higher degree of genetic differentiation between the two Cypriot populations that are separated by only 11 km than between these two Levantine populations and the Aegean population in Greece, which are separated by 1300 km. We hypothesize that local-scale oceanographic factors influenced the dispersal of planulae between the geographically close populations, playing a crucial role in the genetic structure of this coastal coral. Yet, despite being characterized as a species with limited dispersal and high self-recruitment, large-scale migration does eventually occur as first-generation migrants were identified between the most distant populations. In line with previous findings of reproductive plasticity in C. caespitosa, we also found localized differences in reproduction mode (sexual vs. asexual) within a geographically limited context. Several individuals were identified as clones, indicating the predominance of asexual reproduction in one of the Cypriot populations. We interpret this predominance either as a direct response to or as an indirect consequence of perturbations suffered by this C. caespitosa population. These perturbations are caused by unfavourable environmental conditions that threatened local survival, in particular water temperature changes and windstorm swells. Asexual reproduction may be a mechanism used by C. caespitosa to counteract mortality events and recolonize devastated areas, and likely accounts for the occasional high levels of clonality and low levels of genetic diversity. Local adaptations such as these should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies to maintain and preserve the gene pool of this endangered species. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Non-cropping period accounting for over a half of annual nitric oxide releases from cultivated calcareous-soil alpine ecosystems with marginally low emission factors
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 338-344
AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) emissions from alpine ecosystems conventionally being long-term cultivated with feed crops are not well quantified. The authors attempted to address this knowledge gap by performing a year-round experimental campaign in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Fertilized (F) and unfertilized (UF) treatments were established within a flat calcareous-soil site for the long-term cultivation of feed oats. NO fluxes and five soil variables were simultaneously measured. A single plow tillage accounted for approximately 54%–73% of the NO releases during the cropping period (CP); and the non-cropping period (NCP) contributed to 51%–58% of the annual emissions. The direct NO emissions factor (EFd) was 0.021% ± 0.021%. Significantly lower Q10 values (p &lt; 0.01) occurred in the F treatment during the CP (approximately 3.6) compared to those during the other period or in the other treatment (approximately 4.9−5.1), indicating a fertilizer-induced reduction in the temperature sensitivity. The selected soil variables jointly accounted for up to 72% (p &lt; 0.01) of the variance for all the fluxes across both treatments. This finding suggests that temporally and/or spatially distributed fluxes from alpine calcareous-soil ecosystems for feed crop production may be easily predicted if data on these soil variables are available. Further studies are needed to test the hypothesis that the EFd is larger in alpine feed-oat fields than those in this study if the soil moisture content is higher during the period following the basal application of ammonium- or urea-based fertilizer. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The Texas fatmucket, Lampsilis bracteata, is a unionid mussel endemic to the Colorado and upper Guadalupe River basins of Central Texas and a candidate for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act. There is increased interest in propagation and population restoration of threatened mussels in Texas as a potential conservation method, but still little is known about their life histories and how local populations may differ in aspects of their reproductive ecology, e.g. timing of brooding and potential local adaptations to host fish. The purpose of this study was to compare host fish compatibilities and seasonality of reproduction between two populations: (a) by cross-infesting fish from the San Saba and Llano Rivers in the Colorado River basin with sympatric and allopatric mussel larvae in the laboratory (hatchery-produced Guadalupe bass and largemouth bass were also infested); and (b) by assessing gamete concentration, brooding period, viability of larvae and sex ratios using monthly sampling events between February 2017 and February 2018. Reproduction varied with season and between populations. The proportion of females brooding tended to be lower in the summer and the autumn, and higher during winter and spring months before peak water temperatures were reached. The sex ratio in both populations did not significantly differ from 1:1. Fecundity and larvae viability were higher in the Llano River population compared with the San Saba population. Trematode flatworms were found in several female gonad samples from the San Saba population and in a few samples from the Llano population. The highest metamorphosis success occurred on wild green sunfish and largemouth bass, and hatchery-produced largemouth and Guadalupe bass. The average metamorphosis success tended to be higher for some mussel–fish pairings originating from the same tributary, suggesting that mussels may be locally adapted to host fish, which should be considered in conservation efforts. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Serum IgM, MH class II beta genotype and respiratory burst activity do not differ between rainbow trout families displaying resistance or susceptibility to the coldwater pathogen, Flavobacterium psychrophilum
VL  - 483
SP  - 131-140
AB  - Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) is a significant threat to global aquaculture. True to its name, BCWD tends to occur at temperatures between 8 and 12 degrees C and presents as a systemic disease with characteristic skin ulcerations. Juvenile rainbow trout are particularly susceptible and in these fish the condition is referred to as rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS). Resistance to F. psychrophilum is heritable and is not adversely correlated with the growth of fish, thus selective breeding appears to be an achievable approach to its control. The current study explores the connection between resistance to BCWD and several immunological markers. After determining resistance/susceptibility to F. psychrophilum following experimental infection in 40 full-sibling families of rainbow trout, selected families were experimentally infected with F. psychrophilum and differences in antibody production, major histocompatibility (MH) class II beta genotype and respiratory burst activity (RBA) throughout infection were compared. Serum IgM production increased over time but significant differences between resistant and susceptible families were not observed at either 28 days or 120 days. Of the six families that were genotyped for MH class II beta, there did not appear to be specific genotypes that conferred resistance or susceptibility to F. psychrophilum. Further, the RBA of both head kidney leukocytes and whole blood was not significantly different between the resistant and susceptible rainbow trout families. Although the selected immune markers did not differ based on resistance status, the RBA of head kidney leukocytes in all families studied dramatically decreased seven days after infection while total blood RBA remained constant. Day seven was also when severe symptoms and/or mortality due to BCWD was first observed, thus these results may reveal information regarding the pathogenesis of the organism. A better understanding of appropriate immune defenses could provide the basis for breeding programs to effectively combat this costly pathogen, but further study of functional immune markers particularly during the fry stage of development is required.

VL  - 47

SP  - 2522-2531
AB  - Barley-double cropping rice rotation is a typical cropping system in the middle reaches of Yangtze River. Based on a 34-year long-term experiment, the effects of combined application of organic materials and chemical fertilizers reduction in barley-double cropping rice rotation system on utilization efficiency of solar radiation, GDD (growing degree days), and water resources, use efficiency of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium resources, and yield of barley were studied. The objective of this study is to provide the theoretical basis and data support for the fertilization management of barley-double cropping rice rotation system with efficient utilization of resources and stable yield and efficiency in barley. In this study, four fertilization treatments in the long-term positioning experiment were selected, including NPK chemical fertilizer treatment (NPK), NPK chemical fertilizer combined with rice straw treatment (NPK+straw), organic fertilizer nitrogen replacement 30% chemical nitrogen treatment (NPK+LOM), and organic fertilizer nitrogen replacement 60% chemical nitrogen treatment (NPK+HOM). To ensure that the N, P2O5 and K2O application rates of the fertilization treatments in the barley season and early rice season and late rice season, each treatment was based on the equal amount of nitrogen, and the insufficient nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers were supplemented with chemical fertilizers. The results were as follows: (1) Compared with NPK + straw treatment, radiation productive efficiency, accumulated heat productive efficiency, water productive efficiency of NPK+HOM treatment were significantly increased by 0.04 g MJ-1, 0.28 kg℃-1 d-1 hm-2, 0.08 kg m-3, and the increase amplitude was 10.5%, 9.4%, and 9.6% (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. (2) Compared with NPK+straw treatment, the partial productivity of N, P, and K in NPK+LOM treatment increased by 22.5%, 23.4%, and 23.5%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), and K harvest index increased by 36.7% (P &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant difference of the NPK nutrient partial productivity and N harvest index between NPK+LOM and NPK+HOM treatments; (3) The analysis of stability and sustainability of barley yield indicated that NPK+straw treatment was beneficial to stable yield in barley; (4) The NPK+HOM treatment could improve soil fertility. On the whole, NPK+HOM treatment was superior to other fertilization structures in terms of the utilization of light and hot water resources and soil fertilization in barley; NPK+LOM treatment was better than other fertilization structures in the utilization of NPK nutrient resource in barley; Both NPK+LOM and NPK+HOM treatments could increase the yield of barley. Regarding the barley-double-cropping rice rotation model, combining straw to the field combined with organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizers to regulate the synergistic improvement of barley resource utilization and yield was one of the important research tasks in the future. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Negative impacts of the sea lice prophylactic emamectin benzoate on the survival of hatchery released salmon smolts in rivers
VL  - 224
AB  - Emamectin benzoate (EB) is a prophylactic pharmaceutical used to protect Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts migrating out of rivers and into the ocean against sea lice parasites. Randomized control trials comparing the marine survival of smolts treated with EB to a control group is used to calculate the fraction of marine mortality attributable to sea lice parasitism. However, it is assumed that there is no baseline difference in survival induced by the application of EB treatment. We used a combined laboratory and field study approach to investigate the potential impacts of EB treatment on behaviour and survival of hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon in western Norway. In aquaria experiments, EB-treated salmon smolts did not differ significantly in exploratory behaviour. Fish from treated groups responded similarly to simulated predator attack with spontaneous escape and elevated gill beat rate. Three rivers in the Osterfjord system of western Norway were selected for field experiments, Dale, Vosso, and Modalen. Dale River smolts were treated with intraperitoneal EB injections and had lower probability of detection in a wolf trap downstream of the release site than control smolts. Salmon smolts raised in the Vosso River hatchery were treated with EB delivered in their food and were detected on PIT antennas at the rivermouth of Vosso and Modalen at lower rates than control fish, but only when released at downstream sites. Calculation of risk ratios suggested that the bias in mortality caused by treatment with EB decreased the estimated survival of treated fish from an expected 18%to 46%, reducing the observable negative impact of sea lice on Atlantic salmon smolts in randomized control trials. The results suggest that estimates of the fraction of mortality attributable to sea lice may be underestimated due to lower baseline survival of treated fish caused by treatment and bring urgent attention towards a potential systematic underestimation of the impacts of sea lice on wild salmon. © 2020

TI  - Spatial and Thermal Ecology of Snapping Turtles (Chelydra serpentina) in a Small, Dystrophic Lake in Central Michigan
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 22-35
AB  - Understanding the interface between spatial and thermal ecology is integral to understanding energy acquisition and the life histories of ectotherms. Snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) occupy a wide range of habitats that vary greatly in their thermal properties. We studied activity, movements, and thermoregulation of C. serpentina in a small, land-locked lake in central Michigan, USA, using radiotelemetry. Consistent with our a priori predictions, turtles were active within core areas along the lake's edge, showed both diurnal and nocturnal activity, and did not make extensive interwetland movements. Turtles left the lake only for nesting or to hibernate in Sphagnum peat or in the banks of a nearby stream. Home range and core area size estimates of C. serpentina were small compared with other previously studied populations, perhaps in part because of the small dimensions of our lake. Contrary to our prediction of a broad Tset (thermoregulatory set-point) range for a large-bodied, habitat generalist turtle, we found a comparatively low and narrow laboratory-determined Tset range (22°C-26°C). Turtle body temperatures (Tb) cycled between May and August and attained maximal values during the evening hours, a pattern that likely results from thermal inertia, the selection of aquatic thermal patches, or both, as Te (operative temperatures) declined. Turtles most effectively maintained Tb within Tset during July and August when thermal conditions were most favorable. Throughout most of the active season the highly aquatic habits of C. serpentina apparently negated the effects of variations in daily weather conditions and their effects on incoming levels of solar radiation on variation in Tb. However, turtles maintained higher average Tb on sunny days compared with overcast days in April and May, the coolest months of the study. Diel Tb cycling ceased during September and October and average Tb declined despite favorable thermal conditions, at least during September, a pattern that could reflect a downward shift in the Tset range. Comparatively, C. serpentina is less effective at thermoregulating than is a small-bodied species at a similar latitude (Chrysemys picta marginata). Apparently, thermal inertia and lack of atmospheric basking proclivities influenced the thermoregulatory precision in our turtles. © 2020 Chelonian Research Foundation.

SP  - 161-182
AB  - Climate models report that the environmental changes resulting from excess CO2 and heat absorption by the ocean already reach many deep-ocean margins, basins, and seas. Decadal monitoring programmes have confirmed significant warming and deoxygenation trends down to the abyss, which combine with CO2-enriched, more corrosive conditions. Although the resolution of current models does not account for the typical mesoscale seafloor heterogeneity, cumulative impacts on biodiversity and productivity hotpots are anticipated. The growing interest in deep-sea resource exploitation has shed light on the lack of knowledge about current climate-driven disturbance and potential cumulative threats at great depth. Assessing the sensitivity of deep-sea ecosystems to temperature increase combined with oxygen and resource decline is emerging as a growing challenge. The natural patchiness of deep-seafloor habitats and associated deep-sea diversity patterns inform about environmental constraints over space, but the temporal dynamics of these systems is not well known. Experimental studies are required to assess the physiological limits and explore the adaptation and acclimation potential of foundation species exposed to various forms of abiotic stress. The case of cold-water corals is particularly illustrative of the potential synergistic effects of climate stressors, including warming, acidification, deoxygation, and reduced food availability. Addressing ecosystem vulnerability also requires dedicated monitoring efforts to identify the current and future drivers of climate-change impacts on deep-sea habitats. United Nations policy objectives for protected high-sea biodiversity and healthy oceans and seas drive the momentum towards better climate-change forecasting over the ocean-depth range and related integrated observing strategies. © Oxford University Press.

VL  - 64

SP  - 391-399
AB  - We examined the overwintering ability of a flightless strain of the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), which is used as a biological control agent for aphids. The flightless strain was established via artificial selection for reduced flight ability and with no exposure to cold temperature (winter) during the selection. To examine the overwintering ability of the flightless strain, the survival rates were compared with those of wild strains under low temperature laboratory conditions and field winter conditions. In the laboratory experiment, survival rates of flightless strain individuals directly transferred to 5 °C were significantly lower than those with low temperature acclimation. Effects of aggregation on the survival rate at 5 °C were not confirmed. No significant differences were detected between the flightless strain and a wild strain originated from Saga, Kyushu, Japan. In the field experiment, winter survival of the flightless strain was significantly lower than the wild strain both in males and females while not significantly different from another wild strain originated from Fukuyama, Honshu (close to the original locality of the flightless strain). These results suggest that the artificial selection for reduced flight ability did not affect the overwintering ability of H. axyridis. © 2019, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).

TI  - How will farmed populations of freshwater fish deal with the extreme climate scenario in 2100? Transcriptional responses of Colossoma macropomum from two Brazilian climate regions
VL  - 89
AB  - Tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1818) is an endemic fish of the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and it is the most economically important native species in Brazil being raised in five climatically distinct regions. In the face of current global warming, environmental variations in farm ponds represent additional challenges that may drive new adaptive regional genetic variations among broodstocks of tambaqui. In an experimental context based on the high-emission scenario of the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, we used two farmed tambaqui populations to test this hypothesis. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis was performed in the liver of juvenile tambaqui from northern (Balbina Experimental Station, Balbina, AM) and southeastern (Brumado Fish Farming, Mogi Mirim, SP) Brazilian regions kept for 30 days in artificial environmental rooms mimicking the current and extreme climate scenarios. Three Illumina MiSeq runs produced close to 120 million 500 bp paired-end reads; 191,139 contigs were assembled with N50 = 1595. 355 genes were differentially expressed for both populations in response to the extreme scenario. After enrichment analysis, each population presented a core set of genes to cope with climate change. Northern fish induced genes related to the cellular response to stress, activation of MAPK activity, response to unfolded protein, protein metabolism and cellular response to DNA damage stimuli. Genes biologically involved in regulating cell proliferation, protein stabilisation and protein ubiquitination for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system were downregulated. Genes associated with biological processes, including the cellular response to stress, MAPK cascade activation, homeostatic processes and positive regulation of immune responses were upregulated in southeastern fish. The downregulated genes were related to cytoskeleton organisation, energy metabolism, and the regulation of transcription and biological rhythms. Our findings reveal the signatures of promising candidate genes involved in the regional plasticity of each population of tambaqui in dealing with upcoming climate changes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rabbani, A, Kargarfard, M, and Twist, C. Reliability and validity of a submaximal warm-up test for monitoring training status in professional soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 32(2): 326–333, 2018—Two studies were conducted to assess the reliability and validity of a submaximal warm-up test (SWT) in professional soccer players. For the reliability study, 12 male players performed an SWT over 3 trials, with 1 week between trials. For the validity study, 14 players of the same team performed an SWT and a 30-15 intermittent fitness test (30-15IFT) 7 days apart. Week-to-week reliability in selected heart rate (HR) responses (exercise heart rate [HRex], heart rate recovery [HRR] expressed as the number of beats recovered within 1 minute [HRR60s], and HRR expressed as the mean HR during 1 minute [HRpost1]) was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and typical error of measurement expressed as coefficient of variation (CV). The relationships between HR measures derived from the SWT and the maximal speed reached at the 30-15IFT (VIFT) were used to assess validity. The range for ICC and CV values was 0.83–0.95 and 1.4–7.0% in all HR measures, respectively, with the HRex as the most reliable HR measure of the SWT. Inverse large (r = 20.50 and 90% confidence limits [CLs] [20.78 to 20.06]) and very large (r = 20.76 and CL, 20.90 to 20.45) relationships were observed between HRex and HRpost1 with VIFT in relative (expressed as the % of maximal HR) measures, respectively. The SWT is a reliable and valid submaximal test to monitor high-intensity intermittent running fitness in professional soccer players. In addition, the test’s short duration (5 minutes) and simplicity mean that it can be used regularly to assess training status in high-level soccer players. © 2017 National Strength and Conditioning Association.

VL  - 61
IS  - 19
AB  - The production of nitrous oxide, N2O, via NH3 oxidation is not on a practical scale due to the lack of a suitable catalyst. Instead, it is produced via thermal decomposition of NH4NO3, rendering N2O too costly and limiting its prospective uses. Herein, we report CeO2-supported Au nanoparticles (2–3 nm) as a highly selective catalyst for low-temperature NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two orders of magnitude higher space–time yield than the state-of-the-art Mn−Bi/α-Al2O3 and remarkable stability over 70 h on stream. The reaction proceeds via a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, with the density of interfacial Auδ+ species and the oxygen storage capacity of CeO2 identified as the key performance descriptors. The latter could be enhanced by cobalt doping, improving the catalytic activity and setting a new benchmark for N2O productivity. These findings establish NH3 oxidation as an efficient process for N2O manufacture and facilitate its broader utilization in selective oxidations. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

TI  - Yield of vegetable amaranth in diverse tanzanian production environments
VL  - 29
IS  - 4
SP  - 516-527
AB  - Amaranth (Amaranthus sp.) is an important leafy vegetable in Africa where most farmers grow unimproved landraces. Information about amaranth genetic diversity and its adaptation to different environments will help breeders develop improved commercial varieties that meet market requirements. The objectives of this study were to investigate the performances of amaranth entries for vegetable yield across locations and seasons, assess the relative contributions of genetic vs. environmental sources of variation to yield, and cluster locations into mega-environments (MEs) to suggest future test sites. Twenty-six diverse entries were evaluated for vegetable yields in replicated trials at five locations in wet-cool and hot-dry seasons in Tanzania. Season explained the highest proportion (52.1%) of the total sum of squares followed by entries (24.9%) and locations (23.0%). Mean yield across the hot-dry season trials (27.7 t.haL1) was 47.3% greater than the mean yield across wet-cool season trials (18.8 t.haL1). Differences among entries in vegetable yield were higher in the hot-dry season than in the wet-cool season, indicating that gain from selection is likely to be greater in the hot-dry season. Most entries performed well in either wet-cool or hot-dry season but a few entries were adapted to both seasons. Two MEs were identified, one characterized by lower altitudes, higher temperatures, and less fertile soils, and a second ME associated with higher altitudes, lower temperatures, and more fertile soils. Each ME may serve as an initial selection site for their respective target environment. Targeting a specific season may give a better chance of finding high-yielding varieties. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

VL  - 36

SP  - 565-570
AB  - Continuous rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration upshots the genesis of cataclysmic planetary problems such as global warming and climate change. Another critical issue which is environmentally challenging is land degradation. When productive land is poorly managed, it turns to marginal land. And further degradation of marginal land ends up to being unproductive land. On the Contrary, considerable part of depleted soil C pool can be restored through the adoption of conservation agricultural practices, unproductive land could be converted to marginal land and by its further restoration, into productive land. Aromatic plants can sustain various adverse conditions prevailing on the marginal lands. Aromatic plants require low input but the output is quite high due to the production of highvalue essential oil. The pivotal perspective of utilization of marginal lands of India for the production of aromatic plants would explore factors such as land availability, aromatic plants adaptability, C sequestration potential and economic feasibility. India is the largest exporter of essential oils and produces huge amount of aromatic spent residues, which could be converted into several valueadded products. Proficient recycle of distillation waste of aromatic plants in marginal lands will aid to sequester C in soil and enhance the biomass yield. Improvement in the livelihood of farmers especially in developing nations through rise in production and income diversification would encourage farmers to reclaim their marginal lands and accelerate their transition to aromatically cultivable lands. © 2020 British Society of Soil Science

TI  - Variations in tolerance to climate change in a key littoral herbivore
VL  - 165
IS  - 1
AB  - Changes in global climate patterns are affecting marine ecosystems, challenging species’ environmental tolerances, and driving shifts in their distributions. In the Baltic Sea, a brackish water body with low biodiversity, the isopod Idotea balthica is a key herbivore species that has a strong top–down effect on habitat-forming macrophytes. Our aim is to understand how the predicted future combination of hyposalinity and warming will affect the survival of this mesograzer throughout the Baltic Sea. By conducting a manipulative aquarium experiment, we simulated future conditions and measured the survival, at different spatial scales, of replicated populations from the entrance, central, and marginal Baltic Sea regions. Overall, the survival rate was strongly affected by the predicted future combination of hyposalinity and warming, but the intensity of the impact varied both among and within regions. Populations from the marginal Baltic Sea responded negatively to climate change. Populations within the entrance varied in their survival responses, with the geographic variation suggesting the existence of spatially distributed genetic variation in tolerance to climate change. In summary, the future combination of hyposalinity and warming is likely to induce a southward shift in the distribution of I. balthica in the northeast marginal region of the Baltic Sea. However, the geographic variation in tolerance shown by the entrance populations indicates that, for this Baltic region, the species may contain the potential for future adaptive responses in tolerance to climate change. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The observation of two-state unfolding for many small single-domain proteins by denaturants has led to speculation that protein sequences may have evolved to limit the population of partially folded states that could be detrimental to fitness. How such strong cooperativity arises from a multitude of individual interactions is not well understood. Here, we investigate the stability and folding cooperativity of the C-terminal domain of the ribosomal protein L9 in the pressure-temperature plane using site-specific NMR. In contrast to apparent cooperative unfolding detected with denaturant-induced and thermal-induced unfolding experiments and stopped-flow refolding studies at ambient pressure, NMR-detected pressure unfolding revealed significant deviation from two-state behavior, with a core region that was selectively destabilized by increasing temperature. Comparison of pressure-dependent NMR signals from both the folded and unfolded states revealed the population of at least one invisible excited state at atmospheric pressure. The core destabilizing cavity-creating I98A mutation apparently increased the cooperativity of the loss of folded-state peak intensity while also increasing the population of this invisible excited state present at atmospheric pressure. These observations highlight how local stability is subtly modulated by sequence to tune protein conformational landscapes and illustrate the ability of pressure- and temperature-dependent studies to reveal otherwise hidden states. © 2019 Biophysical Society

TI  - Method for calculation the modes of strips cold rolling on multiple-stand rolling mill ensuring cost reduction of sheet rolling shop production. Report 1
VL  - 62
IS  - 7
SP  - 511-516
AB  - A method for calculating the modes of strips cold rolling on multiple-stand (reversing) rolling mill is considered providing minimum power consumption with maximum process stabilization at high speeds and obtaining the given quality of cold-rolled strips (minimum probability of surface defects, compliance with thickness tolerances and flatness requirements of the used standards). The problem is solved using the conditional optimization method. As an optimization criterion, it is proposed to use the total energy expenditure spent on the rolling process, as conditions – technological and structural limitations on the rolling parameters and conditions of strips stability to breaks and surface defects formation. The decision to develop this innovative method is due to the fact that a large number of existing approaches to calculation and design of rolling modes have visible advantages and disadvantages. In many cases, the researchers are trying to take into account several requirements that ensure stability of rolling process, its quality, the equipment operating conditions, reduction of energy consumption, metal, auxiliary materials and the specified (maximum) mill productivity. However, some of these requirements can be contradictory and the best one will be the mode that with a high degree of probability guarantees the fulfillment, in a certain proportion, of the entire set of requirements. Therefore, such calculation method is the presented in this article. Calculation of the cold rolling regimes was limited to selection and distribution of the crimping along the cages (passages in the reversing mill). Also, the strip strains are selected in the intercellular spaces, on the decoiler and coiler, and in setting the speed wedge in a particular system of constraints imposed on the input and output process variables as a function of the adopted optimality criterion. As it was noted earlier, the problem was solved with the help of the conditional optimization method with specification of the optimization criterion. © 2019 National University of Science and Technology MISIS.

TI  - Genetic patterns in Montipora capitata across an environmental mosaic in Kāne'ohe Bay, O'ahu, Hawai'i
VL  - 31

SP  - 5201-5213
AB  - Spatial genetic structure (SGS) is important to a population's ability to adapt to environmental change. For species that reproduce both sexually and asexually, the relative contribution of each reproductive mode has important ecological and evolutionary implications because asexual reproduction can have a strong effect on SGS. Reef-building corals reproduce sexually, but many species also propagate asexually under certain conditions. To understand SGS and the relative importance of reproductive mode across environmental gradients, we evaluated genetic relatedness in almost 600 colonies of Montipora capitata across 30 environmentally characterized sites in Kāneʻohe Bay, Oʻahu, Hawaii, using low-depth restriction digest-associated sequencing. Clonal colonies were relatively rare overall but influenced SGS. Clones were located significantly closer to one another spatially than average colonies and were more frequent on sites where wave energy was relatively high, suggesting a strong role of mechanical breakage in their formation. Excluding clones, we found no evidence of isolation by distance within sites or across the bay. Several environmental characteristics were significant predictors of the underlying genetic variation (including degree heating weeks, time spent above 30°C, depth, sedimentation rate and wave height); however, they only explained 5% of this genetic variation. Our results show that asexual fragmentation contributes to the ecology of branching corals at local scales and that genetic diversity is maintained despite strong environmental gradients in a highly impacted ecosystem, suggesting potential for broad adaptation or acclimatization in this population. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Temperature coupling of mate attraction signals and female mate preferences in four populations of Enchenopa treehopper (Hemiptera: Membracidae)
VL  - 32
IS  - 10
SP  - 1046-1056
AB  - Variation in temperature can affect the expression of a variety of important fitness-related behaviours, including those involved with mate attraction and selection, with consequences for the coordination of mating across variable environments. We examined how temperature influences the expression of male mating signals and female mate preferences—as well as the relationship between how male signals and female mate preferences change across temperatures (signal–preference temperature coupling)—in Enchenopa binotata treehoppers. These small plant-feeding insects communicate using plantborne vibrations, and our field surveys indicate they experience significant natural variation in temperature during the mating season. We tested for signal–preference temperature coupling in four populations of E. binotata by manipulating temperature in a controlled laboratory environment. We measured the frequency of male signals—the trait for which females show strongest preference—and female peak preference—the signal frequency most preferred by females—across a range of biologically relevant temperatures (18°C–36°C). We found a strong effect of temperature on both male signals and female preferences, which generated signal–preference temperature coupling within each population. Even in a population in which male signals mismatched female preferences, the temperature coupling reinforces predicted directional selection across all temperatures. Additionally, we found similar thermal sensitivity in signals and preferences across populations even though populations varied in the mean frequency of male signals and female peak preference. Together, these results suggest that temperature variation should not affect the action of sexual selection via female choice, but rather should reinforce stabilizing selection in populations with signal–preference matches, and directional selection in those with signal–preference mismatches. Finally, we do not predict that thermal variation will disrupt the coordination of mating in this species by generating signal–preference mismatches at thermal extremes. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Reproductive rhythms can be found in numerous crustacean species. This chapter reviews the temporal scales of rhythms and how these rhythms are entrained and maintained by external cues and endogenous clocks. The occurrence and synchrony of rhythms vary along latitudinal and depth gradients, which may depend on the availability of zeitgebers (e.g., temperature and photoperiod), changing selective pressures such as predation risk, and variability in larval development rates that affect the timing and synchrony of reproductive rhythms. Commonly observed rhythms are reproductive migrations and synchronized larval release, which are often timed to reduce predation risk for newly hatched larvae. In crustaceans, reproductive rhythms rarely evolve under pure density-dependent selection for synchrony. Pure density dependence is common in marine broadcast-spawning invertebrates like corals, which rely on accumulation of gametes in time and space to ensure fertilization. Instead, (density-independent) selection for synchrony with environmental cycles that track changes in factors affecting fitness such as energy expenditure, predation risk, or food availability seems to be the rule, although some exceptions may exist. In contrast to natural selection, the possible contribution of sexual selection on reproductive rhythms has rarely been considered. Selection for enhanced mating possibilities should favor reproductive synchrony, but deviations from synchrony will affect the operational sex ratio and influence sexual selection. Finally, the chapter discusses the possibility of sexual conflict over reproductive timing between males and females and explores circumstances under which synchronous reproductive rhythms might be abandoned. © Oxford University Press 2020.

TI  - The productivity of mixed mountain forests comprised of Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, and Abies alba across Europe
VL  - 92
IS  - 5
SP  - 512-522
AB  - Mixed mountain forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) cover a total area of more than 10 million hectares in Europe. Due to altitudinal zoning, these forests are particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, as little is known about the long-term development of the productivity and the adaptation and mitigation potential of these forest systems in Europe, reliable information on productivity is required for sustainable forest management. Using generalized additive mixed models this study investigated 60 long-term experimental plots and provides information about the productivity of mixed mountain forests across a variety of European mountain areas in a standardized way for the first time. The average periodic annual volume increment (PAI) of these forests amounts to 9.3 m3ha-1y-1. Despite a significant increase in annual mean temperature the PAI has not changed significantly over the last 30 years. However, at the species level, we found significant changes in the growth dynamics. While beech had a PAI of 8.2 m3ha-1y-1 over the entire period (1980-2010), the PAI of spruce dropped significantly from 14.2 to 10.8 m3ha-1y-1, and the PAI of fir rose significantly from 7.2 to 11.3 m3ha-1y-1. Consequently, we observed stable stand volume increments in relation to climate change. © 2019 Institute of Chartered Foresters, 2019. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bacterial Stress Responses as Potential Targets in Overcoming Antibiotic Resistance
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
AB  - Bacteria can be adapted to adverse and detrimental conditions that induce general and specific responses to DNA damage as well as acid, heat, cold, starvation, oxidative, envelope, and osmotic stresses. The stress-triggered regulatory systems are involved in bacterial survival processes, such as adaptation, physiological changes, virulence potential, and antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic susceptibility to several antibiotics is reduced due to the activation of stress responses in cellular physiology by the stimulation of resistance mechanisms, the promotion of a resistant lifestyle (biofilm or persistence), and/or the induction of resistance mutations. Hence, the activation of bacterial stress responses poses a serious threat to the efficacy and clinical success of antibiotic therapy. Bacterial stress responses can be potential targets for therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics. An understanding of the regulation of stress response in association with antibiotic resistance provides useful information for the discovery of novel antimicrobial adjuvants and the development of effective therapeutic strategies to control antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Therefore, this review discusses bacterial stress responses linked to antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria and also provides information on novel therapies targeting bacterial stress responses that have been identified as potential candidates for the effective control of Gram-negative antibiotic-resistant bacteria. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A numerical simulation of the temperature field dynamics with short contact of the roller heater with diamond grains moving in trench on the conveyor belt with a layer of a thermal adhesive is used to increase the performance of the heat adhesion screening and extraction of rough diamonds from the concentrate. For determining the width of the contact edge of the roller heater in the apparatus which ensures the fixing of diamonds of given dimension in the heat adhesive substance, we propose a calculation method based on the analysis of the temperature field dynamics in the "heating element– diamond–heat adhesive substance" system. It is believed that the diamond attachment is ensured by melting the heat adhesive substance to a certain depth during the thermal contact of the diamond with the heating roller. According to the proposed method, we calculate the widths of the contact edge of the heating rollers, which are necessary for the installation of effective extraction of diamonds from a mixture of related minerals in three streams on the conveyor belt. The technique can be used to reduce the amount of experimental research with further improvement of the installation and increase its productivity. © 2020 N. P. Starostin, P. P. Sharin, and O. A.

VL  - 10
IS  - 6
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococci; GAS) is an exclusively human pathogen. It causes a variety of suppurative and non-suppurative diseases in people of all ages worldwide. Not all can be successfully treated with antibiotics. A licensed vaccine, in spite of its global importance, is not yet available. GAS express an arsenal of virulence factors responsible for pathological immune reactions. The transcription of all these virulence factors is under the control of three types of virulence-related regulators: (i) two-component systems (TCS), (ii) stand-alone regulators, and (iii) non-coding RNAs. This review summarizes major TCS and stand-alone transcriptional regulatory systems, which are directly associated with virulence control. It is suggested that this treasure of knowledge on the genetics of virulence regulation should be better harnessed for new therapies and prevention methods for GAS infections, thereby changing its global epidemiology for the better. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Improving and Maintaining Winter Hardiness and Frost Tolerance in Bread Wheat by Genomic Selection
VL  - 10
AB  - Winter hardiness is a major constraint for autumn sown crops in temperate regions, and thus an important breeding goal in the development of new winter wheat varieties. Winter hardiness is though influenced by many environmental factors rendering phenotypic selection under field conditions a difficult task due to irregular occurrence or absence of winter damage in field trials. Controlled frost tolerance tests in growth chamber experiments are, on the other hand, even with few genotypes, often costly and laborious, which makes a genomic breeding strategy for early generation selection an attractive alternative. The aims of this study were thus to compare the merit of marker-assisted selection using the major frost tolerance QTL Fr-A2 with genomic prediction for winter hardiness and frost tolerance, and to assess the potential of combining both measures with a genomic selection index using a high density marker map or a reduced set of pre-selected markers. Cross-validation within two training populations phenotyped for frost tolerance and winter hardiness underpinned the importance of Fr-A2 for frost tolerance especially when upweighting its effect in genomic prediction models, while a combined genomic selection index increased the prediction accuracy for an independent validation population in comparison to training with winter hardiness data alone. The prediction accuracy could moreover be maintained with pre-selected marker sets, which is highly relevant when employing cost reducing fingerprinting techniques such as targeted genotyping-by-sequencing. Genomic selection showed thus large potential to improve or maintain the performance of winter wheat for these difficult, costly, and laborious to phenotype traits. © Copyright © 2019 Michel, Löschenberger, Hellinger, Strasser, Ametz, Pachler, Sparry and Bürstmayr.

TI  - Conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations affects the functional composition of litter and soil Collembola
VL  - 11
IS  - 15
SP  - 10686-10708
AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry (“jungle rubber”), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%–38% and 30%–40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 49

SP  - 1087-1094
AB  - In order to study the friction and wear mechanisms of the clutch friction pair at high temperature, 30CrSiMoVM steel was selected as the dual-steel-disk pairing with the copper based powder metallurgy frictional material, and its friction and wear properties were investigated at the temperatures from room temperature to 600 ℃, through a high temperature wear tester (MMU-10G type). The results show that with the increase of temperature, the strength of friction pair materials decrease gradually and the oxide film coatings are constantly formed and peeled on the contact surface, leading to a gradual increase at the friction coefficient and wear loss of the friction pair. At 300-500 ℃, the friction coefficient and wear loss of the friction pair increase steadily, indicating that the friction and wear properties are stable, and the predominant wear mechanisms are abrasive wear, oxidative wear and fatigue wear. At 600 ℃, the material surface is softened, resulting in a rapid increase at the friction coefficient of friction pair and wear loss of the frictional material. Severe adhesive wears occur on the dual-steel-disk surface, but its relative wear loss remains low, and the dominant wear mechanisms are adhesive wear, oxidative wear and fatigue wear. © 2018, Central South University Press.

TI  - Multimodel evaluation of longitudinal stream temperature gradient and dominant influencing factors in Michigan streams
AB  - Stream temperature is an important determinant of fish growth, migration, and survival and can thus impact the structure and function of stream ecosystems. Many streams in Michigan and elsewhere in North America receive groundwater inputs that help regulate instream conditions by stabilizing discharge as well as stream temperature. However, groundwater withdrawal can cause reductions in streamflow which typically results in increased summer stream temperatures. Other atmospheric and hydrologic variables (i.e., overland discharge) also impact the rate at which stream temperature changes as it flows downstream. We deployed paired up- and downstream water pressure and temperature loggers within 21 stream reaches throughout the state of Michigan to quantify and model relationships between stream discharge, air temperature, and longitudinal change in stream temperature (i.e., temperature gradient). Using multimodel selection criteria, we evaluated the performance of a hierarchical suite of models that predict temperature gradient as a function of potential driving variables. The multimodel selection criteria identified a best-fitting model that was able to model the diurnal, seasonal, and annual variations in rates of longitudinal temperature fluctuations across most sample streams. Partial regression analysis indicated that proxy variables representing solar radiation at the stream surface were generally the most influential predictors of longitudinal changes in stream temperature, but air temperature and components of streamflow including groundwater input were significant predictors and important in many streams. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Bibliometric analysis of the research landscape on rice husks gasification (1995–2019)
VL  - 28
IS  - 36
SP  - 49467-49490
AB  - The processing of rice (Oryza sativa L.) generates large quantities of lignocellulosic wastes termed rice husks (RH). Numerous researchers have proposed biomass gasification as the panacea to the waste disposal and management challenges posed by RH. However, a comprehensive analysis of RH gasification is required to examine the research landscape and future directions on the area. The research landscape and global developments on RH gasification from 1995 to 2019 are examined through bibliometric analysis of 228 publications extracted from the Web of Science. Bioresource Technology is considered the most influential journal on the topic, whereas China is the most productive nation due to government policies and research funding. The most productive organization is the Harbin Institute of Technology, which is due to the significant contributions of Zhao YiJun and co-workers. Keyword analysis revealed three crucial research themes: gasification, biomass, and rice husks. The literature revealed that the syngas yield, distribution, and performance of RH gasification are significantly influenced by temperature, equivalence ratio, selected reactor, and gasifying medium. The techno-economic analysis of RH gasification revealed that government interventions such as high sales rates and low investment costs could enhance the commercial viability of the technology. Furthermore, the integration of RH gasification with carbon capture utilization and storage could promote the decarbonization of power plants, negative emissions, and net-zero climate goals. Overall, the paper provides valuable information for future researchers to identify strategic collaborators, journal publications, and research frontiers yet unexplored. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Temperature is a poor proxy for synergistic climate forcing of plankton evolution
VL  - 285
IS  - 1883
AB  - Changes in biodiversity at all levels from molecules to ecosystems are often linked to climate change, which is widely represented univariately by temperature. A global environmental driving mechanism of biodiversity dynamics is thus implied by the strong correlation between temperature proxies and diversity patterns in a wide variety of fauna and flora. Yet climate consists of many interacting variables. Species probably respond to the entire climate system as opposed to its individual facets. Here, we examine ecological and morphological traits of 12 633 individuals of two species of planktonic foraminifera with similar ecologies but contrasting evolutionary outcomes. Our results show that morphological and ecological changes are correlated to the interactions between multiple environmental factors. Models including interactions between climate variables explain at least twice as much variation in size, shape and abundance changes as models assuming that climate parameters operate independently. No dominant climatic driver can be identified: temperature alone explains remarkably little variation through our highly resolved temporal sequences, implying that a multivariate approach is required to understand evolutionary response to abiotic forcing. Our results caution against the use of a 'silver bullet' environmental parameter to represent global climate while studying evolutionary responses to abiotic change, and show that more comprehensive reconstruction of palaeobiological dynamics requires multiple biotic and abiotic dimensions. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - A multi-country analysis on potential adaptive mechanisms to cold and heat in a changing climate
VL  - 111
SP  - 239-246
AB  - Background Temporal variation of temperature-health associations depends on the combination of two pathways: pure adaptation to increasingly warmer temperatures due to climate change, and other attenuation mechanisms due to non-climate factors such as infrastructural changes and improved health care. Disentangling these pathways is critical for assessing climate change impacts and for planning public health and climate policies. We present evidence on this topic by assessing temporal trends in cold- and heat-attributable mortality risks in a multi-country investigation. Methods Trends in country-specific attributable mortality fractions (AFs) for cold and heat (defined as below/above minimum mortality temperature, respectively) in 305 locations within 10 countries (1985–2012) were estimated using a two-stage time-series design with time-varying distributed lag non-linear models. To separate the contribution of pure adaptation to increasing temperatures and active changes in susceptibility (non-climate driven mechanisms) to heat and cold, we compared observed yearly-AFs with those predicted in two counterfactual scenarios: trends driven by either (1) changes in exposure-response function (assuming a constant temperature distribution), (2) or changes in temperature distribution (assuming constant exposure-response relationships). This comparison provides insights about the potential mechanisms and pace of adaptation in each population. Results Heat-related AFs decreased in all countries (ranging from 0.45–1.66% to 0.15–0.93%, in the first and last 5-year periods, respectively) except in Australia, Ireland and UK. Different patterns were found for cold (where AFs ranged from 5.57–15.43% to 2.16–8.91%), showing either decreasing (Brazil, Japan, Spain, Australia and Ireland), increasing (USA), or stable trends (Canada, South Korea and UK). Heat-AF trends were mostly driven by changes in exposure-response associations due to modified susceptibility to temperature, whereas no clear patterns were observed for cold. Conclusions Our findings suggest a decrease in heat-mortality impacts over the past decades, well beyond those expected from a pure adaptation to changes in temperature due to the observed warming. This indicates that there is scope for the development of public health strategies to mitigate heat-related climate change impacts. In contrast, no clear conclusions were found for cold. Further investigations should focus on identification of factors defining these changes in susceptibility. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - An investigation into catalysed thermal recycling of glass fibre reinforced epoxy was carried out to improve its commercial viability. CuO nanopowder was integrated with epoxy to assess its ability at reducing the epoxy thermal stability and in turn reducing the typically high thermal recycling temperatures required. It was found that the CuO at various loadings is able to accelerate the thermal degradation of the selected epoxy. The CuO loading of 5% weight of epoxy provided the largest reduction in thermal stability and activation energy of the second stage of decomposition. © CCM 2020 - 18th European Conference on Composite Materials.

TI  - An operation benefit analysis and decision model of thermal power enterprises in China against the background of large-scale new energy consumption
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
AB  - With the continuous increase in new energy installed capacity, the slowdown in the growth of social power consumption, the pressure created by high coal prices, and the reduction in on-grid electricity tariffs, the challenges facing the survival and development of thermal power generation enterprises are becoming more severe. Hence, based on the cost-benefit analysis method, this paper proposes a diversified operating benefit analysis and decision model for thermal power generation enterprises that includes four profit models: power sales, peak load regulation (without oil), peak load regulation (with oil), and generation right trading. The opportunity cost of peak load regulation and generation rights trading was considered, and six scenarios were designed. An empirical analysis was conducted by selecting a thermal power enterprise in Ningxia, Northwest China, as an example, using scenario and sensitivity analyses. The results show that under the diversified business model, thermal power generation enterprises can more effectively avoid the risks when the external environment changes and significantly improve its economic benefits. The consumption of new energy can be promoted, and positive social effects will be achieved. Therefore, the findings will help the thermal power generation enterprises to face these challenges. © 2020 by the authors.

VL  - 162
IS  - 1
SP  - 76-93
AB  - Meiotic recombination rates vary in response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Recently, heat stress has been shown to reveal plasticity in recombination rates in Drosophila pseudoobscura. Here, a combination of molecular genotyping and X-linked recessive phenotypic markers were used to investigate differences in recombination rates due to heat stress. In addition, haplotypes from the genetic crosses were compared to test if they deviated from equal proportions, which would indicate viability selection. To avoid this potential bias, SNP genotyping markers overlapping the regions assayed with mutant markers were used to further investigate recombination rate. Interestingly, skews in haplotype frequency were consistent with the fixation of alleles in the wild-type stocks used that are unfit at high temperature. Evidence of viability selection due to heat stress in the wild-type haplotypes was most apparent on days 7-9 when more mutant non-crossover haplotypes were recovered in comparison to wild type (p < 0.0001). Recombination analysis using SNP markers showed days 9-10 as significantly different due to heat stress in 2 pairs of consecutive SNP markers (p = 0.018; p = 0.015), suggesting that during this time period the recombination rate is most sensitive to heat stress. This peak timing for recombination plasticity is consistent with Drosophila melanogaster based on a comparison of similarly timed key meiotic events, enabling future mechanistic work of temperature stress on recombination rate. © 2022 S.

TI  - DNA Methylation Can Mediate Local Adaptation and Response to Climate Change in the Clonal Plant Fragaria vesca: Evidence From a European-Scale Reciprocal Transplant Experiment
VL  - 13
AB  - The ongoing climate crisis represents a growing threat for plants and other organisms. However, how and if plants will be able to adapt to future environmental conditions is still debated. One of the most powerful mechanisms allowing plants to tackle the changing climate is phenotypic plasticity, which can be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Environmentally induced epigenetic variation mediating phenotypic plasticity might be heritable across (a)sexual generations, thus potentially enabling rapid adaptation to climate change. Here, we assessed whether epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation in particular, enable for local adaptation and response to increased and/or decreased temperature of natural populations of a clonal plant, Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry). We collected ramets from three populations along a temperature gradient in each of three countries covering the southern (Italy), central (Czechia), and northern (Norway) edges of the native European range of F. vesca. After clonal propagation and alteration of DNA methylation status of half of the plants via 5-azacytidine, we reciprocally transplanted clones to their home locality and to the other two climatically distinct localities within the country of their origin. At the end of the growing season, we recorded survival and aboveground biomass as fitness estimates. We found evidence for local adaptation in intermediate and cold populations in Italy and maladaptation of plants of the warmest populations in all countries. Plants treated with 5-azacytidine showed either better or worse performance in their local conditions than untreated plants. Application of 5-azacytidine also affected plant response to changed climatic conditions when transplanted to the colder or warmer locality than was their origin, and the response was, however, country-specific. We conclude that the increasing temperature will probably be the limiting factor determining F. vesca survival and distribution. DNA methylation may contribute to local adaptation and response to climatic change in natural ecosystems; however, its role may depend on the specific environmental conditions. Since adaptation mediated by epigenetic variation may occur faster than via natural selection on genetic variants, epigenetic adaptation might to some degree help plants in keeping up with the ongoing environmental crisis.

TI  - Determinants of growth and selective mortality in anchovy and sardine in the Bay of Biscay
VL  - 239
AB  - In many exploited marine fish species, older individuals within cohorts often have slower growth rates at age than their younger counterparts, a process generally attributed to fishing. However, environmental changes might also contribute to the selective disappearance of faster growing individuals because of the increasing constraints acting on growth in suboptimal environments. Using otoliths of anchovy and sardine collected each year in spring since 2000 in the Bay of Biscay, we measured individuals’ growth during age-0 and catch-up growth during age-1, and followed their changes in time from 2000 to 2018 to quantify the magnitude of selective mortality. We then determined whether the variations in growth and selective mortality were related to seasonal temperature, food quantity, stock biomass or stock harvest rate. In both species, there was a decline in growth during age 0 over time and a catch-up growth declined in anchovy. Density-dependence had a strong effect on growth in anchovy. In both species, there was a systematic selective disappearance of individuals with large growth at age-0 within each cohort and selection has changed over time to favour individuals with large catch-up growth in anchovy. Moreover, diversifying selection occurred for growth at age-0 in both species and catch-up growth in anchovy. In anchovy, years with high selective disappearance of large individuals, high catch-up growth and high diversifying selection were those in which the harvest rates were high (environmental variables having more limited effect). In sardine, the selective disappearance of large individuals was stronger in years with low food quantity and the magnitude of selection acting on growth was unrelated to this stock's harvest rate. Though fishing exerted strong selection pressure in anchovy, selective mortality against large growth still occurred even at low harvest rates in both species, suggesting that this might be a natural process affecting these small pelagic forage fish species. Although anchovy and sardine have a similar trophic position, their selection regimes differed due to differences in their stock dynamics, environmental sensitivity, and fishing rate. It might therefore be hazardous to extrapolate the responses of single species to environmental and anthropogenic factors onto others. © 2021

AB  - The continuously developing infrared detection technology and precise guidance technology pose an increasingly serious threat to the survival and penetration of missiles, hypersonic aircraft and other weapons and equipment. Infrared stealth technology plays an increasingly important role in modern warfare. Traditional low-emissivity coating materials usually have low emissivity characteristics in the entire infrared band and do not have spectral selectivity. This causes a poor effect on radiative cooling, which is not conducive to the reduction of the overall infrared signal of the target. Spectrally selective radiation infrared stealth materials can reduce the emissivity of atmospheric windows (3-5 and 8-14 µm), while using non-atmospheric window (5-8 µm) for radiative cooling. They have more efficient infrared stealth performance, thus attracting a lot of attention currently. This article introduces the research status and progress of three-generation spectrally selective radiation structures, which are based on photonic crystals, frequency selective surfaces and Fabry-Perot cavities respectively, summarizes their advantages and problems. At present, the spectrally selective radiation infrared stealth material is still far from practical application. In the future, it should continuously develop in the direction of simpler technology, stronger high-temperature stability and multiband compatibility. © 2021, Editorial Board of Journal of Aeronautical Materials.

VL  - 151
AB  - Current research proposes and investigates a novel small-scale solar-driven sustainable combined desalination, heating and power (CDHP) system for a house in cold remote locations and hill stations. Latent heat storage integrated evacuated tube solar collector, organic Rankine's cycle, active solar still and water heater are main subsystems of the proposed system to generate power, potable water and hot water simultaneously. Therminol-66 and eco-friendly organic substance (n-butane) are selected as working fluids for the collector system and organic Rankine's cycle, respectively. Heating oil flow is divided after vapor generator to get best temperature glide and hence exergetic performance. The system is assessed based on multi-objective functions like power output, heating output, water productivity, component irreversibility, subsystems and overall system energy and exergy efficiencies, economic and environmental criterion. Generator temperature, condenser temperature, preheater mass fraction and pinch point temperature difference cases are selected decision variables for the parametric studies. The CDHP system energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, cost rate and CO2 reduction are obtained as 17.89%, 3.915%, 1784 $/yr and 10.806 tonnes, respectively, at mean operating conditions. Furthermore, the maximum exergy efficiency of organic Rankine's cycle is found as 57.46% at optimum generator temperature of 119 °C for 50% preheater mass fraction. Overall, the current CDHP system is recommended to produce power, potable water and hot water to meet energy demands, especially at cold remote locations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Cold-hearted: A case for cold stress in cancer risk
VL  - 91
AB  - A negative correlation exists between environmental temperature and cancer risk based on both epidemiological and statistical analyses. Previously, cold stress was reported to be an effective cause of tumorigenesis. Several studies have demonstrated that cold temperature serves as a potential risk factor in cancer development. Most recently, a link was demonstrated between the effects of extreme cold climate on cancer incidence, pinpointing its impact on tumour suppressor genes by causing mutation. The underlying mechanism behind cold stress and its association with tumorigenesis is not well understood. Hence, this review intends to shed light on the role of associated factors, genetic and/or non-genetic, which are modulated by cold temperature, and eventually influence tumorigenic potential. While scrutinizing the effect of cold exposure on the body, the expression of certain genes, e.g. uncoupled proteins and heat-shock proteins, were elevated. Biological chemicals such as norepinephrine, thyroxine, and cholesterol were also elevated. Brown adipose tissue, which plays an essential role in thermogenesis, displayed enhanced activity upon cold exposure. Adaptive measures are utilized by the body to tolerate the cold, and in doing so, invites both epigenetic and genetic changes. Unknowingly, these adaptive strategies give rise to a lethal outcome i.e., genesis of cancer. Concisely, this review attempts to draw a link between cold stress, genetic and epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis and aspires to ascertain the mechanism behind cold temperature-mediated cancer risk. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Multigene Genetic Programming Model for Temperature Optimization to Improve Lettuce Quality
AB  - This paper presents a Multigene Genetic Programming (MGGP) approach in optimizing the temperature of romaine lettuce inside an artificially controlled environment (ACE). In this research, MGGP is used to find the prediction model that will lead to the optimum temperature for growing lettuce crop. The system used a 1000 population using tournament selection with 40 generations. A mutation probability of 0.14 was applied to validate if it is at global optima. When the iterations reached the termination criteria, the system stopped, resulting in the best temperature model for growing lettuce crop. Training and testing of predictions were done. The model developed in this study can be used for the control system of the temperature setting inside the ACE which can provide optimal condition. © 2021 IEEE.

VL  - 95
IS  - 3
SP  - 833-846
AB  - The influence of the lunar cycle on the feeding habits, feeding success and selectivity was tested in situ on larval stages of the clingfish Gobiesox marmoratus (Gobiesocidae). Gobiesox marmoratus larvae and their prey were collected in the water column during the lunar cycle in austral spring 2015 and 2016, in shallow waters (<30 m depth) of El Quisco, central Chile. Feeding incidence was high (80–100%) throughout the moon cycle. The diet was composed of 32 prey items, being gastropod larvae and invertebrate eggs the most important. Prey composition varied among lunar phases with the lowest prey richness during new moon. During 2016, G. marmoratus larvae ingested the lowest number, but the largest prey during new moon. In spring 2015, there were no significant changes in the abundance of each prey taxon in the water column among moon phases, but in spring 2016 there were significant differences in the abundance of cypris and copepod nauplii, particularly between full and new moon. Feeding selectivity index showed that gastropod larvae were positively selected throughout the lunar cycle during spring 2015. In spring 2016, invertebrate eggs were selectively ingested in full moon and third quarter, but at a new moon G. marmoratus larvae selected gastropod larvae. Mean temperature of the water column and its vertical gradient and nocturnal cloud cover influences the feeding success of larval G. marmoratus. Lunar illumination favoured only an increase of richness of prey items. Therefore, nocturnal cloud cover precludes a greater influence of lunar illumination in the larval trophic ecology of this crypto-benthic fish. © 2019 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

TI  - Catalytic conversion of spent frying oil into biodiesel over raw and 12-tungsto-phosphoric acid modified clay
VL  - 155
SP  - 181-188
AB  - In the present work, locally available clay has been utilized to develop cost effective catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. The selected clay was modified with different concentrations (5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt %) of 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) to enhance the capability of the selected clay in biodiesel production from spent frying oil. The synthesized catalyst was characterized with different analytical techniques to evaluate its physiochemical properties. The result suggested that the catalyst containing 10 wt% 12-tungstophosphoric acid (TPA) loading exhibited good trans-esterification activity to produce maximum biodiesel yield of 96% under the best reaction conditions: oil/methanol molar ratio, 1:10; catalyst amount, 0.7 g; reaction time, 4.5 h and reaction temperature, 85 degrees C. Moreover, the catalytic reusability of the synthesized catalyst was investigated to study its economic viability. The results suggested that the synthesized catalyst could be reused up to 6 times for biodiesel production without any high temperature treatment. Thus, the selected clay has the potential to be used as a starting material to develop an efficient catalyst for biodiesel production from low cost feedstock. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As an important intermediate of prostaglandins and entecavir, optically pure Corey lactone diol (CLD) has great value in the pharmaceutical industry. In this work, the enantioseparation of (±)-CLD was evaluated using high-performance liquid (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). In HPLC, the separations of CLD enantiomers on polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases with both normal phase and polar organic phase were screened. And the conditions for the enantioseparation were optimized in HPLC and SFC, including the selection of mobile phase, temperature, back-pressure, and other conditions. More important, it was found that the chiral resolutions were greatly enhanced by the increase of the coating amount of ADMPC (amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)) under both HPLC and SFC conditions, which can lead to the increase of the productivity and the decrease of the solvent consumption. The preparations of optically pure CLD were evaluated on a semi-preparative (2 × 25 cm) column packed with 30% ADMPC-coated CSP under HPLC and SFC conditions. Preparative performances in terms of kkd are 1.536 kg racemate/kg CSP/day and 1.248 kg racemate/kg CSP/day in HPLC and SFC, respectively. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Numerical investigation of thermo-mechanical field during selective laser melting process with experimental validation
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - In this study, thermo-mechanical simulation was conducted to predict thermal and stress behavior in Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Temperature-dependent material properties for processed material 304L stainless steel were incorporated into the model in order to capture the change from powder to fully dense solid stainless steel. Temperature and thermal stress history were tracked under conditions of different parameter sets which were designed to reduce defect formation. The thermal model predicted the temperature history for multi-track scans under different process parameters, such as laser power, effective scanning speed and hatch spacing. Subsequently, the corresponding melt-pool size, solidification rate and temperature gradients could be calculated from simulated temperature data. These three parameters from the simulation were compared with experimental melt pool size, grain structure and cell spacing data obtained from a Renishaw AM250. The experimental data were also used to determine unknown simulation parameters required by the continuum model, e.g., the optical penetration depth and thermal conductivity multiplier for the molten region. This allowed the simulation model to accurately predict melt pool size and solidification structure of SLM 304L stainless steel. Simulated stress showed that the subsequent thermal cyclic melting in successive scanned tracks resulted in alternating compressive and tensile thermal stresses. This work will provide insight for studying microstructure morphology, residual stress and deformations in the SLM process of 304L stainless steel. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Application of ORC to reduce the energy penalty of carbon capture in non-stationary ICE
VL  - 268
AB  - The electrification of productive activities cannot be considered the only strategy for a low-carbon economy, and sectors such as road freight and passenger transport will have to continue using technologies based on combustion in the medium and long term. It is expected that sustainable synthetic fuels and CO2 capture and storage technologies (CCS) can help to reduce greenhouse emissions. However, the occupation of spaces and the energy penalty of the capture are handicapped in smaller facilities, such as conventional combustion engine vehicles, and determine its technical and economic viability. In this paper, AVL boost and Aspen + softwares simulations are performed to analyze the feasibility of using an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to supply the power consumption of an on-board CCS system coupled to an internal combustion engine (ICE) operating at partial engine loads and over the whole rpm range. Two spark-ignition engines of different sizes, fueled with CH4, have been modelled, and temperature swing adsorption is selected as a viable method for the CCS system, assuming a carbon capture rate of 90 %. Results show that the ORC reduces between 3.9 and 13.9 % the penalization of the CCS system over the engine power, keeping it under 8.84 % in the small engine and 5.71 % in the large engine. It can be concluded that an ORC-CCS hybridized system is energy feasible for the operation of an ICE working at partial loads in the entire rpm. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Complete genome sequence of Arthrobacter sp. PAMC25564 and its comparative genome analysis for elucidating the role of CAZymes in cold adaptation
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The Arthrobacter group is a known set of bacteria from cold regions, the species of which are highly likely to play diverse roles at low temperatures. However, their survival mechanisms in cold regions such as Antarctica are not yet fully understood. In this study, we compared the genomes of 16 strains within the Arthrobacter group, including strain PAMC25564, to identify genomic features that help it to survive in the cold environment. Results: Using 16 S rRNA sequence analysis, we found and identified a species of Arthrobacter isolated from cryoconite. We designated it as strain PAMC25564 and elucidated its complete genome sequence. The genome of PAMC25564 is composed of a circular chromosome of 4,170,970 bp with a GC content of 66.74 % and is predicted to include 3,829 genes of which 3,613 are protein coding, 147 are pseudogenes, 15 are rRNA coding, and 51 are tRNA coding. In addition, we provide insight into the redundancy of the genes using comparative genomics and suggest that PAMC25564 has glycogen and trehalose metabolism pathways (biosynthesis and degradation) associated with carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZymes). We also explain how the PAMC26654 produces energy in an extreme environment, wherein it utilizes polysaccharide or carbohydrate degradation as a source of energy. The genetic pattern analysis of CAZymes in cold-adapted bacteria can help to determine how they adapt and survive in such environments. Conclusions: We have characterized the complete Arthrobacter sp. PAMC25564 genome and used comparative analysis to provide insight into the redundancy of its CAZymes for potential cold adaptation. This provides a foundation to understanding how the Arthrobacter strain produces energy in an extreme environment, which is by way of CAZymes, consistent with reports on the use of these specialized enzymes in cold environments. Knowledge of glycogen metabolism and cold adaptation mechanisms in Arthrobacter species may promote in-depth research and subsequent application in low-temperature biotechnology. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Effect of Sterilization Temperature on Lipid Oxidation and Quality Attributes of Marinated Eggs
VL  - 43
IS  - 5
SP  - 69-75
AB  - The effects of different sterilization temperatures on the conjugated diene acid (CDA) value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, fatty acid profile, color, texture and sensory characteristics of marinated eggs were investigated. The results showed that sterilization temperatures below 95 and 105 ℃ significantly inhibited the increase in CDA and TBARS content, respectively. With increasing sterilization temperature, there was no significant change in the total content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (P > 0.05), while the total content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)increased, and a significant increase was observed when the sterilization temperature was 105 ℃ (P < 0.05). In contrast,the total content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) significantly decreased with increasing sterilization temperature(P < 0.05). When the sterilization temperature was 121 ℃, PUFA/SFA ratio significantly declined (P < 0.05) and the highest n-6/n-3 ratio was observed among all conditions. In addition, the color parameters L* and b* values decreased, and a* value increased with increasing sterilization temperature. Sterilization at 105 ℃ resulted in higher hardness, springiness, chewiness and overall sensory scores than at any other temperature. This study indicates sterilization at 105 ℃ can cause less lipid oxidation, and maintain the nutritional value of fatty acids in marinated eggs and its sensory quality, which will provide a scientific basis for the selection of proper sterilization temperature by marinated egg producers. © 2022, China Food Publishing Company.

TI  - Bpa toxicity during development of zebrafish embryo
VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 437-447
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a monomer used in the production of polycarbonate, a polymer commonly found in plastics, epoxy resins and thermal papers. The presence of BPA in food, water, air and dust has been of great concern in recent years not only due to environmental and ecological issues but also because of its supposed risk to public health related to its mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. In this study we evaluated the toxicity of bisphenol A in zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) and determined the 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of this chemical. BPA was used at concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 100 μM in E3 medium/0.5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) from previously prepared stock solutions in 100% DMSO. Controls included embryos exposed only to E3 medium or supplemented with 0.5% DMSO. Camptothecin (CPT), a known inhibitor of cell proliferation was used as positive control at a concentration of 0.001 μM in E3 medium/0.5% DMSO. Adults zebrafish were placed for breeding a day before the experimental set up, then, viable embryos were collected and selected for use. Experiments were carried out in triplicates, according to specifications from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). One embryo/well (25 embryos per concentration) was distributed in 96 well microplates in presence or absence of the chemicals. The plates were kept in BOD incubators with a controlled temperature of 28.5 ºC and with photoperiod of 14 h light:10 h dark. After 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h exposure, the exposed embryos were evaluated according to the following parameters: mortality, coagulation, rate of heartbeat, hatching and presence of morphological abnormalities. Photography was obtained by photomicroscopy. Apoptosis was evaluated by DNA ladder assay. DNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform method and analyzed by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments were visualized after ethidium bromide staining in ultraviolet transilluminator. The LC50 determined for BPA was 70 μM after 24 hours, 72 μM after 48 hours, 47 μM after 72 hours and 31 μM after 96 hours exposure. BPA induced morphological and physiological alterations such as yolk sac and pericardial edema, hatching delay or inhibition, spine deformation, decreasing in heartbeat rate and mortality. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that BPA induced marked malformations in zebrafish embryos at concentrations above 25 μM corroborating the current concerns related to the widespread presence of BPA in the air, food and water used by humans as well as in the bodily fluids and tissues. © 2021, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of characterized Leuconostoc spp. as novel probiotics isolated from Oreochromis spp. (red tilapia) against fish pathogen Edwardsiella tarda
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
SP  - 601-614
AB  - Aims: This study aimed to isolate and characterize putative new probiotic with antimicrobial properties against common fish pathogens from the gut of Oreochromis spp. (red tilapia). Methodology and results: A total of 28 colonies were isolated from gut of Oreochromis spp. and characterized phenotypically. Eight isolates were selected for probiotic characterization. Temperature, salinity, pH and bile salt tolerance, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial test against selected fish pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus ATCC 25923) were conducted. Characterization studies revealed isolates suited for freshwater environment and exhibited tolerance against wide range of salinity, pH and bile salt. Isolates displayed different antibiotic susceptibility profile, with six exhibited antimicrobial properties against E. tarda. Molecular identification based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed 99.44%, 98.59% and 91.21% sequence similarity with Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides strain 3832T, Leuconostoc lactis strain KCC202369T and Leuconostoc mesenteroides strain 4332T, respectively as compared to known sequence in the Gen Bank. When identified Leuconostoc spp. were coated on feed pellets, no major decrease in viability over 21 days of storage at 4 °C were observed, with an average of 8 log CFU/mL. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The characterized species allow further application assessment of the probiotic-supplemented tilapia feed. Host-originated Leuconostoc displayed potential antimicrobial properties against fish pathogen E. tarda. The isolates Leuconostoc is expected to provide protective effect for Oreochromis spp. against edwardsiellosis and to exert beneficial effects more efficiently as compared to commercial probiotics which are not specifically target for Oreochromis spp., thereby indirectly helping fish farmers in achieving economic sustainability and increase affordability of fish. © 2021.

VL  - 52
AB  - The development of energy generation by solar thermal has been rigorously highlighted worldwide, but efforts to extend this energy resource have yet to be made by ASEAN countries. This paper discusses the emergence of solar thermal applications in the ASEAN region and their challenges. The heat demand profile by temperature range in major industrial sectors in Malaysia to represent the region is also presented. Furthermore, this paper provides an industrial viewpoint regarding awareness and technical know-how required to implement solar thermal in the sector successfully. The results indicated that solar thermal offers vast opportunities for its integration with the existing industry, which operates in the low-temperature range of below 150 °C to the medium-temperature range of 150–400 °C for diverse applications, such as drying, cooking, cleaning, oleochemicals, and fertiliser manufacturing. The results showed that 26% of the respondents are strongly aware of solar thermal technologies. However, most respondents reported some barriers, such as costly solar collectors and lack of knowledge of solar thermal technology selection. Meanwhile, nearly 38% of the respondents believed that the technology could provide energy-saving and environmental benefits (25%), whereas 18% believed that incentives might increase the share of solar renewable energy in the energy mix. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 222
SP  - 343-350
AB  - Glazed roof has a convenient place to receive solar radiation, however its bad thermal mass affects the indoor thermal environment and energy consumption. In the present work, the effect of glazed roof filled with phase change material on its thermal mass was experimentally investigated and compared with conventional glazed roof. Experiments with different PCM melting temperatures, PCM layer thicknesses and glazed roof slopes were performed to analyze their effect on the energy consumption and dissatisfaction rate of indoor thermal environment. Also, a general economic analysis was performed to assess the viability of glazing units containing PCM. The results show that the energy consumption of glazed roof filled with PCM is significantly less than that of air, and up to 47.5% of energy saving can be achieved. Payback period can be reduced to 3.3 years by proper selection of PCM melting temperature. Increasing the melting temperature of PCM can effectively decrease the temperature of internal surface of glazed roof, but has a slight influence on the dissatisfaction rate of indoor thermal environment. Increasing the thickness of PCM layer decreases the peak temperature of internal surface of glazed roof and indoor chamber, the energy consumption and the dissatisfaction rate. The highest energy consumption and dissatisfaction rate are obtained at 20° of the inclination angle. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Population dynamics and resting egg production in Daphnia: Interactive effects of mercury, population density and temperature
VL  - 755
AB  - Toxicity studies on freshwater organisms are commonly conducted by quantifying effects on asexual (clonal) reproductive rates in Daphnia, whereas studies of effects on sexual reproductive rates remain relatively rare. Sexual reproduction in Daphnia and the associated production of resting eggs allows them to survive unfavorable environmental conditions and is thus a crucial component of their long-term fitness. It also maintains genetic diversity within Daphnia populations and hence their potential for adaptation to new environmental conditions. This aspect of their biology may therefore be important to consider in toxicity studies. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time how mercury (Hg) affects sexual versus asexual reproduction in Daphnia under varying environmental conditions. Specifically, we experimentally tested the interactive effects of Hg and temperature on the population dynamics of Daphnia magna. For this purpose, we exposed D. magna to environmentally relevant concentrations (0 mu g/L, 0.5 mu g/L and 2 mu g/L) of Hg (in the form of mercury (II) chloride) found in stream water and measured biomass growth rate resulting from asexual reproduction, and resting egg production resulting from sexual reproduction. This was done at both 17 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Biomass growth rate did not vary across Hg treatments and depended mainly on temperature and population density. Density dependence of biomass growth rate was indeed more pronounced at 24 degrees C than at 17 degrees C, as resource limitation from intraspecific competition was further exacerbated by the rise in feeding rates with temperature. Density dependence of resting egg production was unaffected by Hg and temperature, but resting egg production was higher under Hg exposure at low temperature. These findings show that depending on environmental conditions, rates of sexual reproduction in D. magna may respond to metal exposure at lower concentrations than those impacting population growth during the asexual phase.

VL  - 2021
IS  - 5
SP  - 531-546
AB  - A literature review was conducted on the impacts of climate change on Russian forests and their adaptation. It is well documented that climate change significantly affects forest ecosystems in Russia. Negative effects prevail, although positive ones have also been noted. The article analyzes practical opportunity for adaptation of forests using the categories of impacts of typical hydrometeorological phenomena and their complexes, as well as the potential for natural adaptation. The character of impacts (i.e., negative, positive, or neutral) is assessed based on the priorities of biodiversity conservation, efficiency of forest functioning and conservation of forest resources. The main aim of adaptation measures is to prevent degradation of forest stands and decrease in forest productivity in Russia over significant areas. At the same time, forests can be used for the adaptation of other objects to climate change, since their protective and regulatory features may help offset adverse weather and climate impacts. The types of adaptation could be categorized as follows: Prevention of damage; reduction of losses; preparedness for recovery; using new opportunities; involvement of natural ecosystem adaptation (forest self-adaptation). Forests are effective for maintaining the hydrological regime, protecting against floods, reducing wind speed, as well as protecting against heat waves, erosion and dust storms. Effective use of forests as an adaptation measure requires certain care on their ability to provide the necessary ecosystem services, that is an element of forest adaptation per se. The Forest Code does not provide any direct references on issues of adaptation to climate change. However, some categories of protective forests can provide respective ecosystem services. It is expedient to constitute a new category of protective forests, namely 'adaptation forests'. Sustainable forest management can contribute to both increasing the mitigation and adaptation capacity of forest ecosystems. © 2021, Izdatel'stvo Nauka. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ammonia Volatilization from Farmland Measured by Laser Absorption Spectroscopy
VL  - 40
IS  - 3
SP  - 885-890
AB  - Ammonia volatilization is an important path of nitrogen loss from farmland into the environment, and is also the main factor of PM2.5 formation, which has serial disadvantageous effect on the ecological environment and agricultural production. Previously, most of the traditional methods for ammonia emission measurement collected atmospheric ammonia by an acid absorbent. However, these techniques were labor intensive, making it difficult to determine diurnal variation of ammonia volatilization. The open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is a reliable tool with high precision, high selectivity, and fast response time for continuous and nonintrusive monitoring of ammonia concentrations over distances from tens to hundreds of meters under field conditions. Currently, the combination of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and micrometeorological backward Lagrangian stochastic diffusion model (TDLAS-BLS) has become a popular technique in the measurement of ammonia volatilization in the field. The objectives of the study are first, to compare TDLAS-BLS technique with the micrometeorological integrated horizontal flux method for its accuracy and applicability for quantitatively measuring ammonia emission from large area of farmland through field experiments. Second, determine the dynamics of ammonia volatilization via high-temporal resolution data and identify the factors that govern ammonia volatilization from urea applied to winter wheat. The results indicated that the estimates made by TDLAS-BLS method were statistically equivalent to those made by the IHF method (regression gradient=0.97, R2=0.97, n=14). The ammonia emission rates and total ammonia loss estimated by the TDLAS-BLS technique were only 3% and 6% lower than those from the IHF method, respectively. This implied that TDLAS-BLS technique can be used to quantitatively estimate ammonia emission from large area of farmland during topdressing period of winter wheat with acceptable accuracy. Ammonia concentration was higher in daytime than in the night at topdressing stage of winter wheat, due to wind speed fluctuation causing it to fluctuate greatly. Ammonia volatilization rate increased slowly after fertilization, and reached a maximum value at the sixth day after fertilization and then decreased gradually after 15 days. This was mainly concentrated in the 5~8 days after fertilization, and accounted for 69% of the total during the overall monitoring period. During this period, the total loss determined by TDLAS-BLS method was 8.8 kg N•ha-1 (6.3% of the total applied N). The lower loss was related due to furrow application of urea and low temperature. This demonstrated the ability of the TDLAS-BLS method to characterize the diurnal patterns of ammonia emission and the environmental influences on ammonia emission from cropland via high-temporal resolution data. Ammonia volatilization showed large diurnal variability during the daytime, which was coincident with temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. Wind speed, solar radiation, soil temperature and precipitation are significantly correlated with ammonia volatilization. Meteorological factor (such as precipitation) are the main factors influencing ammonia volatilization in abnormal weather. © 2020, Peking University Press. All right reserved.

VL  - 47

SP  - 764-772
AB  - Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins) are among a few indigenous parasitoids attacking the invasive Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in North America. Both parasitoid species occur in California, whereas only P. vindemiae has been reported from Oregon. We compared the thermal performance of the California populations of P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae, and the Oregon population of P. vindemiae at eight constant temperatures (12.6-32.8 degrees C). Both P. vindemiae populations could develop at all tested temperatures. T. drosophilae failed to develop at or above 29.6 degrees C. This species was, however, able to develop at a diurnal temperature regime of 15-32 degrees C, and survival was higher in older developmental stages. T. drosophilae was less tolerant to both low and high temperatures than P. vindemiae, whereas the Oregon P. vindemiae population was more cold-tolerant but less heat-tolerant than the California population in terms of offspring survival, development, and reproduction. To develop storage strategies for mass-cultured parasitoids, we compared the cold tolerance of immature P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae of the California populations at 12 degrees C for 1, 2, or 3 mo, followed by a 23 degrees C holding period. Successful development to the adult stage decreased as cold storage duration increased. Successful development, however, increased when cold storage was initiated during the older developmental stages for 1-mo exposure for both parasitoid species. The results are discussed with regards to parasitoid thermal adaptation and the potential use of P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae for biological control of spotted-wing drosophila.

VL  - 192
IS  - 10
AB  - Global vegetation has been reported to be turning greener, especially in China and India. The Yellow River Basin is one of the most prominent greening areas in China. While some studies have attributed vegetation greening to large-scale ecological restoration efforts, our study focuses on the role of climate change in vegetation greening. We selected a time series of annual vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation coverage from satellite data to quantify the vegetation greening trend. Annual temperature and precipitation were selected to examine the climate trend from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that the Yellow River Basin experienced a rapid increase in temperature and precipitation during this period. Annual temperature increased with an average speed of 0.905 °C per decade, approximately 4.5 times larger than that of global warming. Annual precipitation increased by 82.8%, with an average speed of 9.17 mm per year. There was widespread vegetation greening in the Yellow River Basin during 2000–2019. This was demonstrated by an increase in vegetation NPP and vegetation coverage in the Yellow River Basin. The increase of annual NPP and coverage from 2000 to 1019 was 26.6% and 30.8%, respectively. Even while considering the effects of conservation and restoration efforts, the rapid increases in temperature and precipitation allowed vegetation to flourish, as evidenced by significant positive correlations between climate variables and vegetation variables. Therefore, climate change played an important positive role in vegetation greening, rather than an undesirable disturbance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

VL  - 281
AB  - Natural gas purification by economic and low-energy adsorptive separation processes is important. However, as a difficult global problem, N2 removal from N2/CH4 mixtures is challenging because of their similar physical properties. In this study, the separation of N2/CH4 by Cr-metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) (MIL-100Cr, MIL-101Cr and TYUT-96Cr) with various open Cr site densities was studied. Gas sorption isotherms showed that TYUT-96Cr exhibited the highest N2/CH4 uptake ratio (13.67 at 0.01 bar and 298 K) of the selected Cr-MOFs, which was consistent with the highest density of Cr (III) sites. This material provided the highest CH4 productivity (0.716 mmol/cm3) per cycle for N2 removal from a 5:95 N2/CH4 mixture to produce 99.99% pure CH4, as shown by the breakthrough experiments. Pressure-swing adsorption simulations indicated that, by a two-bed six-step method, pristine 95% methane was enriched to 98.9% by TYUT-96Cr. The largest CH4 productivity, high breakthrough selectivity and thermal stability of TYUT-96Cr among the Cr-MOFs, made it a promising adsorbent in trace N2 removal for practical industrial application. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Influence of water quality parameters on the prevalence of Livoneca redmanii (Isopoda; Cymothoidae) infestation of mediterranean sea fishes, Egypt
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SP  - 174-181
AB  - The quality of water in the aquatic ecosystem is a very sensitive issue and is controlled by many physical and chemical factors. The deterioration of water quality has variable effect on parasitic population and their rate of infestation and consequently the negative impact can impede fish viability and productivity. The current study aimed to: i) Surveying the parasitic isopod infesting some of the edible fish species inhabit the Egyptian Mediterranean Sea water ii) Assess the seasonal variations in water quality parameters of Mediterranean coastal water of Egypt. iii) Investigating the effect of water quality parameters on the rate of parasitic isopod infestation among the examined fishes. Water samples during each season were analyzed for physico-chemical parameters using standard methods. The selected parameters namely: temperature, pH, salinity, oxidizable organic matter (OOM), ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and some heavy metals (Lead, Copper, Arsenic and Mercury). A total of 400 Mediterranean Sea fish of Tilapia zilli, Solea spp, Mugil capito and Sardinella species were examined for isopod parasites. Parasites were preserved and identified. The results revealed isolation of the isopod species Livoneca redmanii, with an infestation rate of 19% among the examined fish species with the highest rate among Mugil capito (36%) and reached its total maximum value during summer (32%). Correlation analysis revealed that infestation rates were highly correlated (positively) with certain water quality parameters, such as temperature, oxidzable organic matter (OOM) and nitrite. High water temperatures during summer and spring seasons, and high nitrite concentrations were significantly associated with high infestation rates in Tilapia zilli (R2=0.91, P=0.046 and R2 = 0.97, P=0.015). The findings suggested that deterioration of water quality with varying seasons was stressful to fish, and consequently increased the incidences of the parasitic Isopod (Livoneca redmanii) so considered as a predisposing agent to parasitism. The study recommended periodical monitoring of water quality parameters in fish water resources and the need to take all measures by the responsible authorities to prevent pollution of these resources to minimized and control the prevalence of parasite infestations particularly of isopods. © 2019 IJVS.

VL  - 46
IS  - 2
SP  - 316-331
AB  - Aim: This study aims to contribute to the identification of ecological determinants of tropical moist forest montane biodiversity, analysing changes in the structure of bat assemblages along an elevational gradient and testing the role of species traits shaping those assemblages. Location: Mountain ranges in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Methods: We compiled a dataset with the composition of phyllostomid bat assemblages at 32 forested sites, ranging from 60 m to 1,960 m a.s.l. We quantified how abundance and diversity changed along this elevational gradient, and assessed the capacity of each species to be present and abundant at each elevation, identifying traits that may influence that capacity. Results: Abundance and species diversity declined markedly with increasing elevation. Tolerance to low temperatures, low habitat specialization and cave roosting facilitated success at higher elevations. Owing to trait filtering, and to changes in resource availability with elevation, assemblages were progressively dominated by a smaller number of mostly generalist species as elevation increased. Higher elevations harbour only a subset of the species that are present in the lowland forest, with no mountain specialized species. Main conclusions: High mountains harbour phyllostomid assemblages that are impoverished subsets of those at lower elevations. Phyllostomids have a tropical origin and may thus have a low potential to adapt to montane forest environments, which possibly explains the observed climatic trait filtering. Habitat filtering is also important, keeping forest specialists mostly at lowest elevations. Protected areas in the Atlantic Forest are mostly limited to mountains. While these areas are clearly important to protect biodiversity, including phyllostomid assemblages, it is now critical to protect and restore the few remnants of lower elevation Atlantic Forest where higher productivity and resource levels, increased complexity of vertical structure, and fewer climatic constraints favour the success of a wider range of phyllostomid bat species of tropical origin. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Stress response and silencing verification of heat shock proteins in Dermatophagoides farinae under temperature stress
VL  - 144
SP  - 351-361
AB  - Dermatophagoides farinae is a major exogenous allergen. Its ability to tolerate adverse external temperatures makes it responsible for widespread occurrence of allergies. Heat shock protein (HSP), a recognized temperature stress response gene, but its role in D. farinae remained unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive study. First, we found that 25 degrees C was the optimal temperature, and all mites died at 48 or -20 degrees C for 1 h (LT100). Thus, 41 degrees C (LT15), 43 degrees C (LT25), 45 degrees C (LT45), and -10 degrees C (LT25) were selected as stress temperatures to perform de novo RNA-seq. Then, 17 main genes of the 47 differentially expressed HSP, were detected by qRT-PCR. Temperature and time gradient versus expression magnitude histogram revealed that HSP70, HSP83-1, HSP83-2, and HSP16-1 showed heat stress response only at 41-43 degrees C, while HSC71 and HSF played a regulatory role under both heat and cold stress, particularly HSF, with strong intensity, long duration, and quick upregulation at recovery for 10-20 min. Finally, gene expression and D. farinae survival rates significantly decreased following RNAi. These findings indicated that HSPs conferred thermo-tolerance or cold-tolerance to D. farinae. In conclusion, this was the first meaningful exploration that confirmed HSP and HSF playing an important role in temperature resistance of D. farinae. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Highly active enzymes produced by directed evolution with stability-based selection
VL  - 140
AB  - In a directed evolution aimed at improving enzymatic activity, a situation occurs where highly active variants can no longer be obtained from a template protein because the template is already located at a peak (local maximum) in the fitness landscape of activity for the sequence space. To overcome this situation, the template needs to descend the mountain (lose activity) once and climb another higher mountain. However, there is no solid guideline of how the template should go down. Here, we propose a stability index. Previous studies have shown that protein evolution is potentially governed by stability, and that proteins with low activity but high stability are more favorable templates for producing highly active variants. In our earlier works on conventional directed evolution by random mutagenesis of an esterase from Sulfolobus tokodaii, we identified variants with 3-fold higher activity than the wild-type as the highest activity variants. In this work, as a first step, stability-keeping variants were selected by five rounds of random mutagenesis and screening based on halo formation assay using the substrate tributyrin at 70 °C after heat treatment for 30 min at 90 °C. These variants are likely to be scattered at the feet of various mountains in the fitness landscape. Next, these variants were pooled and used as parental proteins for a conventional experiment with activity-based selection, where the activity of variants was assayed using their cell-free extracts on the substrate p-nitrophenyl butyrate at 75 °C. After two rounds of random mutagenesis, we successfully obtained a variant with 9-fold higher activity than the wild-type. These results indicate that the two-step selection by stability and activity enables us more easily to produce markedly activity-improving variants. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Genome number and size polymorphism in Zika virus infectious units
VL  - 95
IS  - 6
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus) is an arthropod-borne infection that can result in severe outcomes, particularly in fetuses infected in utero. It has been assumed that infection by ZIKV, as well as other viruses, is largely initiated by individual virus particles binding to and entering a cell. However, recent studies have demonstrated that multiple virus particles are frequently delivered to a cell simultaneously and that this collective particle delivery enhances infection. ZIKV is maintained in nature between Aedes aegypti mosquitos and vertebrate hosts, including humans. Human infection is initiated through the injection of a relatively small initial inoculum comprised of a genetically complex virus population. Since most mutations decrease virus fitness, collective particle transmission could benefit ZIKV and other arthropod-borne diseases by facilitating the maintenance of genetic complexity and adaptability during infection or through other mechanisms. Therefore, we utilized a barcoded ZIKV to quantify the number of virus genomes that initiate a plaque. We found that individual plaques contain a mean of 10 infecting viral genomes (range, 1 to 212). Few plaques contained more than two dominant genomes. To determine whether multigenome infectious units consist of collectively transmitting virions, infectious units of ZIKV were then separated mechanically by centrifugation, and heavier fractions were found to contain more genomes per plaque-forming unit, with larger diameters. Finally, larger/heavier infectious units reformed after removal. These data suggest that ZIKV populations consist of a variety of infectious unit sizes, likely mostly made up of aggregates, and only rarely begin with a single virus genome. IMPORTANCE The arthropod-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infects humans and can cause severe neurological sequelae, particularly in fetuses infected in utero. How this virus has been able to spread across vast geological ranges and evolve in new host populations is not yet understood. This research demonstrates a novel mechanism of ZIKV transmission through multigenome aggregates, providing insight into ZIKV evolution, immunologic evasion, and better future therapeutic design. This study shows that ZIKV plaques result from collections of genomes rather than individual genomes, increasing the potential for interactions between ZIKV genotypes. Copyright © 2021 Sexton et al.

TI  - Environmental stress leads to genome streamlining in a widely distributed species of soil bacteria
VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 423-434
AB  - Bacteria have highly flexible pangenomes, which are thought to facilitate evolutionary responses to environmental change, but the impacts of environmental stress on pangenome evolution remain unclear. Using a landscape pangenomics approach, I demonstrate that environmental stress leads to consistent, continuous reduction in genome content along four environmental stress gradients (acidity, aridity, heat, salinity) in naturally occurring populations of Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens (widespread soil-dwelling plant mutualists). Using gene-level network and duplication functional traits to predict accessory gene distributions across environments, genes predicted to be superfluous are more likely lost in high stress, while genes with multi-functional roles are more likely retained. Genes with higher probabilities of being lost with stress contain significantly higher proportions of codons under strong purifying and positive selection. Gene loss is widespread across the entire genome, with high gene-retention hotspots in close spatial proximity to core genes, suggesting Bradyrhizobium has evolved to cluster essential-function genes (accessory genes with multifunctional roles and core genes) in discrete genomic regions, which may stabilise viability during genomic decay. In conclusion, pangenome evolution through genome streamlining are important evolutionary responses to environmental change. This raises questions about impacts of genome streamlining on the adaptive capacity of bacterial populations facing rapid environmental change. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Dual expression of CCA-adding enzyme and RNase T in Escherichia coli generates a distinct cca growth phenotype with diverse applications
VL  - 47
IS  - 7
SP  - 3631-3639
AB  - Correct synthesis and maintenance of functional tRNA 3-CCA-ends is a crucial prerequisite for aminoacylation and must be achieved by the phylogenetically diverse group of tRNA nucleotidyltransferases. While numerous reports on the in vitro characterization exist, robust analysis under in vivo conditions is lacking. Here, we utilize Escherichia coli RNase T, a tRNA-processing enzyme responsible for the tRNA-CCA-end turnover, to generate an in vivo system for the evaluation of A-adding activity. Expression of RNase T results in a prominent growth phenotype that renders the presence of a CCA- or A-adding enzyme essential for cell survival in an E. coli cca background. The distinct growth fitness allows for both complementation and selection of enzyme variants in a natural environment. We demonstrate the potential of our system via detection of altered catalytic efficiency and temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, we select functional enzyme variants out of a sequence pool carrying a randomized codon for a highly conserved position essential for catalysis. The presented E. coli-based approach opens up a wide field of future studies including the investigation of tRNA nucleotidyltransferases from all domains of life and the biological relevance of in vitro data concerning their functionality and mode of operation. © The Author(s) 2019.

VL  - 2
AB  - Although laser-based additive manufacturing (AM) has enabled unprecedented fabrication of complex parts directly fromdigital models, broader adoption of the technology remains challenged by insufficient reliability and in-process variations. Inpursuit of assuring quality in the selective laser sintering (SLS)AM, this paper builds a modeling and control framework of thekey thermodynamic interactions between the laser source and thematerials to be processed. First, we develop a three-dimensionalfinite element simulation to understand the important featuresof the melt-pool evolution for designing sensing and feedbackalgorithms. We explore how the temperature field is affectedby hatch spacing and thermal properties that are temperaturedependent. Based on high-performance computer simulation andexperimentation, we then validate the existence and effect of periodic disturbances induced by the repetitive in- and cross-layerthermomechanical interactions. From there, we identify the system model from the laser power to the melt pool width and builda repetitive control algorithm to greatly attenuate variations ofthe melt pool geometry.

TI  - Feeling the heat: Extreme temperatures compromise constitutive innate humoral immunity and skin color in a desert dwelling lizard
VL  - 83
SP  - 142-149
AB  - Environmental temperature, particularly in habitats with extreme temperature fluctuations, may shape selection pressures on life history traits. Especially in ectotherms, temperature affects performance, physiology, and in some species, skin color. Skin color can be a sexual ornament signaling the bearer's ability to resist infections, when only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defense and elaborate ornament expression. However, how the information content of these sexual traits may vary with environmental conditions has been less studied. Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae) males are blue and have a black and white collar. This conspicuous coloration signals performance and immune response, and is related to body temperature. Here, by maintaining males at higher, lower, and mean environmental temperatures we evaluated whether temperature variation influences color and constitutive innate humoral immunity (agglutination and lysis titers, estimated through hemolysis-hemagglutination assays), and whether extreme temperatures impose trade-offs between color and humoral immunity. We found that at low and high temperature treatments males had lower agglutination and lysis titers, and at low temperature, blue chroma from the dorsum declined and males became greener. Interestingly, at low and control temperature treatments, agglutination titer and blue coloration were positively correlated, whereas high temperatures revealed a trade-off between increasing agglutination titers and displaying bluer skin color. Our results suggest that in the Dickerson collared lizard even short-term variation of environmental temperature affects performance of constitutive innate humoral immunity and the brilliant blue skin color. Particularly, high temperatures may compromise some components of male's immunity and sexual signaling. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Feasibility study of carbon dioxide methanation: Assessment of various supported nickel catalyst
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) management is vital for ensuring the economic and environment viability for monetization of high CO 2 gas field. Apart from the great technical challenge in separating high concentration of CO 2 in gas field economically, the management of separated CO 2 is a fine balance between the sink-in value by sequestration and creation of value via conversion to product, constrained by the thermodynamic challenge in breaking the stable CO 2 molecule. Conversion to methane is one the exploratory idea due to ease of integration to current product line-up of PETRONAS. Catalytic conversion of CO 2 to methane are reported here over various supported nickel base catalyst, namely ZrO 2 , La 2 O 3 , and Al 2 O 3 at temperature ranging from 300 to 400°C under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts with fixed Ni loadings were prepared by wet impregnation technique, characterized and their performances were evaluated in a parallel reactor under Sabatier-based CO 2 conversion. Reaction temperature and GHSV were taken into account as two important parameters with fixed H 2 /CO 2 molar ratio. Experimental results indicate that among all catalysts, Ni/Al 2 O 3 give the highest CO 2 conversion of 74% and high CH 4 selectivity of 99% at temperature of 380°C and GHSV 10000 h -1 . This asserted Ni supported on Al 2 O 3 as a potential catalyst for CO 2 conversion and promising methanation performance over a low cost catalyst. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Early detection of eggplant fruit stored at chilling temperature using different non-destructive optical techniques and supervised classification algorithms
VL  - 159
AB  - Eggplant fruit is a chilling injury sensitive vegetable and should not be stored at lower than 12 degrees C postharvest, although fruit are often placed in temperatures as low as 0-5 degrees C. For this reason, a rapid early detection of eggplants previously stored at chilling temperatures would allow early removal of those fruit from the market. Eggplant fruit (cv. Fantasy) were stored either at 2 degrees C (chilling injurious temperature) or at 12 degrees C (safe storage temperature) for 10 days. Every 2 days, fruit from each group were sampled and left at room temperature, for one additional day. Color measurements in the CIE L*a*b* mode and reflectance data in the wavelength range 360-740 nm, Fourier Transform (FT)-NIR spectra (800-2777 nm) and hyperspectral images at the visible (400-1000 nm) and near infrared (900-1700 nm) part of the electromagnetic spectrum were also acquired on each fruit. Three supervised algorithms; partial least square (PLS), supervised vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) were applied to classify fruit according to the storage temperature. Chilling injury (CI) was subjectively evaluated, according to the presence of black seeds or of brown discolored flesh area. According to the results, although chilling injury symptoms started being evident only after the 4th day of storage at 2 degrees C, it was possible to discriminate fruit earlier, since day 2, by processing the FT-NIR spectral data with the SVM classifier (100 and 92% non-error-rate (NER)) in calibration and cross validation, respectively) in the whole period data set. Color or FT-NIR spectral data classified with PLSDA permitted relatively good classification of fruit (> 83% accuracy) since the 4th day of storage, while L, C, H degrees color measurements or Vis-NIR hyperspectral imaging data combined with PLSDA generate trustworthy models only after the 6th day of storage. On the other hand, NIR hyperspectral imaging technique and kNN classification algorithm were incapable to separate the fruit either accurately or consistently. These results indicate a good potential of adapting selected protocols, in terms of technique, processing of the raw data and supervised classification algorithm, in order to minimize postharvest losses induced by the improper temperature management of chilling sensitive fruit, such as the eggplants.

TI  - Controlling the speed and trajectory of evolution with counterdiabatic driving
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 135-142
AB  - The unpredictability of evolution makes it difficult to deal with drug resistance because over the course of a treatment there may be mutations that we cannot predict. The authors propose to use quantum methods to control the speed and distribution of potential evolutionary outcomes. The pace and unpredictability of evolution are critically relevant in a variety of modern challenges, such as combating drug resistance in pathogens and cancer, understanding how species respond to environmental perturbations like climate change and developing artificial selection approaches for agriculture. Great progress has been made in quantitative modelling of evolution using fitness landscapes, allowing a degree of prediction for future evolutionary histories. Yet fine-grained control of the speed and distributions of these trajectories remains elusive. We propose an approach to achieve this using ideas originally developed in a completely different context-counterdiabatic driving to control the behaviour of quantum states for applications like quantum computing and manipulating ultracold atoms. Implementing these ideas for the first time in a biological context, we show how a set of external control parameters (that is, varying drug concentrations and types, temperature and nutrients) can guide the probability distribution of genotypes in a population along a specified path and time interval. This level of control, allowing empirical optimization of evolutionary speed and trajectories, has myriad potential applications, from enhancing adaptive therapies for diseases to the development of thermotolerant crops in preparation for climate change, to accelerating bioengineering methods built on evolutionary models, like directed evolution of biomolecules.

TI  - Light comfort zone in a mesopelagic fish emerges from adaptive behaviour along a latitudinal gradient
VL  - 623
SP  - 161-174
AB  - Throughout the oceans, small fish and other micronekton migrate between daytime depths of several hundred meters and near-surface waters at night. These diel vertical migrations of mesopelagic organisms structure pelagic ecosystems through trophic interactions, and are a key element in the biological carbon pump. However, depth distributions and migration amplitude vary greatly. Suggested proximate causes of the migration such as oxygen, temperature, and light often correlate and therefore the causal underpinnings have remained unclear. Using mesopelagic fishes and the Norwegian Sea as a study system, we developed a dynamic state variable model that finds optimal migration patterns that we validate with acoustic observations along a latitudinal gradient. The model describes predation risk and bioenergetics, and maximizes expected energy surplus, a proxy for Darwinian fitness. The model allows us to disentangle the drivers of migration and make predictions about depth distribution and related fitness consequences along a latitudinal trajectory with strong gradients in environmental drivers and vertical distribution of scattering layers. We show that the model-predicted vertical migration of mesopelagic fishes matches that observed along this transect. For most situations, modelled mesopelagic fish behaviour can be well described by a light comfort zone near identical to that derived from observations. By selectively keeping light or temperature constant, the model reveals that temperature, in comparison with light, has little effect on depth distribution. We find that water clarity, which limits how deeply light can penetrate into the ocean, structures daytime depths, while surface light at night controlled the depth of nocturnal ascents. © The authors 2019.

TI  - Comprehensive footprint assessment of apple and citrus loss and waste
VL  - 29
IS  - 4
SP  - 683-690
AB  - In recent years, food waste has become a global research topic, and fruit loss and waste is an important component of food waste. From the place of origin to the table, fruit waste occurs during picking, post-harvest processing, storage, circulation, consumption, and other stages with varying degrees of loss. Therefore, it is necessary to study the loss and waste of the whole fruit industry in China and to analyze the impact of its resources on the environment. The purpose of this study is to provide data to reduce the loss and waste of fruit and improve the utilization efficiency of ecological resources. Using apples and citrus as examples, this study investigated all of the links in the whole fruit industry chain via questionnaires and field visits. The total amount of loss and waste was estimated, including the ecological, carbon, and water footprints using key parameters, such as greenhouse gas emissions and water waste. A field survey was conducted in the main fruit marketing area to investigate and analyze the loss and waste of fruit during production, post-harvest treatment, storage, circulation, and consumption. This included 209 workers in the entire industrial chain in the main producing area and 271 consumers in the main selling area. The results showed that the wastage rates of apples and citrus were 18.56% and 17.15%, respectively, among which the wastage rate of the circulation link was the highest, accounting for approximately one-third of the total wastage. The wastage for apples and citrus were 719.86×104 t and 733.99×104 t, respectively, for a total loss of 1453.85×104 t. The ecological footprint of apple and citrus wastage was 13.33×104 hm2 and 13.76×104 hm2, respectively, and the total ecological footprint was 26.09×104 hm2. The carbon footprint was 92.37×104 t (CO2 eq) and 102.98×104 t (CO2 eq), respectively, and the total carbon footprint was 195.35×104 t (CO2 eq). The water footprint was 57.65×108 m3 and 41.10×108 m3, respectively, and the total water footprint was 98.75×108 m3. During circulation, jolting, bumping, and squeezing could damage the fruit, resulting in loss; the highest in the entire supply chain. Bumps and squeezes during transportation were the main reasons for loss. Improper selection and temperature control by consumers during sales also caused fruit spoilage. The highest carbon emissions from production accounted for more than 90% of the carbon footprint, mainly due to the application of pesticides and fertilizers. To reduce fruit loss and waste and to improve the utilization efficiency of resources, some measures could be taken, such as improving the mechanization and standardization of fruit production levels and reducing the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In the circulation process, operators must keep the environment clean and tidy. Moreover, an entirely cold-chain process should be advocated, and waste should be opposed during consumption. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - An urban vulnerability index for cities in the middle east
VL  - 3
SP  - 1043-1045
AB  - There is a growing consensus on the influences of heat waves and increased temperature as among the most threatening climate change phenomena to human mortality. In addition, the effect of heat waves is exacerbated significantly in cities as a result of urban heat islands effect. Such intensification of heat waves combined by potentially prolonged periods of extreme temperature will pose huge risks on human mortality in the built environment. Over the past decade, a number of metrics in literature have been developed to assess human thermal risks and their response to extreme climate conditions. However, most of these metrics take into account socioeconomic factors, housing characteristics and climatic risks without looking at the spatial characteristics across the city. Yet, the combination of these factors on an urban resolution haven't been largely explored yet, specifically for vulnerable population with low access to adaptation resources and minimum potentials for ventilation. The paper presents the framework of an urban vulnerability index based on identifying parameters that correlate with thermal discomfort on urban block level and building level. The study analyzes a historical residential neighborhood in Cairo, Egypt to examine the applicability of the proposed index in understanding levels of vulnerability under extreme temperatures. © Copyright: PLEA 2018 Hong Kong.

TI  - Genus-wide comparison of Pseudovibrio bacterial genomes reveal diverse adaptations to different marine invertebrate hosts
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudovibrio have been frequently found in association with a wide variety of marine eukaryotic invertebrate hosts, indicative of their versatile and symbiotic lifestyle. A recent comparison of the sponge-associated Pseudovibrio genomes has shed light on the mechanisms influencing a successful symbiotic association with sponges. In contrast, the genomic architecture of Pseudovibrio bacteria associated with other marine hosts has received less attention. Here, we performed genus-wide comparative analyses of 18 Pseudovibrio isolated from sponges, coral, tunicates, flatworm, and seawater. The analyses revealed a certain degree of commonality among the majority of sponge- and coral-associated bacteria. Isolates from other marine invertebrate host, tunicates, exhibited a genetic repertoire for cold adaptation and specific metabolic abilities including mucin degradation in the Antarctic tunicate-associated bacterium Pseudovibrio sp. Tun.PHSC04_5.I4. Reductive genome evolution was simultaneously detected in the flatworm-associated bacteria and the sponge-associated bacterium P. axinellae AD2, through the loss of major secretion systems (type III/VI) and virulence/symbioses factors such as proteins involved in adhesion and attachment to the host. Our study also unraveled the presence of a CRISPR-Cas system in P. stylochi UST20140214-052 a flatworm-associated bacterium possibly suggesting the role of CRISPR-based adaptive immune system against the invading virus particles. Detection of mobile elements and genomic islands (GIs) in all bacterial members highlighted the role of horizontal gene transfer for the acquisition of novel genetic features, likely enhancing the bacterial ecological fitness. These findings are insightful to understand the role of genome diversity in Pseudovibrio as an evolutionary strategy to increase their colonizing success across a wide range of marine eukaryotic hosts. © 2018 Alex, Antunes.

AB  - This study investigates a potential application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as a relatively new approach for predicting solar still productivity (SSP). Five variables, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation (SR), feed flow rate (MF), and total dissolved solids of feed (TDSF) and brine (TDSB), were used as input parameters. The data were collected from an experimental solar still system used to desalinate seawater in an arid climate. The data were distributed randomly into training, testing, and validation datasets. A hybrid learning algorithm and eight different membership functions were applied to generate the ANFIS models. Several statistical criteria were used to assess the model performances. The ANFIS model with a generalized bell membership function provided the best prediction accuracy compared with models with other membership functions. The coefficient of correlation values for this model were 0.999, 0.959, and 0.832 for training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively. Sensitivity analysis (SA) was used to show the effectiveness of the considered input parameters for predicting SSP. The SA results indicated that SSP is the most influential parameter on SSP. Generally, the findings indicate the robustness of the ANFIS approach for estimating SSP. © IWA Publishing 2018.

VL  - 42

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein is considered as a potential indicator of animal adaptation to harsh environmental stresses and its expression has been correlated with resistance to stress. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the seasonal variation in heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) and their association with frozen semen quality and fertility in buffaloes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During summer and winter, ejaculates (n = 32) were collected from buffalo bulls, diluted with freshly prepared Andromed extender (maintained at 34 degrees C) up to 80 million sperm per mL. The diluted semen was filled in French midi straws, equilibrated, and cryopreserved. The semen was evaluated at pre-freeze and post-thaw stages for heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90), and sperm quality parameters. RESULTS: The levels of HSP70 were significantly (P = 0.00) higher in summer season compared to winter season. The HSP70 had a positive correlation with mass motility (P < 0.05; r = 0.39), live sperm count (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and acrosomal integrity (P < 0.05; r = 0.37). The first artificial insemination conception rate (FAICR) had a positive correlation with HSP70 (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and HSP90 (P < 0.05; r = 0.59), in frozen-thawed semen. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the levels of heat shock proteins may help in predicting cryo-tolerance and fertility of buffalo semen during various seasons.

VL  - 678
AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) has proven to be an unstable and hazardous component of mineral fertilizers. In order to analyze the influence of various potassium salts on thermal properties of ammonium nitrate, differential thermal analysis coupled with thermogravimetry and mass spectrometry was used. Each potassium salt was mixed with AN to create samples with AN:salt mass ratios of 4:1, 9:1 and 49:1. It was concluded that an addition of potassium influences phase transitions of AN. Depending on the salt used, an exothermic decomposition of AN was either accelerated (potassium chloride) or inhibited to the varying degree. Carbonate salts and potassium metabisulfite were too reactive to be used in a fertilizer production, while nitrate, sulphate and both phosphates are considered to be appropriate additives and could be used in a multicomponent fertilizer production. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 24

SP  - 8232-8238
AB  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global public health crisis with social, psychological and long-lasting economical damages. Weather-related dynamics have an impact on the pattern of human health and disease. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of heat and humidity on daily basis incidence and mortality due to COVID-19 pandemic in ten of the world's hottest countries compared to ten of the coldest ones. Materials and Methods: Worldwide, we selected 20 countries; 10 hottest countries with the highest temperatures and 10 coldest countries with the lowest temperature. The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.31±1.51) and humidity (44.67±4.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.19±1.61) and humidity (57.26±2.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web "Time and Date". Results: In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.12±24.33); cumulative cases (9094.34±708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.84±43.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72±207.37); cumulative cases (44232.38±5875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29±310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (β = -5.40, p<0.001) and (β = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1°C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (β = -1.35. p<0.001). Conclusions: The results revealed a significant decrease in incidence of daily cases and deaths in countries with high temperatures and low humidity (warmest countries), compared to those countries with low temperatures and high humidity (coldest countries). The findings could be of interest to the policymakers and the health officials on the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic and weather changes. © 2020 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

TI  - Disentangling plasticity from local adaptation in diapause expression in parasitoid wasps from contrasting thermal environments: A reciprocal translocation experiment
VL  - 124
IS  - 4
SP  - 756-764
AB  - An important question in evolutionary ecology is to understand the drivers of phenotypic variation in contrasting environments. Disentangling plasticity from evolutionary responses in such contexts provides a better understanding of how organisms adapt to changing climates. Many aspects of the seasonal ecology of insect populations are essential for their persistence in temperate environments, including their capacity to overwinter. Phenotypic plasticity should result in locally adapted diapause levels to experienced environmental conditions. Using an outdoor reciprocal translocation experimental design, we compared diapause expression of Canadian and French populations of aphid parasitoid species of the genus Aphidius in both their native and foreign bioclimatic regions, the insects thus experiencing varying temperature conditions under similar latitude (i.e. same photoperiod). From June to December 2016, diapause and mortality levels were recorded every 2 weeks. We found both genotypic (population origins) and environmental effects (experimental locations) on diapause reaction norms of parasitoid species. The incidence of diapause was higher in Canadian populations (up to 90%) than in French populations ( < 20%) at both locations, suggesting local adaptation to harsh (Canadian populations) or mild (French populations) winter climatic conditions in the area of origin. Phenotypic plasticity played an important role in mediating diapause incidence at different temperatures but similar photoperiods, as diapause was induced at higher levels in Canada than in France, independently of the origin of the parasitoid. We conclude that both plastic and evolutionary responses could be involved in the adaptation of parasitoid overwintering strategies to different thermal environments and to ongoing climate warming. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

TI  - Can gypsy moth stand the heat? A reciprocal transplant experiment with an invasive forest pest across its southern range margin
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SP  - 1365-1378
AB  - Temperature provides important physiological constraints that can influence the distribution of an invasive species. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is a generalist defoliator in North America and supraoptimal temperatures (above the optimal for developmental rate) have been implicated in range dynamics at the southern invasion front in West Virginia and Virginia. We sourced egg masses from the Appalachian Mountains (AM), where the gypsy moth range is expanding, from the Coastal Plain (CP), where range retraction is occurring, and from a long-established population in New York (NY) and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to compare development and fitness components among these populations at two sites along the southern invasion front. We found evidence of sublethal effects from rearing in the CP, with decreased pupal mass and fewer eggs compared to individuals reared in the AM, but little difference between source populations in developmental traits. The AM and NY populations did experience reductions in egg viability under a southern winter at the CP site compared to control wintering conditions, while the CP egg masses had equivalent survival. This study provides empirical support for negative fitness consequences of supraoptimal temperatures at the southern range edge, consistent with patterns of range retraction and spread in the region, as well as suggesting the potential for local adaptation through variation in egg survival. Our work illustrates that sublethal effects from high temperature can be an important factor determining the distribution of invasive species under current and future climates. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Ontogenic differences and sexual dimorphism of the locomotor performance in a nocturnal gecko, Tarentola mauritanica
AB  - Locomotion performance in reptiles is deeply associated with habitat use, escape from predators, prey capture, and territory defense. As ectotherms, this trait in lizards is extremely sensitive to body temperature (BT). However, most studies rarely look at locomotion patterns in an ontogenic perspective. The Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, was used to investigate the possible effects of distinct BTs on the locomotor performance within juveniles and adults. Not surprisingly, adult individuals significantly outperform the juveniles in speed at every BT. Moreover, except in the 30-day-old juveniles, there is a general trend for an increase of speed with BT. The comparison of these speed values with the ones obtained for diurnal lizard species, corroborates the premise that because nocturnal species are subject to low thermal heterogeneity, little selection for behavioral thermoregulation, but strong selection for high performance at relatively cool temperatures are expected. Furthermore, the higher locomotor performance in adults at 29°C, roughly coincides with previously obtained preferred BTs. However, further studies need to be conducted to build the full performance curve, and to validate the existence of coadaption between behavioral thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity of physiological performance. Finally, this study has found that adult males run significantly faster than females at the highest BTs, highlighting the importance in understanding sex differences, and its potential to drive sex-specific behaviors, ecology, and ultimately fitness. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Aim: We examine how environmental variability at seasonal and interannual time-scales influences evolutionary trajectories and the role of plasticity in response to recent and future climate change at biogeographic scales. We investigate the interplay of selection pressures at chronic (performance) and acute (thermal stress) time-scales. Location: Colorado, USA. Time period: 1950–2099. Major taxa studied: A montane butterfly, clouded sulphur (Colias eriphyle W.H. Edwards, 1876). Methods: We leverage field and laboratory data to construct phenotype-based models that predict fitness and evolutionary responses to recent and future climate change. Our focal phenotype, wing solar absorptivity, responds plastically to developmental (pupal) temperatures and determines adult fitness via its influence on body temperature. Results: We project that phenology accelerates with decreasing elevation and climate change, but gradients in pupal and adult temperature with climate change are modest. Fitness of the first generation is predicted to decrease at low elevations and increase at high elevations with warming. Elevational clines in optimal wing absorptivity shift towards lower absorptivities with warming. We project that temporal shifts from selection for wing darkening (to extend flight time) to selection for wing lightening (to avoid overheating) in some cool, montane locations will ultimately impose fitness costs. Main conclusions: Our analysis suggests that shifts in the balance of selection between acute and chronic responses to environmental variation will alter biogeographic responses to climate change. Evolutionary lags may ultimately confer greater sensitivity to climate change, but plasticity can reduce evolutionary lags by facilitating trait evolution. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Extreme heat events are mainly responsible for weather-related human mortality due to climate change. However, there is a lack of outdoor thermal management for protecting people from extreme heat events. We present a novel infrared-radiation-enhanced nanofiber membrane (NFM) that has good infrared resonance absorption and selectively radiates thermal radiation of the human body through the atmosphere and into the cold outer space. The NFM comprises polyamide 6 (PA6) nanofibers and randomly distributed SiO2 submicron spheres and has sufficient air permeability and thermal-moisture comfortability because of its interconnect nanopores and micropores. We measure the sky radiative cooling performance under a clear sky, and PA6/SiO2 NFM produces temperatures that are about 0.4-1.7 °C lower than those of commercial textiles when covering dry and wet hands and temperatures 1.0-2.5 °C lower than the ambient temperature when thermal conduction and convection are isolated in a closed device. Our processed PA6/SiO2 NFM combines sky radiative cooling with thermal management of the human body very well, which will promote the development of radiative cooling textiles. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

SP  - 129-137
AB  - Business of fabricating solar thermal devices can play an important role in the economic growth of the country. These technologies can create more employment opportunities in rural as well as urban areas and supplement conventional energy sources in addition to reducing carbon emission. For starting a new business, economic feasibility needs to be assessed in terms of break-even analysis and economic attributes. Banks provide loans only on the basis of economic attributes of the project. Therefore, an attempt has been made to determine the various economic indicators for a unit of three novel solar thermal devices namely, animal feed solar cooker, non-tracking solar cooker and solar dryer for guiding new entrepreneurs. The different economic parameters such as break-even point, net present value, pay back period, benefit-cost ratio, annuity and internal rate of return were determined and found highly profitable while judging the economic viability of the solar devices business. On the basis of break-even-analysis, fabrication and sale of only 37 units annually is sufficient to reach a state of no profit and no loss. The net average annual benefit accrued from this business fabricating 100 units annually is INR 189 800 ($ 2 673). In addition, this business can play a vital role in providing employment to four persons. It also has a great potential to reduce CO2 emission. © 2020, Int.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization (0, 40, 80, 120, 160 kg N ha−1) on changes in selected physical, thermal, and geometric parameters of camelina seeds. Samples 0 kg N ha−1 and 40 kg N ha−1 formed a homogenous group with lower values of 1,000 seed weight and differed significantly from the second homogeneous group of samples 80, 120, and 160 kg N ha−1 with higher 1,000 seed weight. Nitrogen fertilization did not exert a significant effect on bulk density, true density, or porosity. Fertilization had no significant effect on the thermal properties of camelina seeds. Based on all linear dimensions and shape factors, samples 0 and 40 kg N ha−1 formed one homogenous group and were significantly different from the remaining samples. Samples 0 and 40 kg N ha−1 were characterized by the lowest values of linear dimensions, including length, width, surface area, profile specific perimeter, and convex perimeter, the lowest values of selected shape factors, including diameter range, standard deviation of all radii, Blair-Bliss coefficient, and Danielsson coefficient, as well as the highest values of the radius ratio and roundness. Practical Applications: Nitrogen fertilization strongly influences the properties of camelina seeds. Camelina seeds subjected to 120 kg N ha−1 were characterized by the highest dimensions, such as: length, width, surface area, and high values of 1,000 seed weight and they may be most desirable to be used in practice. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VL  - 11

SP  - 465-481
AB  - Mixed culture-based syngas biomethanation is a robust bioconversion process with high versatility in terms of exploitable feedstocks and potential applications, as it could be operated independently, or coupled to anaerobic digestion systems and in-situ biogas upgrading processes. Typically, the syngas biomethanation consists in the stepwise conversion of syngas into methane through a number of catabolic routes, which may vary considerably depending on the operating conditions. In this study, two enrichments were performed at 37 °C and 60 °C to investigate the effect of the incubation temperature on the microbial selection process and the dominant catabolic routes followed. This was carried out through the characterization of the catabolic routes and the microbial composition of the enriched cultures, and a thermodynamic feasibility study on their metabolic networks. The enrichments resulted in two stable microbial consortia with different patterns of activity. The mesophilic enriched consortium presented a more intricate metabolic network composed by four microbial trophic groups, where aceticlastic methanogenesis contributed to 64.9 ± 8.3% of the CH4 production. The metabolic network of the thermophilic enriched consortium was much simpler, consisting in the syntrophic association of carboxydotrophic hydrogenogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. This led to significant differences in methane productivity, corresponding to 1.83 ± 0.27 and 33.48 ± 0.90 mmol CH4/g VSS/h for the mesophilic and the thermophilic enriched consortium, respectively, which would potentially make the thermophilic consortium more suited for industrial applications. 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis indicated the presence of strains with similarity to Acetobacterium sp., Methanospirillum hungateii, Methanospirillum stamsii and Methanothrix sp. at mesophilic conditions, and Thermincola carboxydiphila and Methanothermobacter sp. at thermophilic conditions, implying a role in the conversion of syngas. The thermodynamic feasibility study demonstrated that the microbial selection was not driven solely by kinetic competition, since thermodynamic limitations also played a significant role defining the dominant catabolic routes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Antarctic tundra soil metagenome as useful natural resources of cold-active lignocelluolytic enzymes
VL  - 57
IS  - 10
SP  - 865-873
AB  - Lignocellulose composed of complex carbohydrates and aromatic heteropolymers is one of the principal materials for the production of renewable biofuels. Lignocellulose-degrading genes from cold-adapted bacteria have a potential to increase the productivity of biological treatment of lignocellulose biomass by providing a broad range of treatment temperatures. Antarctic soil metagenomes allow to access novel genes encoding for the cold-active lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, for biotechnological and industrial applications. Here, we investigated the metagenome targeting cold-adapted microbes in Antarctic organic matter-rich soil (KS 2-1) to mine lignolytic and celluloytic enzymes by performing single molecule, real-time metagenomic (SMRT) sequencing. In the assembled Antarctic metagenomic contigs with relative long reads, we found that 162 (1.42%) of total 11,436 genes were annotated as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy). Actinobacteria, the dominant phylum in this soil’s metagenome, possessed most of candidates of lignocellulose catabolic genes like glycoside hydrolase families (GH13, GH26, and GH5) and auxiliary activity families (AA7 and AA3). The predicted lignocellulose degradation pathways in Antarctic soil metagenome showed synergistic role of various CAZyme harboring bacterial genera including Streptomyces, Streptosporangium, and Amycolatopsis. From phylogenetic relationships with cellular and environmental enzymes, several genes having potential for participating in overall lignocellulose degradation were also found. The results indicated the presence of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria in Antarctic tundra soil and the potential benefits of the lignocelluolytic enzymes as candidates for cold-active enzymes which will be used for the future biofuel-production industry. © 2019, The Microbiological Society of Korea.

VL  - 10

SP  - 5064-5076
AB  - Methanol synthesis by means of direct CO2 hydrogenation has the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by turning the most important greenhouse gas into a commodity. However, for this process to become industrially relevant, catalytic systems with improved activity, selectivity, and stability are required. Here, we explore the potential of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors for synthesis of Co3O4-supported In2O3 oxide composites for the direct CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Stepwise pyrolytic-oxidative decomposition of indium-impregnated ZIF-67(Co) MOFs affords the formation of a nanostructured In2O3@Co3O4 reticulated shell composite material able to reach a maximum methanol production rate of 0.65 gMeOH·gcat -1·h-1 with selectivity as high as 87% over 100 h on stream. Textural characteristics of the sacrificial ZIF-67(Co) matrix and In-loading were found to be important variables for optimizing the catalyst performance such as induction time, methanol productivity, and selectivity. The structural investigation on the catalytic system reveals that the catalyst undergoes reorganization under reaction conditions, transforming from Co3O4 with an amorphous In2O3 shell into Co3InC0.75 covered by a layer consisting of a mixture of amorphous CoOx and In2O3 oxides. Structural reorganization is responsible for the observed induction period, while the amorphous mixed cobalt indium oxide shell is responsible for the high methanol yield and selectivity. Additionally, these results demonstrate the tunable performance of MOF-derived In2O3@Co3O4 catalysts as a function of the reaction conditions which allows us to establish a reasonable trade-off between high methanol yield and selectivity in a wide temperature and pressure window.

TI  - Meta-analysis of growth and mortality rates of net cultured sea scallops across the Northwest Atlantic
VL  - 546
AB  - Scallops are one of the most heavily traded and widely consumed seafood in the world and the vast majority of production comes from aquaculture. In 2018, the global value of scallop aquaculture was over $5.8 billion USD with farms producing nearly three times the biomass as the entirety of the wild harvest. North American (specifically U.S. and Canadian) scallop aquaculture lags far behind the rest of the world. The U.S. is home to a valuable Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fishery. Yet demand for scallops far outstrips supply and the U.S. imports an almost equal amount, by value, of farmed scallop products. To capitalize on this trade imbalance, U.S. and Canadian aquaculturists have been developing a farmed sea scallop (hereafter scallop) industry, employing the Japanese practices of suspended net culture and the sale of whole and “roe-on” products. We examined the combined effects of culture method and environment on scallop shell growth and mortality. We compiled all published net cultured scallop shell growth and mortality rates recorded in the last 45 years in the Northwest Atlantic. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we identified significant nonlinear interactions between growth, mortality, environmental conditions, and culture methods applicable from Maine, USA to Newfoundland, Canada. Optimum shell growth occurs within a temperature window of 10–15 °C. Growth is higher in pearl nets than in lantern nets, and is also highly sensitive to stocking density, which has large implications for farm sizes and thinning practices. Maximum mortality occurs at the highest temperatures in our dataset (~17 °C), while stocking density is only a significant predictor of product loss at high densities. Scallops are also more susceptible to mortality at shell heights under 25 mm. Both mortality rates and shell height growth rates were lower in the late spring and early summer after accounting for temperature effects. Careful temperature based site selection and proactive low density stocking can mitigate the effects of intraspecific competition and reduce handling related mortality. Identifying lease sites that provide both optimal environmental conditions and adequate space for low density net culture will be an important step in expanding scallop aquaculture in the Northwest Atlantic. © 2021 The Author(s)

TI  - Unique genetic signatures of local adaptation over space and time for diapause, an ecologically relevant complex trait, in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 16
IS  - 11
AB  - Organisms living in seasonally variable environments utilize cues such as light and temperature to induce plastic responses, enabling them to exploit favorable seasons and avoid unfavorable ones. Local adapation can result in variation in seasonal responses, but the genetic basis and evolutionary history of this variation remains elusive. Many insects, including Drosophila melanogaster, are able to undergo an arrest of reproductive development (diapause) in response to unfavorable conditions. In D. melanogaster, the ability to diapause is more common in high latitude populations, where flies endure harsher winters, and in the spring, reflecting differential survivorship of overwintering populations. Using a novel hybrid swarm-based genome wide association study, we examined the genetic basis and evolutionary history of ovarian diapause. We exposed outbred females to different temperatures and day lengths, characterized ovarian development for over 2800 flies, and reconstructed their complete, phased genomes. We found that diapause, scored at two different developmental cutoffs, has modest heritability, and we identified hundreds of SNPs associated with each of the two phenotypes. Alleles associated with one of the diapause phenotypes tend to be more common at higher latitudes, but these alleles do not show predictable seasonal variation. The collective signal of many small-effect, clinally varying SNPs can plausibly explain latitudinal variation in diapause seen in North America. Alleles associated with diapause are segregating in Zambia, suggesting that variation in diapause relies on ancestral polymorphisms, and both pro- and anti-diapause alleles have experienced selection in North America. Finally, we utilized outdoor mesocosms to track diapause under natural conditions. We found that hybrid swarms reared outdoors evolved increased propensity for diapause in late fall, whereas indoor control populations experienced no such change. Our results indicate that diapause is a complex, quantitative trait with different evolutionary patterns across time and space. Author summary Animals exhibit diverse strategies to cope with unfavorable conditions in temperate, seasonally varying environments. The model fly, Drosophila melanogaster, can enter a physiological state known as diapause under winter-like conditions. Diapause is characterized by an absence of egg maturation in females and is thought to conserve energy for survival during stressful times. The ability to diapause is more common in flies from higher latitudes and in offspring from flies that have recently overwintered. Therefore, diapause has been thought to be a recent adaptation to temperate climates. We identified hundreds of genetic variants that affect diapause and found that some vary predictably across latitudes in North America. We found little signal of repeated seasonality in diapause-associated genetic variants, but our populations evolved an increased ability to diapause in the winter when they were exposed to natural conditions. Combined, our results suggest that diapause-associated variants evolve differently across space and time. We find little evidence that diapause evolved recently in temperate environments; rather, alleles associated with diapause are as common as expected in Zambia, suggesting that diapause may promote survival under stresses other than cold. Our results provide future targets for research into the genetic underpinnings of this complex, ecologically relevant trait.

TI  - How Surface Species Drive Product Distribution during Ammonia Oxidation: An STM and Operando APXPS Study
VL  - 11
IS  - 13
SP  - 8261-8273
AB  - The oxidation of ammonia is a key reaction for the production of artificial fertilizers and for environmental protection. Depending on the area of application, the catalytic reaction needs to be tuned toward the production of either N2 or NO, and this selectivity is controlled by temperature, pressure, reactant ratio, and the type of catalyst. PtRh alloys are highly useful catalytic materials for the oxidation of ammonia, and they can be employed at different reaction conditions. In contrast to pure Pt and Rh catalysts, for which a large number of studies of ammonia oxidation reaction mechanism are available, for PtRh alloys, direct spectroscopic evidence for structure-performance relationship is still lacking. To understand the behavior of PtRh alloys, namely, what is their active phase under reaction conditions and how the alloy composition leads to a particular product distribution, we study the oxidation of ammonia over PtRh/Pt(111) surfaces by simultaneous operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry at 1 mbar total reaction pressure. These data are complemented by a catalyst surface characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy in ultrahigh vacuum. We establish that the predominant surface structure during NH3 oxidation strongly depends on the degree of Pt enrichment and the O2/NH3 mixing ratio. At the nanoscale, the selectivity toward N2 or NO production is driven by the surface populations of N and O species. These, in turn, are controlled by the nature of the alloying of Pt with Rh. © 2021 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

TI  - Effects of spatially heterogeneous warming on gut microbiota, nutrition and gene flow of a heat-sensitive ungulate population
VL  - 806
AB  - Effects of climate warming on trophic cascades are increasingly reported for large herbivores occupying northern latitudes. During the last 40 years, moose (Alces alces) in northeast China have lost nearly half of their historical distribution through their habitat shifting northwards. There are many possible causes of bottom-up and topdown effects of temperature and for moose in northeast China they are poorly understood. Of particular relevance are the effects of extrinsic environmental factors on gene flow, nutritional adaptions, and gut microbiota that occur as moose populations retreat northwards. We combined molecular biology, nutritional ecology and metagenomics to gain deeper mechanistic insights into the effects of temperature on moose populations. In this study, we revealed that the direction and intensity of gene flow is consistent with global warming driving retreats of moose populations. We interpret this as evidence for the northward movement of moose populations, with cooler northern populations receiving more immigrants and warmer southern populations supplying emigrants. Comparison across latitudes showed that warmer late spring temperatures were associated with plant community composition and facilitated related changes in moose protein and carbohydrate intake through altering forage availability, forage quality and diet composition. Furthermore, these nutrient shifts were accompanied by changes in gut microbial composition and functional pathways related to nutrient metabolism. This study provided insights into mechanisms driving effects of spatial heterogeneous warming on genetic, nutritional and physiological adaptions related to key demographic rates and patterns of survival of heat-sensitive ungulates along a latitude gradient. Understanding such changes helps to identify key habitat areas and plant species to ensure accurate assessment of population status and targeted management of moose populations.

TI  - Modelling of metal hydride hydrogen compressors from thermodynamics of hydrogen – Metal interactions viewpoint: Part II. Assessment of the performance of metal hydride compressors
VL  - 46

SP  - 2339-2350
AB  - Performance of the thermally-driven metal hydride hydrogen compressor (MHHC) is defined by (a) its H-2 compression ratio and maximum output H-2 pressure; (b) throughput productivity/average output flow rate; (c) specific thermal energy consumption which determines H-2 compression efficiency. In earlier studies, the focus of the R&D efforts was on the optimisation of the design of the MH containers and heat and mass transfer in the MH storage and compression systemaimed at shortening the time of the H-2 compression cycle. This work considers an important but insufficiently studied aspect of the development of the industrial-scale thermally driven MHHC's - selection of the materials and optimisation of the materials performance. Further to the operation in the specified pressure/temperature ranges, materials selection should be based on the estimation of the productivity of the compression cycle, and specific heat consumption required for the H-2 compression, which together determine the process efficiency. The current work presents a model to determine productivity and heat consumption for a single- and multi-stage MHHC's which is based on use of Pressure - Composition - Temperature (PCT) diagrams of the utilized metal hydrides at defined operating conditions e temperatures and hydrogen pressures - and main operational features of the MHHC (number of stages, amounts of the MH materials used, cycle time). In Part I of this work [Lototskyy, Yartys, et al., Int J Hydrogen Energy, DOI: 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.090], we showed that the calculated cycle productivities significantly vary for the different materials. Analysis of the system performance carried out in this work (Part II) shows that the throughput productivity and efficiency of a multi-stage MHHC also depends on the types and amounts of the used MH materials in the multi-stage compressor layout. This has been analysed for a number of the most practically important AB(5) and Laves type AB(2) hydrogen storage alloys integrated into the MHHC's. A comparison of experimentally measured performances of single-, two- and three-stage industrial-scale MHHC's developed by the authors earlier shows their satisfactory agreement with the modelling results thus demonstrating a high value of the presented method for the proper materials selection during development of the MHHC. As an important future development, the work presents a performance evaluation of a two-stage MHHC for H-2 compression operating in the pressure range from 30 to 500 atm at operating temperatures between 20 and 150 degrees C.

TI  - Reactivity Effects in a Very-High-Temperature Pebble-Bed Reactor
VL  - 47

AB  - The very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) is one of the most promising and innovative designs selected by the Generation IV International Forum. Although previous papers have focused on the study and optimization of several parameter of a VHTR conceptual design, there is still much work needed to achieve the commercial introduction of this technology. The primary aim of this study is to obtain the reactivity effects of such parameters as the temperature of the fuel, moderator, and reflector, and the poisoning by Xe-135 and Sm-149 in the VHTR critically. To reach this goal, the widely-used MCNP6 code was employed in order to simulate the neutronics of the VHTR. The viability of the utilization of the MCNP6 code and the developed model for the study of the physics of the VHTR core was confirmed through the calculation and comparison with benchmarks provided by the IAEA. Based on the results of the temperature coefficients of reactivity obtained, a negative reactivity effect on the system of about -12 pcm/K was found, as is expected in all the nuclear fission reactors, while the combined effect of fission products 135Xe and 149Sm implies a negative reactivity of -3475 pcm.

VL  - 46

SP  - 616-625
AB  - The Larimichthys crocea Daiqu group in the East China Sea was once one of the most commercially important demersal fishes unique to China's coastal waters. It is now an important target for our country to restore and rebuild the resources of L. crocea. In order to clarify the influencing factors of the decline of its resources, and reveal the selectivity of its habitat and the reasons why the resources of the L. crocea are difficult to recover, this paper took the L. crocea fishing output in Zhejiang Province from 1950 to 2020 as a sample, and analyzed the correlation between the population number changes of the L. crocea Daiqu group and major fishery events, such as knocking operation and rounding up the overwintering group in the central fishing ground, by using index analysis method, which aims to trace the causes of the decline of large yellow croaker resources; The biological characteristics and evolution of L. crocea and its adaptability to habitat were described by comprehensive literature analysis. The results showed that: (1) the main causes of the decline and depletion of L. crocea resources were caused by several unreasonable development and utilization methods, such as knocking operation, catching the incoming fishes and overfishing the wintering grounds; (2) L. crocea has the characteristics of long life span, late sexual maturity, complex population structure, and strong habitat environmental selectivity, among which temperature, salinity, flow rate, substrate and feed organisms are the key environmental factors; (3) Due to overfishing, the life history of L. crocea deviated from the original selection position, but it still belonged to K selection game. (4) In addition to human factors (such as excessive fishing intensity), the main factors affecting the recovery of L. crocea resources may also be related to the k-biased life history and habitat selection of large yellow croaker. What’s more, this study also put forward the future protection and proliferation strategies of L. crocea from the perspective of biological characteristics and habitat environmental selectivity, which provides a decision-making basis for the restoration and reconstruction of L. crocea Daiqu group in the East China Sea. © 2022 Shanghai Ocean University.

TI  - Selective synthesis of carbon nanotubes by catalytic decomposition of methane using Co-Cu/cellulose derived carbon catalysts: A comprehensive kinetic study
VL  - 404
AB  - Determination of the optimal operating conditions for large-scale production of carbonaceous nanomaterials (CNTs), mainly carbon nanotubes (CNTs) but also graphene-related materials (GRMs), remains as a major industrial and scientific challenge. For this purpose, our group is conducting an extensive study to evaluate the effect of the reaction conditions and catalyst compositions on the productivity and selectivity to different carbonaceous nanomaterials. In the case of Co-based catalysts, we have found that the promotion with Cu or Mn has a dramatic effect on the type of carbon nanomaterials synthesized. Thus, the presence of Cu promotes the growth of CNTs, while Mn favors the formation of two-dimensional GRMs. In this context, we present here a comprehensive study of the CNTs growth via catalytic decomposition of methane using a Co-Cu/cellulose derived carbon catalyst. The influence of the reaction temperature (650-950 *C) and feed composition (7.1%-42.9% of CH4 and H2) on the yield and CNTs quality was evaluated. A transition in the characteristics of the carbonaceous nanomaterial growth was observed at about 800 *C. Below this temperature, the reaction was selective towards the formation of CNTs, while above 800 *C, the obtained nanomaterial exhibited a graphite-like morphology. In addition, the catalyst deactivation was quite low in the CNTs growth regime, attaining high productivity under 11 h of operation. The model used to study the kinetics of carbon formation allowed understanding the most influential variables in the growth process, revealing the existence of a transition temperature at which there is a change in the preferential path for the formation of CNTs or GRMs. After exploring a large set of reaction conditions, the best operating parameters for growing CNTs with high productivity (0.29 gC/gcat.h) and quality (ID/IG = 1.10, I2D/IG = 0.13) were found at 750 degrees C under 28.6% CH4:14.3% H2:57.1% N2. <comment>Superscript/Subscript Available</comment

TI  - Tigris basin landscapes: Sensitivity of vegetation index ndvi to climate variability derived from observational and reanalysis data
VL  - 24
IS  - 7
SP  - 1-18
AB  - The primary aim of this work is to study the response of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of landscapes in the lower Tigris basin to current global and regional climate variability presented, respectively, by the global circulation indices and monthly temperatures and precipitation extracted from five observational/reanalysis datasets. The second task is to find the dataset that best reflects the regional vegetation and climate conditions. Comparison of the Köppen–Trewartha bioclimatic landscapes with the positions of botanical districts, land-cover types, and streamflow estimates led to the conclusion that only two datasets correctly describe regional climatic zones. Therefore, searching for the NDVI response to regional climate variability requires the use of normalized analogs of temperatures and precipitations, as well as the Spearman rank correlation. We found that March/April NDVI, as proxies of the maximum biological productivity of the regional landscapes, are strongly correlated with October–March precipitation derived from three datasets and January–March temperatures derived from one dataset. We discovered the significant impact of autumn–winter El Niño–Southern Oscillation and winter Indian Oceanic dipole states on regional weather (e.g., all five recent severe droughts occurred during strong La Niña events). However, the strength of this impact on the vegetation was clearly linked to the zonal landscape type. By selecting pairs of the temperature/precipitation time series that best correlated with NDVI at a given landscape, we have built a synthetic climate dataset. The landscape approach presented in this work can be used to validate the viability of any dataset when assessing the impacts of climate change and variability on weather-dependent components of Earth’s surface. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

TI  - Heat adhesion duration: A new high-throughput abalone thermal tolerance assessment method
VL  - 545
AB  - Under the background of continual global warming, mass summer mortalities of aquatic organisms have become more frequent, causing serious ecological and economic losses. Abalone aquaculture has experienced such losses, and thus, thermal-tolerant species are needed for mechanistic research and selective breeding programs. Hence, suitable methods to evaluate the thermal tolerance of abalone have become vitally important. In this study, a high-throughput evaluation method (heat adhesion duration, HAD) was developed based on the adhesion capacity of abalone. The stability and accuracy of the new method were verified by comparisons of survival time, Arrhenius breakpoint temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Positive correlations were found between HAD and survival time and between HAD and ABT, indicating that individuals with higher HAD were more thermal tolerant. The HAD values increased with acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C) but were not affected by abalone size, age, or sex. The assessments of HAD, ABT, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated stronger thermal tolerance of the southern population (JJ) of Haliotis discus hannai compared to the northern population (DL), suggesting plasticity of abalone in thermal tolerance. In addition, the thermal resistance of five abalone species from two hybridization systems, H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (GG), H. fulgens (FF), hybrid H. gigantea female x H. discus hannai male (GD), and hybrid H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male (DF), was evaluated by HAD and ABT, confirming the existence of heterosis for thermal tolerance. The high throughput method developed in this study could provide a reliable indicator for molecular mechanism analyses and genetic selection for thermal tolerance in abalone.

TI  - Physiological and molecular responses of the Antarctic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensis to salinity fluctuations – A multigenerational study
VL  - 204
AB  - Since Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean are facing global climate change, biota inhabiting those coastal regions is now challenged by environmental fluctuations including coastal freshening. In this study, the effects of salinity range of 0–75 (practical salinity unit, PSU) on the Antarctic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensis was investigated by measurement of 96 h survival rate, lifespan, and sex ratio with further analysis of multigenerational growth parameters and mRNA expressions under salinity of 15–45. Different stages of the copepods (i.e., nauplius, male, and female) generally showed tolerance to hypo– and hypersalinity, wherein female copepods were more tolerant than males when exposed to salinity fluctuations. Lifespan was significantly shortened by hypo- and hypersalinity compared to control salinity (34), but there was no significant difference in the sex ratio between salinity treatments. Multigenerational experiments across five generations revealed that exposure to salinities of 15 and 45 reduced body length compared to that in control salinity and the first generation of each salinity group. Our results provide evidence regarding T. kingsejongensis on their preferred salinity ranges, physiological limit to salinity fluctuations, and population dynamics in future salinity. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

SP  - 1068-1081
AB  - This paper describes the continuum thermal modeling of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process for 304L stainless steel using Abaqus. Temperature dependent thermal properties are obtained from literature and incorporated into the model capturing the change from powder to fully dense stainless steel. The thermal model predicts the temperature history for multi-track scans under different process parameters (laser power, effective scanning speed, hatch spacing) which is used to extract the melt-pool size, solidification rate, and temperature gradients. These are compared to experimental results obtained from a Renishaw AM250 in terms of the melt pool size, grain structure, and cell spacing. These experimental results are used to tune unknown simulation parameters required by the continuum model including the optical penetration depth and thermal conductivity multiplier for the molten region. This allows the model to yield predictive simulations of melt pool size and solidification structure of SLM 304L stainless steel. Copyright © SFF 2017.All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimization of forced periodic operations in milli-scale fixed bed reactor for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
VL  - 343
SP  - 156-164
AB  - One-dimensional pseudo-homogenous dynamic reactor model, incorporating detailed Fischer-Tropsch kinetics, was applied in a theoretical analysis of forced periodic operations. A milli-scale fixed-bed reactor was analyzed, using design and operation parameters, obtained previously in a steady-state optimization. Dynamic optimization and NLP methods were utilized to obtain optimal values of amplitude(s), frequency and phase shift(s) of sine-wave variation of inputs, around the corresponding optimal steady-state values, which maximize the productivity of C5+ hydrocarbons. Inlet variables that were modulated are: coolant temperature, reactants molar ratio, mass flow rate and pressure. In addition to the single input forcing, simultaneous modulations of multiple inputs were also considered, with combinations of the listed inlet variables. Among the single input cases, periodic variation of the coolant temperature resulted in the highest relative improvement of C5+ productivity by 30%. Multiple inputs forcing showed additional potential for improvement, resulting in relative C5+ productivity increase of 52% for synchronized modulation of the coolant temperature, reactants molar ratio and mass flow rate. However, the increase in C5+ productivity is accompanied with relative increase in methane selectivity of 22–33% (relative to the steady-state value). The results suggest that, in the case of multiple input variations with high amplitudes, modulation of the inlet reactants molar ratio mainly contributes to the increase of CO conversion (e.g. reaction rate), the coolant temperature forcing slightly increases selectivity towards the desirable higher hydrocarbons (C5+), while the variation of the inlet mass flow rate enables better reaction temperature control and prevents a thermal runway. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Climate change is affecting every ecosystem on Earth. Though climate change is global in scope, literature reviews on the biotic impacts of climate change have focused on temperate and polar regions. Tropical species have distinct life histories and physiologies, and ecological communities are assembled differently across latitude. Thus, tropical species and communities may exhibit different responses to climate change compared with those in temperate and polar regions. What are the fingerprints of climate change in the tropics? This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on impacts of climate change in tropical regions and discusses research priorities to better understand the ways in which species and ecological communities are responding to climate change in the most biodiverse places on Earth. © 2019 Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics.

AB  - Recently, the commercialization of hybrid machine tools that combine directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM) technology and subtractive manufacturing (SM) has rapidly progressed. This technology trend has been developed to meet the market demand for processing quality (precision) and productivity, and to produce products such as lightweight parts, and complex and special functional parts, as well as to facilitate mold production and part repair. Compared to SM technology, metal AM technology has limitations in terms of surface quality and shape accuracy. Therefore, post-processing is necessary for the AM output. Laser-assisted machining (LAM) is an innovative hybrid technique in which surface quality and productivity can be improved by enhancing the machinability of difficult-to-cut materials. LAM studies have mainly been performed on titanium alloys, nickel based alloys and ceramic materials. However, except for ceramics, no high-strength material studies have been conducted to analyze the LAM process machining characteristics of workpieces fabricated by AM process. Therefore, in this study, LAM is applied to post-processing of output fabricated by AM of Ti-6Al-4V. DED device was developed using metal powder feeder and a laser. The Ti-6Al-4V workpieces were successfully fabricated through many tests. The cutting depth for LAM was selected through thermal analysis for LAM of the fabricated workpiece. Compared to the case of traditional machining without preheating, machining characteristics in LAM experiments were analyzed and property testing was performed. © 2020, Korean Society for Precision Engineering.

AB  - Co-occurring species often differ in intraspecific genetic diversity, which in turn can affect adaptation in response to environmental change. Specifically, the simultaneous evolutionary responses of co-occurring species to temporal environmental change may influence community dynamics. Local adaptation along environmental gradients combined with gene flow can enhance genetic diversity of traits within populations. Quantitative genetic theory shows that having greater gene flow results in (a) lower equilibrium population size due to maladaptive immigrant genotypes (migration load), but (b) faster adaptation to changing environments. Here, I build off this theory to study community dynamics of locally adapted species in response to temporal environmental changes akin to warming temperatures. Although an abrupt environmental change leaves all species initially maladapted, high gene flow species subsequently adapt faster due to greater genetic diversity. As a result, species can transiently reverse their relative abundances, but sometimes only after long lag periods. If constant temporal environmental change is applied, the community exhibits a shift toward stable dominance by species with intermediate gene flow. Notably, fast-adapting high gene flow species can increase in absolute abundance under environmental change (although often only for a transient period) because the change suppresses superior competitors with lower gene flow. This eco-evolutionary competitive release stabilizes ecosystem function. The eco-evolutionary community turnover studied here parallels the purely ecological successional dynamics following disturbances. My results demonstrate how interspecific variation in life history can have far-reaching impacts on eco-evolutionary community response to environmental change. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Life table and biological characteristics of the parasitoid semielacher petiolatus reared on phyllocnistis citrella
VL  - 74
IS  - 1
SP  - 129-137
AB  - Semielacher petiolatus (Girault) (Hymenoptera Eulophidae) is an ectoparasitoid of the citrus leaf miner Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera Gracillariidae) that has been widely released in several Mediterranean countries. In an attempt to evaluate the insects temperature adaptations that play a significant role in its establishment potential, life table parameters and the effect of temperature on its fecundity, longevity, host-instar choice, superparasitism and host feeding were studied. Tests were conducted at 20, 25 and 30 +/- 0.5 degrees C with 60 +/- 10% RH and a 14L:10D photoperiod. S. petiolatus oviposition period was 21.05 +/- 2.54 days at 30 degrees C but as short as 2.25 +/- 0.23 days at 20 degrees C. Fecundity had a maximum value (173.3 +/- 27.09) at 30 degrees C followed by 143.57 +/- 22.67 and 5.13 +/- 0.81 at 25 and 20 degrees C, respectively while, 28.57% of the females failed to oviposit at 20 degrees C. Female longevity averaged between 25.20 and 20.57 days at 30 and 25 degrees C, respectively but dropped to just 5.77 days at 20 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) was highest (50.8) at 30 degrees C, and highly reduced (1.1) at 20 degrees C. Following the above pattern, mean generation time (T: 15.45 - 23.39), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m): 0.006 - 0.216) and finite rate of increase (lambda: 1.006 - 1.24) were maximum at 30 degrees C and minimum at 20 degrees C. Population-doubling time (DT) peaked to 106.94 days at 20 degrees C and was reduced to only 3.21 days at 30 degrees C. The host-choice tests showed that second and third instar larvae of P. citrella were equally selected at all temperatures. Superparasitism occurred at a rate of 5.79, 15.39 and 14.52% at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively and up to 6 eggs had been oviposited per host. Daily host feeding rates averaged 0.24, 0.41 and 0.31 hosts at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The above results indicate that S. petiolatus is much better adapted at higher temperatures typical for the Mediterranean climatic conditions during summer while its population increase is expected to be marginal at temperatures close to 20 degrees C. Overall, conservation tactics by maintaining a rich biodiversity in citrus groves for providing alternative food and shelter to the parasitoid, especially during spring before populations of P. citrella increase, should enhance its activity against early summer population of P. citrella in citrus orchards in Mediterranean countries.

TI  - Thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes
VL  - 91
AB  - Temperature is an important determinant affecting the capacity of disease vectors like mosquitoes (Culicidae) to transmit disease agents. Although the impact of temperature on vector-borne disease dynamics has been studied intensively, the actual temperature encountered by the vector in a heterogeneous landscape is rarely taken into account. If disease vectors have temperature preferences and therefore select specific microhabitats, this would substantially influence key life history traits that determine transmission intensity. The thermal preferences of subtropical Aedes aegypti and temperate Ae. japonicus mosquitoes were investigated in a temperature gradient setup consisting of a Plexiglas box on top of an aluminium plate on two thermal regulators. Blood-fed (one day after feeding) and unfed (non-blood-fed) mosquitoes were released in small (15-20 degrees C, 20-25 degrees C, 25-30 degrees C) and large (15-30 degrees C, 30-45 degrees C) temperature gradients to assess their thermal preferences after 15 min. Additionally, the effect of humidity was investigated in a two-choice chamber setup. Both mosquito species avoided higher temperatures, pronouncedly dangerously high temperatures in the 30-45 degrees C gradient. At lower temperatures, blood-fed mosquitoes preferred the cooler sides of the 20-25 degrees C and 25-30 degrees C gradient, which were all below their rearing temperature. In the lowest gradient of 15-20 degrees C, no preferences were found. The thermal preference of unfed mosquitoes was similar to that of the blood-fed mosquitoes. No humidity preference or effect of humidity on temperature preferences was observed within the tested range (40-90%). The set-up allows for assessing the thermal preference of mosquitoes under controlled conditions. The observed preference of mosquitoes for cooler temperatures would increase their longevity and slow down pathogen development. If similar micmhabitat selection is observed in the field, vector borne disease models should be adjusted accordingly.

TI  - Response of Trichogramma brassicae (Hym.: Trichogrammatidae) to temperature: Utilizing thermodynamic models to describe curvilinear development
VL  - 143
AB  - Temperature has profound effects on biological efficiency of parasitoid wasps. In the present study, effects of seven constant temperatures (12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 +/- 0.5 degrees C) on the pre-adult development of Trichogramma brassicae (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) were investigated on Sitotroga cerealella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae). Temperature effects on the emergence rate and sex ratio were also determined. The development rate of T. brassicae was described using two linear and twenty non-linear functions and critical bioclimatic temperatures (i.e., T-min, T-opt, T-max and k) were estimated. Efficiency of models was assessed by different criteria (i.e., R-2, R-adj(2), SSE, AIC, AICc, BIC and zi). Rate of development increased from 12 to 30 degrees C but decreased at two higher temperatures (i.e., 32 and 35 degrees C). At all thermal regimes a higher number of female individuals was emerged than males (1.81, 2.23, 2.03, 1.44, 1.78 and 1.78 female: male, respectively). At 12 degrees C, the lowest rate of parasitoid emergence (9%) was observed. The lower threshold predicted by the two linear models were 8.13 (Ordinary regression method) and 8.36 degrees C (Ikemoto method). These models predicted the thermal constant for pre-adult development as 181 and 177 DD, respectively. The estimates of optimum temperature ranged from 30 to 32 degrees C with an upper threshold between 36 and 41 degrees C, depending on which model was used. Based on both biological and statistical goodness-of-fit criteria, the non-linear model of Lactin-1 had the best described the experimental data. The information herein highlighted the higher performance of T. brassicae at tropical conditions and can be helpful to predict possible effects of temperature on developmental rate, select the best period of time for inundative release and improve mass rearing protocols of this parasitoid wasp.

TI  - Rapid adaptation in phoretic mite development time
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Strong ecological selection can erode genetic variation and render populations unable to deal with changes in ecological conditions. In the adaptation of the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi to its host, the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, the timing of reproduction is crucial. Safe mite development is only possible during the beetles’ brood care; mites that develop too slowly will have virtually zero fitness. If the strong specialisation in development time leaves no room for standing genetic variation to remain, changes in beetle brood care are disastrous. Beetle brood care depends on temperature and is thus vulnerable to changing climate. Accidental host switches to another beetle species with shorter brood care would also have negative effects on the mites. Only sufficient standing genetic variation could allow mismatched mite lines to survive and adapt. To test whether such rapid adaptation is possible in principle, we artificially selected on mite generation time. We were able to speed up, but not to slow down, mite development. We conclude that there is enough standing genetic variation in development time to allow P. carabi to quickly adapt to new host species or climate conditions, which could potentially lead to the evolution of new mite species. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Study on Ethanol Coupling Reaction Based on BP Neural Network and Correlation
SP  - 346-351
AB  - Butanol and C4 olefins, as important chemical raw materials, are widely used in the production of chemical products and pharmaceutical intermediates. Traditional production methods use fossil energy as raw materials, but with the shortage of fossil energy production and the aggravation of its impact on the environment, the energy supply gradually tends to be diversified, and the development of new clean energy is becoming more and more urgent. Ethanol molecules can be prepared by biomass fermentation. They have a wide range of sources and are green and clean. They are used as platform molecules to produce high value-added butanol and C_4 olefins have great application prospects and economic benefits, and have attracted extensive attention at home and abroad. However, in the current industrial production, the catalyst combination and temperature have a great impact on the conversion of ethylene and the selectivity of C4 olefins, and its selection and control greatly affect the production efficiency of C4 olefins. This paper focuses on the influence effect and degree of two factors on two dependent variables in the process of preparing C4 olefins by ethylene coupling reaction. By establishing the least square curve to fit the temperature and ethanol conversion and the temperature and C4 olefin selectivity, the fitting curve is obtained. It can be seen that the temperature has a primary or quadratic function relationship with the ethanol conversion or C4 olefin selectivity, so it is judged that it has a certain influence, Then the effects of temperature, catalyst group and loading method on ethanol conversion and C4 olefin selectivity were obtained by Spearman correlation coefficient and random forest regression algorithm. Based on this result, the model is established, optimized and analyzed, and the optimal catalyst combination and temperature are obtained, so as to obtain the highest C4 olefin yield and achieve the maximum industrial benefit © 2022 IEEE.

VL  - 13
IS  - 3
SP  - 1546-1556
AB  - Silver pompano (Trachinotus blochii) has received tremendous attention from the aquaculture sector, due to its favourable features, such as a high economic value, its good adaptive response and its potential to be cultured in various salinities. The aim of this study was to discover the effects of medium salinities on osmotic performance rate, blood cortisol, and growth performance (absolute growth weight and lenght, specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion (FC), feed efficiency (FE), survival rate (SR)) of T. blochii under recirculating system. The histological alterations (kidney and gill) and water quality (temperature, pH, DO, NH3, NO2 and NO3) were also observed. The 56-day experiment was carried out in Balai Perikanan Budidaya Laut (BPBL) of Batam, Indonesia. A total of 300 fish specimens (11-13 cm in length, weighing 28-29 g) were raised in a 100 L tank containing 80 L of water at a density of 1 fish 4 L-1 (20 fish in total). They were fed with commercial pellet (46% protein) at 3% of fish biomass and 3 times a day. The experiment was conducted according to a completely randomized design with 5 levels of salinity: P1=25‰, P2=20‰, P3=15‰, P4=10‰ and P5=5‰, by performing triplicate measurements for each treatment. The treatment with 15 ‰ salinity showed the best effects, yielding an osmotic performance rate of 3 mOsm L-1 H2O, a blood cortisol level of 50,923 nmol L-1, an absolute growth weight and length of 17.73±1.25 g and 2.32±0.21 cm, respectively, an SGR of 0.87±0.05%, an FC of 1.24±0.00, an FE of 80.79±0.58 and an SR of 88.33±2.88%. Histologically, there were no anomalies in the structure of gill and kidney of the fish cultured in 5‰-25‰ salinities. Water quality was acceptable for growing T. blochii. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

SP  - 175-202
AB  - Visitors’ impressions of the polar regions are often those of great expanses devoid of life and they are most impressed by the extremely low temperatures, snow, ice and long periods of darkness. The mechanism of cold adaptation which permits survival of marine ectotherms at low temperatures can be divided into two general categories; those which extend the lower temperature tolerances of the organisms and, those which confer relatively high levels of metabolism and growth on organisms. In some respects the arctic and antarctic polar marine environments are very similar. Both are characterized by alternating periods of intense light and darkness, low temperatures and thick ice cover. However a number of interesting physical distinctions can be made between the two areas which have lead to different evolutionary responses in the physiology and biochemistry of polar marine organisms. The geography of the polar regions has a tremendous effect on the climate which in turn affects the ice cover. © 1978 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

TI  - Strawberry crown plugs provide flexibility and improved performance in cold climate plasticulture production
VL  - 11
IS  - 8
AB  - Annual plasticulture strawberry production has not been adopted as rapidly in cold climate regions as has occurred in warmer production areas due to uncertainty about potential benefits. Recent trials have demonstrated the potential of regionally adapted varieties in the annual plasticulture system in cold regions, but optimal production practices have not been determined. Summer planting of short-day varieties in these areas would increase flexibility for growers, allowing additional cropping options and improved land use management. The performance of six short-day strawberry varieties (Chandler, Clancy, Jewel, Ovation, Seneca and Ventana) was examined in a series of four annual production trials using cold-stored bare-root crowns for spring planting or a new type of planting stock termed a 'crown plug' for two summer plantings. Procedures for producing crown plugs from cold-stored crowns are described. The crown plug summer plantings significantly outperformed the spring planted bare-root plants across all varieties. The July planting established using crown plugs had higher yield and higher mean berry weight across all six varieties compared to the May bare-root planting (623 g/plant—12.5 g mean fruit weight vs. 330 g/plant—10.6 g mean fruit weight, respectively). In the July planting, 'Seneca', 'Ventana' and 'Jewel' exceeded the mean yield per plant for the planting as a whole and the other three varieties also produced more than previously reported for the May planting established with bare-root plants. The August crown plug planting was less productive than the July planting (623 g/plant vs. 498 g/plant, respectively) but was still more productive than both spring plantings. No difference was observed between the April and May plantings across the six varieties. Utilizing crown plugs also reduced the duration of weed control measures needed, improved efficiency of setting plants and limited the need for blossom and runner removal in the field, thus demonstrating labor cost savings that can offset the cost of crown plug production while also producing higher overall yield and mean fruit weight in the varieties in the trial. The summer plantings established with crown plugs demonstrated improved survival through a second winter dormancy period but produced relatively poor yield and berry size in the second harvest season. Crown plugs provide flexibility and improved productivity for growers utilizing annual plasticulture production in cold climate regions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 45

SP  - 345-354
AB  - 1. Worldwide, the excessive use of insecticides has resulted in field-evolved insecticide-resistant populations of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. A deltamethrin-resistant DBM population from the field was divided into two subpopulations in the laboratory. One population (S-strain) was maintained with no further exposure to insecticides, whereas the other population (R-strain) was maintained under a regime of intermittent selection with deltamethrin. 2. Individuals from both strains were reared at constant temperatures in the range 10–35 °C in the absence of deltamethrin, and the effects of rearing temperature on various traits were investigated. At the time of experimentation, the R-strain was 20-fold more resistant to deltamethrin than the S-strain. 3. Temperature differentially affected developmental time, adult life span, pupal weight, and fecundity of both strains. Although both strains laid eggs after being reared at 10 °C, few of these eggs were fertile. The R-strain developed significantly faster than the S-strain. The integrated performance of the S-strain and R-strain was greatest at 25 and 15 °C, respectively. 4. The present study provides important information on the complexities of the outcomes of the interactions between ectotherms and temperature. Specifically, temperature-trait relationships may not be unimodal, and ectotherm genotypes (in this case insecticide-resistance status) and abiotic stresses can interact with unpredictable outcomes. 5. Current models predicting DBM population dynamics and relative abundance in different locations do not consider different thermal biologies of different genotypes. The present study shows the dramatic effects of environment on many parameters used in these models and will help to enhance their accuracy, and thus their utility. © 2019 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Assessing the sustainable municipal solid waste (MSW) to electricity generation potentials in selected Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS)
VL  - 248
AB  - The Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) are largely reliant on fossil fuels for electricity generations and this dependency makes these Island States immensely vulnerable to global fuel price volatility since the excess outflow of money on fuel imports not only affects the economic growth but also hinders the sustainable development. Additionally, waste management in these small countries is economically and environmentally expensive and mostly dumped in open/closed-dumps and landfills which decompose and releases notorious greenhouse gases (i.e., methane and carbon dioxide, etc.). Amalgamating these two disparate issues, this study aims to find a mutual solution by exploring the feasibility of waste-to-energy (WtE) potentials via different technologies at the selected sites. Using the population and per capita waste generation data of fifteen selected sites of eight PSIDS, a waste profile of each site is evaluated. Then, the waste generation over the projected 20 years is used to determine the electricity generation potential of each site under the proposed alternative scenarios (i.e., 2 - landfill gas to energy (LFGTE) technology, 3 - mass-burn incineration, 4 - hybrid mechanical-biological treated (MBT) anaerobic digestion (AD) and LFGTE technology, and 5 - hybrid MBT-AD and refuse-derived fuel (RDF) incineration). These four scenarios (2-5) are compared to the Business-as-Usual case denoted as scenario 1. To test the economic viability, the Net Present Value, Levelized Cost of Energy, and Payback Period of each site is ascertained. Further economic benefits are assessed through the recycling of materials including plastics (under scenario 4 only), glass, and metals (under all scenarios). Emissions and energy consumption of each scenario are analysed using the Waste Reduction Model (WARM). The outcome of this study revealed that scenario 3 offers the greatest potential in terms of electricity generation, at Port Moresby (PNG1), Papua New Guinea site having the highest potential (i.e., 78.86 GWh) and Kosrae (FSM4), Federated States of Micronesia has the lowest generation potential of only 92.86 MWh. This scenario 3 (mass-burn incineration) was also supported by the economic assessment. It was also found that recycling brought in additional economic benefits and also helped offset CO2-equivalent emissions and contributed towards energy savings. Multi-level multi-criteria decision analysis (ML-MCDA) was performed to select the most viable waste management alternative based on technical, economic, environmental, and stakeholder preferences. The priorities assigned to the respective scenarios for all fifteen sites were as such: scenario 3 > scenario 5 > scenario 4 > scenario 2 > scenario 1. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 10
AB  - The hypersaline sediment and groundwater of playa lake, Lake Lucero, at the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico were examined for microbial community composition, geochemical gradients, and mineralogy during the dry season along a meter and a half depth profile of the sediment vs. the groundwater interface. Lake Lucero is a highly dynamic environment, strongly characterized by the capillary action of the groundwater, the extreme seasonality of the climate, and the hypersalinity. Sediments are predominantly composed of gypsum with minor quartz, thenardite, halite, quartz, epsomite, celestine, and clays. Geochemical analysis has revealed the predominance of nitrates over ammonium in all of the analyzed samples, indicating oxygenated conditions throughout the sediment column and in groundwater. Conversely, the microbial communities are primarily aerobic, gram-negative, and are largely characterized by their survival adaptations. Halophiles and oligotrophs are ubiquitous for all the samples. The very diverse communities contain methanogens, phototrophs, heterotrophs, saprophytes, ammonia-oxidizers, sulfur-oxidizers, sulfate-reducers, iron-reducers, and nitrifiers. The microbial diversity varied significantly between groundwater and sediment samples as their temperature adaptation inferences that revealed potential psychrophiles inhabiting the groundwater and thermophiles and mesophiles being present in the sediment. The dynamism of this environment manifests in the relatively even character of the sediment hosted microbial communities, where significant taxonomic distinctions were observed. Therefore, sediment and groundwater substrates are considered as separate ecological entities. We hope that the variety of the discussed playa environments and the microorganisms may be considered a useful terrestrial analog providing valuable information to aid future astrobiological explorations. © Copyright © 2019 Glamoclija, Ramirez, Sirisena and Widanagamage.

TI  - Proposing an effective and inexpensive tool to detect urban surface temperature changes associated with urbanization processes in small cities
VL  - 192
AB  - A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 9

AB  - In this work, size- and shape-controlled two-dimensional (2D) superparamagnetic maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) quantum flakes (MQFs) with high surface area and mesoporosity were prepared by facile hydrothermal synthesis for biological applications. These quantum flakes exhibited superparamagnetic behaviours over a wide temperature range of 75-950 K with high saturation magnetization ofMs- 23 emu g−1and a lower coercivity ofHc- 6.1 Oe. MQFs also demonstrated a good colloidal stability and a positively charged flake surface. Selective toxicity dependent upon selective ROS scavenging/generation and cellular MQF uptake towards non-malignant human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and malignant melanoma (A357) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB 231) cell lines were witnessed. An increased ROS concentration resulted due to the peroxidase-like activity of MQFs in malignant cells. In contrast, ROS scavenging was observed in non-malignant cells due to dominant catalase-like activity.In vitrofluorescence properties added the diagnostic ability to the ambit of MQFs. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficiency could be significantly enhanced by the hyperthermic (25-47 °C) ability of MQF in cancerous cells. Our findings reveal the novel theranostic MQF structure with immense cancer therapeutic potentialviaaugmentation of ROS generation by hyperthermia in a selective microenvironment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

TI  - Mixed vs. monospecific mountain forests in response to climate change: structural and growth perspectives of Norway spruce and European beech
VL  - 488
AB  - Mixed forests play a key role in terms of stability, production potential and adaptation to climate change. Norway spruce [PA, Picea abies (L.) Karst] and European beech (FS, Fagus sylvatica L.) are among the most important tree species in Europe. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of the species composition of these two tree genera on the production, structure, diversity and growth of mixed Fageto-Piceetum acidophilum stands in the Krkonoše Mountains, in the Czech Republic. The following 5 variants (ratios) of mixture were compared in 6 replications (30 research plots in total): PA 100%, PA 75:25 FS, PA 50:50 FS, PA 25:75 FS and FS 100%. Based on 178 tree core samples, the research also focused on the influence of climatic factors (temperature, precipitation) and air pollution (SO2, NOX, AOT40F) on the radial growth of these tree species of particular variants. Mixed forests showed a timber production higher by 7.7% (-10.8 to 31.5%) in comparison to spruce monocultures, and by 47.3% (21.9–79.7%) compared to beech monocultures. The largest production as well as the highest diameter increment were documented in PA 75:25 FS (656 m3 ha−1). In addition, this variant had the lowest extreme decreases/fluctuations in radial growth in both tree species. Over the last 50 years, the increment in beech increased by 7.9% and by 2.5% in spruce. The cyclical behavior in the radial growth of both tree species occurred in the short-term solar cycles of 9–11 and long-term periods of 50–75 years, while the spruce showed higher cyclic intensity. The concentration of both SO2 and NOX had a significant negative effect on the radial growth of spruce. In both tree species, the negative effect of air pollution lessened with their decreasing share in the stand. Similarly, precipitation and temperature had a more significant effect on the growth of monospecific variants in both tree species, especially in beech. Temperatures, when compared to precipitation, had a greater effect on the radial growth of both tree genera, especially during the vegetation period. In terms of diversity, mixed stands achieved significantly higher structural (diameter, height, crown) differentiation and overall diversity compared to monospecific variants. In general, mixed stands can achieve higher production potential, diversity and especially resistance to climate extremes and air pollution in relation to climate change in the water-sufficient highland and mountain areas of the Czech Republic. Differences between mixed stands vs. monocultures, i.e. the effect of tree species mixing, depend on suitable ratios of tree species and their spatial pattern. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Context dependence of transgenerational plasticity: the influence of parental temperature depends on offspring environment and sex
VL  - 194
IS  - 3
SP  - 391-401
AB  - Under environmental change, the relationship between phenotype and fitness can change rapidly, leaving populations vulnerable. Plasticity within and between generations could provide the fastest mitigation to environmental change. However, plasticity may depend on interactions among parental environment, offspring environment and offspring sex, and we know little of how these interactions manifest. We examine the importance of parental and offspring thermal environment in the context of a terrestrial ectotherm (the jacky lizard, Amphibolurus muricatus), where the thermal environment depends on complex thermoregulatory behaviours. By manipulating both parental and offspring thermoregulatory (basking) opportunities in a full factorial design, we found that transgenerational plasticity was highly context dependent. Overall, longer parental thermoregulatory opportunities led to increased growth in offspring, providing a clear fitness benefit to daughters but inducing a cost of increased oxidative stress in sons. Daughters, but not sons, received the greatest advantage when their thermal environment matched that of their parents. The offspring thermal environment had little independent effect on offspring phenotype. Together, the results suggest that both directional selection on offspring size (leading to growth being dependent on thermal conditions) and selection for anticipatory parental effects operate, but with a different balance in males and females. More broadly, restrictions in thermoregulatory opportunities under climatic warming will have negative consequences both within and between generations, but the exact nature will depend on the evolved functional form of plasticity. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval using extremely randomized trees over the Shandian river basin
VL  - 25
IS  - 4
SP  - 941-951
AB  - Soil moisture plays an important role in the survival of animals and surface plants, the energy and material cycle between atmosphere and surface. Meanwhile, the large-scale monitoring of soil moisture is a critical indicator for water cycle, climate change, agricultural monitoring, ecological environment, geological disasters, fire and other applications. However, because of the influence of soil types, soil structure conditions, terrain characteristics, vegetation environment and human activities, the distribution of soil moisture has spatial heterogeneity characteristic, so it is still hard to find an optimal method to monitor the distribution of soil moisture in large areas (such as watershed scale). In the comprehensive experiments, the Shandian River Basin was selected as the experiment area. Vegetation Indices (VIs) retrieved from MODIS reflectance data and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were calculated as the input parameters, and then the soil moisture measured was taken as the expected output parameters. Further, the random forest model is used to calculate the feature importance of each input parameters to complete feature selection, and a soil moisture inversion model based on extreme random tree was constructed. Compared with empirical models, the soil moisture retrieval model based on extreme random tree has stronger nonlinear expression ability, and can introduce more input parameters; compared with traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Neural Network(NN), extreme random tree can achieve better retrieval accuracy on small sample set by integrating several "weak learners" into "strong learners"; Compared with random forest, extreme random tree can reduce the variance and the deviation of the model to achieve better integration effects. Considering the difficulty of surface temperature measurements and the requirements of regional soil moisture monitoring, the research selected Short wave infrared Transformed Reflectance (STR) instead of LST to establish the extreme random tree model, and inversed the soil moisture map of 2°× 2° area covering experiment area of Shandian River Basin. The results show that: (1) when LST is used as the input parameter, the soil moisture retrieval model based on extreme random tree, (root mean square error 0.054 m3m-3 and correlation coefficient 0.69), has better performance than other models (support vector machine and random forest); (2) when STR is used as the input parameter, the root mean square error of prediction result is 0.060 m3m-3 and the correlation coefficient is 0.66. So it is feasible to introduce STR instead of LST to predict soil moisture in large area. Further, the spatial distribution of soil moisture is basically consistent with the actual situation, which can meet the requirements of general application. Focused on the limitation of MODIS data quality and the scale difference between single point measurement data and satellite data, the accuracy of soil moisture estimation still need to be improved. At the same time, due to the lack of long-term measured data of soil moisture, the spatiotemporal scalability of soil moisture inversion model needs to be further verified. Optical remote sensing is greatly affected by the weather, while microwave remote sensing can be the alternative choices for all-weather observation. The multi-source remote sensing data fusion should be attribute more attention to soil moisture retrieval model construction. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.

TI  - A heat-health watch and warning system with extended season and evolving thresholds
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Many countries have developed heat-health watch and warning systems (HHWWS) or early-warning systems to mitigate the health consequences of extreme heat events. HHWWS usually focuses on the four hottest months of the year and imposes the same threshold over these months. However, according to climate projections, the warm season is expected to extend and/or shift. Some studies demonstrated that health impacts of heat waves are more severe when the human body is not acclimatized to the heat. In order to adapt those systems to potential heat waves occurring outside the hottest months of the season, this study proposes specific health-based monthly heat indicators and thresholds over an extended season from April to October in the northern hemisphere. Methods: The proposed approach, an adoption and extension of the HHWWS methodology currently implemented in Quebec (Canada). The latter is developed and applied to the Greater Montreal area (current population 4.3 million) based on historical health and meteorological data over the years. This approach consists of determining excess mortality episodes and then choosing monthly indicators and thresholds that may involve excess mortality. Results: We obtain thresholds for the maximum and minimum temperature couple (in °C) that range from (respectively, 23 and 12) in April, to (32 and 21) in July and back to (25 and 13) in October. The resulting HHWWS is flexible, with health-related thresholds taking into account the seasonality and the monthly variability of temperatures over an extended summer season. Conclusions: This adaptive and more realistic system has the potential to prevent, by data-driven health alerts, heat-related mortality outside the typical July–August months of heat waves. The proposed methodology is general and can be applied to other regions and situations based on their characteristics. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Indoor thermal environment is vital for occupant comfort and productivity. This is true of educational facilities where people are expected to engage in prolonged period of intense concentration. This research focuses on evaluating and comparing the effect of envelopes in uninsulated prototypical governmental schools built before 2003 with thermally insulated. Indoor thermal environments of classrooms of the old and new schools were assessed using two methods. The first, indoor temperature profiles obtained through field monitoring were analyzed under the adaptive comfort standard model employed in ASHRAE standard 55. The second method relied upon thermal simulation of the selected classrooms using DB to obtain the predicted mean vote (PMV) values of classrooms in accordance with ISO 7730. Finally, for the validation purpose, a control group was conducted to function as a base case model for the schools. A calibration test was conducted, by comparing the indoor environmental measurements obtained from field monitoring with the simulation results. Based on the above results, both schools exceeded the range comfort level during peak hours. The result indicate that the indoor thermal environment in the new school was more satisfactory than the old one. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Improvement of fertilizing properties of glauconite under microwave radiation
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 1304-1310
AB  - This work was conducted with the purpose of finding a method to increase the fertilizing properties of glauconite using a rectangular microwave resonant cavity. For the modified glauconite, we measured the specific surface area, the total porosity and the mean pore radius via Quanta chrome Instruments high-speed gas sorption analyzer NOVA series 1200e. The equilibrium concentrations of heavy metal ions in solutions were measured using X-ray fluorescence on Shimadzu EDX-7000/8000 energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. The statistical parameters of heavy metal ions adsorption from soil were obtained by building mathematically processed adsorption isotherms. The calibration curve of dependence was constructed in "A-Cequil" coordinates. Biogenic cations were determined by the spectrometric analysis. The fertilizing properties of glauconite were verified through the cultivation of peas. Electromagnetic radiation of super high frequency with 3 kW power and 2150-2450 MHz frequency is shown to be applicable for the non-thermal modification of glauconite, increasing the performance properties of this mineral while using it as a crops fertilizer. The optimum treatment regime was selected, according to which glauconite should be exposed to radiation for 5 minutes. We found out that this method allows improving physical, adsorptive, cation-exchange and fertilizing properties of the ore, especially in concentrated form. Glauconite, modified by electromagnetic radiation of super high frequency, when contacting soil, promotes the increase of potassium, calcium and magnesium cations in it. At the same time, the level of heavy metals - iron, manganese and copper decreases due to their adsorption by soil particles. This glauconite proved to be a highly effective full-fledged fertilizer, stimulating, first of all, the development of the root system of peas, as well as above-ground parts of the plant. In comparative experiments with untreated and modified by electromagnetic radiation of super high frequency glauconite, in the first case the length of the main root in comparison with the not fertilized control increased by 32%, the height of the green mass - by 24%; under modified glauconite, the root and green mass increased by 35.3% and 63.4% respectively. The received results are important for more rational usage of glauconite in agriculture and show perspective in applying the modified by microwave radiation concentrated form of glauconite as a fertilizer for legume and other cultures. © 2006-2018 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

TI  - Optics to control thermal effects in selective laser melting
VL  - 10523
AB  - Selective Laser Melting technology (SLM) is a thermal process, and control of thermal effects is of great importance since enhanced productivity of modern SLM equipment can be achieved by increased laser power. To provide acceptable physical resolution of image recording, the TEM00 lasers are applied, for example fiber lasers which power reaches today several kW. However, the Gaussian intensity distribution of single-mode powerful lasers brings some problems in SLM: inhomogeneous intensity in focused spot results in non-uniform temperature profile and subsequent irregularities of melting process, unwished evaporation or sparking; another issue relates to optics-dynamic gradient heating of optical components and subsequent induce of waist shift and wave aberrations resulting in variation of size and intensity distribution of focused spot in working plane. The thermally induced effects are especially important for protective windows which are inevitably contaminated by fine powder inducing higher heating. Solution suggested to provide uniform temperature in working spot is beam shaping optics made from high purity fused silica and creating optimum for uniform melting flat-top or doughnut profiles. To stabilize the size and intensity of working spot it is suggested to apply athermalized protective windows from optical material self-compensating geometrical and refractive thermal effects. Detailed measurements of beam properties and measurements of real manufactured parts confirmed correctness of suggested approach, its possibility to stabilize drastically the SLM process. The paper presents description of optics applied; measurements of process parameters and analysis of properties of manufactured parts are presented as well. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

TI  - Climate change will render size-selective harvest of cold-water fish species unsustainable in Mediterranean freshwaters
VL  - 58
IS  - 3
SP  - 562-575
AB  - Climate change is impacting the composition and functioning of virtually every ecosystem on Earth, and disrupting the productivity of exploited ones. Species are rapidly adjusting to their changing environments through evolutionary and/or plastic phenotypic changes in behavioural, physiological, phenological and life-history traits. Size-selective harvest produces severe demographic impacts on exploited populations and induces individual phenotypic changes in many of the same fitness-related traits as climate change and thus can impair local adaptation and acclimation. We addressed in the context of inland recreational fisheries two interrelated questions: (1) Will fisheries-induced phenotypic changes operate at different rates and direction than those induced by climate change, and thus hinder local adaptation and acclimation, threatening population persistence?; (2) which harvest regulations most likely lead to overexploitation of populations under the new environmental conditions? We used an eco-genetic individual-based model to simulate the consequences of size-selective fishing for a cold-water fish species brown trout Salmo trutta across a range of regulatory (defined by exploitation rate and size-based limits) and environmental scenarios (warming vs. concurrent warming and streamflow reduction) in a Mediterranean system. We ran 1,620 combinations of fishing and environmental scenarios and analysed results using artificial neural networks. In our simulations, (a) climate change and size-selective fishing both led to a reduced, truncated population, with increased juvenile but decreased adult growth and earlier maturation at smaller size, but fisheries-induced changes were stronger than those produced by climate change; (b) their effects were additive or dampened but rarely synergistic and (c) phenotypic changes in fitness-related traits resulted from both evolutionary and plastic processes. Synthesis and applications. Our model-based analyses highlight that any size-selective fishing regime would lead to the overexploitation of cold-water freshwater fish populations if climate warming is accompanied by streamflow reduction—as projected in Mediterranean fisheries. Even if we assumed no future streamflow regime changes, only a limited range of size-based harvest regulations may provide an acceptable balance between conservation and fishery objectives. Thus, recreational fisheries of cold-water fish in Mediterranean climates might be more sustainably managed under climate change if conservation-oriented strategies based on harvest bans (e.g. catch-and-release fishing) were implemented. © 2020 British Ecological Society

TI  - Comparative transcriptomic analysis of deep-A nd shallow-water barnacle species (Cirripedia, Poecilasmatidae) provides insights into deep-sea adaptation of sessile crustaceans
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Barnacles are specialized marine organisms that differ from other crustaceans in possession of a calcareous shell, which is attached to submerged surfaces. Barnacles have a wide distribution, mostly in the intertidal zone and shallow waters, but a few species inhabit the deep-sea floor. It is of interest to investigate how such sessile crustaceans became adapted to extreme deep-sea environments. We sequenced the transcriptomes of a deep-sea barnacle, Glyptelasma gigas collected at a depth of 731 m from the northern area of the Zhongjiannan Basin, and a shallow-water coordinal relative, Octolasmis warwicki. The purpose of this study was to provide genetic resources for investigating adaptation mechanisms of deep-sea barnacles. Results: Totals of 62,470 and 51,585 unigenes were assembled for G. gigas and O. warwicki, respectively, and functional annotation of these unigenes was made using public databases. Comparison of the protein-coding genes between the deep-A nd shallow-water barnacles, and with those of four other shallow-water crustaceans, revealed 26 gene families that had experienced significant expansion in G. gigas. Functional annotation showed that these expanded genes were predominately related to DNA repair, signal transduction and carbohydrate metabolism. Base substitution analysis on the 11,611 single-copy orthologs between G. gigas and O. warwicki indicated that 25 of them were distinctly positive selected in the deep-sea barnacle, including genes related to transcription, DNA repair, ligand binding, ion channels and energy metabolism, potentially indicating their importance for survival of G. gigas in the deep-sea environment. Conclusions: The barnacle G. gigas has adopted strategies of expansion of specific gene families and of positive selection of key genes to counteract the negative effects of high hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, low temperature and food limitation on the deep-sea floor. These expanded gene families and genes under positive selection would tend to enhance the capacities of G. gigas for signal transduction, genetic information processing and energy metabolism, and facilitate networks for perceiving and responding physiologically to the environmental conditions in deep-sea habitats. In short, our results provide genomic evidence relating to deep-sea adaptation of G. gigas, which provide a basis for further biological studies of sessile crustaceans in the deep sea. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Mechanisms of plastic rescue in novel environments
VL  - 49
SP  - 331-354
AB  - Adaptive phenotypic plasticity provides a mechanism of developmental rescue in novel and rapidly changing environments. Understanding the underlying mechanism of plasticity is important for predicting both the likelihood that a developmental response is adaptive and associated life-history trade-offs that could influence patterns of subsequent evolutionary rescue. Although evolved developmental switches may move organisms toward a new adaptive peak in a novel environment, such mechanisms often result in maladaptive responses. The induction of generalized physiological mechanisms in new environments is relatively more likely to result in adaptive responses to factors such as novel toxins, heat stress, or pathogens. Developmental selection forms of plasticity, which rely on within-individual selective processes, such as shaping of tissue architecture, trial-and-error learning, or acquired immunity, are particularly likely to result in adaptive plasticity in a novel environment. However, both the induction of plastic responses and the ability to be plastic through developmental selection come with significant costs, resulting in delays in reproduction, increased individual investment, and reduced fecundity. Thus, we might expect complex interactions between plastic responses that allow survival in novel environments and subsequent evolutionary responses at the population level. © 2018 by Annual Reviews.

TI  - Theoretical Overview of Methane Hydroxylation by Copper-Oxygen Species in Enzymatic and Zeolitic Catalysts
VL  - 51
IS  - 10
SP  - 2382-2390
AB  - ConspectusAs fossil-based energy sources become more depleted and with renewable-energy technologies still in a very early stage of development, the utilization of highly abundant methane as a transitional solution for current energy demands is highly important despite difficulties in transport and storage. Technologies enabling the conversion of methane to liquid/condensable energy carriers that can be easily transported and integrated into the existing chemical infrastructures are therefore essential. Although there commercially exists a two-step gas-to-liquid process involving syngas production, a novel route of methane conversion that can circumvent the high-cost production of syngas should be developed. Among all of the conceptually possible methods for converting methane to methanol, methane hydroxylation (CH4 + 1/2O2 → CH3OH) at low temperature seems to be the most viable since it provides a direct route of conversion and allows a much lower operational cost. However, it is hampered by the fact that the complete oxidation to CO2 is thermodynamically more favored. To overcome this, an effective catalyst that is able to "mildly" oxidize methane and stabilize the resultant methyl radical toward methanol formation is required. Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and copper-exchanged zeolites are two catalysts known to hydroxylate methane into methanol at low temperature with high selectivity. Having been studied for more than 30 years, these copper-cored catalysts are still relevant topics of discussion since the actual structure of the active sites has not been agreed upon, and thus, the reaction mechanism and factors influencing their reactivity and productivity are yet to be understood. Density functional theory (DFT) has provided us with a powerful computational tool for accomplishing these tasks.This Account presents an overview of the recent progress in the computational elucidation of the catalytic mechanism of methane hydroxylation by mono-, di-, and trinuclear copper sites in pMMO and Cu-exchanged zeolites as well as its correlations to the influencing factors that must be controlled to achieve higher reactivity. First, we briefly introduce the catalytic mechanism of a bare CuO+ cation as the simplest copper-oxo system in methane hydroxylation. The system is then extended to the copper-oxo species in pMMO and zeolites, and the radical and nonradical mechanisms are examined. Investigations of the reactivities of mononuclear and dinuclear copper-oxo species in the pMMO active site suggest that the bis(μ-oxo)CuIICuIII, (μ-oxo)(μ-hydroxo)CuIICuIII, and CuIIIO species are important for the catalytic activity of pMMO. In the case of Cu-exchanged zeolites, as the mono(μ-oxo)CuIICuII and tris(μ-oxo)CuIICuIIICuIII active sites have been fully characterized in experiments, here we discuss the effects of zeolite structures on the geometry and reactivity of the active sites.

TI  - Spawning of calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa at low temperature and high salinity improves hatch success for cold-stored egg production
VL  - 530
AB  - When copepod Acartia tonsa is isolated from tropical populations, the produced eggs exhibit low hatching after long-term storage, a critical aspect that makes their use difficult in aquaculture. In three experiments, this study spawned adults of A. tonsa cultured at different salinities and temperatures. The eggs were collected to determine hatching success of fresh and cold-stored eggs (HS-C). Experiment 1: Adults spawned under four combinations of two temperatures (18 and 28 degrees C) and two salinities (18 and 30 PSU) to determine the HS-C from 0 (fresh eggs) to 4 weeks of storage. Experiment 2: Adults spawned under three combinations of temperatures (18, 23, and 29 degrees C) and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 4 weeks of storage). Experiment 3: Adults spawned under 18 degrees C and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 8 weeks of storage). All adults were distributed in triplicate in 2 L containers at 0.5 individual mL(-1) and fed with the Rhodomonas sauna microalgae at 2000 mu g C L-1. In every experimental unit, the eggs were collected and stored at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. In fresh eggs (0 weeks of storage), most of the treatments showed great hatching ( > 90%). However, low salinity and high temperature resulted in a significantly (p < .05) lower hatch (81%) of the fresh eggs. The combination of 18 degrees C and 30 PSU produced better hatching (p < .05) in eggs stored for 2 and 4 weeks (85% and 73%, respectively), followed by 18 degrees C and 18 PSU (65% and 41%), 28 degrees C and 30 PSU (50% and 17%) and 28 degrees C and 18 PSU (11% and 2%). Stored quiescent eggs were strongly affected by the temperature and salinity of the culture environment. On the other hand, fresh (subitaneous) eggs do not depend so much of these variables. Therefore, the criteria to select what salinity and temperature combination is best to raise adults for egg production will depend on whether the eggs will be used for immediate-use (fresh) or storage.

TI  - The Use of Novel Technologies in Egg Processing
AB  - The impact of thermal processing on the fresh-like characteristics of foods is well-known. Eggs have unique fresh-like characteristics, functional properties, nutritional value, and sensory quality that can be modified by thermal processing. This complex scenario has led to the study and optimization of technologies that do not use high temperatures to enhance egg shelf life and preserve fresh-like characteristics. Technologies such as high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), pulsed electric fields (PEF), ultrasound (US), pulsed light (PL), cold plasma (CP) and ozonation, have been investigated for egg treatment, and findings were summarized in this paper. These novel treatments improve food safety, shelf life, and have minimal impact on the functional properties of fresh eggs and egg products. The immunoreactivity of egg allergens is reduced and the bioactivity of egg component is favored (in selected conditions) by non-thermal technologies. However, additional studies are necessary to clarify the effect of these technologies on the sensory properties of treated products, evaluate different combinations of hurdles to ensure safety, improve the knowledge about the effect in egg allergens and bioactive compounds, and also explore the processing of healthier and functional eggs and egg products. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Estimation of heat loss coefficient and thermal demands of in-use building by capturing thermal inertia using lstm neural networks
VL  - 14

AB  - Accurate forecasting of a building thermal performance can help to optimize its energy consumption. In addition, obtaining the Heat Loss Coefficient (HLC) allows characterizing the thermal envelope of the building under conditions of use. The aim of this work is to study the thermal inertia of a building developing a new methodology based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This approach was applied to the Rectorate building of the University of Basque Country (UPV/EHU), located in the north of Spain. A comparison of different time-lags selected to catch the thermal inertia has been carried out using the CV(RMSE) and the MBE errors, as advised by ASHRAE. The main contribution of this work lies in the analysis of thermal inertia detection and its influence on the thermal behavior of the building, obtaining a model capable of predicting the thermal demand with an error between 12 and 21%. Moreover, the viability of LSTM neural networks to estimate the HLC of an in-use building with an error below 4% was demonstrated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Protective role of zinc in Spodoptera exigua larvae under 135-generational cadmium exposure
VL  - 235
SP  - 785-793
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether zinc supplementation modulates cadmium toxicity in the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua selected for 135 generations towards cadmium tolerance. To achieve this, larvae originating from three laboratory populations of S. exigua (control strain - C; cadmium-intoxicated for 135 generations strain - Cd, and control strain intoxicated with Cd for 1 generation - CCd) were additionally exposed to zinc in three concentrations (Zn1, 400 μg Zn·g−1 dry mass of food; Zn2; 200 μg Zn·g−1 dry mass of food; Zn3, 100 μg Zn·g−1 dry mass of food). As the markers of toxicity, a life history traits (the duration of L4 and L5 stages), cellular (DNA damage indices) and biochemical parameters (ADP/ATP ratio and ATP and HSP70 concentrations) were chosen. The duration of larval stages of Zn supplemented larvae was prolonged, while cellular and biochemical indicators, in general, appeared to be lower in comparison to the insects from respective reference groups in each laboratory populations. Moreover, the range of the differences depended on zinc concentration in food. We can suspect that zinc supplementation contributed to the protection of S. exigua individuals against negative effects of cadmium intoxication, probably at the cost of growth rate. Significant differences in the response pattern between insects from different laboratory populations indicate that the influence of additional stress factors is dependent on the overall condition of animals and their previous adaptation to other stressors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Activation of Se-enriched coal gangue and the efficient use of coal gangue Se fertilizer
VL  - 26
IS  - 8
SP  - 1526-1535
AB  - [Objectives] The technology of producing Se fertilizer was studied using Se-rich coal gangue from solid waste ore.[Methods]The tested coal gangue was from Enshi, where was famous for rich of Se in the environment, and grounded to pass 0.038 mm for the experiment. Preliminary experiments were conducted with 6 levels of each single factor for the activation of Se, and three levels of each were accordingly selected for the following response surface optimization, which would give the optimal activation parameters eventually. The IR spectroscopy and TG thermogravimetry methods were employed to observe and analyze the activating and thermal effects of the bonds of Se with other metals before and after the activation in the coal gangue. The activated coal gangue was then blended with farm manure in ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1, and fermented for one month to make activated coal gangue selenium organic fertilizers (organic Se fertilizer). A garlic field trial was conducted using the four organic Se fertilizers as treatments, and pure activated coal gangue Se and farm manure as controls. The total and organic Se contents in the garlic bulbs were measured at harvest. [Results]The single factor levels obtained from the single factor experiments were 10%, 20% and 30% for Na2CO3, 2.5 h, 3.5 h and 4.5 h for the activation time, 75°C, 85°C and 95°C for the activation temperature, and 1:5, 1:10 and 1:15 for solid-liquid ratio (g/mL). The optimized activation condition by the response surface optimization were Na2CO3 22%, the activation time 3.9 h, the solid-liquid ratio 1:9 g/mL and the activation temperature 85°C. Under the condition, the pH of the activated coal gangue was 7.6, and the maximum activation rate of Se was about 81.24%, and the active Se content was 170.82 mg/kg. Through the IR spectroscopy image, it could be seen that the bonds between Se and other symbiotic metal and nonmetal elements were broken, and the original crystalline network were broken too, indicating the Se in the coal gangue was unleashed. The derivative thermogravimetry curve had 2 peaks before activation within 100°C, while only 1 peak left near 100°C after activation, the weightlessness situation was weaker than the non-activated as well, indicating the improved heat stability of the coal gangue. According to the Se content in the activated coal gangue, the Se contents in the prepared 4 Se organic fertilizers were roughly 85.41, 113.88, 128.05 and 136.66 mg/kg in turn. The total Se contents of the garlic bulbs applied with the coal gangue fertilizer and the four Se organic fertilizers were 1.033, 1.306, 1.480, 1.382, and 1.355 μg/g, respectively, which were all significantly higher than that in the noneselenium fertilizer control (P < 0.05). The organic Se rate of the garlic bulbs in the five fertilizer treatments reached 99%, which was higher than the 60% of the control. The four Se organic fertilizers produced significantly higher Se contents in garlic bulbs than the activated coal gangue did, with the highest Se content by the 2:1 ratio mixed Se organic fertilizer.[Conclusions]The optimum process conditions of coal gangue using Na2CO3 as activator are: The Na2CO3 22%, activation time for 3.9 h, the solid-liquid ratio of 1:9 g/mL at 85°C. Under the condition, the activation ratio of Se can be as high as 81.24%, and with good thermal stability. The preparation of Se organic fertilizer made by co-fermentation of farm manure and activated coal gangue can greatly increase the efficiency of the activated Se, and the optimum effect is under the mix ratio of 1:2. © 2020 Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences,Editorial Department of Journal of Plant Nutrition and Fertilizer.

TI  - Liner deployed flow control devices in SAGD infill producers
AB  - Connacher Oil and Gas has deployed Flow Control Devices (FCDs)on an infill well liner as part of a Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) exploitation strategy. Infill wells are horizontal wells drilled in between offsetting SAGD well pairs in order to access bypassed pay and accelerate recovery. These wells can have huge variability in productivity, based on several factors: • variable initial temperature due to variable steam chamber development and initial mobility • variable injectivity from day one limiting steam circulation and stimulation • significant hot spots during production that limit drawdown of the well and oil productivity FCDs have shown great value in several SAGD schemes and are becoming common throughout SAGD applications to manage similar challenges in SAGD pairs, but their application in infill wells is less prevalent and presents a novel challenge to design and evaluate performance. This case study will examine the theory, operation, and early field results of this field trial. Density-based FCDs designed for thermal operations were selected to minimize the impact of viscous fluids commonly encountered early in cold infill well production. The design also limited steam outflow during the stimulation phase, where steam is injected in order to initiate production of the well. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) data, pressures and rates are utilized to analyze the impact of the FCDs towards conformance of the well in the early life. The value of FCDs has led to further piloting of this technology in a second group of nine infill wells, where further value is to be extracted using slimmer wellbores.

TI  - Selective clast survival in an experimentally-produced pseudotachylyte
VL  - 147
AB  - On-fault processes during earthquakes contribute to seismic rupture propagation and slip. Here we investigate clast fragmentation in an experimental pseudotachylyte (solidified seismic melt) produced with a rotary shear machine. We slid for 0.44 m (corresponding to Mw ≥ 6 earthquakes), at slip rates > 1 m/s, pre-cut samples of quartz + phyllosilicates + plagioclase + sillimanite + garnet -bearing ultramylonite, that hosts pseudotachylytes in nature. The ultramylonite minerals extensively preserved as clasts in the experimental pseudotachylyte are quartz, plagioclase, and sillimanite. Garnet is scarcely preserved, despite having a melting temperature similar to plagioclase, probably due to having low thermal shock resistance. This selective clast survival is identical to the one found in the natural pseudotachylytes. Based on these experimental observations and assuming non-equilibrium melting, the preservation of a mineral, as a clast, in the melt appears to be controlled by its thermal shock properties as well as by its melting temperature. Since the mechanical effects of rupture propagation in these experiments were negligible, we conclude that, for Mw ≥ 6 earthquakes, (i) frictional slip and heating of the slipping zone plus (ii) thermomechanical properties of minerals, rather than fault rupture processes, control mineral comminution and clast survival in frictional melts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Genomic signatures of thermal adaptation are associated with clinal shifts of life history in a broadly distributed frog
VL  - 91
IS  - 6
SP  - 1222-1238
AB  - Temperature is a critical driver of ectotherm life-history strategies, whereby a warmer environment is associated with increased growth, reduced longevity and accelerated senescence. Increasing evidence indicates that thermal adaptation may underlie such life-history shifts in wild populations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) can help uncover the molecular mechanisms of temperature-driven variation in growth, longevity and senescence. However, our understanding of these mechanisms is still limited, which reduces our ability to predict the response of non-model ectotherms to global temperature change. In this study, we examined the potential role of thermal adaptation in clinal shifts of life-history traits (i.e. life span, senescence rate and recruitment) in the Columbia spotted frog Rana luteiventris along a broad temperature gradient in the western United States. We took advantage of extensive capture–recapture datasets of 20,033 marked individuals from eight populations surveyed annually for 14–18 years to examine how mean annual temperature and precipitation influenced demographic parameters (i.e. adult survival, life span, senescence rate, recruitment and population growth). After showing that temperature was the main climatic predictor influencing demography, we used RAD-seq data (50,829 SNPs and 6,599 putative CNVs) generated for 352 individuals from 31 breeding sites to identify the genomic signatures of thermal adaptation. Our results showed that temperature was negatively associated with annual adult survival and reproductive life span and positively associated with senescence rate. By contrast, recruitment increased with temperature, promoting the long-term viability of most populations. These temperature-dependent demographic changes were associated with strong genomic signatures of thermal adaptation. We identified 148 SNP candidates associated with temperature including three SNPs located within protein-coding genes regulating resistance to cold and hypoxia, immunity and reproduction in ranids. We also identified 39 CNV candidates (including within 38 transposable elements) for which normalized read depth was associated with temperature. Our study indicates that both SNPs and structural variants are associated with temperature and could eventually be found to play a functional role in clinal shifts in senescence rate and life-history strategies in R. luteiventris. These results highlight the potential role of different sources of molecular variation in the response of ectotherms to environmental temperature variation in the context of global warming. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Meta-comparison of associated agronomic traits and qtls with high-temperature tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.)
VL  - 101
IS  - 1
SP  - 7-19
AB  - To identify associated agronomic traits and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with high-temperature tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.), three backcross inbred populations (BC2F4) of NSIC Rc150/Dular, Gayabyeo/Nagina22 and Gayabyeo/Dular were screened during the 2014 dry season. Analysis of microclimate conditions of near canopy such as temperature, relative humidity, and dew point temperature using Micrometeorological Instrument for Near Canopy Environment of Rice (MINCER) confirmed the presence of high-temperature stress during heading and maturity stages. MINCER data showed high temperatures (37.04 +/- 0.14 degrees C), accompanied by dry to high humidity (89.0-35.03 +/- 1.82%) condition. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate phenotypic traits associated with fertility. Dehiscent high-temperature was correlated with spikelet fertility in NSIC Rc150/Dular and Gayabyeo/Nagina22. Number of spikelets showed significant correlation with fertility in the cross between Gayabyeo/Nagina22 and Gayabyeo/Dular. The variability explained by the associated traits to the high-temperature tolerance in NSIC Rc150/Dular was 56%, which was higher than the variability (54.0%) in Gayabyeo/Dular populations. The lowest variability (40.0%) explained by the associated traits was observed in Gayabyeo/Nagina22. In a previous study, QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5 and 10 (Grospe et al. 2016). The present study further identified QTLs in different mapping populations using the inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method with IciMapping 4.0 software. Four major QTLs, which were associated with high-temperature tolerance in the new mapping population of Gayabyeo/Dular, were identified, namely, qHTfert3 (17.5%), qHTtof10.1 (14.1%), qHTtof10.2 (15.2%) and qHTspk4 (15.35%). Rice Genome Browser was used to identify the neighboring and coincided genes with the identified QTLs. The co-located/coincided/co-located genes in NSIC Rc150/Dular were qHfert1 (RM9) - LOC_Os01g41200, qHTfert3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190, qHTfert4 (RM348) - in LOC_Os04g54890, qHTtof10 (RM25213) - LOC_Os10g18740, qHTdht3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190, qHTdht3 (RM3586) - LOC_Os03g63950, qHTdht4 (RM16742) - LOC_Os04g28100, qHTdht5 (RM480) - LOC_Os05g47660, qHTdht10 (RM25213) - LOC_Os10g18740, qHThd3 (RM16102) - LOC_Os03g59480, and qHThd3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190. The co-located/coincided/co-located genes in Gayabyeo/Dular were qHTtof10.1 (RM4455) - LOC_Os10g22510 and qHTspk4 (RM17486) - LOC_Os04g52300. This study inferred that QTLs for high-temperature tolerance are cross specific, hence QTLs varied depending on parental combination. Moreover, these can be used in fine mapping of novel genes and rice breeding in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for high-temperature tolerance in rice.

TI  - Combined effect of temperature, salinity, and rearing density on the larval growth of the black shell strain and wild population of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 335-347
AB  - Crassostrea gigas is a commercially important species which is the mostly widely cultured in the world. However, most of the oyster broodstock in China remains unselected. Through a 7-generation of selection on the shell color and growth traits of adult oysters, an excellent strain of C. gigas with black shell coloration and mantle has been developed. In order to facilitate the industrialized breeding, it is necessary to explore the growth performance of the black shell strain in larval stage and find out the optimal conditions for larval development. In this study, the accumulated growth rate and survival rate of the black shell strain and wild population of C. gigas larvae were measured respectively, and a central composite design as well as a response surface method was used to investigate the combined effect of temperature, salinity, and rearing density on the growth of both the two populations. No significant differences were found in survival rate between the two populations, and two model equations for the growth of the two populations were established. The optimizations of accumulated growth rate for two populations were explored. When the temperature, salinity, and rearing density was 25.14 °C, 30.28 psu, and 1.00 ind. ml−1, respectively, the accumulated growth rate for the black shell strain maximized 15.40 μm day−1. With a combination of temperature of 25.06 °C, salinity of 29.27 psu and rearing density of 1.00 ind. ml−1, the maximum value of accumulated growth rate for wild population was 13.20 μm day−1. Furthermore, the larval growth rates were compared between the black shell strain and wild population, and the larvae of the black shell strain significantly grew faster than those of wild population when temperature, salinity and rearing density in a suitable range. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

VL  - 9

SP  - 2945-2963
AB  - A long-standing debate in evolutionary biology concerns the relative importance of different evolutionary forces in explaining phenotypic diversification at large geographic scales. For example, natural selection is typically assumed to underlie divergence along environmental gradients. However, neutral evolutionary processes can produce similar patterns. We collected molecular genetic data from 14 European populations of Plantago lanceolata to test the contributions of natural selection versus neutral evolution to population divergence in temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity of floral reflectance. In P. lanceolata, reflectance plasticity is positively correlated with latitude/altitude. We used population pairwise comparisons between neutral genetic differentiation (F ST and Jost's D) and phenotypic differentiation (P ST ) to assess the contributions of geographic distance and environmental parameters of the reproductive season in driving population divergence. Data are consistent with selection having shaped large-scale geographic patterns in thermal plasticity. The aggregate pattern of P ST versus F ST was consistent with divergent selection. F ST explained thermal plasticity differences only when geographic distance was not included in the model. Differences in the extent of cool reproductive season temperatures, and not overall temperature variation, explained plasticity differences independent of distance. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that thermal plasticity is adaptive where growing seasons are shorter and cooler, that is, at high latitude/altitude. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Zeolite Fixed Metal Nanoparticles: New Perspective in Catalysis
VL  - 54
IS  - 11
SP  - 2579-2590
AB  - ConspectusLoading metal nanoparticles on the surface of solid supports has emerged as an efficient route for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts. Notably, most of these supported metal nanoparticles still have shortcomings such as dissatisfactory activity and low product selectivity in catalysis. In addition, these metal nanoparticles also suffer from deactivation because of nanoparticle sintering, leaching, and coke formation under harsh conditions. The fixation of metal nanoparticles within zeolite crystals should have advantages of high activities for metal nanoparticles and excellent shape selectivity for zeolite micropores as well as extraordinary stability of metal nanoparticles immobilized with a stable zeolite framework, which is a good solution for the shortcomings of supported metal nanoparticles.Materials with metal nanostructures within the zeolite crystals are normally denoted as metal@zeolite, where the metal nanoparticles with diameters similar to those of industrial catalysts are usually larger than the micropore size. These metal nanoparticles are enveloped with the zeolite rigid framework to prevent migration under harsh reaction conditions, which is described as a fixed structure. The zeolite micropores allow the diffusion of reactants to the metal nanoparticles. As a result, metal@zeolite catalysts combine the features of both metal nanoparticles (high activity) and zeolites (shape selectivity and thermal stability), compared with the supported metal nanoparticles.In this Account, we describe how the zeolite micropore and metal nanoparticle synergistically work to improve the catalytic performance by the preparation of a variety of metal@zeolite catalysts. Multiple functions of zeolites with respect to the metal nanoparticles are highlighted, including control of the reactant/product diffusion in the micropores, the adjustment of reactant adsorption on the metal nanoparticles, and sieving the reactants and products with zeolite micropores. Furthermore, by optimizing the wettability of the zeolite external surface, the zeolite crystals could form a nanoreactor to efficiently enrich the crucial intermediates, thus boosting the performance in low-temperature methane oxidation. Also, the microporous confinement weakens the adsorption of C1 intermediates on the metal sites, accelerating the C-C coupling to improve C2 oxygenate productivity in syngas conversion. In particular, the zeolite framework efficiently stabilizes the metal nanoparticles against sintering and leaching to give durable catalysts. Clearly, this strategy not only guides the rational design of efficient heterogeneous catalysts for potential applications in a variety of industrial chemical reactions but also accelerates the fundamental understanding of the catalytic mechanisms by providing new model catalysts. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - A combination of selective laser melting (SLM) additive manufacture and subtractive process was explored to produce maraging steel copper bimetal. Relationships among laser parameter, interfacial characteristic and mechanical performance are elucidated. A metallurgical bonded interface with a 30-40 mu m inter-diffusion region is formed. Gradient submicro grains with strong < 111 > orientation exhibit at the interface, which owe to high cooling rate and temperature gradient caused by high thermal conductive copper. A selected region of the interface was extracted by focused ion beam(FIB) for interfacial bonding analysis. The bonding mechanism is revealed and illustrated in detail. Interfacial intense Marangoni flows pull the copper toward the molten pool of maraging steel and the liquid maraging steel penetrates into the melting copper, which contributes to interfacial bonding. The bonding strength of hybrid processed bimetals are evaluated. Fracture in tensile is not present at the interface but on the copper side. The highest flexural strength reaches 557 MPa, which is slightly higher than that of the copper. Effects of parameter on fracture behaviors are also elucidated. This hybrid manufacture increases the productivity and functionality of the direct SLM-produced part, and provides a new approach for producing high-performance functional dissimilar bimetals based on laser additive manufacture.

TI  - Recent developments in phase change materials for energy storage applications: A review
VL  - 129
SP  - 491-523
AB  - In order to overcome the increasing demand-supply energy gap due to the rapid urbanization, labor productivity, consumerism and depletion of fossil fuel resources, there is a need for the development of technologies with renewable energy sources. Phase change materials are one of the most appropriate materials for effective utilization of thermal energy from the renewable energy resources. As evident from the literature, development of phase change materials is one of the most active research fields for thermal energy storage with higher efficiency. This review focuses on the application of various phase change materials based on their thermophysical properties. In particular, the melting point, thermal energy storage density and thermal conductivity of the organic, inorganic and eutectic phase change materials are the major selection criteria for various thermal energy storage applications with a wider operating temperature range. The strategy adopted in improving the thermal energy storage characteristics of the phase change materials through encapsulation as well as nanomaterials additives, are discussed in detail. Specifically, the future research trends in the encapsulation and nanomaterials are also highlighted. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil thermal properties can influence several soil processes important for crop productivity. This study was conducted to evaluate the influence of cover crops on selected soil physical and thermal properties. The field site was set up using a randomized complete block design with two levels of cover crops (cover crops versus no cover crops). The soil thermal properties measured included thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and thermal diffusivity. The physical properties of the soil studied included bulk density, volumetric water content, total pore spaces, water-filled pore spaces, air-filled pore spaces, gas diffusion coefficient, and soil pore tortuosity factor. Soil organic carbon was also measured. The results showed that soil organic carbon was 26% higher under cover crops management compared to no cover crops management. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity were positively correlated with soil bulk density and these properties (soil thermal conductivity and soil thermal diffusivity) were higher under no cover crops management compared with cover crops management probably due to the proximity between soil particles. The volumetric heat capacity was positively correlated with soil organic carbon, with soil organic carbon being higher under cover crops management compared with no cover crops management. Results from the current study show that cover crops can improve soil physical and thermal properties which may benefit crop productivity as corroborated via laboratory measurements. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Rainbow trout adaptation to a warmer Patagonia and its potential to increase temperature tolerance in cultured stocks
VL  - 9
SP  - 82-88
AB  - The viability of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) culture is being challenged progressively by global warming. Previous trials with Australian and Japanese rainbow trout lines suggested that improvements in thermal performance may be possible. Here, we hypothesized that strain-related differences in physiological response to temperature exist between a north Patagonian hatchery stock (CENSALBA), a Neotropical one (Criadero Boca de Río), and a thermal stream (Valcheta) population of wild introduced rainbow trout. This was tested by comparing, at 20 °C, the thermal preference, specific metabolic rate, thermal tolerance, growth, and condition on juveniles of the three strains, and on a Valcheta stream male x CENSALBA female F1 cross. Preferred temperature (PT) and loss of equilibrium temperature (LET, a measure of thermal tolerance) of Valcheta stream and F1 were significantly higher than those of CENSALBA, and the average PTs of Valcheta stream and F1 were higher than the 95% confidence interval of available reference data for rainbow trout. These results suggest that the F1, reared under standard hatchery conditions and selected by growth and thermal preference, presents higher thermal preference and higher thermal tolerance than the current CENSALBA hatchery stock. Introduction of this naturally adapted strain to hatchery stocks would likely result in the improvement of their temperature resistance to warmer waters. Current studies on adults of this F1 generation are underway. © 2017 The Authors

VL  - 43

AB  - California's Central Valley contains an abundance of rivers with historical and potential productivity for anadromous salmonids, which are currently limited by impacts such as dams, water diversions, and high temperatures. We surveyed genetic variation in Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss within the upper Tuolumne and Merced rivers in and around Yosemite National Park to evaluate both population origins (ancestry) and the evolutionary response to natural and artificial barriers to migration (adaptation). This analysis revealed that despite extensive stocking with hatchery Rainbow Trout strains throughout the study area, most populations retained largely indigenous ancestry. Adaptive genomic variation associated with anadromy was distributed throughout the study area, with higher frequencies observed in populations connected to reservoirs that are known to support adfluvial life history variants. Fish in southern Central Valley rivers experience temperatures near the upper thermal limit for salmonids and represent an important reservoir of genomic diversity for adaptation to climate change. These results highlight the importance of local adaptation as well as the potential for resident Rainbow Trout populations above barrier dams to contribute to the recovery of steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) once migratory connectivity is restored between upstream spawning and rearing habitats and the ocean. © 2018 American Fisheries Society

TI  - Boosting nitrogen fertilization by a slow releasing nitrate-intercalated biocompatible layered double hydroxide-hydrogel composite loaded with Azospirillum brasilense
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
SP  - 6704-6714
AB  - Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers leads to soil environmental disbalance and therefore, preparation and application of environment-friendly slow-release multifunctional fertilizers are of paramount importance for sustainable crop production in the present scenario. In this study, we propose a slowrelease multifunctional composite nitrogen (N) fertilizer, which possesses the ability to supply plant accessible N in the form of ammonium (NH4 +) and nitrate (NO3 -) to improve nitrate assimilation coupled with zinc (Zn, a major micronutrient for plants in the soil) after its degradation. For this purpose, NO3 - intercalated zinc-aluminum (Zn-Al) layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized using a coprecipitation protocol. The prepared LDH was added as 25.45% of total polymer weight to a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose/hydroxyethyl cellulose citric acid (NaCMC/HEC-CA) biodegradable hydrogel. A. brasilense, commonly used nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soils, was added to the LDH-hydrogel composite along with LDH alone to augment the availability of NH4 + and NO3 -. Adjusting the pH under acidic (pH 5.25) and neutral (pH 7) conditions, the release pattern of NO3 - from LDH and the composite was monitored for 30 days at normal temperature. The pH was selected based on the soil analysis data of North East India. The LDH-composite released 90% (w/w) and 85.45% (w/w) of intercalated NO3 - at pH 5.25 and 7.00 respectively in 30 days. However, 100% (w/w) and 87% (w/w) of intercalated NO3 - at pH 5.25 and 7.00 respectively were released in 30 days when only LDH was applied, which indicated the lower performance of LDH alone in comparison to the LDH-composite for the nitrate holding pattern. The pH of the bacteria-loaded system was observed to be acidic (pH = 5-6) during the study of nitrate assimilation and Zn2+ release. A. brasilense improved nitrate assimilation and increased the NH4 + ion concentration in the studied system. A significant increase in Zn2+ release was observed from day 5 in the presence of A. brasilense in the LDH-composite compared with that in the absence of A. brasilense. In conclusion, the prepared LDH-hydrogel-A. brasilense composite fertilizer system increases the availability of plant accessible N form (both NO3 - and NH4 +) and can potentially improve soil fertility with the addition of Zn and bacteria to the soil in the extended course. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Biologging physiological and ecological responses to climatic variation: New tools for the climate change era
VL  - 6
AB  - In this mini-review, we discuss how biologging technology can be used to detect, understand, and forecast species' responses to climate change. We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step toward answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging with metrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned in measuring phenotypic responses to short-term climate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change. © 2018 Chmura, Glass and Williams.

TI  - Antimicrobial activities and in vitro properties of cold-adapted Lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal tract of cold water fishes of high latitude water areas in Xinjiang, China
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: There are still a large variety of microorganisms among aquatic animals, especially probiotic lactic acid bacteria in cold water fishes at high latitudes have not been fully developed. Hence, the present study aims to evaluate the probiotic potential of cold-adapted Lactobacillus strains isolated from the intestinal tract of cold water fishes (Xinjiang) and select candidates to be used as new food preservative agents and/or probiotic additives in feeding of aquaculture. Results: A total of 43 Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from 16 kinds of intestinal tract of cold-water fishes. They were characterized by phenotypic methods, identified using Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing as four species: Lactobacillus sakei (22 isolates), Lactobacillus plantarum (16 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (4 isolates) and Lactobacillus paracasei (1 isolate). The in vitro tests included survival in low pH and bile, antimicrobial activity (against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Listeria innocua), resistance to 15 antibiotics and hemolytic tests. Among all 43 lactobacilli isolates, the 22 isolates showed a wide range of antimicrobial activity against 6 different pathogenic strains. There were twenty isolates growing at optimal temperature ranging 16~20 °C, which were initially considered to be cold-adapted strains. Two (2) Lb. sakei strains and 2 Lb. plantarum strains demonstrated the highest survivability after 4 h of exposure at pH 2.0. Most of the tested strains cannot be cultured after exposed into 0.5% bile solution for 4 h, while 2 Lb. plantarum strains (E-HLM-3, CQ-CGC-2) and 1 Lb. sakei strain M-DGM-2 survived even at 2% bile concentration. In addition, the safety assessment showed that 22 strains without any detectable hemolytic activity and resistant to glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), levofloxacin, aztreonam, amikacin and oxacillin, while all the studied lactobacilli showed sensitivity to or semi-tolerant to other antibiotics. Conclusions: Based on all the experiments, 3 strains, including E-HLM-3, CQ-CGC-2, and M-DGM-2 might be a candidate of choice for using in the food preservative agents and/or probiotic additives in feeding of aquaculture. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Towards a Dual Lateral Flow Nanobiosensor for Simultaneous Detection of Virus Genotype-Specific PCR Products
VL  - 2018
AB  - Nervous necrosis virus (nodavirus) has been responsible for mass mortalities in aquaculture industry worldwide, with great economic and environmental impact. A rapid low-cost test to identify nodavirus genotype could have important benefits for vaccine and diagnostic applications in small- and medium-scale laboratories in both academia and fish farming industry. A dual lateral flow biosensor for simultaneous detection of the most prevalent nodavirus genotypes (RGNNV and SJNNV) was developed and optimized. The dual biosensor consisted of two antibody-based test zones, indicative of each genotype, and a control zone. The positive signals were visualized by gold nanoparticles functionalized with anti-biotin antibody, and the detection was completed within 20 min. Optimization studies included antibody type and amount determination for test zone construction, gold nanoparticle conjugate type selection for high signal generation, and detection assay parameter determination. Following optimization, the biosensor was evaluated with healthy and RGNNV-nodavirus-infected fish samples. The proposed assay's cost was estimated to be less than 3 , including the required reagents and biosensor. This work presents important steps towards making a dual lateral flow biosensor for nodavirus genotyping; further evaluation with clinical samples is needed before the test is appropriate for diagnostic kit development. © 2018 Dimitra K.

TI  - Generation and selection of Pareto-optimal solution for the sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification system with solid oxide fuel cell
VL  - 196
SP  - 1420-1432
AB  - The biomass gasification coupled with a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system is one of the most efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for combined heat and power generations. For the development and improvement of the integrated process systems, the optimization problem has more than one conflicting objective functions to be optimized (i.e., thermodynamic performance, environmental impacts, annual profit, capital and operating costs) simultaneously. Multi-objective optimization (MOO) methods are used to find a set of optimal (or non-dominated) solutions. In this work, MOO of a sorption enhanced steam biomass gasification (SEG) integrated with an SOFC and gas turbine (GT) system, for combined heat and power production from Eucalyptus wood chips as biomass feedstock, is investigated. Firstly, the model of this integrated plant is developed in Aspen Plus that can be divided into five parts: (1) SEG, (2) hot gas cleaning and steam reforming, (3) SOFC, (4) catalytic burning, GT and CO2 compression, and (5) Portland cement production. As the annual profit demonstrates the economic viability of the plant and annualized capital cost (ACC) indicates availability of investments, the MOO of the integrated plant is performed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions based on the minimization of ACC and maximization of annual profit with five important decision variables. After that, ten selection methods are used to recommend practical solutions for implementing in the integrated plant. In order to explore the effect of decision variables uncertainty on obtained Pareto-optimal solutions, random variations in decision variables are used to quantify deviations in objective functions. The Pareto-optimal solutions are ranked based on the normalized variations for decision variables uncertainty. At the end of this study, robust MOO of the integrated plant is performed, with respect to uncertainties in the market and operating parameters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - HSP 47 expression in fibroblasts by NIR laser irradiation in vitro
VL  - 11618
AB  - We investigated the photothermal effect of near-infrared pulsed laser irradiation on collagen synthesis in fibroblasts in vitro to reduce complications in skin rejuvenation therapy by selective collagen heating. Tissue thermal damage with pain by laser heating of water is a problem in conventional laser skin rejuvenation therapy. To reduce these complications, we suggest heating collagen fibril selectively by applying selective photothermolysis. Laser parameters such as wavelength, pulse duration, pulse interval, and irradiance are important for selective heating. Fibroblasts will be heated gently by conducted heat from collagen fibril in our process, which enhances the expression of heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in fibroblasts. This procedure would reduce pain and thermal damage on fibroblasts compared with the conventional procedure. In this study, we evaluated the amount of HSP47 content per living cell to investigate the photothermal effect on fibroblasts. The temperature distribution of the dermis during laser irradiation was simulated by the finite element method (FEM). 1480 and 1550 nm pulsed laser was irradiated to cultured fibroblasts. The laser emitted with a pulse duration of 100 µs, repetition of 2 kHz, fluence of 0 - 60 J/cm2, and irradiance of 0.5 W/cm2. To evaluate cell functional changes in time, ELISA and cell viability assay were performed 24 and 48 hours after laser irradiation. © 2021 SPIE.

TI  - Lolium perenne - A phytoremediation option in case of total petroleum hydrocarbons polluted soils
VL  - 69
IS  - 5
SP  - 1110-1114
AB  - Rehabilitation of polluted soils with petroleum products requires a re-vegetation strategy to obtain a green mass cover that can quickly and efficiently cover the polluted soil. For the gradual recovery of the destroyed soil, it was necessary: 1. adequate soil treatments with fertilizer i.e. sewage sludge and fly ash as amendment, 2. plant species selection, 3. agronomical works in accordance with geographical position and climatic conditions. Fertilizers and fly ash create conditions for plant installation, by nutrients insurance. Our experiment was conducted in pots with 91.73±11.12 [gKg-1 D.M (dry matter)] total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) polluted soil, fertilised with sewage sludge and fly ash 60 [tha-1] derived from the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power plants. The selected plant species for bio-remediation is Lolium perenne. The selected plant species Lolium perenne is installed on 50-90% of the land surface giving 8 successive crops of grass in the warm season. The TPH reductions of polluted and treated soil were 38.4-56.3 [%]. The biomass did not bioaccumulate chromium at the detection limit. The amounts of cadmium, lead and zink bioaccumulated in the aerial parts were below acceptable limits. The obtained biomass can be used as animal feed or for bedding in shelters. The soil remediation efficiencies of 91.73 ± 11.12 [gKg-1 D.M] were directly proportional to the amount of fly ash used. © 2018 SYSCOM 18 S.R.L. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Strong within-host selection in a maternally inherited obligate symbiont: Buchnera and aphids
VL  - 118
IS  - 35
AB  - Numerous animal lineages have maternally inherited symbionts that are required for host reproduction and growth. Endosymbionts also pose a risk to their hosts because of the mutational decay of their genomes through genetic drift or to selfish mutations that favor symbiont fitness over host fitness. One model for heritable endosymbiosis is the association of aphids with their obligate bacterial symbiont, Buchnera. We experimentally established heteroplasmic pea aphid matrilines containing pairs of closely related Buchnera haplotypes and used deep sequencing of diagnostic markers to measure haplotype frequencies in successive host generations. These frequencies were used to estimate the effective population size of Buchnera within hosts (i.e., the transmission bottleneck size) and the extent of within-host selection. The within-host effective population size was in the range of 10 to 20, indicating a strong potential for genetic drift and fixation of deleterious mutations. Remarkably, closely related haplotypes were subject to strong within-host selection, with selection coefficients as high as 0.5 per aphid generation. In one case, the direction of selection depended on the thermal environment and went in the same direction as between-host selection. In another, a new mutant haplotype had a strong within-host advantage under both environments but had no discernible effect on host-level fitness under laboratory conditions. Thus, within-host selection can be strong, resulting in a rapid fixation of mutations with little impact on host-level fitness. Together, these results show that within-host selection can drive evolution of an obligate symbiont, accelerating sequence evolution. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of coke rate on thermal treatment of waste selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst during iron ore sintering
VL  - 42
SP  - 415-423
AB  - Waste selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst as a hazardous waste has a significant impact on the environment and human health. In present study, a novel technology for thermal treatment of waste SCR catalyst was proposed by adding it to sinter mix for iron ore sintering. The influences of coke rate on the flame front propagation, sinter microstructure, and sinter quality during sintering co-processing the waste SCR catalyst process were studied. In situ tests results indicated the maximum sintering bed temperature increased at higher coke rate, indicating more liquid phase generated and higher airflow resistance. The sintering time was longer and the calculated flame front speed dropped at higher coke rate. Sinter microstructure results found the coalescence and reshaping of bubbles were more fully with increasing coke rate. The porosity dropped from 35.28% to 25.66%, the pore average diameter of large pores decreased from 383.76 μm to 311.43 μm. With increasing coke rate, the sinter indexes of tumbler index, productivity, and yield, increased from 33.2%, 9.2 t·m−2·d−1, 28.9% to 58.0%, 36.0 t·m−2·d−1, 68.9%, respectively. Finally, a comprehensive index was introduced to systematically assess the influence of coke rate on sinter quality, which rose from 100 to 200 when coke rate was increased from 3.5% (mass) to 5.5% (mass). © 2021

TI  - Operation strategies guideline for packed bed thermal energy storage systems
VL  - 43
IS  - 12
SP  - 6211-6221
AB  - Packed bed thermal energy storage (TES) systems have been identified in the last years as one of the most promising TES alternatives in terms of thermal efficiency and economic viability. The relative simplicity of this storage concept opens an important opportunity to its implementation in many environments, from the renewable solar-thermal frame to the industrial waste heat recovery. In addition, its implicit flexibility allows the use of a wide variety of solid materials and heat transfer fluids, which leads to its deployment in very different applications. Its potential to overcome current heat storage system limitations regarding suitable temperature ranges or storage capacities has also been pointed out. However, the full implementation of the packed bed storage concept is still incomplete since no industrial scale units are under operation. The main underlying reasons are associated to the lack of a complete extraction of the full potential of this storage technology, derived from a successful system optimization in terms of material selection, design, and thermal management. These points have been evidenced as critical in order to attain high thermal efficiency values, comparable to the state-of-the-art storage technologies, with improved technoeconomic performance. In order to bring this storage technology to a more mature status, closer to a successful industrial deployment, this paper proposes a double approach. First, a low-cost by-product material with high thermal performance is used as heat storage material in the packed bed. Second, a complete energetic and efficiency analysis of the storage system is introduced as a function of the thermal operation. Overall, the impact of both the selected storage material and the different thermal operation strategies is discussed by means of a thermal model which permits a careful discussion about the implications of each TES deployment strategy and the underlying governing mechanisms. The results show the paramount importance of the selected operation method, able to increase the resulting cycle and material usage efficiency up to values comparable to standard currently used TES solutions. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Analysing the benefits and challenges of retrofitting rural dwellings in Hunan, China to the Passivhaus EnerPHit standard
VL  - 329
AB  - Chinese rural housing largely consists of uninsulated reinforced-concrete apartment blocks with poor energy performance. These dwellings are structurally sound, costly to demolish and challenging to recycle. Retrofit is, therefore, potentially more worthwhile than new build. Currently, there is no Chinese standard for retrofitting dwellings. This research examined the viability of applying the German EnerPHit retrofit standard to Chinese rural dwellings in Hunan, southern China (hot summers and cold winters). Dwellings were evaluated in terms of building structure, materials and systems, and a common type of apartment was selected. The real-world thermal performance of the dwelling was monitored and then the dwelling was modelled using the dynamic thermal simulation software DesignBuilder and Passivhaus Planning Package (PHPP). Monitoring data were used to validate the software’s predicted values. Next, energy-efficient EnerPHit retrofitting measures were incrementally applied to the dwelling model. Simulation results indicated that it was possible for the apartment to meet the EnerPHit standard if an optimised combination of thermal measures were applied. Good ventilation heat recovery was essential for winter comfort and minimum energy consumption; in summer, using adjustable shading and a high efficiency humidity recovery ventilation system was important. Appropriate natural ventilation schedules contributed in lowering cooling energy demand. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

TI  - Adjustments of cardiac mitochondrial phenotype in a warmer thermal habitat is associated with oxidative stress in European perch, Perca fluviatilis
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Mitochondria are playing key roles in setting the thermal limits of fish, but how these organelles participate in selection mechanisms during extreme thermal events associated with climate warming in natural populations is unclear. Here, we investigated the thermal effects on mitochondrial metabolism, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial gene expression in cardiac tissues of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) collected from an artificially heated ecosystem, the "Biotest enclosure", and an adjacent reference area in the Baltic sea with normal temperatures (similar to 23 degrees C and similar to 16 degrees C, respectively, at the time of capture in summer). Fish were sampled one month after a heat wave that caused the Biotest temperatures to peak at similar to 31.5 degrees C, causing significant mortality. When assayed at 23 degrees C, Biotest perch maintained high mitochondrial capacities, while reference perch displayed depressed mitochondrial functions relative to measurements at 16 degrees C. Moreover, mitochondrial gene expression of nd4 (mitochondrial subunit of complex I) was higher in Biotest fish, likely explaining the increased respiration rates observed in this population. Nonetheless, cardiac tissue from Biotest perch displayed higher levels of oxidative damage, which may have resulted from their chronically warm habitat, as well as the extreme temperatures encountered during the preceding summer heat wave. We conclude that eurythermal fish such as perch are able to adjust and maintain mitochondrial capacities of highly aerobic organs such as the heart when exposed to a warming environment as predicted with climate change. However, this might come at the expense of exacerbated oxidative stress, potentially threatening performance in nature.

TI  - Spatial scale, topography and thermoregulatory behaviour interact when modelling species’ thermal niches
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 376-389
AB  - The spatial scale at which climate and species’ occupancy data are gathered, and the resolution at which ecological models are run, can strongly influence predictions of species performance and distributions. Running model simulations at coarse rather than fine spatial resolutions, for example, can determine if a model accurately predicts the distribution of a species. The impacts of spatial scale on a model's accuracy are particularly pronounced across mountainous terrain. Understanding how these discrepancies arise requires a modelling approach in which the underlying processes that determine a species’ distribution are explicitly described. Here we use a process-based model to explore how spatial resolution, topography and behaviour alter predictions of a species thermal niche, which in turn constrains its survival and geographic distribution. The model incorporates biophysical equations to predict the operative temperature (T e ), thermal-dependent performance and survival of a typical insect, with a complex life-cycle, in its microclimate. We run this model with geographic data from a mountainous terrain in South Africa using climate data at three spatial resolutions. We also explore how behavioural thermoregulation affects predictions of a species performance and survival by allowing the animal to select the optimum thermal location within each coarse-grid cell. At the regional level, coarse-resolution models predicted lower T e at low elevations and higher T e at high elevations than models run at fine-resolutions. These differences were more prominent on steep, north-facing slopes. The discrepancies in T e in turn affected estimates of the species thermal niche. The modelling framework revealed how spatial resolution and topography influence predictions of species distribution models, including the potential impacts of climate change. These systematic biases must be accounted for when interpreting the outputs of future modelling studies, particularly when species distributions are predicted to shift from uniform to topographically heterogeneous landscapes. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Lineage Divergence and Vector-Specific Adaptation Have Driven Chikungunya Virus onto Multiple Adaptive Landscapes
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the adaptation of Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) chikungunya virus (CHIKV) strains for Aedes albopictus transmission was mediated by an E1-A226V substitution, followed by either a single substitution in E2 or synergistic substitutions in the E2 and E3 envelope glycoproteins. Here, we examined whether Asian lineage strains, including those that descended from the 2014 Caribbean introduction, are likely to acquire these A. albopictus-adaptive E2 substitutions. Because Asian lineage strains cannot adapt through the E1-A226V substitution due to an epistatic constraint, we first determined that the beneficial effect of these E2 mutations in IOL strains is independent of E1-A226V. We then introduced each of these E2 adaptive mutations into the Asian lineage backbone to determine if they improve infectivity for A. albopictus. Surprisingly, our results indicated that in the Asian lineage backbone, these E2 mutations significantly decreased CHIKV fitness in A. albopictus. Furthermore, we tested the effects of these mutations in Aedes aegypti and observed different results from those in A. albopictus, suggesting that mosquito species-specific factors that interact with the envelope proteins are involved in vector infection efficiency. Overall, our results indicate that the divergence between Asian lineage and IOL CHIKVs has led them onto different adaptive landscapes with differing potentials to expand their vector host range. IMPORTANCE Since its introduction into the Caribbean in October 2013, CHIKV has rapidly spread to almost the entire neotropical region. However, its potential to further spread globally, including into more temperate climates, depends in part on its ability to be transmitted efficiently by Aedes albopictus, which can survive colder winters than A. aegypti. We examined in an Asian lineage backbone A. albopictus-adaptive mutations that arose from 2005 to 2009 in Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) strains. Our results predict that the Asian CHIKV lineage now in the Americas will not readily adapt for enhanced A. albopictus transmission via the same mechanisms or adaptive mutations used previously by IOL strains. The vector species- and CHIKV lineage-specific effects caused by adaptive CHIKV envelope glycoprotein substitutions may elucidate our understanding of the mechanisms of mosquito infection and spread.

TI  - Relationship between spawning and egg and larval stages of a unique estuarine-resident species and environmental variables and prey
VL  - 246
AB  - This study has elucidated the environmental factors associated with spawning and the ecology of early life cycle stages of the sparid Acanthopagrus butcheri, which is atypically long-lived and large for a species confined to its natal estuary. The prevalence of A. butcheri eggs in monthly plankton samples from the Blackwood River Estuary, south-western Australia, in 2014/15, allied with long-term gonadal data, imply that spawning in this estuary commences in mid-spring (October) as water temperatures increase to ~17 °C and peak at ~22 °C in early summer (December). Eggs were initially found only in deeper, downstream areas, where a salt wedge had started to penetrate following precipitous seasonal decline in freshwater discharge. Spawning occurred progressively further upstream during November/December as the salt wedge continued its intrusion of the upper estuary. The concentrations of eggs and yolk-sac and preflexion larvae, which were related positively to salinity and temperature and less so to oxygen concentration, were located predominantly below the halocline, implying that successful spawning typically requires salinities ≥15. Concentrations of eggs and yolk-sac and preflexion larvae peaked in December and of flexion larvae in January. As the concentrations of copepod nauplii exceeded by orders of magnitude those of larval A. butcheri, with which they co-occur and constitute their main prey, it is unlikely that restricted food resources accounted for the poor recruitment of the 2014/15 year class. In this context, the presence of many yolk-sac larvae and preflexion larvae in the low oxygen concentrations, which have become increasingly prevalent in microtidal estuaries of south-western Australia due to climate change, is likely to have led to considerable mortality. In most populations throughout its range in southern Australia, A. butcheri spawns in a restricted period between the austral mid-spring and mid-summer, with the synchrony achieved through differences in the temperatures that cue spawning at different latitudes, i.e. higher temperature cues at lower and thus warmer latitudes. Spawning occurs earlier, however, in atypical estuaries in which salinities and temperatures are high in late winter/spring. Despite experiencing episodic recruitment, A. butcheri sustains substantial populations through maturing early relative to its maximum age, and therefore producing numerous offspring in those few years when spawning conditions are optimal. Episodic recruitment could thus be related to subtle inter-annual differences in environmental conditions during the short spawning periods, with oxygen levels greater than usual a potential key factor. The adaptability of A. butcheri makes this sparid useful in assessing the degree, direction and scale of climate change effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Resource availability alters fitness trade-offs: implications for evolution in stressful environments
VL  - 107
IS  - 2
SP  - 308-318
AB  - Premise: Industrialization and human activities have elevated temperatures and caused novel precipitation patterns, altering soil moisture and nutrient availability. Predicting evolutionary responses to climate change requires information on the agents of selection that drive local adaptation and influence resource acquisition and allocation. Here, we examined the contribution of nutrient and drought stress to local adaptation, and we tested whether trade-offs across fitness components constrain or facilitate adaptation under resource stress. Methods: We exposed 35 families of Boechera stricta (Brassicaceae) to three levels of water and two levels of nutrient supply in a factorial design in the greenhouse. We sourced maternal families from a broad elevational gradient (2499–3530 m a.s.l.), representing disparate soil moisture and nutrient availability. Results: Concordant with local adaptation, maternal families from arid, low-elevation populations had enhanced fecundity under severe drought over those from more mesic, high-elevation sites. Furthermore, fitness trade-offs between growth and reproductive success depended on the environmental context. Under high, but not low, nutrient levels, we found a negative phenotypic relationship between the probability of reproduction and growth rate. Similarly, a negative phenotypic association only emerged between fecundity and growth under severe drought stress, not the benign water treatment levels, indicating that stressful resource environments alter the direction of trait correlations. Genetic covariances were broadly concordant with these phenotypic patterns. Conclusions: Despite high heritabilities in all fitness components across treatments, trade-offs between growth and reproduction could constrain adaptation to increasing drought stress and novel nutrient levels. © 2020 Botanical Society of America

TI  - Response of liriomyza trifolii to cold acclimation and differences of cold tolerance among different populations
VL  - 54

SP  - 2781-2788
AB  - [Objective] The response of the major invasive pest Liriomyza trifolii to cold acclimation and the cold tolerance of three geographical populations (Wuhan City, Hubei Province; Haikou City, Hainan Province; Anqing City, Anhui Province) were studied to provide references for the potential colonization of L. trifolii in high latitudes of China. [Method] The pupae and adults of L. trifolii population in Hainan were exposed to low temperatures of -12, -14, -16, -18, -20, -22 and -24°C for 30 min, and the temperature with a survival rate of 15%-30% was selected as the recognition temperature. The L. trifolii pupae and adults were put at 5°C for 1-6 h or 12°C for 1-6 d, and then put at the recognition temperature for 30 min to detect the survival rate. The undomesticated pupae and adults were also placed at the recognition temperature for 30 min as a control, and the difference in low-temperature survival rate after cold acclimation was compared. Besides, five target temperatures were set at 0, -5, -10, -15, and -20°C, respectively, and the pupae of three geographical populations were exposed to the target temperatures for 2 h, the difference of survival rate was studied. Finally, the supercooling point (SCP) of pupae of three geographical populations was measured by supercooling point tester. [Result] When the L. trifolii pupae and adults were exposed to -20°C for 30 min, the survival rates were 15.0%, 19.6%, and 21.0%, respectively. Therefore, -20°C was determined as the cold acclimation recognition temperature of L. trifolii. The cold tolerance of L. trifolii pupae and adults was improved after rapid cold acclimation at 5°C, and the adults responded more positively to rapid cold acclimation. The effect of cold acclimation for 1 h and 2 h was the best, and the effect of rapid cold acclimation decreased gradually until disappeared with the extension of exposure time. Within 6 days, the cold tolerance of L. trifolii pupae and adults was improved by low-temperature exposure at 12°C for different periods, and there was little difference in cold tolerance after cold acclimation for different periods. Besides, under the low-temperature exposure of 5, 0 and -5°C, there was no significant difference in the survival rate of pupae between the Hainan population and Anhui, Hubei populations, but under the low-temperature exposure of -10, -15 and -20°C, the pupa survival rate of Hainan population was significantly lower than that of Anhui and Hubei populations. The SCP of pupae in the Anhui and Hubei populations was significantly lower than that in the Hainan population.[Conclusion] The cold tolerance of L. trifolii can be enhanced by cold acclimation, which may be one of the reasons why L. trifolii gradually spread to high latitudes in China. The cold tolerance of the Hubei and Anhui populations is stronger than that of the Hainan population. The results are helpful to predict the overwintering distribution area of L. trifolii in China and guide its monitoring, early warning, and prevention and control. © 2021 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate selected physical, morphological and thermal properties of durum wheat grain. Additionally, the parameters of control grain (grown without fertilizers or a growth retardant) were compared with the grain from treatments with different combinations of nitrogen fertilizer and growth retardant. The grain of durum wheat grown without nitrogen fertilizer or growth retardant was characterized by the lowest values of thousand-kernel weight (47.24 g for the sample collected in 2015 and 45.70 g for the sample collected in 2016), bulk density (814 kg m−3—2015 and 745 kg m−3—2016), length (7.62 mm—2015 and 7.54 mm—2016), width (3.35 mm—2015 and 3.32 mm—2016) and shape factors (specific perimeter of object boundary, Danielsson coefficient). The highest values of thousand-kernel weight, bulk density and width of durum wheat grain harvested in both years of the study were determined in the samples collected in the treatment with a total nitrogen rate of 80 kg ha−1 without the growth retardant. In the samples collected in 2015, the above combination produced grain with the greatest length, the highest specific perimeter of object boundary and the highest Danielsson coefficient. In 2016, these parameters were highest in grain from the treatment where a total nitrogen rate of 80 kg ha−1 was combined with a growth retardant. Different combinations of nitrogen fertilization and the growth retardant did not affect the true density or the thermal properties of wheat grain. Statistically significant differences between the experimental groups were not observed. © 2018, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).

TI  - Effect of Fire Hazard on Seismic Capacity of RC Frame Building
VL  - 175
SP  - 223
AB  - Fire represents one of the most severe hazards encountered by built infrastructure in any urban habitat. It can result from an accidental event viz., short circuiting or as a secondary event following other natural hazards such as earthquakes, explosions, etc. Fires, if not controlled at early stages, can create threatening situations leading to a catastrophe. This can include loss of life, huge property damage contributing to the impaired functionality of existing infrastructure systems, etc. Further, in most of the disastrous seismic events across the world, fire happens to be a significant contributor for the causalities encountered. In addition, post-fire behaviour of structure is necessary for determining the extent of structural damage left behind by a fire event for necessary repair and also for ensuring the safety and integrity of the structure. Hence, a four-storey RC frame building designed according to IS codes located in the city of Warangal, Telangana State has been selected in this study. Thermal analysis of structural components is performed to generate the modified material, and cross-sectional properties for various fire scenarios expressed in terms of exposure times. Finally, the seismic inelastic capacity of the structure is evaluated using nonlinear static analysis for various fire scenarios on the structural models considered. From the results, it can be clearly envisaged that the seismic structural capacity significantly reduces due to a fire hazard and can prove detrimental for survival of the structure in case of prolonged fire hazard. Hence, consideration of fire hazard is necessary to estimate the capacity and in arriving at an appropriate repair/retrofitting strategy for restoring the functionality of the built environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Density-dependent habitat selection predicts fitness and abundance in a small lizard
VL  - 127
IS  - 3
SP  - 448-459
AB  - Density-dependent habitat selection has been used to predict and explain patterns of abundance of species between habitats. Thermal quality, a density-independent component of habitat suitability, is often the most important factor for habitat selection in ectotherms which comprise the vast majority of animal species. Ectotherms may reach high densities such that individual fitness is reduced in a habitat due to increased competition for finite resources. Therefore, density and thermal quality may present conflicting information about which habitat will provide the highest fitness reward and ectotherm habitat selection may be density-independent. Using ornate tree lizards Urosaurus ornatus at 10 sites each straddling two adjacent habitats (wash and upland), we tested the hypothesis that habitat selection is density-dependent even when thermal quality differs between habitats. We first tested that fitness proxies decline with density in each habitat, indicating density-dependent effects on habitat suitability. We also confirmed that the two habitats vary in suitability (quantified by food abundance and thermal quality). Next, we tested the predictions that habitat selection depends on density with isodar analyses and that fitness proxies are equal in the two habitats within a site. We found that monthly survival rates decreased with density, and that the wash habitat had more prey and higher thermal quality than the upland habitat. Lizards preferred the habitat with more food and higher thermal quality, lizard densities in the two habitats were positively correlated, and fitness proxies of lizards did not differ between habitats. These patterns are consistent with density-dependent habitat selection, despite differences in thermal quality between habitats. We expect that density-dependent habitat selection is widespread in terrestrial ectotherms when densities are high and temperatures are close to their optimal performance range. In areas where thermal quality is low, however, we expect that depletable resources, such as food, become less limiting because assimilating resources is more difficult. © 2017 The Authors

TI  - Thermal tolerance of a thermally selected strain of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and the pedigrees of its F1 and F2 generations indicated by their critical thermal maxima
VL  - 84
IS  - 4
SP  - 671-679
AB  - A thermally selected strain of rainbow trout has been established by selective breeding since 1966 in Miyazaki, Japan. In the present study, we compared the critical thermal maxima (CTMs), the temperatures at which organisms reach a predefined sublethal endpoint and lose their equilibrium, between a thermally selected and two normal (Donaldson) strains of rainbow trout. The CTM of one normal strain from Nikko (Nikko strain) acclimated to 20 A degrees C (29.7 A degrees C) was significantly lower than those of the thermally selected strain (30.0 A degrees C) and the other Donaldson strain from Aomori (29.9 A degrees C) (P < 0.05). The F1 generations, F1T and F1N, were produced by crossing thermally selected strain females with Nikko strain males and Nikko strain females with thermally selected strain males, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the CTM between F1T [30.1 +/- 0.15 A degrees C (n = 30)] and F1N [30.1 +/- 0.16 A degrees C (n = 30)] (P > 0.05) for fish acclimated to 20 A degrees C, suggesting that the F1 offspring inherited the thermal tolerance trait from one thermally selected strain parent irrespective of whether it was the male or female. F2 offspring of F1T or F1N also showed the thermal tolerance trait. The coefficients of variation for CTM were also compared among all the datasets obtained in the present study and their values for F1 hybrids were lower than those of the parental generation of the Nikko strain (P < 0.05). In contrast, the coefficients of variation of F2s were the same as those of their parental generation. Furthermore, the thermally selected strain and Nikko strain as a reference family provide a F2 generation for segregating phenotypes, which is required for in-depth genetic analysis of the thermally selected rainbow trout strain.

TI  - Changes in dive patterns of leatherback turtles with sea surface temperature and potential foraging habitats
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - Marine mesotherms are able to occupy broader thermal niches than ectotherms; however, this means they must thermoregulate according to diverse thermal conditions across the ocean. Knowledge remains limited about how differences in thermal conditions within the selected habitats affect the behavior and associated ecological traits in mesotherms. Here, we tested if a marine mesotherm, leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) generally maintain their body temperature by diving to greater depths to expose themselves to cold waters as sea surface temperature becomes warmer. Moreover, we investigate how such behavioral thermoregulation may influence their ecological traits (e.g., foraging and migration). We analyzed 49,461 dive profiles and 16,255 temperature-depth profiles from 17 leatherback turtles migrating across the North Pacific using satellite-linked data loggers. Our results showed that leatherbacks changed their dive behavior regionally, in response to sea surface temperature and potential foraging habitats. Dive type classification revealed that V-shaped, presumably gliding dives, became deeper when the surface water was warmer, likely because leatherbacks dive to deep cold waters to avoid overheating. We found five hotspots of wiggle (up-and-down undulations in the depth profile) dives that are indicative of foraging behavior, ranging from tropical to cool-temperate regions in the North Pacific. The dive patterns in potential foraging hotspots indicate that leatherbacks engage in behavioral thermoregulation in warmer regions. Such bioenergetics may affect the time available for foraging activity during migration phases. In cool-temperate foraging areas, leatherbacks are indeed able to spend more time foraging due to mesothermy. However, the trade-off between energy gain by foraging activity and additional migration cost of moving to higher latitude areas might not result in greater reproductive output for leatherbacks foraging in distant cool-temperate regions. These patterns highlight that mesothermy represents a trade-off: Leatherbacks can utilize cooler waters but must engage in additional behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., extremely deep dives) in warmer waters. Thus, mesothermy might not provide a direct fitness advantage to all individual leatherback turtles; rather, it affords a species-level fitness advantage by allowing a greater diversity of habitats to be utilized. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Female American lobster (Homarus americanus) size-at-maturity declined in Canada during the 20th and early 21st centuries1
VL  - 75
IS  - 6
SP  - 908-924
AB  - Changes in the environment and fishing have been shown to affect life-history characteristics, such as size or age of maturation, in a number of finfish and invertebrates. The American lobster (Homarus americanus) supports Canada’s most valuable fishery and exploitation rates are high. Female size-at-maturity (SM) is an important parameter in management of this species, as it is used in establishing minimum legal size regulations. In this study, we show with historical and recent data that SM of female American lobsters has declined across most of Canada, in some areas by as much as 30%, over the past 10–80 years. The spatial patterns of these declines are inconsistent with patterns of rising ocean temperature and lobster abundance (density). They are, however, strongly correlated to the strength of size-based fishery selection, and egg-per-recruit modeling indicates a gain in lifetime egg production associated with observed SM declines under a range of realistic harvesting scenarios. These findings suggest that the marked decrease we document in SM of female American lobsters in Canada over the past century represents an evolutionary response to intense exploitation. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Response surface design and multi-objective optimization of Poria cocos cubes drying by vacuum combined inclined hot air
VL  - 52
IS  - 8
SP  - 2294-2305
AB  - Objective: To investigate the vacuum temperature (x1) switching moisture ratio (x2), hot air temperature (x3) and their interaction on drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content and crushing rate in the process of "vacuum drying + inclined hot air" combined drying of Poria cocos. Therefore, the drying process parameters of P. cocos with short drying time, good quality and low energy consumption were achieved. Methods: Taking P. cocos cube as raw material, when the vacuum drying reaches a certain moisture content, the inclined hot air drying is carried out; The factors of vacuum drying temperature (65-85 ℃), switching moisture ratio (70%-90%) and hot air drying temperature (65-85 ℃) are selected to design Box-Behnken response surface test was used to analyze the primary and secondary factors influencing the indexes and the interaction among them. The quadratic regression model of drying time, unit energy, polysaccharide content and crushing rate were established. The fitness function was constructed and optimized by comprehensive scoring method, genetic algorithm and NSGA-II method respectively. By comparing the results of the three optimization methods, the optimal process parameters were obtained and verified. Results: The order of influencing drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content and crushing rate was x2 &gt; x3 &gt; x1, x2 &gt; x1 &gt; x3, x3 &gt; x2 &gt; x1, x2 &gt; x3 &gt; x1. The regression model of drying time, energy consumption per unit, polysaccharide content and crushing rate was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001), which could be used to analyze and predict the evaluation index of P. cocos cube combined drying. The optimal process parameters were optimized by comprehensive scoring method as follows: vacuum temperature 65.12 ℃, moisture ratio 70.07%, hot air temperature 74.19 ℃. Under this circumstance, the drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content and crushing rate was 330.4 min, 4.13 kJ•h/kg, 3.52 mg/g and 4.48%, respectively. The process parameters optimized by genetic algorithm was as follows: vacuum temperature 82.23 ℃, switching water ratio 81.10% and hot air temperature 69.04 ℃. And the drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content and crushing rate was 245.27 min, 2.01 kJ•h/kg, 3.32 mg/g and 23.05%, respectively. NSGA-II algorithm optimized the optimal process parameters as follows: vacuum temperature 65.04 ℃, switching moisture ratio 70%, hot air temperature 70.96 ℃, under which the drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content, crushing rate were 340.86 min, 4.22 kJ•h/kg, 3.87 mg/g and 4.21%, respectively. Taking fitness value as the evaluation index, the NSGA-II algorithm optimization can be considered as the best result. Conclusion: NSGA-II algorithm can be used for the multi-objective optimization of "vacuum drying + inclined hot air" drying process of P. cocos cubes, and the better process parameters selected from Pareto set are modified. The optimal conditions are determined as follows: vacuum temperature 65 ℃, switching moisture ratio 70%, hot air temperature 71 ℃. The drying time, unit energy consumption, polysaccharide content and crushing rate were (335 ± 13) min, (4.28 ± 0.32) kJ•h/kg, (3.82 ± 0.31) mg/g, (4.33 ± 0.35)%, respectively. The optimized combined drying process has the advantages of short drying time, low energy consumption per unit, high polysaccharide content, low crushing rate, and significant energy saving and synergistic effect, which can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the industrial processing of P. cocos. © 2021, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

TI  - Explore the feasibility of fabricating pure copper parts with low-laser energy by selective laser melting
VL  - 7
IS  - 10
AB  - Pure copper is widely used for complex shapes, high thermal conductivity and good conductivity parts, such as heat exchangers, welding nozzles, injection molds, and various conductive parts. However, traditional manufacturing techniques are difficult to design complex pure copper parts into the most effective thermal and conductive structure. Selective Laser melting(SLM) can fabricate parts with complex shapes directly. However, due to the characteristics of easy oxidation, high optical reflectivity and high thermal conductivity, 3D printing pure copper by SLM is extremely challenging. In this study, the feasibility of fabricating pure copper by low-laser energy was studied by both numerical simulation and printing experiments, and the characteristics of the molten pool (molten pool structure, temperature flow and velocity flow) were studied. The results showed that due to its high thermal conductivity, heat spread out quickly in the molten pool, temperature rise rate and cooling rate reached as high as 1.36 × 107 K S−1, 2.99 × 105 K S−1 respectively. And it took only about 1.7 × 10–4 S for the process time of powder melting and solidification. Additionally, by reducing the particle size, the absorption rate for pure copper was improved, pure copper parts were successfully fabricated with low-laser energy: laser power 500 W, hatching space 0.07 mm, layer thickness 0.03 mm, laser scanning velocity 2500 mm s−1. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Plant–microbiome interactions under a changing world: responses, consequences and perspectives
VL  - 234

AB  - Climate change is increasing global temperatures and the frequency and severity of droughts in many regions. These anthropogenic stresses pose a significant threat to plant performance and crop production. The plant-associated microbiome modulates the impacts of biotic and abiotic stresses on plant fitness. However, climate change-induced alteration in composition and activities of plant microbiomes can affect host functions. Here, we highlight recent advancements in our understanding of the impact of climate change (warming and drought) on plant–microbiome interactions and on their ecological functions from genome to ecosystem scales. We identify knowledge gaps, propose new concepts and make recommendations for future research directions. It is proposed that in the short term (years to decades), the adaptation of plants to climate change is mainly driven by the plant microbiome, whereas in the long term (century to millennia), the adaptation of plants will be driven equally by eco-evolutionary interactions between the plant microbiome and its host. A better understanding of the response of the plant and its microbiome interactions to climate change and the ways in which microbiomes can mitigate the negative impacts will better inform predictions of climate change impacts on primary productivity and aid in developing management and policy tools to improve the resilience of plant systems. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Spatial genetic structure in a crustacean herbivore highlights the need for local considerations in Baltic Sea biodiversity management
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 974-990
AB  - Incorporating species' eco-evolutionary responses to human-caused disturbances remains a challenge in marine management efforts. A prerequisite is knowledge of geographic structure and scale of genetic diversity and connectivity—the so-called seascape genetic patterns. The Baltic Sea is an excellent model system for studies linking seascape genetics with effects of anthropogenic stress. However, seascape genetic patterns in this area are only described for a few species and are completely unknown for invertebrate herbivores, which constitute a critical part of the ecosystem. This information is crucial for sustainable management, particularly under future scenarios of rapid environmental change. Here, we investigate the population genetic structure among 31 locations throughout the Baltic Sea, of which 45% were located in marine protected areas, in one of the most important herbivores of this region, the isopod crustacean Idotea balthica, using an array of 33,774 genome-wide SNP markers derived from 2b-RAD sequencing. In addition, we generate a biophysical connectivity matrix for I. balthica from a combination of oceanographic current models and estimated life history traits. We find population structure on scales of hundreds of kilometers across the Baltic Sea, where genomic patterns in most cases closely match biophysical connectivity, indicating passive transport with oceanographic currents as an important mean of dispersal in this species. We also find a reduced genetic diversity in terms of heterozygosity along the main salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea, suggesting periods of low population size. Our results provide crucial information for the management of a key ecosystem species under expected changes in temperature and salinity following global climate change in a marine coastal area. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Nest site selection in a southern and northern population of the velvet gecko (Amalosia lesueurii)
VL  - 102
AB  - In many oviparous reptiles, thermal conditions inside nests influence phenotypic traits of hatchlings that are linked to survival. Maternal nest-site selection can therefore have long-term implications for offspring and maternal fitness. We studied nest-site selection in a nocturnal lizard (Amalosia lesueurii) from south eastern Australia. Females of this species lay their eggs communally inside rock crevices, and previous studies have shown that maximum daily nest temperatures are positively correlated with maximum daily air temperatures. The incubation period extends for up to 100 d, so during hot summers, embryos may be exposed to stressful thermal conditions. Potentially, mothers could buffer their eggs from thermal extremes via careful selection of nest sites. To evaluate this, we studied nest site selection in a southern population (Morton) and a northern population (Yengo) that experience mild and hot summers respectively. In the field, we measured the physical characteristics, orientation, canopy cover and incident radiation load, and thermal regimes of nest sites and randomly available crevices during one of the hottest Australian summers on record (2018–2019). We found strong inter population differences in the degree of canopy cover and solar radiation loads above nest sites. Nest sites from Morton were more open, and received higher radiation loads, than nest sites from Yengo. Mean nest temperatures were similar in Morton and Yengo, but nests from Yengo experienced higher daily temperatures than those from Morton. During heatwaves, temperatures in some nests exceeded the species critical thermal maximum (39.9 °C) for several hours each day. Our results show that females can adjust nest-site choice to match local environments, but future research is necessary to clarify whether exposure to high temperatures influences hatching success or offspring phenotypes in this species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Retrospective evaluation of marker-assisted selection for resistance to bacterial cold water disease in three generations of a commercial rainbow trout breeding population
VL  - 9
AB  - Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD), caused by Flavobacterium psychrophilum, is an endemic and problematic disease in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture. Previously, we have identified SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) associated with BCWD resistance in rainbow trout. The objectives of this study were (1) to validate the SNPs associated with BCWD resistance in a commercial breeding population; and (2) to evaluate retrospectively the accuracy of MAS (marker-assisted selection) for BCWD resistance in this commercial breeding program. Three consecutive generations of the Troutlodge May breeding population were evaluated for BCWD resistance. Based on our previous studies, a panel of 96 SNPs was selected and used to genotype the parents and ten offspring from each of the 138 full-sib families of the 2015 generation, and 37 SNPs associated with BCWD resistance were validated. Thirty-six of the validated SNPs were clustered on chromosomes Omy3, Omy8 and Omy25. Thus, at least three QTL (quantitative trait loci) for BCWD resistance were validated in the 2015 generation. Three SNPs from each QTL region were used for haplotype association analysis. Three haplotypes, Omy3TGG, Omy8GCG and Omy25CGG, were found to be associated with BCWD resistance in the 2015 generation. Retrospective analyses were then performed to evaluate the accuracy of MAS for BCWD resistance using these three favorable haplotypes. The accuracy of MAS was estimated with the Pearson correlation coefficient between the total number of favorable haplotypes in the two parents and the family BCWD survival rates. The Omy8 and Omy25 haplotypes were positively correlated with the family BCWD survival rates across all three generations. The accuracies of MAS using these two haplotypes together were consistently around 0.5, which was equal or greater than the accuracy of the conventional family-based selection in the same generation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MAS for BCWD resistance is feasible in this commercial rainbow trout breeding population. © 2018 Liu, Vallejo, Evenhuis, Martin, Hamilton, Gao, Leeds, Wiens and Palti.

TI  - Isolation and molecular identification of lignin peroxidase- producing bacterial isolates from Jeddah City
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SP  - 338-346
AB  - Background The identification of naturally occurring bacteria with lignin-oxidizing enzymes would be significant. Several species of filamentous bacteria belonging to the genus Streptomyces (Actinomycetes) have been identified as degraders of lignin. Such species play the most important role in biodegradation of lignin. Objective This study aimed to isolate and discover promising isolates and ideal conditions for lignin peroxidase (LiP) production as well as 16S-rRNA identification of the ligninolytic bacterial strains. Materials and methods Lignin was isolated and purified from black wood liquor. The ligninolytic bacterial colonies were isolated from three types of soil farms (F1, F2, and F3) from Jeddah, KSA. Fermentation medium (FM) was used for screening of lignin-degrading bacteria after dilution of the soil sample using lignin (0.1% v/v). The FM medium was supplemented with 50 mg/l of Azure B and toluidine dyes and 100 mg/l of tannic acid. FM was used without any supplements and agar for isolation of lignin-degrading bacteria after dilution of the soil samples. Different concentrations of lignin (0.1-0.9%) were applied to optimize LiP production by the selected strains under different temperatures (30, 35, 40, and 45°C); different pH values (7, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5); eight different carbon sources (0.1%, w/v), such as glucose, fructose, xylose, lactose, sucrose, carboxymethyl cellulose, and xylan; and four organic sources (0.1%, w/v), such as peptone, meat extract, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate. The enzyme productivity was evaluated in the culture supernatant. The bacterial strain genomic DNA was extracted from pure culture isolated from soil and subjected to amplification and sequencing of 16 S ribosomal RNA gene. Results and discussion Nine ligninolytic bacterial colonies that excrete peroxidases based on the use of lignin (as sole carbon source) were isolated from three types of soil farms (F1, F2, and F3) from Jeddah, KSA, and the promising isolates and the optimum conditions for LiP production using FM under three incubation periods were evaluated. Two most active isolates for production of LiP belonging to Actinomycetes and Bacilli designated (R-St-1 and R-B-1) were identified using 16S-rRNA. Results showed that the highest LiP producer was Streptomyces R-St-1 isolate (3.8 U/ml) followed by Bacilli R-B-1 isolate (2.4 U/ml) after 3 days of fermentation. Different concentrations of lignin (0.1-0.9%) were tested for their effect on LiP production by Streptomyces R-St-1. As lignin concentration increased, LiP production increased, and the maximum productivity of 4.9 U.mL-1 was observed at 0.5% lignin after which the LiP production was decreased. At the ideal temperature recorded of 35°C and at the optimum pH of 7.5, the production of LiP rose significantly (4.6 U.mL-1 and 4.0 U.mL-1).Various carbon sources were examined for LiP production, and glucose was shown to be the best option for producing a high yield of LiP by Streptomyces R-St-1, followed by lactose (4.6 and 4.0 U/ml, respectively). However, neither organic nor inorganic nitrogen sources were shown to be suited for high LiP output. As lignin concentration increased, LiP production increased, and the maximum productivity of 4.4 U/ml from Bacilli R-B-1 isolate was observed at 0.7% lignin, after which LiP production was decreased. The optimum temperature was 40°C, where LiP production showed a significant increase (4.5 U/ml), whereas the optimum pH was 8.0, and sucrose was found to be more suitable for high yield of LiP production followed by glucose (4.3 and 3.3 U/ml, respectively). The identified bacterial DNA sequences were conserved in the GenBank under two accession numbers OL697233.1 (Streptomyces lavendulae R-St-1) and Priestia aryabhattai R-B-1(OL697234.1) (formerly known as Bacillus aryabhattai). © 2022 Egyptian Pharmaceutical Journal.

TI  - Steep and deep: Terrain and climate factors explain brown bear (Ursus arctos) alpine den site selection to guide heli-skiing management
VL  - 15
IS  - 9
AB  - Winter recreation and tourism continue to expand worldwide, and where these activities overlap with valuable wildlife habitat, there is greater potential for conservation concerns. Wildlife populations can be particularly vulnerable to disturbance in alpine habitats as helicopters and snowmachines are increasingly used to access remote backcountry terrain. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) have adapted hibernation strategies to survive this period when resources and energy reserves are limited, and disturbance could negatively impact fitness and survival. To help identify areas of potential conflict between helicopter skiing and denning brown bears in Alaska, we developed a model to predict alpine denning habitat and an associated data-based framework for mitigating disturbance activities. Following den emergence in spring, we conducted three annual aerial surveys (2015-2017) and used locations from three GPS-collared bears (2008-2014) to identify 89 brown bear dens above the forest line. We evaluated brown bear den site selection of land cover, terrain, and climate factors using resource selection function (RSF) models. Our top model supported the hypothesis that bears selected dens based on terrain and climate factors that maximized thermal efficiency. Brown bears selected den sites characterized by steep slopes at moderate elevations in smooth, well-drained topographies that promoted vegetation and deep snow. We used the RSF model to map relative probability of den selection and found 85% of dens occurred within terrain predicted as prime denning habitat. Brown bear exposure to helicopter disturbance was evident as moderate to high intensities of helicopter flight tracking data overlapped prime denning habitat, and we quantified where the risk of these impact was greatest. We also documented evidence of late season den abandonment due to disturbance from helicopter skiing. The results from this study provide valuable insights into bear denning habitat requirements in subalpine and alpine landscapes. Our quantitative framework can be used to support conservation planning for winter recreation industries operating in habitats occupied by denning brown bears. © 2020 Crupi et al.

TI  - Resurrection of dormant Daphnia magna: Protocol and applications
VL  - 2018
IS  - 131
AB  - Long-term studies enable the identification of eco-evolutionary processes that occur over extended time periods. In addition, they provide key empirical data that may be used in predictive modelling to forecast evolutionary responses of natural ecosystems to future environmental changes. However, excluding a few exceptional cases, long-term studies are scarce because of logistic difficulties associated with accessing temporal samples. Temporal dynamics are frequently studied in the laboratory or in controlled mesocosm experiments with exceptional studies that reconstruct the evolution of natural populations in the wild. Here, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided to revive or resurrect dormant Daphnia magna, a widespread zooplankton keystone species in aquatic ecosystems, to dramatically advance the state-of-the-art longitudinal data collection in natural systems. The field of Resurrection Ecology was defined in 1999 by Kerfoot and co-workers, even though the first attempts at hatching diapausing zooplankton eggs date back to the late 1980s. Since Kerfoot's seminal paper, the methodology of resurrecting zooplankton species has been increasingly frequently applied, though propagated among laboratories only via direct knowledge transfer. Here, an SOP is described that provides a step-by-step protocol on the practice of resurrecting dormant Daphnia magna eggs. Two key studies are provided in which the fitness response of resurrected Daphnia magna populations to warming is measured, capitalizing on the ability to study historical and modern populations in the same settings. Finally, the application of next generation sequencing technologies to revived or still dormant stages is discussed. These technologies provide unprecedented power in dissecting the processes and mechanisms of evolution if applied to populations that have experienced changes in selection pressure over time. © 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

VL  - 254
AB  - In educational buildings, an efficient daylight design has significant influences on student's visual comfort, well-being and productivity while it offers significant benefits for reducing lighting energy consumption. Besides visual discomfort, the excess of daylight entry to space will cause disadvantages, including building overheat. Therefore, it is essential to define the optimal design for daylight control devices. In previous studies, daylight performance of light-shelf as a window-attached daylight control device has been studied. This paper aims to investigate the effect of sky cloudiness on the optimum light-shelf properties defined for typical classrooms. In addition, the optimum properties of the light shelf for classrooms in two cities have been defined, which had not been addressed in Iran's national codes and guidelines. The methodology used is based on three steps: daylight optimization of light shelf parameters, thermal comfort analysis for selected solutions, and choosing the best option. Four parameters of light-shelf, including height, length of the exterior part, length, and angle of inner part, have been considered as variables. Using Octopus optimization algorithm in Rhinoceros, Grasshopper simulation tool, a multi-objective algorithm has been applied to find the optimum combination of the parameters based on daylight performance indicators. Thermal comfort analysis has been conducted for selected solutions with optimized light shelves using Openstudio. The results indicated that applying light-shelf in Tehran with less sky cloudiness is more effective than Sari in terms of providing both daylight and thermal comfort, especially for cases with more window to wall ratio (WWR). Sari, the case with lower WWR, does not necessarily have less Annual Solar Exposure, even with an optimized light-shelf. Hence choosing the best option without comparing daylight metrics for optimized solutions of various WWR is misleading. According to the results, although the best options are different in the cities as the effect of sky cloud cover, the optimum light-shelf properties are the same in light-shelf height, exterior, and interior length, while the pivot angles vary. There is also a relation between rotation angle and daylight availability regarding WWR in each city. Considering daylight and comfort issues, WWR for the best option in Tehran is greater than Sari. The study results provide useful information for designers for choosing the optimal properties of light shelves and the best option for design in the two mentioned cities. @ 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Adaptation of Drosophila species to climate change — A literature review since 2003
VL  - 18

SP  - 805-814
AB  - Global climate warming has been exerting impacts on agricultural pests. Pests also take some strategies to adapt to climate change. Understanding such adaptation could benefit more accurate predictions and integrated management of pest. However, adaptation to climate change has not been widely investigated in agricultural pests but has been well documented in model species, Drosophila, and reviewed by Hoffmann before 2003. To provide recent progress and references for agricultural entomologists who interested in thermal biology, here we have reviewed literatures since 2003 about adaptation to temperature changes under climate change. We mainly summarized thermal adaptation of Drosophila (especially to high temperatures) from three aspects, behaviors, plastic responses and micro-evolution and discussed how Drosophila increases their heat tolerance through these three mechanisms. Finally, we summarized the measures of thermotolerance and concluded the main progress in recent decade about the behavioral thermoregulation, mortality risks driven by limited evolutionary and plastic response under climate change, geographic distribution based on basal rather than plastic thermotolerance. We propose future work focus on better understanding adaptation of organisms including agricultural pests to climate change. © 2019 CAAS. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V

TI  - Er composition (X)-mediated catalytic properties of Ce1-XErXVO4 surfaces for selective catalytic NOX reduction with NH3 at elevated temperatures
VL  - 359
SP  - 65-75
AB  - Catalytic rare earth metal vanadates have shown promise for efficiently converting NOX to N2 at elevated temperatures (NH3-SCR) (e.g., CeVO4, ErVO4, and TbVO4). However, these vanadates have limitations as catalytic sites because of three major issues such as weak hydro-thermal stability, low N2 selectivity, and limited numbers of major active (Lewis acid) sites. As an efficient way to circumvent these constraints, this study showcases a means of structurally modifying vanadate with additional rare earth metals to generate bimetallic vanadates with variable metal compositions. While selecting Ce and Er as metal constituents, a series of Ce1-XErXVO4 solid solutions were deposited onto WO3-promoted TiO2 supports (WO3-TiO2) to form ErX catalysts, whereas a control simulating a commercial catalyst (V) was also synthesized using WO3-TiO2 for comparison. Bimetallic Ce1-XErXVO4 (X = 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75) showed enhanced redox features, improved the quantities of Lewis/Brönsted acid sites and defects, and increased resistance to hydro-thermal aging relative to their monometallic analogues (X = 0 and 1). The optimal Er composition of Ce1-XErXVO4 studied was found to be X = 0.5. This was because Er0.5 provided the best redox character, the largest number of active sites with the desired Lewis acid strength, and the greatest hydro-thermal stability among all the ErX and V catalysts studied. This led to the best catalytic consequence of Er0.5 in the selective NH3 oxidation and the NH3-SCR reactions, both of which should achieve high N2 productivities at elevated temperatures. In addition, Er0.5 subjected to hydro-thermal aging also extended its best NH3-SCR performance among all aged catalysts studied even to low temperature regime of &lt; 300 °C. This paper remarks the proper combination of rare earth metals used to construct bimetallic vanadates can be adaptable to create high-performance NH3-SCR catalysts for use at elevated temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 66
AB  - The innovation of novel and proficient nanostructured materials for the precise level determination of pharmaceuticals in biological fluids is quite crucial to the researchers. With this in mind, we synthesized iron molybdate nanoplates (Fe2(MoO4)3; FeMo NPs) via simple ultrasonic-assisted technique (70 kHz with a power of 100 W). The FeMo NPs were used as the efficient electrocatalyst for electrochemical oxidation of first-generation antihistamine drug- Promethazine hydrochloride (PMH). The as-synthesized FeMo NPs were characterized and confirmed by various characterization techniques such as XRD, Raman, FT-IR, FE-SEM, EDX and Elemental mapping analysis and electron impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, the electrochemical characteristic features of FeMo NPs were scrutinized by electrochemical techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry technique (DPV). Interestingly, the developed FeMo NPs modified glassy carbon electrode (FeMo NPs/GCE) discloses higher peak current with lesser anodic potential on comparing to bare GCE including wider linear range (0.01–68.65 µM), lower detection limit (0.01 µM) and greater sensitivity (0.97 µAµM-1cm−2). Moreover, the as-synthesized FeMo NPs applied for selectivity, reproducibility, repeatability and storage ability to investigate the practical viability. In the presence of interfering species like cationic, anionic and biological samples, the oxidation peak current response doesn't cause any variation results disclose good selectivity towards the detection of PMH. Additionally, the practical feasibility of the FeMo NPs/GCE was tested by real samples like, commercial tablet (Phenergan 25 mg Tablets) and lake water samples which give satisfactory recovery results. All the above consequences made clear that the proposed sensor FeMo NPs/GCE exhibits excellent electrochemical behavior for electrochemical determination towards oxidation of antihistamine drug PMH. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Milling of Inconel 718: an experimental and integrated modeling approach for surface roughness
VL  - 120
IS  - 3
SP  - 1609-1624
AB  - Inconel 718, a hard-to-cut superalloy is reputed for having poor machining performance due to its low thermal conductivity. Consequently, the surface quality of the machined parts suffers. The surface roughness value must fall within the stringent limits to ensure the functional performance of the components used in aerospace and bioimplant applications. One doable way to enhance its machinability is the adequate dissipation of heat from the machining zone through efficient and ecofriendly cooling environment. With this perspective, an experimental and integrated green-response surface machining-based-evolutionary optimization (G-RSM-EO) approach is presented during this investigation. The results are compared with two base-line techniques: the traditional flooded approach with Hocut WS 8065 mineral oil, and the dry green approach. A Box-Behnken response surface methodology (RSM) is employed to design the milling tests considering three control parameters, i.e., cutting speed (vs), feed/flute (fz), and axial depth of cut (ap). These control parameters are used in the various experiments conducted during this research work. The parametric analysis is then accomplished through surface plots, and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is presented to assess the effects of these control parameters. Afterwards, a multiple regression model is developed to identify the parametric relevance of vs, fz, and ap, with surface roughness (SR) as the response attribute. A residual analysis is performed to validate the statistical adequacy of the predicted model. Lastly, the surface roughness regression model is considered as the objective function of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) model to minimize the surface roughness of the machined parts. The optimized SR results are compared to the widely employed genetic algorithm (GA) and RSM-based desirability function approach (DF). The confirmatory machining tests proved that the integrated optimization approach with PSO being an evolutionary technique is more effective compared to GA and DF with respect to accuracy (0.05% error), adequacy, and processing time (3.19 min). Furthermore, the study reveals that the Mecagreen 450 biodegradable oil-enriched flooded strategy has significantly improved the milling of Inconel 718 in terms of eco-sustainability and productivity, i.e., 42.9% cost reduction in cutting fluid consumption and 73.5% improvement in surface quality compared to the traditional flooded approach and the dry green approach. Moreover, the G-RSM-EO approach presents a sustainable alternative by achieving a Ra of 0.3942 μm that is finer than a post-finishing operation used to produce close tolerance reliable components for aerospace industry. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 26

SP  - 44-57
AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSP) are essential molecular chaperones that play important roles in the stress stimulation of insects. Bemisia tabaci, a phloem feeder and invasive species, can cause extensive crop damage through direct feeding and transmission of plant viruses. Here we employed comprehensive genomics approaches to identity HSP superfamily members in the Middle East Asia Minor 1 whitefly genome. In total, we identified 26 Hsp genes, including three Hsp90, 17 Hsp70, one Hsp60 and five sHSP (small heat shock protein) genes. The HSP gene superfamily of whitefly is expanded compared with the other five insects surveyed here. The gene structures among the same families are relatively conserved. Meanwhile, the motif compositions and secondary structures of BtHsp proteins were predicted. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression patterns of BtHsp gene superfamily were diverse across different tissues of whiteflies. Most Hsp genes were induced or repressed by thermal stress (40°C) and cold treatment (4°C) in whitefly. Silencing the expression of BtHsp70-6 significantly decreased the survival rate of whitefly under 45°C. All the results showed the Hsps conferred thermo-tolerance or cold-tolerance to whiteflies that protect them from being affected by detrimental temperature conditions. Our observations highlighted the molecular evolutionary properties and the response mechanism to temperature assaults of Hsp genes in whitefly. © 2017 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

TI  - Multigenerational plasticity of Daphnia magna under thermal stress across ten generations
VL  - 194
AB  - The effects of increasing temperature owing to thermal discharge and global warming on zooplanktons such as Daphnia magna are a growing concern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of elevated temperature (25 degrees C) on oxidative stress responses, growth, and reproduction of D. magna across 10 generations. The number of offspring per female at 21 d was significantly increased and the rate of adult somatic growth (5-21 d) was decreased in the F0 generation at 25 degrees C compared with those at the reference temperature 20 degrees C. However, the F3 generation showed the lowest number of offspring and the highest adult somatic growth rate and oxidative stress responses (5 d) at 25 degrees C. Moreover, all life-history traits seemed to recover to the levels of the control group from the F6 generation at 20 degrees C. These findings suggest that D. magna under continuous thermal stress exhibits non-adaptive responses in the early generations (F0-F3) and changes to adaptive responses in the later generations (F6-F9). However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism should be identified in the future.

TI  - Multigenerational study of life history traits, bioaccumulation, and molecular responses of Pseudodiaptomus annandalei to cadmium
VL  - 230
AB  - Metal pollution provide a substantial challenge for environmental health. This study investigated the multigeneration effects of cadmium on populations of the copepod species Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, exposed to a sublethal concentration, 40 µg/L of cadmium (Cd), over 10 generations. At the end of each generation, copepod individuals were collected to estimate fecundity, bioaccumulation, and real time qPCR quantification of selected differentially expressed genes to evaluate Cd effects and sex-specific responses of copepods across multiple generations. Our results revealed a sex-specific accumulation of Cd integrating 10 successive generations. The concentration of Cd was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in males than in females. We also observed a generational increase in Cd accumulation. Fecundity increased, with the exception of the first generation, possibly as a compensation for a decrease of copepod population size under Cd exposure. Protein expression of copepods exposed to Cd occurred in a sex-specific manner. Hemerythrin was mostly up-regulated in both copepod sexes exposed to Cd with males having the highest expression levels, while heat shock protein 70 was mostly up-regulated in males and down-regulated in female copepods, both exposed to Cd. Although copepods are known to develop adaptive mechanisms to tolerate toxic chemicals, continuous exposure to metals could lead to the bioaccumulation of metals in their offspring through maternal transfer and direct uptake from the medium over several generations. As a consequence, increased metal concentrations in copepods could result in physiological damage, reducing their fitness, and possibly compromise copepod population structures. This study showed that mortality, life history traits and molecular responses of a copepod species provided important toxicological endpoints and bio-markers for environmental risk assessments. Environmental pressure resulting from continuous exposure to persistent pollutants like Cd, could have evolutionary significance. The tendency for copepods to selectively adapt to a toxic environment through modifications, could increase their chance of survival over a long term. © 2022

TI  - Cyclical environments drive variation in life-history strategies: A general theory of cyclical phenology
VL  - 286
IS  - 1898
AB  - Cycles, such as seasons or tides, characterize many systems in nature. Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change-driven alterations to environmental cycles-such as longer seasons-are associated with phenological shifts around the world, suggesting a deep link between environmental cycles and life cycles. However, general mechanisms of lifehistory evolution in cyclical environments are still not well understood. Here, I build a demographic framework and ask how life-history strategies optimize fitness when the environment perturbs a structured population cyclically and how strategies should change as cyclicality changes. I show that cycle periodicity alters optimality predictions of classic life-history theory because repeated cycles have rippling selective consequences over time and generations. Notably, fitness landscapes that relate environmental cyclicality and life-history optimality vary dramatically depending on which trade-offs govern a given species. The model tuned with known life-history trade-offs in a marine intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus successfully predicted the shape of life-history variation across natural populations spanning a gradient of tidal periodicities. This framework shows how environmental cycles can drive life-history variation-without complex assumptions of individual responses to cues such as temperature-thus expanding the range of life-history diversity explained by theory and providing a basis for adaptive phenology. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Morphological deformation of Daphnia magna embryos caused by prolonged exposure to ibuprofen
VL  - 261
AB  - The effect of chronic exposure of freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna to low, environmentally relevant concentrations i.e 4 mu L-l of ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in a laboratory experiment was studied. We observed the key life history traits of first and fifth generation individuals: age and size at first reproduction, number of first clutch eggs and individual growth rate. Moreover, chosen molecular/subcellular markers of experimental animals stress response such as triglyceride content, heat shock proteins (HSP) expression and DNA:RNA ratio were collected. Overall, chronic exposure to ibuprofen had no significant effect on the molecular markers nor on the life history parameters of the Daphnia. It did, however, caused lethal morphological deformities in embryos and juvenile daphnids. Depending on the clonal affiliation, exposure to a low dosage of ibuprofen over five generations resulted in the deformation of similar to 3%--similar to 10% of the first clutch of offspring. Also, up to 90% of females carried at least one deformed embryo. This is the first time that research has revealed such an effect of ibuprofen on D. magna. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Multiple paternity in the intertidal zone porcelain crab petrolisthes cinctipes randall, 1840 (Decapoda: Anomura: Porcellanidae) is a life-history strategy that increases fitness during heat stress
VL  - 40

AB  - Multiple paternity is widespread across animal and plant taxa and can increase genetic diversity and enhance fitness, especially in unpredictable environments. A prior study of the intertidal zone porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes (Randall, 1840), found that most females carried polyandrous broods. We tested the hypothesis that multiple paternity in P. cinctipes enhances fitness through increased average brood tolerance to temperature stress. Embryonic survival of split broods (N = 27) was measured under ambient conditions and following a single one-hour heat shock at 30 °C. Two microsatellite loci were used to genotype embryos and mothers in order to distinguish multiple from single paternity in each brood. Mean overall hatching percentage did not differ between singly and multiply sired broods; however, when exposed to a heat-shock, single-sired broods experienced 11% lower hatching success. Though relative fitness was higher in single-sired broods under non-stressful conditions, extrapolation of our results to conditions where temperatures are at least 30 °C (present-day extremes for the California coast) for > 2 days of the embryonic brood period, multiply sired broods have a relative fitness that is approximately 24 times higher after 15 generations. Maternal quality (size) and the timing of the heat shock relative to developmental timing also influence the brood response to heat shock. Our results suggest that multiple paternity reduces embryo survival variance between ambient and heat-shock conditions and that polyandrous behavior could be an advantage for P. cinctipes in the thermally variable high-intertidal zone. We conclude that multiple paternity is an important strategy for increasing fitness by genetic diversification in organisms that experience severe and unpredictable levels of environmental stress. © The Author(s) 2020.

TI  - Variation of thermal plasticity in growth and reproduction patterns: Importance of ancestral and developmental temperatures
VL  - 84
SP  - 460-468
AB  - Temperature is an important ecological driver modulating life history traits of organisms, such as growth and reproduction. With the ongoing global warming, understanding the mechanisms underlying the effect of temperature on size and resource allocation trade-off is crucial. The temperature-size rule (TSR) describes plastic growth patterns in populations of ectothermic species under different thermal environments, whereby warming results in faster initial growth but lower size at maturity. However, the evolution of the TSR remains poorly understood. Here we conducted an experiment with populations of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes maintained at two temperatures for successive generations to investigate changes in the growth pattern of the TSR. After rearing six generations at cold (20 °C) and warm (30 °C) temperature, we conducted common garden experiments on the seventh generation where we compare growth trajectories and reproduction patterns in four different groups of fish: (i) fish reared at cold temperature over all seven generations (cold past and present), (ii) fish reared at warm temperature over six generations and at cold temperature at the seventh generation (warm past and cold present), (iii) fish reared at warm temperature over all seven generations (warm past and present) and (iv) fish reared at cold temperature over six generations and at warm temperature at the seventh generation (cold past and warm present). For each treatment, we monitored growth curves and reproduction, and investigated changes in model parameters and reproduction up to 350 days after hatching. Our study showed changes in TSR patterns according to ancestral and developmental temperatures. Developmental temperature mainly impacted age at maturity and asymptotic size, whereas size at maturity was driven more by the dissimilarity between developmental and ancestral temperatures. Our results also highlight a loss of plasticity in temperature-size and reproductive patterns for the fish that were reared under warm condition over six generations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The piRNA pathway responds to environmental signals to establish intergenerational adaptation to stress
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: piRNAs have a constitutive role in genome defence by silencing transposable elements in the germline. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs also induce epigenetic silencing of transgenes, which can be maintained for many generations in the absence of the piRNA pathway. The role of multi-generational epigenetic inheritance in adaptation to the environment is unknown. Results: Here, we show that piRNA biogenesis is downregulated in response to a small increase in temperature. Some effects on gene expression persist into subsequent generations and are associated with a negative fitness cost. We show that simultaneous infection with pathogenic bacteria suppresses downregulation of the piRNA pathway in response to increased temperature. This effect is associated with increased fitness of progeny of infected animals in subsequent generations. Conclusions: Our results show that the piRNA pathway integrates inputs from the environment to establish intergenerational responses to environmental conditions, with important consequences for the fitness of the subsequent generation. © 2018 Sarkies et al.

TI  - Within- and Trans-Generational Life History Responses to Diurnal Temperature Amplitudes of the Pupal Stage in the Diamondback Moth
VL  - 50
IS  - 4
SP  - 888-897
AB  - Diurnal temperature fluctuations in nature can have a significant effect on many ectodermic traits. However, studies on the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on organisms, especially the effects on specific life stages, are still limited. We examined the immediate effects of the same average temperature (25°C) and different temperature amplitudes (±4, ±6, ±8, ±10, ±12°C) on the development and survival of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We also assessed carry-over effects on adult longevity, reproduction, development, and survival of offspring across generations. The effect of moderate temperature amplitudes was similar to that of constant temperature. Wide temperature amplitudes inhibited the development of pupae, reduced total reproduction, lowered intrinsic rates of population growth, and slowed the development and survival of eggs on the first day, but the proportion of females ovipositing on the first three days increased. Insects coped with the adverse effects of wide temperature amplitudes by laying eggs as soon as possible. Our results confirmed that a logistic model based on daily average temperature cannot predict development rates under wide temperature amplitudes. These findings highlight the effect of environmental temperature fluctuations at the pupal stage on the development and oviposition patterns of P. xylostella and should be fully considered when predicting field occurrence. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Lizards from warm and declining populations are born with extremely short telomeres
VL  - 119
IS  - 33
AB  - Aging is the price to pay for acquiring and processing energy through cellular activity and life history productivity. Climate warming can exacerbate the inherent pace of aging, as illustrated by a faster erosion of protective telomere DNA sequences. This biomarker integrates individual pace of life and parental effects through the germline, but whether intra- and intergenerational telomere dynamics underlies population trends remains an open question. Here, we investigated the covariation between life history, telomere length (TL), and extinction risk among three age classes in a cold-adapted ectotherm (Zootoca vivipara) facing warming-induced extirpations in its distribution limits. TL followed the same threshold relationships with population extinction risk at birth, maturity, and adulthood, suggesting intergenerational accumulation of accelerated aging rate in declining populations. In dwindling populations, most neonates inherited already short telomeres, suggesting they were born physiologically old and unlikely to reach recruitment. At adulthood, TL further explained females' reproductive performance, switching from an index of individual quality in stable populations to a biomarker of reproductive costs in those close to extirpation. We compiled these results to propose the aging loop hypothesis and conceptualize how climate-driven telomere shortening in ectotherms may accumulate across generations and generate tipping points before local extirpation. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 10

SP  - 11296-11303
AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is increasingly recognized as a mechanism by which organisms can respond to environments that change across generations. Although recent empirical and theoretical studies have explored conditions under which TGP is predicted to evolve, it is still unclear whether the effects of the parental environment will remain beyond the offspring generation. Using a small cyprinodontid fish, we explored multigenerational thermal TGP to address two related questions. First (experiment 1), does the strength of TGP decline or accumulate across multiple generations? Second (experiment 2), how does the experience of a temperature novel to both parents and offspring affect the strength of TGP? In the first experiment, we found a significant interaction between F1 and F2 temperatures and juvenile growth, but no effect of egg diameter. The strength of TGP between F0 and F1 generations was similar in both experiments but declined in subsequent generations. Further, experience of a novel temperature accelerated the decline. This pattern, although similar to that found in other species, is certainly not universally observed, suggesting that theoretical and empirical effort is needed to understand the multigenerational dynamics of TGP. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Impact of global warming scenarios on life-history traits of Tetranychus evansi (Acari: Tetranychidae)
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops. Although T. evansi is of South American subtropical origin, it has recently expanded its distribution range to many tropical and temperate areas around the world. Its potential distribution range in response to scenarios of global warming was recently modeled, confirming its current and possible future distributions. Here, we experimentally investigated the biological traits of T. evansi in the context of the current and future global warming (2100) scenarios. Using an environmental simulation system, we tested the life-history traits of T. evansi under current summer temperatures (as of June, July, and August 2016) and under expected temperature increases based on two IPCC scenarios: RCP2.6 (+ 1 °C) and RCP8.5 (+ 3.7 °C). The mites were introduced into each scenario on 1 June and their sequential progeny were used for testing in each following month. Results: The mite could develop and reproduce under all scenarios. There was a decrease in the duration of lifespan and female fecundity at RCP8.5 during June and August, but this may be compensated for by the high intrinsic rate of increase, which implies faster population growth and shorter generation time. Conclusion: Our study and other reports reveal the high adaptability of T. evansi to a wide range of summer temperatures; this may explain its current distribution. We anticipate that global warming will favor the spread of T. evansi and may further expand its distribution to a large area of the globe. These findings should be of ecological and practical relevance for designing prevention and control strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Suppression of autumnal sexual morph production in spring by a seasonal timer in an aphid
VL  - 45
IS  - 2
SP  - 103-109
AB  - Photoperiod is the major seasonal cue for phenotypic plasticity in the regulation of development and reproduction. Aphids have a peculiar mechanism in which sensitivity to the photoperiod is lost for a few months through successive generations after hatching from diapause eggs, and therefore, the mechanism responsible for the photorefractory period is termed “a seasonal timer”. However, whether the seasonal timer has adaptive significance has never been investigated. Here, we show that the photorefractory generation avoids an unseasonal sexual morph production under short days in spring in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris). When the seasonal timer operated, the overwintered generation, stem mothers, produced only parthenogenetic progenies under natural photoperiods and temperatures in both warm and cold springs. After repeated parthenogenesis following diapause, however, aphids with an expired seasonal timer produced sexual females and males typical of autumn under natural photoperiods and temperatures in a warm spring. These sexual morphs are thought to have a reproductive disadvantage compared to parthenogenetic morphs in the following summer. We thus conclude that the seasonal timer is adaptive for avoiding sexual morph production in spring. The present study shows, for the first time, that a photorefractory period lasting over generations is a trait of ecological importance. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Early warming stress on rainbow trout juveniles impairs male reproduction but contrastingly elicits intergenerational thermotolerance
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The exposure of adult fish to warm or high temperatures is known to impair reproduction, yet the long-term reproductive impacts for treatments at early life are not well clarified. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of warm temperature (WT) during juvenile stage on gonad maturation, gamete quality, and offspring thermotolerance in rainbow trout. While the comparison of basic reproductive parameters in WT females did not reveal any kind of impairment, many WT males showed an atrophied, undeveloped gonad, or a smaller testis with lower milt volume; sperm quality parameters in WT males and deformity rates in the respective progeny were also highly affected. However, despite of such negative effects, many of the remaining progeny presented better rates of survival and growth when exposed to the same conditions as those of parental fish (WT), suggesting that thermal stress in parr stage males elicited intergenerational thermotolerance after a single generation. The present results support that prolonged warming stress during early life stages can adversely affect key reproductive aspects, but contrastingly increase offspring performance at upper thermal ranges. These findings have implications on the capacity of fish to adapt and to cope with global warming. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Multigenerational effects of nickel on Daphnia magna depend on temperature and the magnitude of the effect in the first generation
VL  - 37
IS  - 7
SP  - 1877-1888
AB  - Ecological risk assessment is commonly based on single-generation ecotoxicological tests that are usually performed at one standard temperature. We investigated the effects of nickel (Ni) on Daphnia magna reproduction at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C over 4 generations. Multigenerational Ni effects on D. magna reproduction depended on the magnitude of the effect in the first generation (F0) and showed very different patterns at different temperatures. At low effect level concentrations (<10% effect concentration [EC10] in F0), chronic Ni toxicity at 15 and 20 degrees C did not increase over 4 generations, and the increase in Ni toxicity at 25 degrees C observed in F1 and F2 in some Ni treatments did not persist into F3, where complete recovery of reproduction was observed. At higher effect level concentrations, the multigenerational Ni effects depended on the test temperature. In F0, Ni toxicity was 6.5-fold lower at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C (based on the median effect concentration), but the temperature effect on Ni toxicity was not explained by differences in Ni accumulation. At a lower temperature, lower internal Ni concentrations in D. magna were necessary to induce the same Ni toxicity as at a higher temperature. Overall, our results indicate that low single-generation chronic effect concentrations of Ni in D. magna (EC10 in the present study) are also protective in a long-term, multigenerational context and that temperature should be taken into account in the ecological risk assessment of Ni.

TI  - Transgenerational inheritance of sexual attractiveness via small RNAs enhances evolvability in C. elegans
VL  - 57
IS  - 3
SP  - 298-309.e9
AB  - It is unknown whether transient transgenerational epigenetic responses to environmental challenges affect the process of evolution, which typically unfolds over many generations. Here, we show that in C. elegans, inherited small RNAs control genetic variation by regulating the crucial decision of whether to self-fertilize or outcross. We found that under stressful temperatures, younger hermaphrodites secrete a male-attracting pheromone. Attractiveness transmits transgenerationally to unstressed progeny via heritable small RNAs and the Argonaute Heritable RNAi Deficient-1 (HRDE-1). We identified an endogenous small interfering RNA pathway, enriched in endo-siRNAs that target sperm genes, that transgenerationally regulates sexual attraction, male prevalence, and outcrossing rates. Multigenerational mating competition experiments and mathematical simulations revealed that over generations, animals that inherit attractiveness mate more and their alleles spread in the population. We propose that the sperm serves as a “stress-sensor” that, via small RNA inheritance, promotes outcrossing in challenging environments when increasing genetic variation is advantageous. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Multi-generational effects and variations of stress response by hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) exposure in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 245
SP  - 216-222
AB  - In order to understand multi-generational effects and changes of stress response by hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) exposure, the animal model Caenorhabditis elegans was chosen for toxicity study. Multiple endpoints, including the physiological levels (growth, reproduction, and locomotion behaviors), stress-related gene expressions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and degree of cell apoptosis, were evaluated on exposed nematodes and their progeny. Prolonged exposure to HBCD at concentrations of 2 nM–200 nM caused adverse physiological effects in the parental generation (F0), and these effects were also observed in the oﬀspring under HBCD-free conditions (F1). HBCD-induced toxicities could be transferred from parent to oﬀspring. The integrated gene expressions proﬁles showed that exposure to HBCD at concentrations of 20–200 nM resulted in obvious changes in stress-related gene expressions, which were more increased in F0 generation than in F1 generation. The increased expressions were pronounced in several genes related to oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, e.g., hsp-16.2, hsp-16.48, sod-1, sod-3 and cep-1 genes. Exposure to 200 nM of HBCD could signiﬁcantly increase ROS production and degree of cell apoptosis in the F0 and F1 generations. Therefore, it was speculated that HBCD exposure induced oxidative stress and cell apoptosis, which resulted in the adverse physiological effects. This finding is helpful for understanding the multi-generational effects and evaluating the potential risk of HBCD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Transgenerational and multigenerational stress gene responses to the insecticide etofenprox in Folsomia candida (Collembola)
VL  - 175
SP  - 181-191
AB  - Insecticide exposure may cause both transgenerational and multigenerational effects on populations, but the molecular mechanisms of these changes remain largely unclear. Many studies have focused on either transgenerational or multigenerational mechanisms but did neglect the comparative aspects. This study assessed whether the pyrethroid insecticide etofenprox (formulation Trebon ® 30 EC) shows transgenerational and/or multigenerational effects on the survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida (Collembola). The activation of stress-related genes was studied to detect whether etofenprox modifies the expression of reproduction-associated genes in trans- and multigenerational treatments. A laboratory study was carried out for three generations with five insecticide concentrations in LUFA 2.2 soil. In the transgenerational treatment, only the parent generation (P) was exposed, but the subsequent generations were not. In the multigenerational treatment, all three generations were exposed to the insecticide in the same manner. Multigenerational exposure resulted in reduced reproduction effects over generations, suggesting that F. candida is capable of acclimating to enhanced concentration levels of etofenprox during prolonged exposure over multiple generations. In the transgenerational treatment, the heat shock protein 70 was up-regulated and cytochrome oxidase 6N4v1 expression down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in the F2 generation. This finding raises the possibility of the epigenetic inheritance of insecticide impacts on parents. Furthermore, CYP6N4v1 expression was oppositely regulated in the trans- and multigenerational treatments. Our results draw attention to the differences in molecular level responses of F. candida to trans- and multigenerational etofenprox exposure. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Within- and trans-generational responses to combined global changes are highly divergent in two congeneric species of marine annelids
VL  - 167
IS  - 4
AB  - Trans-generational plasticity (TGP) represents a primary mechanism for guaranteeing species persistence under rapid global changes. To date, no study on TGP responses of marine organisms to global change scenarios in the ocean has been conducted on phylogenetically closely related species, and we thus lack a true appreciation for TGP inter-species variation. Consequently, we examined the tolerance and TGP of life-history and physiological traits in two annelid species within the genus Ophryotrocha: one rare (O. robusta) and one common (O. japonica). Both species were exposed over two generations to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) in isolation and in combination (OAW). Warming scenarios led to a decrease in energy production together with an increase in energy requirements, which was lethal for O. robusta before viable offspring could be produced by the F1. Under OA conditions, O. robusta was able to reach the second generation, despite showing lower survival and reproductive performance when compared to control conditions. This was accompanied by a marked increase in fecundity and egg volume in F2 females, suggesting high capacity for TGP under OA. In contrast, O. japonica thrived under all scenarios across both generations, maintaining its fitness levels via adjusting its metabolomic profile. Overall, the two species investigated show a great deal of difference in their ability to tolerate and respond via TGP to future global changes. We emphasize the potential implications this can have for the determination of extinction risk, and consequently, the conservation of phylogenetically closely related species. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Multigenerational effects modify the tolerance of mosquito larvae to chlorpyrifos but not to a heat spike and do not change their synergism
VL  - 292
AB  - While interactions with global warming and multigenerational effects are considered crucial to improve risk assessment of pesticides, these have rarely been studied in an integrated way. While heat extremes can magnify pesticide toxicity, no studies tested how their combined effects may transmit to the next generation. We exposed mosquito larvae in a full factorial, two-generation experiment to a heat spike followed by chlorpyrifos exposure. As expected, the heat spike magnified the chlorpyrifos-induced lethal and sublethal effects within both generations. Only when preceded by the heat spike, chlorpyrifos increased mortality and reduced the population growth rate. Moreover, chlorpyrifos-induced reductions in heat tolerance (CTmax), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and development time were further magnified by the heat spike. Notably, when parents were exposed to chlorpyrifos, the chlorpyrifos-induced lethal and sublethal effects in the offspring were smaller, indicating increased tolerance to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, there was no such multigenerational effect for the heat spike. Despite the adaptive multigenerational effect to the pesticide, the synergism with the heat spike was still present in the offspring generation. Generally, our results provide important evidence that short exposure to pulse-like global change stressors can strongly affect organisms within and across generations, and highlight the importance of considering multigenerational effects in risk assessment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Potential impact of climate change on whiteflies and implications for the spread of vectored viruses
VL  - 92
IS  - 2
SP  - 381-392
AB  - Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are important insect pests causing serious damage to plants and transmitting hundreds of plant viruses. Climate change is expected to influence life history and trophic interactions among plants, whiteflies and their natural enemies. Here, we review the potential impacts of climate change on whiteflies and the likely consequences for agricultural systems. This review concludes that while climatic stress tends to negatively affect life history traits, the effects differ with the tolerance of the whiteflies and the amount of stress experienced. Whiteflies also differ in their adaptability. Better adapted species will likely experience increased distribution and abundance provided their tolerance limits are not exceeded, while species with lower tolerance and adaptation limits will suffer reduced fitness, which will have overall effects on their distribution and abundance in space and time. The majority of methods used to control whiteflies will still be useful especially if complementary methods are combined for maximum efficacy. Parasitism and predation rates of whitefly natural enemies could increase with temperature within the optimum ranges of the natural enemies, although life history traits and population growth potential are generally maximised below 30 °C. Changes in climatic suitability modifying the distribution and abundance of whiteflies, and environmental suitability for plant viruses, will likely affect epidemics of viral diseases. Greater efforts are required to improve understanding of the complex effects of climate change on multi-species and multi-trophic interactions in the agro-ecological systems inhabited by whiteflies, and to use this new knowledge to develop robust and climate-smart management strategies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Conservation and transmission of seed bacterial endophytes across generations following crossbreeding and repeated inbreeding of rice at different geographic locations
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
AB  - There are comparatively diverse bacterial communities inside seeds, which are vertically transmitted and conserved, becoming sources of endophytes in the next generation of host plants. We studied how rice seed endophyte composition changed over time following crossbreeding, repeated inbreeding, subsequent human selection and planting of different rice seeds in different ecogeographical locations. Using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study bacterial communities, we observed that diversity between the original parents and their offspring may show significant differences in richness, evenness and diversity indices. Heat maps reveal substantial contributions of both or either parent in the shaping of the bacterial seed endophytes of the offspring. Most of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the subsequent progeny could be traced to any or both of its parents while unique T-RFs of the offspring suggest external sources of colonization particularly when the seeds were cultivated in different locations. Many similar groups of endophytic bacteria persist in the seeds even after recultivation in different locations, indicating resilience to environmental changes and conservation of bacteria across generations. This study suggests that parent plants contributed to the shaping of seed bacterial endophytes of their offspring, although it is also possible that these soil grown rice plants recruit similar populations of endophytes from the soil generation after generation. This study also highlights some bacterial groups belonging to Herbaspirillum, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas and Enterobacter that may be part of a transmitted and conserved “core microbiota” that are ubiquitous and dominant members of the endophytic communities of the rice seeds. © 2018 The Authors.

VL  - 2018
IS  - 134
AB  - The killifish Nothobranchius furzeri is an emerging model organism in the field of ecotoxicology and its applicability in acute and chronic ecotoxicity testing has been demonstrated. Overall, the sensitivity of the species to toxic compounds is in the range with, or higher than, that of other model species. This work describes protocols for acute, chronic, and multigenerational bioassays of single and combined stressor effects on N. furzeri. Due to its short maturation time and life-cycle, this vertebrate model allows the study of endpoints such as maturation time and fecundity within four months. Transgenerational full life-cycle exposure trials can be performed in as little as 8 months. Since this species produces eggs that are drought-resistant and remain viable for years, the on-site culture of the species is not needed but individuals can be recruited when required. The protocols are designed to measure life-history traits (mortality, growth, fecundity, weight) and critical thermal maximum. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

TI  - Natural Genetic Variation in a Multigenerational Phenotype in C. elegans
VL  - 28
IS  - 16
SP  - 2588-2596.e8
AB  - Although heredity mostly relies on the transmission of DNA sequence, additional molecular and cellular features are heritable across several generations. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, insights into such unconventional inheritance result from two lines of work. First, the mortal germline (Mrt) phenotype was defined as a multigenerational phenotype whereby a selfing lineage becomes sterile after several generations, implying multigenerational memory [1, 2]. Second, certain RNAi effects are heritable over several generations in the absence of the initial trigger [3–5]. Both lines of work converged when the subset of Mrt mutants that are heat sensitive were found to closely correspond to mutants defective in the RNAi-inheritance machinery, including histone modifiers [6–9]. Here, we report the surprising finding that several C. elegans wild isolates display a heat-sensitive mortal germline phenotype in laboratory conditions: upon chronic exposure to higher temperatures, such as 25°C, lines reproducibly become sterile after several generations. This phenomenon is reversible, as it can be suppressed by temperature alternations at each generation, suggesting a non-genetic basis for the sterility. We tested whether natural variation in the temperature-induced Mrt phenotype was of genetic nature by building recombinant inbred lines between the isolates MY10 (Mrt) and JU1395 (non-Mrt). Using bulk segregant analysis, we detected two quantitative trait loci. After further recombinant mapping and genome editing, we identified the major causal locus as a polymorphism in the set-24 gene, encoding a SET- and SPK-domain protein. We conclude that C. elegans natural populations may harbor natural genetic variation in epigenetic inheritance phenomena. Frézal et al. discover that some C. elegans wild isolates become sterile after several generations at high temperature, a reversible trait that is known to correspond to alterations in non-genetic inheritance phenomena. They identify in the wild isolate MY10 a deletion in the set-24 gene as causal for this multigenerational inheritance phenotype. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of Temperature on Survival, Development, and Reproduction of Aphis glycines (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Autumnal Morphs
VL  - 103

SP  - 236-242
AB  - Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a common pest in soybeans in China. Though the pest has been studied extensively for many yr, there is little information regarding life history traits of A. glycines autumnal morphs on buckthorn in autumn. Life tables were constructed of A. glycines gynoparae, males, and oviparae reared at 13, 18, 23, 28, and 33 °C with a photoperiod of 12:12 h (L:D). Our results showed that gynoparae nymphs of A. glycines could survive well at temperatures from 13 to 33 °C, but male and oviparae nymphs could not develop into adults at 33 °C. Development time of nymphal gynoparae, males, and oviparae all gradually decreased when temperatures increased from 13 to 28 °C. Adult longevity of gynoparae and virgin males also decreased gradually when temperatures increased from 13 to 28 °C. Fecundity of A. glycines gynoparae was the greatest at 23 °C, with a value of 15.87 ± 0.33 oviparae per gynoparae. Males and oviparae of A. glycines mated only at 13 and 18 °C in the laboratory. Oviparae fecundity at 18 °C was greater than at 13 °C. This study provides important information on survival, development, and reproduction of A. glycines autumnal morphs, which is useful for understanding the population dynamics and life cycle of A. glycines in autumn, and to study the ecological adaptability of A. glycines in autumn. © 2020 Florida Entomological Society.

TI  - Multigenerational inspections of environmental thermal perturbations promote metabolic trade-offs in developmental stages of tropical fish*
VL  - 308
AB  - Global warming both reduces global temperature variance and increases the frequency of extreme weather events. In response to these ambient perturbations, animals may be subject to trans- or intra-generational phenotype modifications that help to maintain homeostasis and fitness. Here, we show how temperatureassociated transgenerational plasticity in tilapia affects metabolic trade-offs during developmental stages under a global warming scenario. Tropical tilapia reared at a stable temperature of 27 degrees C for a decade were divided into two temperature-experience groups for four generations of breeding. Each generation of one group was exposed to a single 15 degrees C cold-shock experience during its lifetime (cold-experienced CE group), and the other group was kept stably at 27 degrees C throughout their lifetimes (cold-naive CN group). The offspring at early life stages from the CE and CN tilapia were then assessed by metabolomics-based profiling, and the results implied that parental cold-experience might affect energy provision during reproduction. Furthermore, at early life stages, progeny may be endowed with metabolic traits that help the animals cope with ambient temperature perturbations. This study also applied the feature rescaling and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize metabolic dynamics, and the result could effectively decompose the complex omic-based datasets to represent the energy trade-off variability. For example, the carbohydrate to free amino acid conversion and enhanced compensatory features appeared to be hypothermic-responsive traits. These multigenerational metabolic effects suggest that the tropical ectothermic tilapia may exhibit transgenerational phenotype plasticity, which could optimize energy allocation under ambient temperature challenges. Knowledge about such metabolism-related transgenerational plasticity effects in ectothermic aquatic species may allow us to better predict how adaptive mechanisms will affect fish populations in a climate with narrow temperature variation and frequent extreme weather events.

TI  - Venom is beneficial but not essential for development and survival of Nasonia
VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 146-153
AB  - 1. Parasitoid wasps sting and inject venom into arthropod hosts, which alters host metabolism and development while keeping the host alive for several days, presumably to induce benefits for the parasitoid young. 2. This study investigates the consequences of host envenomation on development and fitness of wasp larvae in the ectoparasitoid Nasonia vitripennis, by comparing wasps reared on live unstung, previously stung, and cold-killed hosts. Developmental arrest and suppression of host response to larvae are major venom effects that occur in both stung and cold-killed hosts, but not in unstung hosts, whereas cold-killed hosts lack venom effects that require a living host. Thus, cold-killed hosts mimic some of the effects of venom, but not others. 3. Eggs placed on live unstung hosts have significantly higher mortality during development; however, successfully developing wasps from these hosts have similar lifetime fecundity to that of wasps from cold-killed or stung hosts. Therefore, although venom is beneficial, it is not required for wasp survival. 4. While wasps developing on both cold-killed and stung hosts have similar fitness levels, rearing multiple generations on cold-killed hosts results in significant fitness reductions of wasps. 5. It is concluded that the largest benefits of venom are induction of host developmental arrest and suppression of host response to larva (e.g. immune responses), although more subtle benefits may accrue across generations or under stressful conditions. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Extreme temperature impairs growth and productivity in a common tropical marine copepod
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Shallow, tropical marine ecosystems provide essential ecosystem goods and services, but it is unknown how these ecosystems will respond to the increased exposure to the temperature extremes that are likely to become more common as climate change progresses. To address this issue, we tracked the fitness and productivity of a key zooplankton species, the copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, acclimated at two temperatures (30 and 34 °C) over three generations. 30 °C is the mean temperature in the shallow water of the coastal regions in Southeast Asia, while 34 °C simulated a temperature extreme that occurs frequently during the summer period. For each generation, we measured the size at maturity and reproductive success of individuals. In all three generations, we found strong negative effects of warming on all measured fitness-related parameters, including prolonged development time, reduced size at maturity, smaller clutch sizes, lower hatching success, and reduced naupliar production. Our results suggest that P. annandalei are already exposed to temperatures that exceed their upper thermal optimum. Increased exposure to extreme temperatures may reduce the abundance of these tropical marine copepods, and thus reduce the availability of resources to higher trophic levels. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Biochemical and physiological responses of the water flea Moina macrocopa to microplastics: a multigenerational study
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 523-532
AB  - Background: Numerous studies have measured the harmful effects of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) (e.g., ingestion, temporal bioconcentration, acute and chronic responses, and the trophic transfer from primary producers to consumers) on aquatic invertebrates due to their ubiquitous and persistent nature in waterbodies. Objective: An experimental water flea model, Moina macrocopa, was exposed to different concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100, and 500 μg L−1) of polystyrene microbeads (1 μm). The effects of polystyrene microbeads were investigated by measurement of multigenerational survival rate, growth, and reproduction parameters with further analysis of biochemical responses across three generations. Results: Exposure to polystyrene microbeads resulted in clear ingestion and egestion in feces. The survival rate was significantly decreased by relatively higher concentrations of polystyrene microbeads compared to control groups. Multigenerational experiments across three generations revealed that exposure to relatively higher concentrations of polystyrene microbeads reduced the growth rate with longer intermolt durations compared to that in the first generation of each group, but similar patterns were observed in reproduction parameters between generations. Initial exposure to polystyrene microbeads resulted in oxidative stress and the induction of antioxidant defense, while 14-day exposure significantly inhibited the antioxidant response. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the detrimental effects of prolonged exposure to polystyrene microbeads would be concentration dependent and harmful for the maintenance of water flea populations by induction of oxidative stress and failure in antioxidant defense. © 2021, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics.

TI  - Establishment of coral-bacteria symbioses reveal changes in the core bacterial community with host ontogeny
VL  - 10
AB  - Bacterial communities are fundamental symbionts of corals. However, the process by which bacterial communities are acquired across the life history of corals, particularly in larval and early juvenile stages, is still poorly characterized. Here, transfer of bacteria of the Scleractinian coral Acropora digitifera from adults to spawned egg-sperm bundles was analyzed, as well as acquisition across early developmental stages (larvae and newly settled spat), and 6-month-old juveniles. Larvae were reared under manipulated environmental conditions to determine the source (maternal, seawater, or sediment) of bacteria likely to establish symbiotic relationships with the host using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Maternal colonies directly transferred bacteria from the families Rhodobacteraceae, Cryomorphaceae, and Endozoicimonaceae to egg-sperm bundles. Furthermore, significant differences in the microbial community structure were identified across generations, yet the structure of the coral bacterial community across early life history stages was not impacted by different environmental rearing conditions. These data indicate that the uptake and structure of bacterial communities is developmentally, rather than environmentally, regulated. Both maternal coral colonies and ubiquitous bacteria found across environmental substrates represent a potential source of symbionts important in establishing the coral microbiome. Uniquely, we report the presence of variation with ontogeny of both the core and resident bacterial communities, supporting the hypothesis that microbial communities are likely to play specific roles within the distinct life history stages of the coral host.

TI  - Thermal regime during parental sexual maturation, but not during offspring rearing, modulates DNA methylation in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis)
VL  - 289
IS  - 1974
AB  - Epigenetic inheritance can result in plastic responses to changing environments being faithfully transmitted to offspring. However, it remains unclear how epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can contribute to multigenerational acclimation and adaptation to environmental stressors. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), an economically important salmonid, is highly sensitive to thermal stress and is of conservation concern in the context of climate change. We studied the effects of temperature during parental sexual maturation and offspring rearing on whole-genome DNA methylation in brook charr juveniles (fry). Parents were split between warm and cold temperatures during sexual maturation, mated in controlled breeding designs, then offspring from each family were split between warm (8°C) and cold (5°C) rearing environments. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we found 188 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to parental maturation temperature after controlling for family structure. By contrast, offspring rearing temperature had a negligible effect on offspring methylation. Stable intergenerational inheritance of DNA methylation and minimal plasticity in progeny could result in the transmission of acclimatory epigenetic states to offspring, priming them for a warming environment. Our findings have implications pertaining to the role of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in response to ongoing climate change. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing. All rights reserved.

VL  - 40
IS  - 4
SP  - 365-376
AB  - Arthropod biological control agents are at risk due to climate change, since heat stress negatively impacts their life history traits. Here, we investigated ontogenetic variation of thermal sensitivity in an important whitefly predator, Serangium japonicum Chapin (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In particular, we evaluated the impact of heat shock on survival rate, development, and reproduction of S. japonicum, and checked whether the negative effects resulting from heat stress are stage-related. The two most heat-tolerant stages of S. japonicum (egg and adult) were exposed to heat shock treatments at 36, 39, and 42 °C for 2 h, and 36 and 39 °C for 4 h. We found that heat shock significantly reduced egg-to-adult survival rate, extended egg-to-adult development time, and decreased fecundity and oviposition period compared to control (27 °C). The sex ratio however was not affected. Eggs exposed to heat shock led to adults whose weight and longevity were consid-erably reduced. The detrimental effects that resulted from heat shock were carried over to later life stages and even the next generation. Those carry-over effects were independent of stage except for egg-to-adult development time and adult weight. Our results suggest that releasing eggs or adults into fields or greenhouses makes little difference in reducing any negative impact on the developmental performance of S. japonicum induced by heat stress in a warming climate. © 2020 E.

TI  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) induces several behavioural defects in Caenorhabditis elegans that can also be transferred to the next generations
VL  - 291
AB  - Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a well-known global persistent organic pollutant of grave concern to ecological and human health. Toxicity of PFOS to animals and humans are well studied. Although few studies have reported the behavioral effect of PFOS on nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, it's transgenerational effects were seldom studied. Therefore, we investigated the toxicity of PFOS on several behavioral responses besides bioaccumulation and transgenerational effects in C. elegans. In contrast to the several published studies, we used lower concentrations (0.5–1000 μg/L or 0.001–2.0 μM) that are environmentally relevant and reported to occur close to the contaminated areas. The 48 h median lethal concentration of PFOS was found to be 3.15 μM (1575 μg/L). PFOS (≥0.01 μM) caused severe toxicity to locomotion, and this effect was even transferred to progeny. However, after a few generations, the defect was rectified in the progeny of single-time exposed parent nematodes. Whereas, continuous exposure at 0.001 μM PFOS, no visible defects were observed in the progeny. PFOS (≥0.01 μM) also significantly decreased the brood size in a concentration-dependent manner. Besides, lifespan was affected by the higher concentration of PFOS (≥1.0 μM). These two behavioral endpoints, lifespan and reproduction defects, became less severe in the progeny. Chemotaxis plasticity was also significantly retarded by ≥ 1.0 μM PFOS compared to the control group. Results indicate that PFOS can exert severe neurobehavioral defects that can be transferred from parents to their offspring. The findings of this study have significant implications for the risk assessment of perfluorinated substances in the environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Local adaptation in thermal tolerance for a tropical butterfly across ecotone and rainforest habitats
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
AB  - Thermal adaptation to habitat variability can determine species vulnerability to environmental change. For example, physiological tolerance to naturally low thermal variation in tropical forests species may alter their vulnerability to climate change impacts, compared with open habitat species. However, the extent to which habitat-specific differences in tolerance derive from within-generation versus acrossgeneration ecological or evolutionary processes are not well characterized. Here we studied thermal tolerance limits of a Central African butterfly (Bicyclus dorothea) across two habitats in Cameroon: A thermally stable tropical forest and the more variable ecotone between rainforest and savanna. Second generation individuals originating from the ecotone, reared under conditions common to both populations, exhibited higher upper thermal limits (CTmax) than individuals originating from forest (∼3°C greater). Lower thermal limits (CTmin) were also slightly lower for the ecotone populations (∼1°C). Our results are suggestive of local adaptation driving habitat-specific differences in thermal tolerance (especially CTmax) that hold across generations. Such habitat-specific thermal limits may be widespread for tropical ectotherms and could affect species vulnerability to environmental change. However, microclimate and within-generation developmental processes (e.g. plasticity) will mediate these differences, and determining the fitness consequences of thermal variation for ecotone and rainforest species will require continued study of both within-generation and across-generation eco-evolutionary processes. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Within-generation and transgenerational plasticity of mate choice in oceanic stickleback under climate change
VL  - 374
IS  - 1768
AB  - Plasticity, both within and across generations, can shape sexual traits involved in mate choice and reproductive success, and thus direct measures of fitness. Especially, transgenerational plasticity (TGP), where parental environment influences offspring plasticity in future environments, could compensate for otherwise negative effects of environmental change on offspring sexual traits. We conducted a mate choice experiment using stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with different thermal histories (ambient 17 degrees C or elevated 21 degrees C) within and across generations under simulated ocean warming using outdoor mesocosms. Parentage analysis of egg clutches revealed that maternal developmental temperature and reproductive (mesocosm) environment affected egg size, with females that developed at 17 degrees C laying smaller eggs in 21 degrees C mesocosms, likely owing to metabolic costs at elevated temperature. Paternal developmental temperature interacted with the reproductive environment to influence mating success, particularly under simulated ocean warming, with males that developed at 21 degrees C showing lower overall mating success compared with 17 degrees C males, but higher mating success in 21 degrees C mesocosms. Furthermore, mating success of males was influenced by the interaction between F1 developmental temperature and F0 parent acclimation temperature, demonstrating the potential role of both TGP and within-generation plasticity in shaping traits involved in sexual selection and mate choice, potentially facilitating rapid responses to environmental change. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

VL  - 88
IS  - 3
SP  - 320-335
AB  - Understanding how marine organisms will be affected by global change is of primary importance to ensure ecosystem functioning and nature contributions to people. This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2 levels by IPCC for 2050–2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO2 values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO2 levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

VL  - 634
SP  - 260-266
AB  - The plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is an emerging organic contaminant that has represented a risk for organisms present in the environment. However, there is still limited information regarding DEHP-induced multigenerational toxicity and the underlying mechanisms. In this study we investigated the multigenerational toxic effects including locomotive behaviors and reproduction upon prolonged DEHP exposure (from larval L1 to adult) and the underlying mechanisms in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The multigenerational effects were examined over 6 generations (F0–F5) with only parental C. elegans (F0) was exposed to DEHP from larval L1 to adults (72 h), and the subsequent offsprings (F1–F5) were grown under DEHP-free conditions. The results showed that prolonged exposure (72 h) to various concentrations of DEHP caused dose-dependent locomotive impairments and reproduction defects in C. elegans and that a concentration of 0.2 mg/L DEHP was enough to cause such sublethal effects. The results showed that after prolonged exposure to DEHP in the F0 generation, abnormal locomotive behaviors such as reduced body bends and head thrashes were observed from generations F0 to F5. Additionally, prolonged exposure to DEHP (20 mg/L) in F0 significantly reduced total brood size in F0, and this parental exposure was sufficient to cause multigenerational reproductive toxicity in the offspring generations (F1–F5) as well. Furthermore, the expressions of reproduction-related genes such as vit-2 and vit-6 were down-regulated by about 20% until F3, and the expression of H3Kme2 demethylase, spr-5, was downregulated in F1 by about 40%. Results from this study demonstrate that prolonged exposure to DEHP only at F0 adversely affected reproduction and locomotive behaviors in C. elegans across generations and might be associated with inadequate vitellogenin production and malfunction of H3Kme2 demethylase. This study implies that parentally prolonged exposure to DEHP caused multigenerational defects in both reproduction and locomotive behaviors raising the potential health and ecological risk. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The memory of neuronal mitochondrial stress is inherited transgenerationally via elevated mitochondrial DNA levels
VL  - 23
IS  - 8
SP  - 870-880
AB  - The memory of stresses experienced by parents can be passed on to descendants as a forecast of the challenges to come. Here, we discovered that the neuronal mitochondrial perturbation-induced systemic mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in Caenorhabditis elegans can be transmitted to offspring over multiple generations. The transgenerational activation of UPRmt is mediated by maternal inheritance of elevated levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which causes the proteostasis stress within mitochondria. Furthermore, results from intercrossing studies using wild C. elegans strains further support that maternal inheritance of higher levels of mtDNA can induce the UPRmt in descendants. The mitokine Wnt signalling pathway is required for the transmission of elevated mtDNA levels across generations, thereby conferring lifespan extension and stress resistance to offspring. Collectively, our results reveal that the nervous system can transmit stress signals across generations by increasing mtDNA in the germline, enabling descendants to better cope with anticipated challenges. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

TI  - Transgenerational response to early spring warming in Daphnia
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Temperature and photoperiod regulate key fitness traits in plants and animals. However, with temperature increase due to global warming, temperature cue thresholds are experienced at shorter photoperiods, disrupting the optimal seasonal timing of physiological, developmental and reproductive events in many species. Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation to the asynchrony between temperature and photoperiod is key to inform our understanding of how species will respond to global warming. Here, we studied the transgenerational mechanisms of responses of the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia magna to different photoperiod lengths co-occurring with warm temperature thereby assessing the impact of earlier spring warming on its fitness. Daphnia uses temperature and photoperiod cues to time dormancy, and to switch between sexual and asexual reproduction. Daphnia life cycle offers the opportunity to measure the relative contribution of plastic and genetic responses to environmental change across generations and over evolutionary time. We use transgenerational common garden experiments on three populations ‘resurrected’ from a biological archive experiencing temperature increase over five decades. Our results suggest that response to early spring warming evolved underpinned by a complex interaction between plastic and genetic mechanisms while a positive maternal contribution at matching environments between parental and offspring generation was also observed. © 2019, The Author(s).

VL  - 5

SP  - 709-724
AB  - The present study explores the thermal adaptability in pathogens and tries to find out a relationship between climate warming and diseases. The phenotypic evolutionary analysis of a multi-pathogen system with temperature dependent disease transmission and virulence leads to a possibility of the bistable behaviour of pathogens on temperature scale. Bistability allows the establishment of low and high temperature specialist pathogen strains in a host population. It is observed that bistability can be realized in a host-pathogen system when survival of host and pathogen is possible on a sufficiently wide range of temperature. On the other hand, if host or pathogen survival remains temperature limited, host is susceptible to only one of the either specialists. For the proposed model with density dependent host mortality, we have observed the dimorphic existence of pathogens on moderately warm temperature range only. An advanced level multivariable time-series plot of malaria epidemic in Manipur (India) confirms the bistable behaviour of malaria infection on the temperature scale. Here, we present a novel investigation about thermal adaptability and diseases. We have tried to test the validity of the theory of range expansion and range shifts about climate and diseases. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Cross-generational effects of heat stress on fitness and wolbachia density in aedes aegypti mosquitoes
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia symbionts are now being released into the field to control the spread of pathogenic human arboviruses. Wolbachia can spread throughout vector populations by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility and can reduce disease transmission by interfering with virus replication. The success of this strategy depends on the effects of Wolbachia on mosquito fitness and the stability of Wolbachia infections across generations. Wolbachia infections are vulnerable to heat stress, and sustained periods of hot weather in the field may influence their utility as disease control agents, particularly if temperature effects persist across generations. To investigate the cross-generational effects of heat stress on Wolbachia density and mosquito fitness, we subjected Ae. aegypti with two different Wolbachia infection types (wMel, wAlbB) and uninfected controls to cyclical heat stress during larval development over two generations. We then tested adult starvation tolerance and wing length as measures of fitness and measured the density of wMel in adults. Both heat stress and Wolbachia infection reduced adult starvation tolerance. wMel Wolbachia density in female offspring was lower when mothers experienced heat stress, but male Wolbachia density did not depend on the rearing temperature of the previous generation. We also found cross-generational effects of heat stress on female starvation tolerance, but there was no cross-generational effect on wing length. Fitness costs of Wolbachia infections and cross-generational effects of heat stress on Wolbachia density may reduce the ability of Wolbachia to invade populations and control arbovirus transmission under specific environmental conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - One hundred-seventy years of stressors erode salmon fishery climate resilience in California’s warming landscape
VL  - 28
IS  - 7
SP  - 2183-2201
AB  - People seek reliable natural resources despite climate change. Diverse habitats and biologies stabilize productivity against disturbances like climate, prompting arguments to promote climate-resilient resources by prioritizing complex, less-modified ecosystems. These arguments hinge on the hypothesis that simplifying and degrading ecosystems will reduce resources’ climate resilience, a process liable to be cryptically evolving across landscapes and human generations, but rarely documented. Here, we examined the industrial era (post 1848) of California's Central Valley, chronicling the decline of a diversified, functional portfolio of salmon habitats and life histories and investigating for empirical evidence of lost climate resilience in its fishery. Present perspectives indicate that California's dynamic, warming climate overlaid onto its truncated, degraded habitat mosaic severely constrains its salmon fishery. We indeed found substantial climate constraints on today's fishery, but this reflected a shifted ecological baseline. During the early stages of a stressor legacy that transformed the landscape and -- often consequently -- compressed salmon life history expression, the fishery diffused impacts of dry years across a greater number of fishing years and depended less on cool spring-summer transitions. The latter are important given today's salmon habitats, salmon life histories, and resource management practices, but are vanishing with climate change while year-to-year variation in fishery performance is rising. These findings give empirical weight to the idea that human legacies influence ecosystems’ climate resilience across landscapes and boundaries (e.g., land/sea). They also raise the question of whether some contemporary climate effects are recent and attributable not only to increasing climate stress, but to past and present human actions that erode resilience. In general, it is thus worth considering that management approaches that prioritize complex, less-modified ecosystems may stabilize productivity despite increasing climate stress and such protective actions may be required for some ecological services to persist into uncertain climate futures.

TI  - Transgenerational interactions between pesticide exposure and warming in a vector mosquito
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
SP  - 906-917
AB  - While transgenerational plasticity may buffer ectotherms to warming and pesticides separately, it remains unknown how combined exposure to warming and pesticides in the parental generation shapes the vulnerability to these stressors in the offspring. We studied the transgenerational effects of single and combined exposure to warming (4°C increase) and the pesticide chlorpyrifos on life-history traits of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Parental exposure to a single stressor, either warming or the pesticide, had negative effects on the offspring: parental exposure to both warming and the pesticide resulted in an overall lower offspring survival, and a delayed offspring metamorphosis. Parental exposure to a single stressor did, however, not alter the vulnerability of the offspring to the same stressor in terms of survival. Parental pesticide exposure resulted in larger offspring when the offspring experienced the same stressor as the parents. Within both the parental and offspring generations, warming made the pesticide more toxic in terms of survival. Yet, this synergism disappeared in the offspring of parents exposed to both stressors simultaneously because in this condition, the pesticide was already more lethal at the lower temperature. Our results indicate that transgenerational effects will not increase the ability of this vector species to deal with pesticides in a warming world. Bifactorial transgenerational experiments are crucial to understand the combined impact of warming and pesticides across generations, hence to assess the efficacy of vector control in a warming world. © 2018 The Authors.

SP  - 697-701
AB  - Summary What is already known about this topic? An increasing number of studies have projected temperature-related mortality, but few consider the change of population’s adaptability to future temperature and mortality burden from cold and heat effects. What is added by this report? This study offers a comprehensive characterization of human adaptability and excess mortality burden of temperature across various regions of China. What are the implications for public health practice? The temperature-related excess mortality was projected to increase in the 2050s and decrease in the 2080s. Heat adaptability was projected to increase in the future, but along with the rising temperatures, the heat-related excess mortality continuously rose, except for the low-speed rising scenario. Although the excess mortality of cold was projected to decrease in the nearer future, it might not keep declining in the long run, due to the decreasing cold-adaptability, which deserves more attention. © 2021, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

TI  - Impact of near-future ocean warming and acidification on the larval development of coral-eating starfish Acanthaster cf. solaris after parental exposure
VL  - 548
AB  - Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster spp. (COTS) are among the most severe local threats to Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Despite intensive research, the factors triggering outbreaks remain unclear, though could involve enhanced COTS larval fitness due to ocean warming and acidification. Nevertheless, the effect of these combined stressors has never been tested on larval development and survivorship after parental exposure. We investigated the effects of ocean warming (+2 °C above ambient) and/or acidification (pH 7.75) on early COTS life-history stages of offspring after exposing the parental generation for 20 weeks to the same treatments. We hypothesized that prior adult exposure would modulate the effects measured in previous studies that omitted this phase, providing a more realistic scenario. Our results showed detrimental effects of elevated temperature towards lower gastrulation success and smaller advanced bipinnaria. Both elevated temperature and lower pH produced developmental delay from early to advanced bipinnaria, eventually translating into retarded achievement of mid-late brachiolaria. On average, larvae were significantly bigger in low pH treatments, independent of stages. We suggest a link between developmental delay and larger larvae due to acidification, where larvae could be blocked at a developmental stage but continue growing. Finally, we found that larval mortality was not impacted by treatments, potentially due to prior adult exposure. If adult COTS were able to acclimatize their reproductive physiology in 15 weeks to produce larvae withstanding warming and/or acidification, slow climatic changes might not affect survival at this life stage. However, the developmental delays displayed might elongate their fragile pelagic phase, potentially decreasing their chances to reach recruitment. We specified the natural spawning peak in New Caledonia, and show caution in directly linking high fertilisation rates with high larval success. Our study reinforces the need to include parental exposure when investigating climate change effects on echinoderm larvae, as punctual stress over single-life stages may produce misleading results. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Generalists versus specialists in fluctuating environments: a bet-hedging perspective
VL  - 129
IS  - 6
SP  - 879-890
AB  - Bet-hedging evolves in fluctuating environments because long-term genotype success is determined by geometric (rather than arithmetic) mean fitness across generations. Diversifying bet-hedging produces different specialist offspring, whereas conservative bet-hedging produces similar generalist offspring. However, many fields, such as behavioral ecology and thermal physiology, typically consider specialist versus generalist strategies only in terms of maximizing arithmetic mean fitness benefits to individuals. Here we model how environmental variability affects optimal amounts of phenotypic variation within and among individuals to maximise genotype fitness, and we disentangle the effects of individual-level optimization and genotype-level bet-hedging by comparing long-term arithmetic versus geometric mean fitness. For traits with additive fitness effects within lifetimes (e.g. foraging-related traits), genotypes of similar generalists or diversified specialists perform equally well. However, if fitness effects are multiplicative within lifetimes (e.g. sequential survival probabilities), generalist individuals are always favored. In this case, geometric mean fitness optimization requires even more within-individual phenotypic variation than does arithmetic mean fitness, causing individuals to be more generalist than required to simply maximize their own expected fitness. In contrast to previous results in the bet-hedging literature, this generalist conservative bet-hedging effect is always favored over diversifying bet-hedging. These results link the evolution of behavioral and ecological specialization with earlier models of bet-hedging, and we apply our framework to a range of natural phenomena from habitat choice to host specificity in parasites. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - The epigenetic landscape of transgenerational acclimation to ocean warming
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SP  - 504-509
AB  - Epigenetic inheritance is a potential mechanism by which the environment in one generation can influence the performance of future generations 1 . Rapid climate change threatens the survival of many organisms; however, recent studies show that some species can adjust to climate-related stress when both parents and their offspring experience the same environmental change 2,3 . Whether such transgenerational acclimation could have an epigenetic basis is unknown. Here, by sequencing the liver genome, methylomes and transcriptomes of the coral reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, exposed to current day (+0 °C) or future ocean temperatures (+3 °C) for one generation, two generations and incrementally across generations, we identified 2,467 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 1,870 associated genes that respond to higher temperatures within and between generations. Of these genes, 193 were significantly correlated to the transgenerationally acclimating phenotypic trait, aerobic scope, with functions in insulin response, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial activity, oxygen consumption and angiogenesis. These genes may therefore play a key role in restoring performance across generations in fish exposed to increased temperatures associated with climate change. Our study is the first to demonstrate a possible association between DNA methylation and transgenerational acclimation to climate change in a vertebrate. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Polyandry provides reproductive and genetic benefits in colonising populations
VL  - 10
IS  - 19
SP  - 10851-10857
AB  - Polyandry, when females mate with more than one male, is theorised to play an important role in successful colonisation of new habitats. In addition to possible benefits from sexual selection, even mild polyandry could facilitate colonisation by protecting against inbreeding and reducing the costs of mating with incompatible or infertile males. Here, we measure the importance of mild polyandry for population viability and reproductive fitness following experimental founder events into a higher-temperature regime. Using colonisation experiments with the model beetle Tribolium castaneum, in which females can produce offspring for up to 140 days following a single mating, we founded more than 100 replicate populations using single females that had been given the opportunity to mate with either one or two males and then tracked their subsequent population dynamics. Following population viability and fitness across 10 generations, we found that extinction rates were significantly lower in populations founded by females given polyandrous opportunities to mate with two males (9%) compared to populations founded by monogamous females (34%). In addition, populations founded by females that had been provided with opportunities to store sperm from two different males showed double the median productivity following colonisation compared to monogamous-founded populations. Notably, we identified short-term and longer-term benefits to post-colonisation populations from double-mating, with results suggesting that polyandry acts to both protect against mating with incompatible males through the founder event, and reduce inbreeding depression as the colonisation proceeds for 10 generations. Our results therefore show that even mild polyandry provides both reproductive and genetic benefits for colonising populations. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - High temperature tolerance and thermal-adaptability plasticity of Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis Guenée) after a single extreme heat wave at the egg stage
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SP  - 1040-1047
AB  - Due to ongoing climate change, short-term extreme heat waves in the summer are expected to be more frequent. Insect eggs are sensitive to thermal stress. This raises the question of whether herbivore insects' thermal adaptability would be changed after a single extreme heat wave at the egg stage. In this study, we examined the developmental performance of Ostrinia fumacalis Guenee at 25 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 29 degrees C or 31 degrees C after a single extreme heat wave (42 degrees C) for 0 h (control), 1 h, 2 h, or 3 h at the egg stage. The results showed that O. furnacalis at the egg or larval stage was more sensitive to a single heat wave than it was at the pupae or adult stage. After a single heat wave, O. furnacalis showed a reduced egg-hatching rate or reduced larval survival rate, but the optimum temperature for egg hatching and larval survival was higher than that in the control. The upper temperature threshold and optimum temperature for larval development in the control were higher than that after a single extreme heat wave. Both male and female pupal weight decreased with increasing temperature, and pupal weight decreased faster in females than in males. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that when O. furnacalis developed at 25 degrees C, the instantaneous death risk of adults with a 3 h heat wave at the egg stage was higher than that of the control, but when O. furnacalis developed at 29 degrees C and 31 degrees C, the instantaneous death risk of adults after a heat wave was significantly lower than that of the control. Our study highlights the effect of a single heat wave on O. fumacalis eggs and the subsequent development of survival individuals.

TI  - Influence of climatic conditions on productivity and adaptability of Camelina sativa
VL  - 224
AB  - The purpose of the research is to assess the productivity and adaptability of Camelina sativa depending on the natural and climatic conditions of the forest-steppe zone of the Middle Volga region and the steppe Crimea. The researches were conducted in two regions (Penza and Crimea) with contrasting hydrothermal conditions in 2015-2019 years. Climate conditions in the years of researches were characterized by significant variability in both the degree of humidity and temperature regime in both regions. The hydrothermal coefficient in the Crimea varied in the range of 0.23-1.11, in the conditions of Penza - from 0.45 to 1.10. The index of environmental conditions varied from -0.58 to 1.28 units depending on the natural and climatic zone. On average, in 2015-2019, the productivity of Camelina changed from 1.45 to 1.79 t/ha in Penza and from 0.56 to 1.66 t/ha in Crimea. The highest yield of Camelina sativa was recorded in 2016 in Penza and in 2017 in the Crimea and amounted to 1.79 and 1.66 t/ha, respectively. The value of the index of environmental conditions is 1.17 and 1.28 with hydrothermal coefficient of 0.82 and 0.61, respectively. Depending on the conditions of the year and the region, the oil content varied from 33.9 to 43.9 %. At the same time, there is a tendency to decrease the amount of oil for all years of study in the direction from the Crimea to the zone of the Penza region. Camelina sativa is characterized by a high level of resistance to stressful conditions (0.49- 1.10), differs in environmental adaptability (bi=1.15-1.17), has a high fitness criterion, 41.2-41.5 g/m2, depending on the region. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

TI  - Impact of Heat Stress on the Predatory Ladybugs Hippodamia variegata and Propylaea quatuordecimpunctata
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - In cotton-growing regions of northwestern China, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and Prop-ylaea quatuordecimpunctata (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are key natural enemies of hemip-teran pests. As only H. variegata can be encountered in hot, arid production areas, the thermal responses and climatic adaptability of both species likely differ substantially. In this study, we as-sessed the survival, longevity, fecundity, prey consumption rate, and antioxidant capacity of both species under laboratory conditions at 32–38 °C. The (negative) impacts of elevated temperatures (i.e., 35 and 38 °C) on adult survival and reproduction were more pronounced for P. quatuordec-impunctata than for H. variegata. Similarly, high temperatures exhibited the strongest negative impacts on the prey consumption rates of P. quatuordecimpunctata. At elevated temperatures, superox-ide dismutase and catalase activity increased, while glutathione-S-transferases activity decreased for both species. However, for P. quatuordecimpunctata, peroxidase activity and total antioxidant capacity progressively declined. Antioxidant responses thus constitute a key physiological adaptation of ladybugs to heat stress, reflecting a superior thermal tolerance of H. variegata. Our work empha-sizes how laboratory assays can explain spatiotemporal distribution patterns of individual ladybugs and inform strategies to bolster their ensuing biological control under conditions of global warming or extreme weather events. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Evidence for the metal resistance of earthworm Eisenia fetida across generations (F1 and F2) under laboratory metal exposure
VL  - 425
AB  - Environmental stressors are persistent but most toxicological studies always evaluate the risk via short-term acute toxicity, while continuous toxicity and biological resistance across generations are relatively unknown. Here, earthworm Eisenia fetida was laboratory-reared and exposed to historically contaminated soils with an increasing metal gradient (CK, LM and HM), to investigate cross-generation toxicity and resistance of F1 and F2 worms. The results elucidated that biomass and juvenile hatching rate of F2 E. fetida showed maximum decreases of 20.8% and 38.5% than those of F1, which indicated severer toxicity of earthworm offspring. However, metal bioaccumulation in F2 E. fetida showed maximum increases of 150%, 49.2%, 19.7% and 25.5% than F1 for Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb, respectively. F2 E. fetida suffered less oxidative stress because the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were basically lower than that of F1. Meanwhile, the detoxification genes of metallothionein and heat shock protein 70 in F2 E. fetida showed maximum of 296% and 78.9% up-regulations, respectively, which suggested greater metal resistance of F2 E. fetida. This study confirmed the cross-generation toxicity and resistance of earthworms, which provides novel insights to reveal specific contaminant risks from longer lifecycles.

TI  - Global change scenarios trigger carry-over effects across life stages and generations of the intertidal limpet, Siphonaria australis
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - For organisms with complex life histories, carry-over effects (COEs) can manifest between life stages, when conditions experienced by one stage influence the next, as well as trans-generationally, when the parental environment affects offspring. Here we used multiple global change-associated stressors to examine both forms of COE simultaneously in an intertidal limpet with mixed development (i.e. planktonic larvae hatch from benthic egg masses). Adult Siphonaria australis were subjected to four treatments over four weeks: an ambient control, a treatment featuring elevated water temperature (25C) and UVB (1.7 W m-2), a copper pollution treatment (5.0 μg L-1), and a treatment incorporating all three stressors. Egg masses laid by these adults were then redistributed among the same four treatments (producing 16 adult-to-egg treatment histories) and stressed until hatching. Finally, hatching larvae were reared under ambient conditions for 24 days. While adult survivorship was unaffected by treatment, embryonic viability in egg masses responded strongly to egg mass treatment, as well as parental stress exposure, therefore displaying trans-generational COEs. These trans-generational COEs interacted with COEs originating in egg masses to produce highly context-dependent hatching sizes and larval growth. This demonstrates that the performance of a given organism at a given time reflects not only conditions experienced during embryonic development, but also those of the parental generation, and suggests that COEs play an important but underestimated role in responses to global change scenarios. © 2018 Kessel, Phillips.

TI  - High-efficiency CRISPR gene editing in C. elegans using Cas9 integrated into the genome
VL  - 17
IS  - 11
AB  - Gene editing in C. elegans using plasmid-based CRISPR reagents requires microinjection of many animals to produce a single edit. Germline silencing of plasmid-borne Cas9 is a major cause of inefficient editing. Here, we present a set of C. elegans strains that constitutively express Cas9 in the germline from an integrated transgene. These strains markedly improve the success rate for plasmid-based CRISPR edits. For simple, short homology arm GFP insertions, 50-100% of injected animals typically produce edited progeny, depending on the target locus. Template-guided editing from an extrachromosomal array is maintained over multiple generations. We have built strains with the Cas9 transgene on multiple chromosomes. Additionally, each Cas9 locus also contains a heatshock-driven Cre recombinase for selectable marker removal and a bright fluorescence marker for easy outcrossing. These integrated Cas9 strains greatly reduce the workload for producing individual genome edits. Author summaryGermlines have evolved specialized mechanisms to protect themselves from invasions by transposons and viruses, which create barriers to genome editing techniques. For example, transgenes are silenced in the germline of the nematode C. elegans, thereby creating a barrier to CRISPR editing by Cas9. To facilitate gene editing, we built a collection of C. elegans strains in which Cas9 is never silenced. CRISPR is significantly more efficient in these animals, decreasing the effort researchers need to expend to get edited animals. The strains are available in multiple genetic backgrounds, and contain accessory transgenes to simplify downstream genetics. Together, these strains enable efficient, low-cost genome editing in C. elegans.

AB  - Garcia-Marques et al. present CLADES, an innovative approach to study neuronal lineages based on CRISPR. Inspired by synthetic biology, CLADES relies on a system of genetic switches to activate and inactivate reporter genes in a predetermined order. We present CLADES (cell lineage access driven by an edition sequence), a technology for cell lineage studies based on CRISPR-Cas9 techniques. CLADES relies on a system of genetic switches to activate and inactivate reporter genes in a predetermined order. Targeting CLADES to progenitor cells allows the progeny to inherit a sequential cascade of reporters, thereby coupling birth order to reporter expression. This system, which can also be temporally induced by heat shock, enables the temporal resolution of lineage development and can therefore be used to deconstruct an extended cell lineage by tracking the reporters expressed in the progeny. When targeted to the germ line, the same cascade progresses across animal generations, predominantly marking each generation with the corresponding combination of reporters. CLADES therefore offers an innovative strategy for making programmable cascades of genes that can be used for genetic manipulation or to record serial biological events.

VL  - 468
AB  - Shelled pteropods are cosmopolitan, free-swimming organisms of biogeochemical and commercial importance. They are widely used as sentinel species for the overall response of marine ecosystems to environmental stressors associated with climate change and changes in ocean chemistry. However, currently we are unable to project the effects of climate change on shelled pteropods at the population level, due to the missing spatio-temporal characterization of the response of pteropods to environmental stressors, and the limited information on the pteropod life history and life-cycle. In this study, we implement a shelled pteropod Individual-Based Model (IBM), i.e. we simulate a pteropod population as a set of discrete individuals over several generations, life-stages (eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults) and as a function of temperature, food availability, and aragonite saturation state. The model is able to provide an abundance signal that is consistent with the abundance signal measured in the temperate region. In addition, the modeled life-stage progression matches the reported size spectrum across the year, with two major spawning periods in spring and fall, and maturation in March and September. Furthermore, our IBM correctly predicts the abundance maxima of younger, smaller and potentially more susceptible life-stages in spring and winter. Thus, our model provides a tool for advancing our understanding of the response of pteropod populations to future environmental changes. © 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Plasticity in parental effects confers rapid larval thermal tolerance in the estuarine anemone Nematostella vectensis
VL  - 224
IS  - 5
AB  - Parental effects can prepare offspring for different environments and facilitate survival across generations. We exposed parental populations of the estuarine anemone, Nematostella vectensis, from Massachusetts to elevated temperatures and quantified larval mortality across a temperature gradient. We found that parental exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in a consistent increase in larval thermal tolerance, as measured by the temperature at which 50% of larvae die (LT50), with a mean increase in LT50 of 0.3°C. Larvae from subsequent spawns returned to baseline thermal thresholds when parents were returned to normal temperatures, indicating plasticity in these parental effects. Histological analyses of gametogenesis in females suggested that these dynamic shifts in larval thermal tolerance may be facilitated by maternal effects in nonoverlapping gametic cohorts. We also compared larvae from North Carolina (a genetically distinct population with higher baseline thermal tolerance) and Massachusetts parents, and observed that larvae from heat-exposed Massachusetts parents had thermal thresholds comparable to those of larvae from unexposed North Carolina parents. North Carolina parents also increased larval thermal tolerance under the same higherature regime, suggesting that plasticity in parental effects is an inherent trait for N. vectensis. Overall, we find that larval thermal tolerance in N. vectensis shows a strong genetic basis and can be modulated by parental effects. Further understanding of the mechanisms behind these shifts can elucidate the fate of thermally sensitive ectotherms in a rapidly changing thermal environment. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Implementation of Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm to multi-objective loading pattern optimization of a PWR reactor
VL  - 148
AB  - Loading pattern optimization (LPO) is a main issue of in-core fuel management. In this work, the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm based on behavior of gray wolves for hunting is introduced for the multi-objective LPO of a WWER-1000 core. Besides the GWO, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) have been applied and the performances of these algorithms are compared in challenging test functions (Griewank and Rastrigin) and LPO. The basic goal of this paper is to optimize the loading pattern with Neutronic and Thermal-Hydraulic (NTH) parameters, simultaneously. Considering these goals, a fitness function is defined for increasing k(eff) and flattening of PPFs. Thermal-hydraulic (TH) goals with specified weight are considered in this fitness (including critical heat flux (CHF) and fuel temperature). To calculate the required parameters of the core, two nuclear computational codes are used. The neutronic calculations are done by PARCS and COBRA-EN code is implemented for Thermal-hydraulic. These codes have been coupled with the GWO, GA and GSA algorithms with proper procedures. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the GWO and confirm that the GWO has appropriate adaptability for loading pattern optimization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Experimental evidence for population variability of reproductive traits in Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus
VL  - 49
AB  - Small pelagic fishes show spatiotemporal variations in reproductive traits due probably to responses to varying environmental conditions, but potential genetic contributions to such variations have received little attention. This study compared several reproductive traits of Japanese anchovy between two geographically isolated populations, from the central Seto Inland Sea and Omura Bay, western Japan, under common environmental conditions over three generations. There were no significant differences in age and standard length at sexual maturation between populations. Temperature-mediated variation in egg size was found in the two populations with decrease in egg size as temperature increased. However, regression analysis showed that the relationship between egg size and temperature differed significantly between the two populations over three generations. There was also a significant difference in the relative batch fecundity of the F1 and F2 generations between populations. Hence, females from the central Seto Inland Sea could produce a larger number of smaller eggs than females from Omura Bay. Variation in egg size appears to reflect significant differences in larval size at hatch and the onset of feeding in waters of different temperatures. These findings suggest that the thermal reaction norms of egg size observed in the two populations could have genetic contributions and that their egg traits may mediate a possible difference in offspring viability during early life stages.

TI  - Variation of indoor minimum mortality temperature in different cities: Evidence of local adaptations
VL  - 246
SP  - 745-752
AB  - Epidemiological studies on the impact of outdoor temperature to human health have demonstrated the capability of humans to adapt to local climate. However, there is limited information on the association between indoor temperature and human health, despite people spending most of their time indoors. The problem stems from the lack of sufficient indoor temperature measurement in the population. To overcome this obstacle, this paper presents an indirect epidemiological approach to evaluate the impact of high indoor temperature on mortality. The relationships between indoor-outdoor temperatures in different climate zones identified in the literature were combined with the outdoor temperature-mortality curves of the same locations to obtain the local indoor minimum mortality temperatures (iMMT), the temperature at which mortality is lowest, which by implication is the temperature at which the population is most comfortable on average. We show that the iMMT varies and has a weak linear relationship with the distance to the equator, which provides evidence of human adaptation to local indoor temperatures. These findings reinforce the adaptive comfort theory, which states that people can adapt to local indoor environment and establish their thermal comfort. Recognising the human adaptability to local climate will direct flexible and optimized policy to protect public health against extreme temperature events. This will also help reduce energy consumption for regulating indoor temperature without compromising the occupants’ health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd The estimated indoor minimum mortality temperatures are different from the outdoor minimum mortality temperatures but varied similarly across climate zones. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Exposure of zebrafish to elevated temperature induces sex ratio shifts and alterations in the testicular epigenome of unexposed offspring
VL  - 186
AB  - Accumulating evidence shows that environmental changes can affect population sex ratios through epigenetic regulation of gene expression in species where sex depends on both genetic and environmental cues. Sometimes, altered sex ratios persist in the next generation even when the environmental cue is no longer present (a multigenerational effect). However, evidence of transgenerational effects (i.e., beyond the first non-exposed generation), which tend to be paternally transmitted, is scarce and a matter of debate. Here, we used the AB strain of zebrafish, where sex depends on both genetic and environmental influences, to study possible multi- (to the F1) and transgenerational (to the F2) effects of elevated temperature during the critical period of sex differentiation. From eight initial different families, five were selected in order to capture sufficient variation between the sex ratio of the control group (28 °C) and the group exposed to elevated (35 °C) temperature only at the parental (P) generation. Results showed a consistent increase in the proportion of males in the P generation in all five families as a result of heat treatment. Sex ratios were then determined in the F1 and F2 offspring derived from both above groups, which were all raised at 28 °C. A persisting male-skewed sex ratio in the 35°C-derived, unexposed offspring of the F1 generation was observed in three families, denoting family-dependent multigenerational effects. However, no transgenerational effects were observed in the F2 generation of any family. DNA methylation was also assessed in the testis of P, F1 and F2 males derived from exposed and non-exposed fathers and grandfathers. DNA methylation was significantly decreased only in the testis of the 35°C-derived males in the F1 generation but not of the F2 generation and, surprisingly, neither in the 35°C-exposed males of the P generation. Taken together, our results show great interfamily variation, not only in sex ratio response to elevated temperature, but also on its multigenerational effects, denoting a strong influence of genetics. Alterations in the testicular epigenome in F1 males calls for attention to possible, previously unnoticed, effects of temperature in the unexposed offspring of heat-exposed parents in a global warming scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Parents exposed to warming produce offspring lower in weight and condition
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
AB  - The parental environment can alter offspring phenotypes via the transfer of non-genetic information. Parental effects may be viewed as an extension of (within-generation) phenotypic plasticity. Smaller size, poorer physical condition, and skewed sex ratios are common responses of organisms to global warming, yet whether parental effects alleviate, exacerbate, or have no impact on these responses has not been widely tested. Further, the relative non-genetic influence of mothers and fathers and ontogenetic timing of parental exposure to warming on offspring phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we tested how maternal, paternal, and biparental exposure of a coral reef fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to elevated temperature (+1.5°C) at different ontogenetic stages (development vs reproduction) influences offspring length, weight, condition, and sex. Fish were reared across two generations in present-day and projected ocean warming in a full factorial design. As expected, offspring of parents exposed to present-day control temperature that were reared in warmer water were shorter than their siblings reared in control temperature; however, within-generation plasticity allowed maintenance of weight, resulting in a higher body condition. Parental exposure to warming, irrespective of ontogenetic timing and sex, resulted in decreased weight and condition in all offspring rearing temperatures. By contrast, offspring sex ratios were not strongly influenced by their rearing temperature or that of their parents. Together, our results reveal that phenotypic plasticity may help coral reef fishes maintain performance in a warm ocean within a generation, but could exacerbate the negative effects of warming between generations, regardless of when mothers and fathers are exposed to warming. Alternatively, the multigenerational impact on offspring weight and condition may be a necessary cost to adapt metabolism to increasing temperatures. This research highlights the importance of examining phenotypic plasticity within and between generations across a range of traits to accurately predict how organisms will respond to climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Interactive effects of extreme temperature and a widespread coastal metal contaminant reduce the fitness of a common tropical copepod across generations
VL  - 159
AB  - Tropical coastal areas are increasingly exposed to temperature extremes from marine heatwaves and contaminants from anthropogenic activities. The interactive effects of these environmental changes on marine life are understudied. We investigated the direct and cross-generational effects of copper (Cu) on F0 and F1 generations of the common tropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei under extreme temperatures (30 and 34 degrees C). In F0, Cu exposure reduced survival and nauplii production; these patterns were more pronounced at 34 degrees C and in females. F0 Copepods produced more faecal pellets at 34 degrees C than 30 degrees C, indicating a higher energetic demand. In F1, the number of F1 adults was lower in CueF0 and at 34 degrees C. Cu-exposed F0 produced larger adult F1, while exposure to 34 degrees C resulted in smaller adult F1. Our results show that tropical copepods are highly vulnerable to the interactive effects of contaminants and extreme temperatures.

TI  - Limits on optimal decision making: host plant selection is not altered by high temperatures in a butterfly
VL  - 174
SP  - 87-95
AB  - Plastic behavioural adjustments represent a powerful mechanism for animals to respond to severe environmental changes. For instance, animals may use distinct resources, which could enhance their fitness, because of increased temperatures. Such shifts in resource use may be observed in egg laying female insects, modifying host plant preference under challenging conditions. Indeed, females are expected to increase their selectivity towards high-quality host plants when experiencing high compared with benign temperatures. In this study, we examined whether female Bicyclus anynana butterflies can enhance their reproductive performance by modifying host plant use in response to challenging temperature regimes. Towards this end, we investigated (1) whether exposure to variable thermal conditions affected reproductive output when females had access to only one host plant, and (2) whether this in turn affected the oviposition preference for host plants of different quality under laboratory conditions. We expected hot conditions to reduce the reproductive performance (egg number, offspring survival and performance) of butterflies. Such deleterious effects may, however, be counterbalanced by a higher selectivity for high-quality plants when females have simultaneous access to plants of different quality. We found that the reproductive performance of butterflies was indeed reduced when they experienced hot conditions. These temperature effects were only observed when butterflies only had access to a lowquality plant. However, individuals did not increase their selectivity towards the higher-quality host plant in response to hot conditions, possibly because of fecundity costs associated with increased choosiness. Our results illustrate the limits of plastic behavioural adjustments in response to changing environmental conditions under laboratory conditions. Further studies are, however, necessary to clarify whether this lack of plasticity is also observed in wild animals, which may limit their adaptability in the face of climate change. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Effects of Heavy Metal Pollution on Fitness and Swimming Performance of Bufo raddei Tadpole
VL  - 105
IS  - 3
SP  - 387-392
AB  - Systematic studies on the impact of environmental pollution on the survival adaptability of amphibians are relatively few. In this study, Bufo raddei tadpoles from two places with totally different backgrounds of heavy metal pollution were chosen to explore the effects of heavy metal pollution on fitness and swimming performance of tadpoles, the physiological effects were investigated as well. The tadpoles at GS 25, GS 30 and GS 35 were collected randomly from the two study sites and were exposed to different environmental temperatures. The results showed that heavy metal enrichment and antioxidant levels were significantly higher in the tadpoles under long-term heavy metal stress. Meanwhile, heavy metal pollution affected the adaptability of tadpoles to environmental change and decreased the swimming performance of the tadpoles. Unexpected, the tadpoles from heavy metal-polluted area also showed some adaptive changes, mainly reflected in the increase in swimming endurance. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The development and reproduction, and maximum number of generations across seasons were ascertained for populations of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Central Europe. Number of generations was calculated using the thermal characteristics of development and summation of daily average air temperatures, in 2007–2016. This species can produce 2–3 generations per year. However, there is insufficient time for it to achieve its full reproductive potential. Delayed emigration from hibernacula (late April) shortened the period of seasonal activity by 1–6%. Breeding occurred from May to mid September. Oviposition continued into late summer, which left insufficient time for the late-hatching immatures to complete their development before the onset of winter. A high mobility, opportunistic use of prey patches and weak tendency to enter dormancy provide the potential for population increase by extending the period of development of immatures at the risk of failure if the cold period comes early. © 2017, International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).

VL  - 49

SP  - 2119-2127
AB  - Patagonian red octopus, Enteroctopus megalocyathus, is a merobenthic octopus whose paralarvae have been successfully cultured up to juvenile octopuses. At present, high mortality during the paralarval period prevents the scaling from experimental rearing to commercial aquaculture. The aim of the study was to determine upper (CTMax) and lower (CTMin) thermal tolerance, acclimation response ratio (ARR) and thermal tolerance polygon of paralarvae from different culture conditions and subjected to seven acclimation temperatures (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18°C) during the first 5 days of paralarval life. Culture conditions were two types of egg incubation (maternal care and artificial incubators) and two feeding regimes (fed or starved). Fed paralarvae showed thermal preferendum, while unfed paralarvae preferred much higher temperatures than those of acclimation. CTMin and CTMax increased along with the acclimation temperature. Lower values of ARR were obtained in paralarvae from artificial incubation, with this type of paralarva showing the least adaptability to thermal changes. Starved paralarvae showed the lowest values for thermal tolerance range (TTR) and smaller areas of thermal polygon than fed paralarvae. Rearing temperatures above 16°C may be considered suboptimal to paralarvae and affected by the conditions during the embryonic incubation. Rearing temperatures below 8°C may be considered suboptimal for all hatched paralarvae. Therefore, the other temperatures within this range could be used in the context of improving the culture management of paralarvae. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

SP  - 68-75
AB  - 【Objective】To investigate the effects of short-term exposure to high temperature at larval stage on the survival rate, development and fecundity of Assara inouei. 【Method】Neonate larvae or mature larvae of A. inouei were exposed to high temperatures of 35, 38, 41 and 45 ℃ for 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively, and the survival rate was measured. After neonate larvae or mature larvae of A. inouei were exposed to high temperatures of 35, 38 and 41 ℃ for 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively, biological parameters of developmental duration, pupation rate, emergence rate, male and female longevity, number of eggs laid per female and egg hatching rate were investigated. 【Result】The survival rate of neonate larvae decreased gradually with the increase of temperature and treatment time. The developmental duration of neonate larvae was shortened by 35 ℃ treatment, but the developmental durations were prolonged by 38 and 41 ℃ treatments. After mature larvae were exposed to high temperature for short term, the pupation rate, pupal weight, emergence rate, oviposition period, female longevity and number of eggs laid per female decreased gradually, and pupal duration prolonged gradually with the increase of temperature and treatment time. 【Conclusion】Neonate larvae have higher adaptability to short-term high temperature than mature larvae. Short-term exposure to high temperature has significant effects on the survival, development and fecundity of mature larvae of A. inouei. The results reveal the adaptability of A. inouei larvae to high temperature, and provide a scientific basis for predicting the population dynamics of A. inouei. © 2020, Editorial Department, Journal of South China Agricultural University.

TI  - Fitness cost of a mcr-1-carrying IncHI2 plasmid
VL  - 13
IS  - 12
AB  - IncHI2 is a common type of large mcr-1-carrying plasmids that have been found worldwide. Large plasmids could impose metabolic burden for host bacterial strains, we therefore examine the stability and fitness cost of a mcr-1-carrying 265.5-kb IncHI2 plasmid, pMCR1_ 1943, in Escherichia coli in nutrient-rich LB and nutrient-restricted M9 broth. Stability tests revealed that pMCR1_1943 was stably maintained with a stability frequency of 0.99±0.01 (mean ± standard deviation) after 880 generations in LB and 0.97±0.00 after 220 generations in M9 broth. Relative fitness (expressed as w, defined as relative fitness of the plasmid-carrying strain compared to the plasmid-free progenitor strain) was examined using the 24-h head to head competitions. pMCR1_1943 initially imposed costs (w, 0.88±0.03 in LB, 0.87±0.01 in M9) but such costs were largely reduced after 14-day cultures (w, 0.97±0.03 in LB, 0.95±0.03 in M9). The stable maintenance and the largely compensated cost after passage may contribute to the wide spread of mcr-1-carrying IncHI2 plasmids. To investigate potential mechanisms for the reduced fitness cost, we performed whole genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism calling for the competitor strains. We identified that molecular chaperone-encoding dnaK, cell division protein-encoding cpoB and repeat protein-encoding rhsC were associated with the cost reduction for pMCR1_1943, which may represent new mechanisms for host bacterial strains to compensate fitness costs imposed by large plasmids and warrant further studies. © 2018 Ma et al.

VL  - 34
IS  - 5
SP  - 841-853
AB  - Animals that face natural and human-mediated landscape disturbance processes can demonstrate different modalities of phenotypic variation to influence local population persistence. Differences in the frequency and pervasiveness of environmental variation can cause an individual’s phenotype to demonstrate either directional plasticity (i.e., environmental matching), canalization, or increased trait variance. Furthermore, how important a trait’s influence is on fitness can further mediate the nature of phenotypic outcomes to environmental variation. We explored the effects of multi-decadal chronosequences of logging and fire-related forest disturbance on morphological variation of the generalist lizard species, the Yellow-bellied water skink (Eulamprus heatwolei) in Southern Australia. There was evidence that both logging and fire-related disturbance could influence multiple elements of vegetation structure that would construe a major source of environmental variation for lizards. Nevertheless, neither logging nor fire-related disturbance effects resulted in significant differences in lizard morphological traits. However, there was evidence that years post-fire disturbance was associated with a modest but significant increase in a measure of lizard morphological variance. For the most part, we suggest that lizards exhibit canalization in their morphological responses to disturbance related environmental variation. In forests ecosystems with complex temporal and spatial regimes of environmental variation, canalization of lizard morphology could be expected to ensure phenotypic stability within or across generations to favor geometric, over arithmetic, fitness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Thermal annealed silk fibroin membranes for periodontal guided tissue regeneration
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
AB  - Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is a surgical procedure applied in the reconstruction of periodontal defects, where an occlusive membrane is used to prevent the fast-growing connective tissue from migrating into the defect. In this work, silk fibroin (SF) membranes were developed for periodontal guided tissue regeneration. Solutions of SF with glycerol (GLY) or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) where prepared at several weight ratios up to 30%, followed by solvent casting and thermal annealing at 85 °C for periods of 6 and 12 h to produce high flexible and stable membranes. These were characterized in terms of their morphology, physical integrity, chemical structure, mechanical and thermal properties, swelling capability and in vitro degradation behavior. The developed blended membranes exhibited high ductility, which is particular relevant considering the need for physical handling and adaptability to the defect. Moreover, the membranes were cultured with human periodontal ligament fibroblast cells (hPDLs) up to 7 days. Also, the higher hydrophilicity and consequent in vitro proteolytic degradability of these blends was superior to pure silk fibroin membranes. In particular SF/GLY blends demonstrated to support high cell adhesion and viability with an adequate hPDLs’ morphology, make them excellent candidates for applications in periodontal regeneration.

TI  - An adaptive transgenerational effect of warming but not of pesticide exposure determines how a pesticide and warming interact for antipredator behaviour
VL  - 245
SP  - 307-315
AB  - The impact of pesticides on organisms may strongly depend on temperature. While many species will be exposed to pesticides and warming both in the parental and offspring generations, transgenerational effects of pesticides under warming are still poorly studied, particularly for behaviour. We therefore studied the single and combined effects of exposure to the pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and warming both within and across generations on antipredator behaviour of larvae of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Within each generation pesticide exposure and warming reduced the escape diving time, making the larvae more susceptible to predation. Pesticide exposure of the parents did not affect offspring antipredator behaviour. Yet, parental exposure to warming determined how warming and the pesticide interacted in the offspring generation. When parents were reared at 24 °C, warming no longer reduced offspring diving times in the solvent control, suggesting an adaptive transgenerational effect to prepare the offspring to better deal with a higher predation risk under warming. Related to this, the CPF-induced reduction in diving time was stronger at 20 °C than at 24 °C, except in the offspring whose parents had been exposed to 24 °C. This dependency of the widespread interaction between warming and pesticide exposure on an adaptive transgenerational effect of warming is an important finding at the interface of global change ecology and ecotoxicology. An adaptive transgenerational effect of exposure to warming, but not to a pesticide determines how pesticide and warming interact for antipredator behaviour in the offspring. © 2018

TI  - Effects of ocean acidification on copepods
VL  - 196
SP  - 17-24
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) leads to significant changes in seawater carbon chemistry, broadly affects marine organisms, and considered as a global threat to the fitness of marine ecosystems. Due to the crucial role of copepods in marine food webs of transferring energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels, numerous studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of OA on biological traits of copepods such as growth and reproduction. Under OA stress, the copepods demonstrated species-specific and stage-dependent responses. Notably, different populations of the same copepod species demonstrated different sensitivities to the increased pCO2. In copepods, the deleterious effects of OA are also reinforced by other naturally occurring co-stressors (e.g., thermal stress, food deprivation, and metal pollution). Given that most OA stress studies have focused on the effects of short-term exposure (shorter than a single generation), experiments using adults might have underestimated the damaging effects of OA and the long-term multigenerational exposure to multiple stressors (e.g., increased pCO2 and food shortage) will be required. Particularly, omics-based technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) will be helpful to better understand the underlying processes behind biological responses (e.g., survival, development, and offspring production) at the mechanistic level which will improve our predictions of the responses of copepods to climate change stressors including OA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fuzzy mathematics based evaluation method of crop adaptability for agriculture and photovoltaic combined system
VL  - 2361
AB  - In view of the lack of theoretical basis for the selection of crop species under agrivoltaics, a comprehensive evaluation method of crop fitness was proposed by using the idea of fuzzy mathematics. Firstly, the sunlight, temperature and precipitation in the process of crop growth were selected to establish the corresponding membership function and the method of comprehensive evaluation of its fitness. The evaluation model of these three conditions was established, and the fitness function was combined with the evaluation model.

TI  - Mapping the increased minimum mortality temperatures in the context of global climate change
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Minimum mortality temperature (MMT) is an important indicator to assess the temperature–mortality relationship. It reflects human adaptability to local climate. The existing MMT estimates were usually based on case studies in data rich regions, and limited evidence about MMT was available at a global scale. It is still unclear what the most significant driver of MMT is and how MMT will change under global climate change. Here, by analysing MMTs in 420 locations covering six continents (Antarctica was excluded) in the world, we found that although the MMT changes geographically, it is very close to the local most frequent temperature (MFT) in the same period. The association between MFT and MMT is not changed when we adjust for latitude and study year. Based on the MFT~MMT association, we estimate and map the global distribution of MMTs in the present (2010s) and the future (2050s) for the first time. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Combined effects of abamectin and temperature on the physiology and behavior of male lizards (Eremias argus): Clarifying adaptation and maladaptation
VL  - 837
AB  - Chemical pollution and global warming are two major threats to organisms, which can interact to affect the normal activities of living beings. In this study, to explore the effects of abamectin and high temperature on adaptability of lizard, male adult Eremias argus (a native Chinese lizard) were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of abamectin (0.02 mg·L−1 and 2 mg·L−1) and different temperature (26 °C and 32 °C) for 30 days. The fitness-related behaviors (locomotion, predation, and thermoregulation) of lizards were evaluated. Physiological effects were addressed using biochemical biomarkers related to oxidative stress, detoxification, and neurotransmitter content. The results showed that abamectin could affect the neurotransmitter systems, cause oxidative stress, and alters lizard locomotion and predation-related behaviors of lizards, but lizards up-regulating detoxification metabolic enzymes, exhibiting higher body temperature preference to alleviate the toxicity of abamectin, and compensate the increased energy demand for detoxification and repair damage by increasing food intake. After exposure to high temperature, lizards showed adaptation to high temperature (higher body temperature preference), the thermal compensation mechanisms may involve elevated Hsp70 levels and increased food intake. At the combined effects of abamectin and high temperature, more obvious behavioral disorders and more severe oxidative stress were observed, although lizards avoided the negative effects of overheating and pollutants by seeking thermal shelter and reducing energy expenditure, this may subsequently reduce foraging opportunities and the ability to obtain energy needed for vital physiological functions (i.e., growth, maintenance, and reproduction). From a long-term perspective, these short-term adaptive strategies will be detrimental to individual long-term survival and population sustainability, and may transformed into maladaptation. © 2022

VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SP  - 1093-1098
AB  - Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are known for their multigenerational migration, one of the longest for any insect. These butterflies are a keystone species, as they help in pollination and are also part of Batesian mimicry. They depend on various environmental cues for reproduction, migration, and hibernation. The Monarchs are threatened by milkweed loss, pesticides, logging, and climate change, all of which are contributing towards a steady decline in their abundance. The changes in climate patterns also affect their migratory path leading to a decline in their population. After several reports of decline in numbers of the Monarchs, conservation efforts have been taken, however a significant improvement has still not been observed. This study explores various immediate and concerted efforts to protect and restore the habitats along the migratory routes of the Monarchs and discusses the multigenerational migration journey. The study also focuses on the impact of climate change and the importance of conserving the population of these butterflies. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research. All rights reserved.

TI  - Induced methylation in plants as a crop improvement tool: Progress and perspectives
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - The methylation of gene promoters is an epigenetic process that can have a major impact on plant phenotypes through its control of gene expression. This phenomenon can be observed as a response to stress, such as drought, cold/heat stress or pathogen infection. The transgenerational heritability of DNA methylation marks could enable breeders to fix beneficial methylation patterns in crops over successive generations. These properties of DNA methylation, its impact on the phenotype and its heritability, could be used to support the accelerated breeding of improved crop varieties. Induced DNA methylation has the potential to complement the existing plant breeding process, supporting the introduction of desirable characteristics in crops within a single generation that persist in its progeny. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation and to develop methods for precisely modulating methylation patterns for crop improvement. Here we describe the currently available epigenetic editing tools and their advantages and limitations in the domain of crop breeding. Finally, we discuss the biological and legislative limitations currently restricting the development of epigenetic modification as a crop improvement tool. © 2020 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

VL  - 77
IS  - 2
SP  - 939-948
AB  - BACKGROUND: In fluctuating climatic environments, heat acclimation in predatory mites is a superior adaptation strategy for effective agricultural pest management and can be used to enhance the abilities critical in biological control efficiency. We investigated the regulatory mechanism governing the remarkable plastic response of thermotolerance in a high-temperature adapted strain (HTAS) and discerned the differences in the defensive reactions between the HTAS and the conventional strain (CS) in the predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri. RESULTS: At 42 °C, the relative expression levels of four identified HSP70 genes increased rapidly in both N. barkeri strains; meanwhile the expression of NbHSP70-1 and NbHSP70-2 in CS sharply decreased after 4 h, displaying a distinct contrast with the remaining elevated expression in HTAS. Western blot analysis showed that the protein level of NbHSP70-1 in CS was dramatically elevated at 0.5 h and decreased at 6 h at 42 °C. Conversely, in HTAS, NbHSP70-1 was constantly induced and peaked at 6 h at 42 °C. Furthermore, HSP70 suppression by RNAi knockdown had a greater influence on the survival of HTAS, causing a higher mortality under high temperature than CS. Finally, the recombinant exogenous NbHSP70-1 protein enhanced the viability of E. coli BL21 under a lethal temperature of 50 °C. CONCLUSION: Sustained accumulation of HSP70 proteins results in predatory phytoseiid mites with the thermotolerance advantage that could promote their biological control function to pests. The divergent constitutive regulation of HSP70 to a thermal environment is conducive to the flexible adaptability of predators in the higher trophic level to trade off under extremely adversity stress. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Development of a Yellow-Seeded Stable Allohexaploid Brassica Through Inter-Generic Somatic Hybridization With a High Degree of Fertility and Resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
VL  - 11
AB  - The Brassica coenospeceis have treasure troves of genes that could be beneficial if introgressed into cultivated Brassicas to combat the current conditions of climate change. Introducing genetic variability through plant speciation with polyploidization is well documented, where ploidy augmentation of inter-generic allohexaploids using somatic hybridization has significantly contributed to genetic base broadening. Sinapis alba is a member of the Brassicaceae family that possesses valuable genes, including genes conferring resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Alternaria brassicae, pod shattering, heat, and drought stress. This work aimed to synthesize stable allohexaploid (AABBSS) Brassica while incorporating the yellow-seed trait and resistance to S. sclerotiorum stem rot. The two fertile and stable allohexaploids were developed by polyethylene glycol mediated protoplast fusions between Brassica juncea (AABB) and S. alba (SS) and named as JS1 and JS2. These symmetric hybrids (2n = 60) were validated using morphological and molecular cytology techniques and were found to be stable over consecutive generations. The complete chromosome constitution of the three genomes was determined through genomic in situ hybridization of mitotic cells probed with S. alba genomic DNA labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. These two allohexaploids showed 24 hybridization signals demonstrating the presence of complete diploid chromosomes from S. alba and 36 chromosomes from B. juncea. The meiotic pollen mother cell showed 30 bivalent sets of all the 60 chromosomes and none of univalent or trivalent observed during meiosis. Moreover, the backcross progeny 1 plant revealed 12 hybridization signals out of a total of 48 chromosome counts. Proper pairing and separation were recorded at the meiotic metaphase and anaphase, which proved the stability of the allohexaploid and their backcross progeny. When screening, the allohexaploid (JS2) of B. juncea and S. alba displayed a high degree of resistance to S. sclerotiorum rot along with a half-yellow and half-brown (mosaic) seed coat color, while the B. juncea and S. alba allohexaplopid1 (JS1) displayed a yellow seed coat color with the same degree of resistance to Sclerotinia rot. © Copyright © 2020 Kumari, Singh, Kumar and Yadava.

TI  - Matching the genetics of released and local Aedes aegypti populations is critical to assure Wolbachia invasion
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Background Traditional vector control approaches such as source reduction and insecticide spraying have limited effect on reducing Aedes aegypti population. The endosymbiont Wolbachia is pointed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission and has been deployed worldwide. Models predict a rapid increase on the frequency of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in local settings, supported by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and high maternal transmission rate associated with the wMelBr strain. Methodology/principle findings Wolbachia wMelBr strain was released for 20 consecutive weeks after receiving >87% approval of householders of the isolated community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro. wMelBr frequency plateued40% during weeks 7-19, peaked 65% but dropped as releases stopped. A high (97.56%) maternal transmission was observed. Doubling releases and deploying mosquitoes with large wing length and low laboratory mortality produced no detectable effects on invasion trend. By investigating the lab colony maintenance procedures backwardly, pyrethroid resistant genotypes in wMelBr decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations. Therefore, we initially released susceptible mosquitoes in a local population highly resistant to pyrethroids which, associated with the over use of insecticides by householders, ended jeopardizing Wolbachia invasion. A new strain (wMelRio) was produced after backcrossing wMelBr females with males from field to introduce mostly pyrethroid resistance alleles. The new strain increased mosquito survival but produced relevant negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits, reducing egg clutche size and egg hatch. Despite the cost on fitness, wMelRio successful established where wMelBr failed, revealing that matching the local population genetics, especially insecticide resistance background, is critical to achieve invasion. Conclusions/significance Local householders support was constantly high, reaching 90% backing on the second release (wMelRio strain). Notwithstanding the drought summer, the harsh temperature recorded (daily average above 30 degrees C) did not seem to affect the expression of maternal transmission of wMel on a Brazilian background. Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion. Considering pyrethroid-resistance is a widely distributed phenotype in natural Ae. aegypti populations, future Wolbachia deployments must pay special attention in maintaining insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases. Author summary Traditional vector control methods have been showing limited success in managing arboviruses disease outbreaks in endemic areas. The endosymbiont bacterium Wolbachia was microinjected on the mosquito Aedes aegypti and later showed the ability to block dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses' development on vector body. Nowadays, Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti has been deployed in twelve countries as an attempt to mitigate arboviruses transmission. Herein, we report the failure of Wolbachia releases on a suburban isolated district of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. For the first time, we demonstrated that the insecticide resistance profile of released and wild mosquitoes is a critical feature for achieving Wolbachia invasion. Special consideration must be given to avoid releasing susceptible mosquitoes where native populations are resistant, since local householders might rely on domestic use of spraying insecticides (mostly pyrethroids) to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

TI  - Warm and out of breath: Thermal phenotypic plasticity in oxygen supply
VL  - 33
IS  - 11
SP  - 2142-2149
AB  - Aquatic ectotherms face a challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen, and it is commonly claimed that this challenge increases with increasing environmental temperature, causing concerns about the fate of aquatic ecosystems under climate change. However, the oxygen challenge hypothesis often ignores the effect of known phenotypic plastic responses. These can occur on either a within- or multigenerational scale, where multiple reactions act in concert to increase oxygen supply in response to increased temperature in a wide range of traits (molecular, egg content, behavioural, cell structure, morphological). Here, we combine a novel modelling approach with empirical measurements that enable quantification of how both the oxygen supply (maximum oxygen diffusion rate) and demand (metabolic rate) are affected by temperature while allowing for phenotypic plasticity. We exposed the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna to a range of temperatures (17–28°C) over several asexual generations and confirm that phenotypic plasticity contributes to an increased ability to obtain oxygen on the whole-organism level at high temperatures. This response is strongest within the highest temperature range (22–28°C), where the change in oxygen challenge is expected to be most pronounced. However, the observed thermal plasticity in oxygen supply failed to compensate for the increased demand. Thus, we provide empirical evidence that the oxygen challenge in aquatic ectotherms increases with increasing temperature, even in the presence of phenotypic plasticity in oxygen supply.

TI  - Methods for estimating and modelling spruce budworm development rates at constant temperatures
VL  - 154
AB  - We describe an experimental protocol for measuring the response of spruce budworm postdiapause larval development to temperature. This protocol is specifically designed to include measurements of development near their upper and lower thermal thresholds. The application of this protocol to a laboratory colony allowed for the first experimental evidence that spruce budworm larval development occurs at temperatures as low as 5 °C and as high as 35 °C, and it provides data to fit stage-specific development models. Our protocol is also designed to minimise mortality near the thermal development thresholds, thus allowing for multigenerational studies. We observed developmental plasticity in larvae reared at constant temperatures, particularly the occurrence of up to 42% of some individuals requiring only five instars to complete development compared to the expected six instars. The occurrence exhibited no clear relation to temperature. Although this protocol is specifically designed for spruce budworm, it provides a template for the study of other species’ developmental responses to temperature. © The Author(s) and Natural Resources Canada, 2022.

TI  - Reproductive gene expression in a coral reef fish exposed to increasing temperature across generations
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Reproduction in marine fish is generally tightly linked with water temperature. Consequently, when adults are exposed to projected future ocean temperatures, reproductive output of many species declines precipitously. Recent research has shown that in the common reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, step-wise exposure to higher temperatures over two generations (parents: +1.5°C, offspring: +3.0°C) can improve reproductive output in the F2 generation compared to F2 fish that have experienced the same high temperatures over two generations (F1 parents: +3.0°C, F2 offspring: +3.0°C). To investigate how a step-wise increase in temperature between generations improved reproductive capacity, we tested the expression of well-known teleost reproductive genes in the brain and gonads of F2 fish using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and compared it among control (+0.0°C for two generations), developmental (+3.0°C in second generation only), step (+1.5°C in first generation and +3.0°C in second generation), and transgenerational (+3.0°C for two generations) treatments. We found that levels of gonadotropin receptor gene expression (Fshr and Lhcgr) in the testes were reduced in developmental and transgenerational temperature treatments, but were similar to control levels in the step treatment. This suggests Fshr and Lhcgr may be involved in regulating male reproductive capacity in A. polyacanthus. In addition, lower Fshb expression in the brain of females in all temperature treatments compared to control, suggests that Fshb expression, which is involved in vitellogenesis, is sensitive to high temperatures. Our results help elucidate key genes that facilitate successful reproduction in reef fishes when they experience a gradual increase in temperature across generations consistent with the trajectory of climate change. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Nix alone is sufficient to convert female Aedes aegypti into fertile males and myo-sex is needed for male flight
VL  - 117
IS  - 30
SP  - 17702-17709
AB  - A dominant male-determining locus (M-locus) establishes the male sex (M/m) in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Nix, a gene in the M-locus, was shown to be a male-determining factor (M factor) as somatic knockout of Nix led to feminized males (M/m) while transient expression of Nix resulted in partially masculinized females (m/m), with male reproductive organs but retained female antennae. It was not clear whether any of the other 29 genes in the 1.3-Mb M-locus are also needed for complete sex-conversion. Here, we report the generation of multiple transgenic lines that express Nix under the control of its own promoter. Genetic and molecular analyses of these lines provided insights unattainable from previous transient experiments. We show that the Nix transgene alone, in the absence of the M-locus, was sufficient to convert females into males with all male-specific sexually dimorphic features and male-like gene expression. The converted m/m males are flightless, unable to perform the nuptial flight required for mating. However, they were able to father sex-converted progeny when presented with cold-anesthetized wild-type females. We show that myo-sex, a myosin heavy-chain gene also in the M-locus, was required for male flight as knockout of myo-sex rendered wild-type males flightless. We also show that Nix-mediated female-to-male conversion was 100% penetrant and stable over many generations. Therefore, Nix has great potential for developing mosquito control strategies to reduce vector populations by female-to-male sex conversion, or to aid in a sterile insect technique that requires releasing only non-biting males. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Multigenerational Effects of Short‐Term High Temperature on the Development and Reproduction of the Zeugodacus cucurbitae (Coquillett, 1899)
VL  - 12
IS  - 7
AB  - Zeugodacus cucurbitae is an important pest of fruit and vegetable crops in tropical and subtropical regions, and high‐temperature stress can have different effects on the development and reproduction of successive generations of Z. cucurbitae. To clarify the multigenerational effects of short‐time high temperature on the development and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae, the newly emerged adults of the contemporary (F1 generation) and the next generation (F2 generation) were exposed to short‐term high temperatures of 25 °C, 33 °C, 37 °C, 41 °C, and 45 °C for 1 h, and the multigenerational (F1, F2, and F3 generation) effects of these temperatures on the development and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae were evaluated. The results showed that (1) when the F1 was exposed to short‐term high temperature, the egg production and lifespan of the F1 decreased continuously with the increasing temperature, except for the 45 °C treatment for 1 h, which stimulated egg production. Only the 41 °C group had significantly higher egg production and lifespan than the control group in the F3. (2) In the F1 and F2 that were exposed to short‐term high temperature, the F1 and F3 were consistent with the results of F1 that were exposed to short‐term high temperature. In conclusion, the effects of high‐temperature intensity and frequency on multiple generations of Z. cucurbitae were different. The results of this study can elucidate the effects of short‐term high‐temperature stress on the growth, development, and reproduction of Z. cucurbitae in different generations, and provide a reference basis for the integrated control of Z. cucurbitae. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Intraspecific variations on thermal susceptibility in the predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae): Responding to long-term heat acclimations and frequent heat hardenings
VL  - 121
SP  - 208-215
AB  - Biological control of spider mites using phytoseiid mites is frequently being disrupted by high temperatures, which results in an important and urgent research topic. We hypothesized that this scenario could be ameliorated if the thermal tolerance of a certain phytoseiid mite is enhanced. In this study, a high temperature adapted strain (HTAS) of the predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes was selected from its conventional strain (CS) via a long-term heat acclimation (maintained at 35 degrees C) and frequent heat hardenings (exposed at 45 degrees C for 2 h every 15-25 days) over multiple generations. As expected, heat acclimation greatly improved the survival probabilities of N. barkeri when a single heat stress event occurred, with a median lethal time (e.g., at 45 degrees C) calculated as 15.2 h for HTAS females and 1.9 h for CS ones, respectively. After the heat acclimatory, HTAS showed a faster growth and developmental rate, and a higher immature survival rate than CS did; a significant reduced total fecundity rather than longevity was observed at 35 degrees C; a shifting from larger females to smaller males was observed (about 21% reduced in female ratio). Meanwhile, single heat stress event (e.g., exposed at 42 degrees C for 4 h) had a detrimental effect on the reproductive traits of the newly-emerged females, particularly obvious for mites from CS colony, by delaying the onset of oviposition and reducing reproductive output. This is the first experimental demonstration that the artificially heat acclimatory can shape the intraspecific variations on thermal susceptibility in a phytoseiid mite. It is suggested that HTAS N. barkeri might be a promising strain for the biological control of the high temperature favored spider mites, and more field and greenhouse trials should be evaluated in the future.

AB  - The ability to tolerate environmental stress may determine invasion success of alien species. Comparative data on physiological thermal tolerance between native and invasive vertebrates are quite limited. Here, we assessed the difference in thermal tolerance between a native (Mauremys reevesii) and an invasive (Trachemys scripta elegans) freshwater turtle species. We incubated eggs of M. reevesii and T. scripta elegans from different cohorts at 29 °C, and measured the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) of hatchlings. Our results preliminarily showed that the hatchlings of T. scripta elegans had a greater high-temperature tolerance and wider tolerance range than the hatchlings of M. reevesii; in the two-cohort system, individuals from the high-latitude cohort seemed to have greater low-temperature tolerance but similar high-temperature tolerance compared with those from the low-latitude cohort. Relatively greater thermal tolerance ability for T. scripta elegans might reflect its environmental adaptability to thermal stress. © Firenze University Press.

TI  - Negative carry-over effects on larval thermal tolerances across a natural thermal gradient
VL  - 103
IS  - 1
AB  - Under climate change, marine organisms will need to tolerate or adapt to increasing temperatures to persist. The ability of populations to cope with thermal stress may be influenced by conditions experienced by parents, by both genetic changes and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity through epigenetics or maternal provisioning. In organisms with complex life cycles, larval stages are particularly vulnerable to stress. Positive parental carry-over effects occur if more stressful parental environments yield more tolerant offspring while the opposite pattern leads to negative carry-over effects. This study evaluated the role of parental effects in determining larval thermal tolerances for the intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus. We tested whether thermal environments across a natural gradient (shoreline elevation) impacted mussel temperature tolerances. Lethal thermal limits were compared for field-collected adults and their larvae. We observed parental effects across one generation, in which adult mussels exposed to warmer habitats yielded less tolerant offspring. Interestingly, although parental environments influenced offspring tolerances, we found no clear effects of habitat conditions on adult phenotypes (tolerances). We found indicators of trade-offs in energy investment, with higher reproductive condition and larger egg diameters in low stress environments. These results suggest that parental effects are negative, leading to possible adverse effects of thermal stress on the next generation. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Reproductive trade-offs of the estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis under different thermal and haline regimes
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Copepod females invest a quantity of resources in their reproduction. Depending on several biotic and abiotic factors and their evolutionary history a trade-off can be commonly observed between producing a large number of smaller offspring or a small number of larger offspring. In this study, a multi-generational approach was applied to determine whether a trade-off between clutch size and egg size existed in the copepod Eurytemora affinis under different controlled conditions of temperature and salinity. This protocol was based on the follow-up of reproductive (Clutch Size ‘CS’, Egg Diameter ‘ED’) and morphological (Prosome Length ‘PL’) traits during several generations. Copepods were acclimated to cold (7 °C) and warm (20 °C) temperatures, and then their reproductive output was tested at the higher temperature of 24 °C. CS and ED were positively correlated to PL, so as a first step linear regressions between each reproductive trait and female PL were performed. The residuals from the regression lines of CS and ED with PL were calculated to remove the effect of female size. When the normalized data (residuals) of CS and ED plotted together a negative relationship between egg size and egg number revealed the existence of a trade-off. Copepod populations initially acclimated to cold temperature are commonly characterized by relatively smaller CS and larger ED. Conversely, warm temperature adapted females produced relatively larger CS and smaller ED. After transfer to a temperature of 24 °C, the ED did not change but the CS showed high variability indicating stressful conditions and no trade-off was observed. These observations suggest that E. affinis is able to modulate its reproduction depending on the encountered temperature. It seems that this copepod species can shift between a K- and an r-strategy in response to colder or warmer conditions. In a late winter-early spring like cold temperature, copepod females seem to invest more on offspring quality by producing relatively larger eggs. This ecological strategy ensures a high recruitment of the spring generation that is responsible for the strength of the maximum population size usually observed in late spring-early summer (May–June). To the contrary, at summer-like temperature, where the population density decreases significantly in the Seine estuary, copepod females seem to switch from K to r strategy by favoring offspring number compared to offspring size. Finally, the use of a higher temperature of 24 °C seems to disrupt the observed reproductive trade-off even after several generations. These results suggest that a switching between K- or r-strategy of E. affinis depends highly on temperature effects. The effect of salinity increase during a summer-like temperature of 20 °C as well as after transfer to 24 °C decreased PL and CS but the ED did not change significantly. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Sporadic nesting reveals long distance colonisation in the philopatric loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta)
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - The colonisation of new suitable habitats is crucial for species survival at evolutionary scale under changing environmental conditions. However, colonisation potential may be limited by philopatry that facilitates exploiting successful habitats across generations. We examine the mechanisms of long distance dispersal of the philopatric loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) by analysing 40 sporadic nesting events in the western Mediterranean. The analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA and 7 microsatellites of 121 samples from 18 of these nesting events revealed that these nests were colonising events associated with juveniles from distant populations feeding in nearby foraging grounds. Considering the temperature-dependent sex determination of the species, we simulated the effect of the incubation temperature and propagule pressure on a potential colonisation scenario. Our results indicated that colonisation will succeed if warm temperature conditions, already existing in some of the beaches in the area, extend to the whole western Mediterranean. We hypothesize that the sporadic nesting events in developmental foraging grounds may be a mechanism to overcome philopatry limitations thus increasing the dispersal capabilities of the species and the adaptability to changing environments. Sporadic nesting in the western Mediterranean can be viewed as potential new populations in a scenario of rising temperatures. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Acaricidal efficacy of ultraviolet-C irradiation of Tetranychus urticae adults and eggs using a pulsed krypton fluoride excimer laser
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Pulsed ultraviolet (UV)-C light sources, such as excimer lasers, are used in emerging non-thermal food-decontamination methods and also have high potential for use in a wide range of microbial decontamination applications. The acaricidal effect of an experimental UV-C irradiation device was assessed using female adults and eggs of a model organism, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. Methods: UV-C light was generated by a pulsed krypton fluoride excimer laser operating at 248-nm emission wavelength. The pulse energy and pulse repetition rate were 5 mJ and up to 100 Hz, respectively. The distance from the light source to the target was 150 mm; the target surface area was 2.16 cm2. The exposure time for the mites and fresh eggs varied from 1 to 4 min at 5–300 mW, which corresponded to UV doses of 5–80 kJ/m2. Post-irradiation acaricidal effects (mite mortality) were assessed immediately and also measured at 24 h. The effects of UV-C irradiation on the hatchability of eggs were observed daily for up to 12 days post-irradiation. Results: The mortality of mites at 5 and 40 kJ/m2 was 26% and 92%, respectively. Mite mortality reached 98% at 80 kJ/m2. The effect of exposure duration on mortality was minimal. The effect of irradiation on egg hatchability was even more significant than that on adult mite mortality, i.e. about 100% egg mortality at an accumulated dose of as little as 5 kJ/m2 for each exposure time. Conclusions: A high rate of mite mortality and lethal egg damage were observed after less than 1 min of exposure to 5 mJ UV-C pulsed irradiation at 60 Hz. Pending further developments (such as beam steering, beam shaping and miniaturisation) and feasibility studies (such as testing with mites in real-life situations), the reported results and characteristics of the UV-C generator (modulation of energy output and adaptability to varying spot sizes) open up the use of this technology for a vast field of acaricidal applications that require long-range radiation.

TI  - Distinct roles of two histone methyltransferases in transmitting h3k36me3-based epigenetic memory across generations in caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 210
IS  - 3
SP  - 969-982
AB  - Epigenetic information contributes to proper gene expression and development, and can be transmitted not only through mitotic divisions but also from parents to progeny. We investigated the roles in epigenetic inheritance of MES-4 and MET-1, the two Caenorhabditis elegans enzymes that methylate H3K36 (histone H3 Lys 36). Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed immunostaining results showing that both MES-4 and MET-1 catalyze H3K36me3. In the adult germline, MES-4 is enriched in the distal mitotic zone and MET-1 is enriched in the meiotic pachytene zone. Embryos inherit H3K36me3-marked chromosomes from both the oocyte and sperm, and a maternal load of MES-4 and MET-1. Maternal MES-4 quickly associates with sperm chromosomes; that association requires that the sperm chromosomes bear H3K36me3, suggesting that MES-4 is recruited to chromosomes by preexisting H3K36me3. In embryos that inherit H3K36me3-positive oocyte chromosomes and H3K36me3-negative sperm chromosomes, MES-4 and H3K36me3 are maintained on only a subset of chromosomes until at least the 32-cell stage, likely because MES-4 propagates H3K36me3 on regions of the genome with preexisting H3K36me3. In embryos lacking MES-4, H3K36me3 levels on chromosomes drop precipitously postfertilization. In contrast to the relatively high levels of MES-4 in early-stage embryos, MET-1 levels are low at early stages and start increasing by the ~26-cell stage, consistent with expression from the zygotic genome. Our findings support the model that MET-1 mediates transcription-coupled H3K36me3 in the parental germline and transcriptionally active embryos, and that MES-4 transmits an epigenetic memory of H3K36me3 across generations and through early embryo cell divisions by maintaining inherited patterns of H3K36me3. © 2018 Kreher et al.

TI  - Transgenerational impact of environmental change
VL  - 1200
SP  - 71-+
AB  - The ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions is critical for any species to survive. Many environmental changes occur too rapidly for an organism’s genome to adapt in time. Accordingly, being able to modify either its own phenotype, or the phenotype of its offspring to better suit future anticipated environmental conditions could afford an organism a significant advantage. However, a range of animal models and human epidemiological data sets are now showing that environmental factors such as changes in the quality or quantity of an individual’s diet, temperature, stress or exposure to pollutants can all adversely affect the quality of parental gametes, the development of the preimplantation embryo and the health and wellbeing of offspring over multiple generations. This chapter will examine transgenerational effects of both maternal and paternal environmental factors on offspring development and wellbeing in both human and animal model studies. Changes in the epigenetic status of either parental or grand-parental gametes provide one candidate mechanism through which the impacts of environmental experience can be passed from one generation to another. This chapter will therefore also focus on the impact of parental and grand-parental diet on epigenetic transgenerational inheritance and offspring phenotype. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

VL  - 43

AB  - In today's world, global problems such as a shortage of fossil fuel energy, environmental pollution, and global warming are becoming increasingly serious. For the development of human society, sustainability is particularly important. Energy is the basis for human survival and promotes the development of human society. However, rapid growth in population and the global economy has led to a significant increase in energy demand. At the same time, extensive use of fossil fuels has polluted the environment and led to a shortage of fossil energy. Currently, with the continuous increase in energy consumption and development of human society, there is a pressing need to develop energy storage technology. Latent heat storage, using phase change materials that play a vital role in the field of energy storage, has been widely accepted as an effective way to improve heat energy utilization. Phase change materials provide a type of thermal energy storage that can store a large amount of latent heat through physical phase change. This heat is then released in a controlled manner within a small temperature change based on thermal energy requirements. At present, phase change materials have important applications in aerospace, industrial and agricultural production, building materials, energy and power, textile materials, highway transportation, and engine technology. Most current research on phase change materials focuses on medium- and low-temperature materials, especially those materials whose phase change temperature is lower than 100 ℃. There is less research on high-temperature phase change materials owing to the encapsulation and corrosion of such materials. The problem of performance is difficult to solve, yet high temperature phase change materials are in urgent need in some extreme high temperature environments. High-temperature phase change materials (HTPCM) can control thermal energy under extremely high temperatures. They have important prospects for application in the fields of thermal protection and thermal management in high-temperature environments such as aerospace, solar energy, etc. The microencapsulation of phase change materials can solve the problem of melt exudation of these materials during the phase change process, improve the environmental adaptability of these materials, and expand their applications. This article mainly reviewed the preparation and application of HTPCM above 300 ℃. The classification of phase change materials, the method of synthesis of microcapsules, and the preparation of high temperature microcapsules were discussed. Through research, it is found that fluoride microcapsules, with their high melting point and enthalpy value, are a promising material in the field of HTPCMs. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Biogas driven multigeneration integrated with simultaneous charging-discharging type thermal energy storage system
VL  - 270
AB  - This work presents a novel and sustainable solution based on combined heat and power (CHP) system integrated with a simultaneous charging-discharging type thermal energy storage tank. The multi-generation system uses biogas as the heat source and is analyzed from the thermodynamic, exergoeconomic, and environmental perspectives. The proposed configuration aims to meet the electrical requirements of a cluster of 20 villages, greenhouse heating, and hot air production for agricultural drying applications. The exhaust gases from the biogas fired turbine are utilized to power a recompression supercritical CO2 and steam Rankine cycle. The additional surplus heat is stored inside a simultaneous charging/discharging type thermal storage tank that provides favorable conditions (50–55 °C) for biogas producing microorganisms to maximizing gas production. The meso-erythritol (sugar alcohol) is used as a phase change material due to its high latent heat and large supercooling (&gt;60 °C), suitable for the present applications. The PCM is characterized on heat flux Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermophysical properties are evaluated. Further, the exergoeconomic analysis is presented to examine the economic viability of the system which serves as a holistic solution for rural power generation. It is found that the total product unit cost of the system is 12.96 $/GJ and operating charges are 140.5 $/h. The proposed multigenerational system promises a Levelized cost of electricity at 5 ¢ /kWh. The net overall electricity generated by the system is 1432 kW and provides 200 kW of space thermal heating. In addition, hot air is produced at the rate of 9720 kg/h for different agricultural drying applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Gradual, temperature-induced change of secondary sexual characteristics in Trichogramma pretiosum infected with parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia
VL  - 2019
IS  - 8
AB  - Intersex is an intermediate stage of sexual differentiation in insects. Determining intersex morphology and the cause of its production will aid in the understanding of the mechanism of sexual differentiation in insects. In this paper, Wolbachia-infected Trichogramma pretiosum (T. preW(+)) that shows thelytokous parthenogenesis were used as subjects. In order to determine the causes of the T. preW(+) intersex and the influence of parental generation temperature on gradual changes in secondary masculinization in intersex offspring, we examined the occurrence of intersex offspring (F-1 and F-2 generation) after the parental generations were treated with high temperature (27, 29, 31, and 33 degrees C) and described the external morphology of the intersexes. The results showed that the T. preW(+) parental generation temperature is positively correlated with the probability of intersex offspring. The probability of F-1 intersex is significantly higher than that of F-2 intersex in different high temperature. The degree of secondary masculinization in T. preW+ intersexes increases as parental generation temperature increases. In addition, our study first identified 11 intersex types in T. preW(+) and found that the primary and secondary sexual characteristics showed a regular distribution. We also found that the D type and H type of intersex have the highest frequency of appearance. The external genitalia of most intersexes were female, and only three intersex types have male external genitalia. Conclusions were ultimately obtained: Wolbachia is a direct factor that causes the occurrence of intersexes, while high temperature is an indirect factor that determines the external morphology of intersexes. The effects of high temperature on T. preW(+) intersexes is passed through the parental generation to offspring, and this maternal effect weakens as the number of generations increases. In T. preW(+) intersex individuals, most exhibit female primary sexual characteristics, and secondary sexual characteristics exhibit signs of masculinization.

TI  - Effects of Temperature on the Growth and Survival of Reciprocal Hybrids of Two Oyster Species, Crassostrea Gigas and Crassostrea Angulata
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 29-36
AB  - The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is one of the most commonly cultured oysters worldwide due to its fast growth rate, high disease resistance, and strong environmental adaptability. However, large-scale summer mortalities of Pacific oyster have been reported in many major production areas, and the economic impacts of these mortalities are often serious. High temperature is considered to be an important factor in summer mortality. Crossbreeding has been observed to improve the stress tolerance of shellfish, including against high temperature stress. This study evaluated the effects of temperature on the growth and survival of two hybrid groups (Crassostrea gigas♀ × C. angulata♂ (GA) and C. angulata♀ × C. gigas♂ (AG)) and two inbred groups (C. gigas♀ × C. gigas♂ (GG) and C. angulata♀× C. angulata♂ (AA)). The LT50 was calculated using Probit analysis, survival rates, daily growth rates, and heterosis of juvenile oysters, which were measured at five temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, and 32 ℃). Our results revealed that the sublethal temperature was 37.5 ℃ for GA and AG and 37.0 ℃ for GG and AA, whereas the lethal temperature of GA was 44.0 ℃, and that of AG, GG, and AA was 43.5 ℃. The LT50 values of GA, AG, AA, and GG were 42.48 ℃, 41.94 ℃, 41.63 ℃, and 41.55 ℃, respectively. The respective optimal temperatures for survival and growth of different crosses were as follows: 16–28 ℃ and 20–28 ℃ for GA; 16– 28 ℃ and 20–28 ℃ for AG; 20–28 ℃ and 20–28 ℃ for GG; and 24–28 ℃ and 24–28 ℃ for AA. Growth and survival heterosis were positive for two juvenile hybrids at all temperatures. At 20 ℃, GA had the largest growth heterosis, and the mid-parent heterosis H and single-parent heterosis HAGwere 35.1 and 38.8, respectively, whereas the maximum single-parent heterosis HGAwas 43.4 at 32 ℃. The mid-parent heterosis H was 28.4 at 16 ℃, whereas the single-parent heterosis HGAand HAGvalues were 21.5 and 36.4, respectively. The mid-parent heterosis H was 42.2 at 32 ℃, and the single-parent heterosis HGAand HAGwere 72.7 and 20, respectively. Overall, the thermotolerance of juvenile hybrids was greater than that of the two parental species, and the hybrids exhibited obvious growth heterosis and survival advantage. Among these groups, GA showed the best growth and survival performances. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - PxTret1-like Affects the Temperature Adaptability of a Cosmopolitan Pest by Altering Trehalose Tissue Distribution
VL  - 23
IS  - 16
AB  - Global warming poses new challenges for insects to adapt to higher temperatures. Trehalose is the main blood sugar in insects and plays an important role in energy metabolism and stress resistance. The transmembrane transport of trehalose mainly depends on the trehalose transporter (TRET1). Plutella xylostella (L.) is a worldwide agricultural pest; however, the effects of the trehalose transport mechanism and trehalose distribution in tissues on the development, reproduction and temperature adaptation of P. xylostella have yet to be reported. In this study, PxTret1-like was cloned and analyzed regarding its expression pattern. It was found that the expression of PxTret1-like was affected by ambient temperature. The knockout mutation of PxTret1-like was generated using a CRISPR/Cas9 system by targeted knockout. The trehalose content and trehalase activity of mutant P. xylostella increased at different developmental stages. The trehalose content increased in the fat body of the fourth-instar P. xylostella, and decreased in the hemolymph, and there was no significant change in glucose in the fat body and hemolymph. Mutant strains of P. xylostella showed a significantly reduced survival rate, fecundity and ability to withstand extreme temperatures. The results showed that PxTret1-like could affect the development, reproduction and temperature adaptability of P. xylostella by regulating the trehalose content in the fat body and hemolymph. © 2022 by the authors.
