AB  - In the Brazilian stingless bee, Scaptotrigona postica, social thermoregulation was studied. Intranidal temperature was recorded in different parts of the nest and related to changes in ambient temperature. In addition, cooling and overheating experiments were carried out using colonies in laboratory observation hives. The brood chamber is the warmest part of the nest, well insulated by a multi-layered involucrum. In the brood nest 32 ± 3° C were measured. In case of low aerial temperature the bees are capable of heating up the brood combs by mass incubation. In addition, cold spots around the brood chamber are insulated by covering with cerumen, and the entrance is more or less closed. Overheating of the brood is reduced by accelerated and aligned fanning and withdrawal of all the bees from the combs. Any direct cooling by evaporation of water could not be observed and probably is not needed in natural nests of Sc. postica which are built in trunk cavities of old trees in the neotropical rain forest. The importance of temperature homeostasis in the nest of stingless bees with perennial colonies and permanent brooding activity in tropical climate and a hypothesis on the evolution of thermoregulation in the highly eusocial Meliponidae and Apidae are discussed. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

SP  - 299-319
AB  - The highly conserved heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a decisive role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during growth and survival under normal conditions, as well as upon exposure to diverse stress stimuli. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract has been evolutionary, adapting to survive in an unusual microenvironment exposed to numerous chemical, physical, inflammatory or pharmacological insults. The mucosal barrier is the first line of defense against insults derived from ingested foods and pathogens and consists of a complex network of immunological and non-immunological mechanisms that underlie the discrimination between potentially harmful and beneficial microorganisms, the defense against environmental insults and the absorption and utilization of nutrients. Among these mechanisms, the production of cytoprotective stress proteins, such as the Hsps, is of major importance for the optimal functioning of the entire organism. The intestinal microflora, via bacterial-derived factors including short chain fatty acids or lipopolysaccharides, cytokines and the myoelectrical activity of the gut play a regulatory role in the constitutive and induced expression of Hsps in the intestinal epithelial cells, mainly those of the colon and the stomach. The interplay between physiologically expressed Hsps and pro-and/or anti-inflammatory mediators confers selective cytoprotection, primarily aiming at the restitution of the damaged epithelium, the preservation of barrier function and the regulation of the inflammatory response. Under pathophysiological conditions, in GI injury and during drug therapy, the expression of various Hsps appears to be a crucial adaptive and protective process, in both experimental animal models and human studies. For example, Hsps of many pathogenic bacteria including Helicobacter pylori often serve as essential molecules for their adhesion to the intestinal mucosa, thus participating in the host inflammatory response. Moreover, the induction of molecular chaperones which are present in normal epithelial cells has been associated with a number of GI disorders. Since Hsps play a central role in protecting cellular homeostatic processes in all cells, from bacterial to human, the understanding of the interplay between Hsps originating from the gut flora and the host tissues could lead to the evaluation of modulators of cytoprotective Hsps as potentially therapeutic interventions in intestinal injuries, such as inflammatory bowel disease, infections and cancer. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Three Japanese natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster were transferred to laboratory cages and kept at three temperature conditions (25°C constant, 20~30°C fluctuating and 18°C constant). Their chromosomal variation was examined after about 20 months. Polymorphic inversions found at high frequency in nature were almost eliminated from the cage populations at 25°C and 20~30°C condition, and were in the process of being eliminated at 18°C. The elimination of the polymorphic inversions was also confirmed in the periodical monitor of cage populations. Inversions were disadvantageous compared to the standard chromosomes in laboratory cages, and the selection coefficient of the average inversion was found to be 0.05 or 0.06 for the heterozygotes and 0.10 or 0.12 for the homozygotes. The direct estimates of fitness components showed that the inversion chromosomes had various selective values in productivity but they had relatively constant selective values in viability which might result in the elimination of inversions. The frequency of unique (newly occurring) inversions in cage populations was equal to that found in nature, 0.0026 per major autosome arm per generation. © 1979, The Genetics Society of Japan.

VL  - 55
IS  - 2
SP  - 354-375
AB  - From 1989 to 1996, barbel in the River Ourthe started spawning under variable environmental conditions, except for water temperature. Each year, spawning was initiated when water daily minimum temperature reached or exceeded 13.5 degrees C. Any decrease of temperature below this value later in the spawning period caused spawning to be suspended. Analyses of offspring growth provided evidence that 13.5 degrees C was the value below which 0+ barbel stop growing. It was hypothesized that barbel trade off the lower initial probability of survival against a larger size at the onset of winter. To test empirically for this hypothesis, the adequacy of alternative-theoretical-strategies associated with other thermal thresholds (12, 15.0, 17.1 and 20.2 degrees C) was modelled with respect to: (1) the feasibility of spawning (inhibition of sexual maturation by a decreasing photoperiod): (2) the impact of the temperature on embryonic development; (3) the effect of water level variations on the integrity of spawning grounds until the emergence of larvae; (4) the size of the offspring at the onset of winter. On an 8-year (1989-1996) average, the present spawning strategy would have produced a higher recruitment than alternative strategies (relative adequacy of 33.23, 85.64, 93.17 and 17.62%, respectively). However, alternative strategies would have produced better annual scores on five of eight occasions in the River Ourthe environment. and a better overall score in environments 1.5 or 3.5 degrees C warmer than now. The consistency of the thermal threshold over years, despite a low selection pressure by the environment, was interpreted as the expression of a phenotypic mechanism (thermal homing) promoting the selection of the lowest efficient thermal threshold, and enabling breeders to relay to the next generation some form of thermal stability in a variable environment.

AB  - Genetic Algorithms (GA) are adaptive search algorithms based on the theory of natural selection and survival of the fittest. In this study, GA was used to derive a thermal compact model of a micro lead frame package. The GA derived model was then used to compute the junction temperature (Tj) of the package for various boundary conditions. The results obtained were checked against simulation results of a detailed thermal model and were found to be within τ 1.5% of error. Computational time taken by the detailed finite element model required approximately 4 min whereas the GA derived model took less than 35 s to generate the Tj of the package. Further, the study shows the feasibility and potential of applying GA as a powerful tool for optimization. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are responsible for nearly 50% of all common cold infections. Ordinarily, HRV infections are mild and self-limiting; nonetheless, every year they result in significant loss of economic productivity and substantial inappropriate antibiotic use. Development of effective vaccine and antiviral prophylaxis against HRV has been hampered by the extensive antigenic diversity present among the nearly 100 serotypes. To gain new insights into the evolutionary processes that create the genetic diversity present among HRVs, we tested for recombination and selection for individual genes and the coding genome for 45 HRV serotypes using estimated phylogenetic relationships. Although the structural capsid genes and nonstructural genes recovered incongruent tree topologies, no recombination was detected using substitution methods. Therefore, the coding genome was determined to be appropriate for phylogenetic tests. Results of the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test support the hypothesis that the capsid genes recover a different evolutionary history than the nonstructural genes. Our best phylogenetic estimate based on the coding genome suggests that HRV-B is more closely related to enterovirus than to HRV-A; however, several alternative phylogenetic hypotheses were not rejected by the SH test. Positive selection was examined by using two different approaches; d(N)/d(S) rate ratio and the physicochemical phenotypes for 31 amino acid properties. Analyses using d(N)/d(S) failed to detect positive selection. However, protein phenotypic expression appears to be a more sensitive approach. There was extensive stabilizing and destabilizing positive selection in HRV-A major and HRV-B serotypes for all proteins, except in 3A in HRV-B, which overlapped with functional, structural, and to a greater extent in uncharacterized genomic regions. In contrast, the evolution of HRV-A minor serotypes appears to be driven primarily by destabilizing selection. Our results demonstrate that HRV-A major, HRV-A minor, and HRV-B serotypes have not been similarly influenced by purifying selection.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effects of season and lines on age at sexual maturity, body weight at sexual maturity and some egg yield traits in 11 generations of selected Japanese quail. The material used in this research was selected from high (HL) or low (LL) body weight Japanese quail lines according to 5-week body weights and their random bred control line and layer line (L) for 120 d egg production. Average egg weight was the lowest in summer and in LL line, which also had lowest total egg number, total egg weight and hen day egg production. Maximum eggs were produced by L line, while heaviest eggs were produced by HL line. The highest and lowest ages at sexual maturity were determined in winter and summer seasons, respectively. Also, the heaviest first egg weight was found in winter season. It is concluded that lines and seasons generally affected quail egg production. © GSP, India.

TI  - A statistical-mechanical study of evolution of robustness: An approach from two-temperature models
VL  - 197
AB  - Recently we proposed a simple statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins for studying evolutional process in biological system. In our model, a configuration of spins and their interactions J represent a phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a stochastic process with temperature TS under a fixed Hamiltonian with J. Meanwhile, the evolution of J is also stochastic with temperature TJ and follows mutations introduced into J and selection based on a fitness given by equilibrium spin configurations of a given set of target spins. Using Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that frustration around the target spins is strongly suppressed for the interactions J evolved in the intermediate T S temperature region. The evolved J's give the funnel-like dynamics and show robustness to mutations. This model can be regarded as an extension of partial annealing model, in which the interactions between spins are dynamical variables with characteristic time scale widely separated from that of the spins. We also discuss the partially annealed Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model by particularly paying attention to the frustration. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Natural freeze-tolerance in hatchling painted turtles?
VL  - 134
IS  - 2
SP  - 233-246
AB  - Hatchlings of the North American painted turtle (Family Emydidae: Chrysemys picta) typically spend their first winter of life inside a shallow, subterranean hibernaculum (the natal nest) where life-threatening conditions of ice and cold commonly occur. Although a popular opinion holds that neonates exploit a tolerance for freezing to survive the rigors of winter, hatchlings are more likely to withstand exposure to ice and cold by avoiding freezing altogether - and to do so without the benefit of an antifreeze. In the interval between hatching by turtles in late summer and the onset of wintery weather in November or December, the integument of the animals becomes highly resistant to the penetration of ice into body compartments from surrounding soil, and the turtles also purge their bodies of catalysts for the formation of ice. These two adjustments, taken together, enable the animals to supercool to temperatures below those that they routinely experience in nature. However, cardiac function in hatchlings is diminished at subzero temperatures, thereby compromising the delivery of oxygen to peripheral tissues and eliciting an increase in reliance by those tissues on anaerobic metabolism for the provision of ATP. The resulting increase in production of lactic acid may disrupt acid/base balance and lead to death even in animals that remain unfrozen. Although an ability to undergo supercooling may be key to survival by overwintering turtles in northerly populations, a similar capacity to resist inoculation and undergo supercooling characterizes animals from a population near the southern limit of distribution, where winters are relatively benign. Thus, the suite of characters enabling hatchlings to withstand exposure to ice and cold may have been acquired prior to the northward dispersal of the species at the end of the Pleistocene, and the characters may not have originated as adaptations specifically to the challenges of winter. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

VL  - 109

SP  - 342-352
AB  - Field phenologies of high- (ca. 1500 m) and low- (ca. 500 m) altitude populations of the two most common European species of dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea, differ quite markedly due to differences in climate. To differentiate genetic adaptation due to natural selection and phenotypic plasticity, I compared standard life history characters of pairs of high- and low-altitude populations from three disjunctive sites in Switzerland in a laboratory experiment. The F1 rearing environment did not affect any of the variables of the F2 generation with which all experiments were conducted; hence, there were no carry-over or maternal effects. In Sc. stercoraria, high-altitude individuals were smaller but laid larger eggs; the latter may be advantageous in the more extreme (i.e. more variable and less predictable) high-altitude climate. Higher rearing temperature strongly decreased development time, body size and the size difference between males and females (males are larger), produced female-biased sex ratios and led to suboptimal adult emergence rates. Several of these variables also varied among the three sites, producing some interactions complicating the patterns. In Se. cynip sen, high-altitude females were marginally smaller, less long-lived and laid fewer clutches. Higher rearing temperature strongly decreased development time and body size but tended to increase the size difference between males and females (males are smaller); it also increased clutch size but decreased physiological longevity. Again, interpretation is complicated by variation across sites and some significant interactions. Overall, genetic adaptation to high-altitude conditions appears weak, probably prevented by substantial gene flow, and may be swamped by the effects of other geographic variables among populations. In contrast, phenotypic plasticity is extensive. This may be due to selection of flexible, multi-purpose genotypes. The results suggest that differences in season length between high- and low-altitude locations alone do not explain well the patterns of variation in phenology and body size.

TI  - Evaluation of chili rootstocks for grafted sweet pepper production during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons in Taiwan
VL  - 767
SP  - 151-157
AB  - Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum, L.) production during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons in the lowland tropics is constrained by high temperature, flooding, and root diseases. AVRDC has developed a grafting technology for tomato production during the hot summer season and is now accepted by a growing number of farmers in Southeast Asia. Similar technology is being developed for sweet pepper to enhance yield and improve quality under flooding. Since 2002, several chili pepper lines from a wide collection including wild species were identified to have tolerance to flooding. In 2003, screening was expanded with the goal of identifying chili pepper lines for production in flood-prone areas or for use as rootstocks for sweet pepper production during the hot-wet season, when market prices are profitable. Selected lines from C. baccatum, C. frutescens and C. chacoense were most tolerant to flooding damage with survival rate greater than 45%. In 2004, 23 accessions were selected to evaluate outstanding lines as rootstocks for sweet pepper production during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons. Significant correlations (P < 0.01) were detected among plant traits during both seasons. Most traits were negatively correlated with disease incidence indicating that resistance to disease may be enhanced by taller plant stature, larger rootstock stem diameter and higher root number. Significant differences in yield were observed among rootstocks in both seasons. Mean yield during the hot-dry season was 50% higher than the hot-wet season. This study has identified promising lines of chili rootstock for production of grafted sweet pepper during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons in the lowland tropics.

TI  - Experimentally manipulated growth rate in threespine sticklebacks: Assessing trade offs with developmental stability
VL  - 63
IS  - 1
SP  - 67-78
AB  - The evolution of 'adaptive' growth rate and its influence on how other life history traits evolve is a neglected topic in biology. Growth rate influences life history because size strongly influences age-specific survival and fecundity, and because growth rate defines the relationship between age and size. Improved predictions about the evolution of life history traits may be possible with a greater understanding of the factors that influence the evolution of growth rate. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that a trade off may exist between growth rate and developmental stability in freshwater threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. We compared the degree of developmental instability (measured as fluctuating asymmetry = FA) in four lateral plate and two fin traits of fish reared under a high vs. low growth regime in response to food ration and temperature. We found evidence that symmetry was reduced (FA increased) in fast growing compared to slow growing fish, suggesting that a trade off between developmental stability and growth is possible. FA plausibly reflected developmental instability because of significant associations between rank FA levels across traits in individuals. These results are preliminary because of the possible confounding effects of temperature and food ration on asymmetry, and because we do not know if this trade off has fitness or other life history consequences. Our results also do not support the hypothesis of honest signaling sometimes invoked in studies of sexual selection because greater symmetry was found under poorer rather than better resource levels.

AB  - The effect of competition between incompatible and compatible pollen grains on the seed production of white clover was studied. Stigmatic receptivity was also studied. A selection line of white clover that has red leaves was used as a pollen donor and as a genetic marker to allow determination of the pollen donor responsible for ovule fertilisation. Results show that incompatible pollen did not inhibit compatible pollen grains from fertilising ovules and producing seeds, although it did slightly impair seed yield. At temperatures of 20/10 degrees C (day/night) stigmas of white clover remained receptive to additional pollination up to 32 h after an initial compatible pollination and 40 h after an incompatible pollination. The results imply that factors other than inadequate pollination and the self-incompatibility system are responsible for failure of white clover to attain its potential seed yield.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is the primitive character state for most if not all traits. Insofar as developmental and physiological processes obey the laws of chemistry and physics, they will be sensitive to such environmental variables as temperature, nutrient supply, ionic environment, and the availability of various macro- and micronutrients. Depending on the effect this phenotypic plasticity has on fitness, evolution may proceed to select either for mechanisms that buffer or canalize the phenotype against relevant environmental variation or for a modified plastic response in which some ranges of the phenotypic variation are adaptive to particular environments. Phenotypic plasticity can be continuous, in which case it is called a reaction norm, or discontinuous, in which case it is called a polyphenism. Although the morphological discontinuity of some polyphenisms is produced by discrete developmental switches, most polyphenisms are due to discontinuities in the environment that induce only portions of what is in reality a continuous reaction norm. In insect polyphenisms, the environmental variable that induces the alternative phenotype is a token stimulus that serves as a predictor of, but is not itself, the environment to which the polyphenism is an adaptation. In all cases studied so far, the environmental stimulus alters the endocrine mechanism of metamorphosis by altering either the pattern of hormone secretion or the pattern of hormone sensitivity in different tissues. Such changes in the patterns of endocrine interactions result in the execution of alternative developmental pathways. The spatial and temporal compartmentalization of endocrine interactions has produced a developmental mechanism that enables substantial localized changes in morphology that remain well integrated into the structure and function of the organism.

TI  - Evolution of the Yellow/Major Royal Jelly Protein family and the emergence of social behavior in honey bees
VL  - 16
IS  - 11
SP  - 1385-1394
AB  - The genomic architecture underlying the evolution of insect social behavior is largely a mystery. Eusociality, defined by overlapping generations, parental brood care, and reproductive division of labor, has most commonly evolved in the Hymenopteran insects, including the honey bee Apis mellifera. In this species, the Major Royal Jelly Protein (MRJP) family is required for all major aspects of eusocial behavior. Here, using data obtained from the A. mellifera genome sequencing project, we demonstrate that the MRJP family is encoded by nine genes arranged in an ∼60-kb tandem array. Furthermore, the MRJP protein family appears to have evolved from a single progenitor gene that encodes a member of the ancient Yellow protein family. Five genes encoding Yellow-family proteins flank the genomic region containing the genes encoding MRJPs. We describe the molecular evolution of these protein families. We then characterize developmental-stage-specific, sex-specific, and caste-specific expression patterns of the mrjp and yellow genes in the honey bee. We review empirical evidence concerning the functions of Yellow proteins in fruit flies and social ants, in order to shed light on the roles of both Yellow and MRJP proteins in A. mellifera. In total, the available evidence suggests that Yellows and MRJPs are multifunctional proteins with diverse, context-dependent physiological and developmental roles. However, many members of the Yellow/MRJP family act as facilitators of reproductive maturation. Finally, it appears that MRJP protein subfamily evolution from the Yellow protein family may have coincided with the evolution of honey bee eusociality. ©2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

TI  - Evaluation of temperature-selection differences among juvenile muskellunge originating from different latitudes
VL  - 79
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-98
AB  - Genetic differences among muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations are related to residence in major river drainages, suggesting the existence of divergent stocks. By use of radio-telemetry we compared different seasonal and diel temperature selection in a southern Illinois reservoir for three geographically and genetically distinct stocks of age-2 muskellunge from throughout the latitudinal range of the species. Muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi River drainage were represented by the Leech Lake, Minnesota, population and the Ohio River drainage was represented by the Cave Run Lake, Kentucky, population. Progeny from North Spring Lake, Illinois, an interstock, or mixed-origin stock, were also evaluated. No differences in temperature selection were observed among stocks of juvenile muskellunge across seasons or diel periods. The seasonal mean temperatures of the water varied significantly-spring 21.7°C, summer 28.4°C, and fall 14.8°C, with an overall average temperature of 24.1°C, in agreement with previously published values obtained in laboratory trials. This lack of different temperature-selection patterns among stocks is in contrast with other life-history characteristics, for example growth, metabolism, and conversion efficiency, which have been shown to differ among populations and stocks. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 27
IS  - 2
SP  - 145-155
AB  - By means of crosses with the African Migratory locust it has been demonstrated that various strains carry different segregations of genes which quantitatively condition the formation of chiasmata during meiosis. These genes occur in polygenic series, and in one low frequency strain the polygenes show an epistatic effect for low chiasma frequency, while another low frequency strain seems to have attained this property through gamma radiation. In reciprocal crosses between the lastnamed low and a medium frequency strain there appears to be a maternal effect, with heterosis and epistasis respectively in the reciprocal crosses. In one strain two lines were selected for plasticity and non-plasticity of hopper colour change in small populations, and this selection has resulted in multiple changes in that the two lines now diverge in the three main physical criteria of phase transformation, viz. hopper colour, adult morphometric ratios and chiasma frequencies; one line is now solitarious for these characteristics, the other more gregarious. The genotypes selected out could be related to the ability to utilize the gregarization pheromone. A 10° rise in temperature above 22° C has the effect of increasing chiasma frequencies significantly, but increase in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has no effect. Male and female hoppers produce equivalent amounts of the chiasma-inducing pheromone, while solitarised hoppers do not lose the ability to produce this pheromone. The crucial stage for the action of this pheromone on chromosomes is during the fifth nymphal instar. The phase status of parents appears to affect chiasma frequencies in the offspring, more specifically that of the mother, so that there is further evidence of maternal effect on chiasma frequency. © 1969 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - 55 million years of continuous anatexis in Central Iberia: Single-zircon dating of the Peña Negra Complex
VL  - 161
IS  - 2
SP  - 255-263
AB  - Single-zircon evaporation and ion-microprobe dating of migmatites and anatectic granites in the Peña Negra Complex of Central Iberia reveal that the Variscan anatexis occurred continuously from 352 to 297 Ma, with a maximum at 335-305 Ma. Anatexis began coeval with the main collision of continental masses. A limited melting event, probably related to syncollision crustal-scale shear zones, produced a population of zircons with ages of c. 350 Ma. The production of new zircons decreased to a minimum at c. 343 Ma but then increased swiftly as the internal thermal evolution of the thickened Central Iberian crust led to widespread anatexis in the Peña Negra region at 332 Ma. Shortly after this, the melt resident in the migmatites was locally segregated into small bodies that crystallized as cordierite leucogranites at 321 Ma. Simultaneously, extensional subhorizontal shear zones were preferentially developed over layers of the migmatite series that, owing to their elevated heat production and fertility, had the highest melt fraction. Shearing provoked further anatexis and contributed significantly to the in situ production of high melt-fraction granodiorites and adamellites from the migmatites. This process occurred from 325 to 305 Ma, with a maximum at 309 Ma marking the peak of the Variscan extensional collapse in Central Iberia. After c. 305 Ma the melt fraction decreased quickly, so that the production of new zircons was insignificant at 300 Ma and had stopped completely by 297 Ma.

TI  - Immune function, parasitization and extended phenotypes in colour polymorphic pygmy grasshoppers
VL  - 85
IS  - 3
SP  - 373-383
AB  - Ecological and evolutionary consequences of host-parasite interactions have attracted considerable attention from evolutionary biologists. Previous studies have suggested that immune responsiveness may be genetically or developmentally linked with colour pattern, such that the evolution of animal colour patterns may be influenced by correlated responses to selection for parasite resistance. We studied interactions between the endoparasitic fly Leiophora innoxia (Meigen) (Diptera: Tachinidae) and its colour polymorphic pygmy grasshopper host Tetrix undulata (Sow.) (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) to test for morph-specific differences in parasitization and immune defence, and host-induced variation in parasite phenotypes. Our results revealed that c. 2 and 30% of adult grasshoppers collected from the same natural population in two subsequent years, respectively were parasitized. Parasite prevalence was independent of host sex and colour morph. Pupae were larger if the parasite had developed in a female than in a male host, possibly reflecting host resource value or a physical constraint on larval growth imposed by host body size. Pupal size was also associated with host colour morph, with individuals that had developed in dark morphs being smaller at pupation compared to those that developed in paler morphs. However, immune defence, measured as the encapsulation response to a novel antigen, did not differ among individuals belonging to alternative colour morphs or sexes. Darker morphs warm up more quickly and prefer higher body temperatures than paler ones. Encapsulation was not influenced by maintenance temperature (15 vs. 30 degrees C), however, suggesting that indirect effects of coloration on parasite resistance mediated via differential body temperature are unlikely. The dependence of parasite body size on host colour morph may thus reflect plasticity of growth and development of the larvae in response to differential host body temperature, rather than variable host immune defence.

TI  - Adaptation of Drosophila to temperature extremes: Bringing together quantitative and molecular approaches
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 175-216
AB  - Although adaptation of Drosophila to thermal extremes has been investigated for many years, only recently has much progress been made in identifying the genetic and physiological basis of evolutionary shifts in thermoresistance. Here we examine the way the Drosophila research has been used to understand the evolution of plastic responses, tradeoffs and limits to selection, and to develop links between laboratory studies and adaptive shifts leading to population and species differences. Several methods have been devised to rapidly measure heat and cold resistance, but the relevance of these-measures to selection pressures in nature remains largely unknown. Plastic responses to thermal extremes are usually. divided into short-term exposures to sub-lethal conditions or into longer-term exposures (often referred to as hardening and acclimation respectively). Hardening responses appear to have costs associated with the expression of a heat shock protein (Hsp70). Costs of acclimation are more difficult to identify because exposing Drosophila to suboptimal conditions for a long time can have deleterious effects unrelated to the acclimation response. Quantitative genetic analyses have revealed genetic variation for thermoresistance under laboratory conditions, but variation under natural conditions has rarely been identified. In a few cases selection responses within laboratory populations have been linked to specific candidate genes and physiological mechanisms. Population comparisons have provided evidence for clinal variation in thermoresistance traits, although many studies lack power because only a few populations have. been considered. Clinal patterns in candidate genes have also been demonstrated. However evidence for direct selection for thermoresistance and for the involvement of specific genes under natural conditions is mostly lacking. Clinal responses to-c old extremes can involve changes in diapause strategies and altered patterns of reproduction. Inbreeding influences thermoresistance and acclimation responses, but inbreeding effects may be environment-specific. Species differences in heat or in cold resistance commonly match the geographical (climatic) distributions of species. Interspecific differences, for heat resistance are usually smaller than for cold resistance. Drosophila species from the same location can differ markedly for stress resistance, and this may-allow-species to occupy different niches. Rapid progress is likely in the next few years in identifying genes and fraits-underlying variation in stress resistance among populations and species of Prosophila, and in comparing. these findings to those from other taxa.

TI  - A new soybean for human consumption in the tropics
VL  - 58

SP  - 143-147
AB  - Modern technology, especially in animal husbandry, has made remarkable progress. Even with all recent advances in animal reproduction (animal protein), we have not been able to keep pace with the rapid population growth rate in order to meet the demand for protein. This discrepancy in demand and supply for animal protein is even more severe in the tropics. The tradition of producing cereals and legumes to feed animals for conversion to meat (protein) is no longer feasible. Usually, animal proteins have complete profiles of essential amino acids, whereas those of plant origin are deficient in one or more of them. Soybean proteins, however, have about the same nutritional value as those of animals, and it is available for direct consumption by humans at a low cost. Because of the "off" or painty flavor, soybeans were not used for direct human consumption for a long time, except in areas such as China, Japan, Korea and Indonesia. Two major limiting factors for production of soybeans in the tropics are (a) lack of varieties adapted to low latitude and shorter days of the cool season, or to high altitude and low temperatures of the tropics, and (b) lack of varieties that are mild in beany flavor and appropriate for direct human consumption. A cross of the selected soybeans Kahala × Lee 68″ was made at Iguala ISAAEG Research Station. Several lines were selected in the F4 generation with good agronomic and organoleptic properties. The resulting variety has been evaluated from 0 to 40° latitude and in the short growing season of low latitude; results were good. The ISAAEG-BM2 variety of soybean is mild in flavor, and the heat treatment commonly applied to denature antinutritional factors is sufficient to completely eliminate the painty flavor. Details for the synthesis of ISAAEG-BM2 variety and the recommended cultural practices for its maximal yield is discussed. © 1981 American Oil Chemists' Society.

VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SP  - 436-444
AB  - 1. To test the hypothesis that rapid embryogenesis is an adaptation to cold climate, embryonic development time was measured in three oviparous species of Sceloporus that occur at different altitudes: S. woodi (lowland), S. virgatus (intermediate) and S. scalaris (high altitude). 2. Total embryonic development time (TEDT), defined as the time between ovulation to hatching, was measured at the same constant temperature (30-degrees-C) in the laboratory. Mean TEDT was 61.6 days in S. woodi, 55.3 days in S. virgatus, and 45.6 days in S. scalaris. 3. Embryo stages at oviposition, which provide a qualitative assessment of egg retention time, were noted for females ovipositing in laboratory aquaria. S. woodi exhibited brief egg retention, S. virgatus, intermediate egg retention, and S. scalaris, prolonged egg retention. 4. There was an apparent negative correlation between TEDT and elevation, as well as between TEDT and egg retention time. 5. The TEDT of S. jarrovi (56.6 days), a viviparous montane congener, was less than that of S. woodi, indicating that the developmental rate of S. jarrovi embryos was greater than that in a lowland species. 6. Despite differences in thermal characteristics of environments at different elevations, minimum estimates of TEDT in the field for S. woodi, S. virgatus, and S. scalaris were similar. 7. Measures of TEDT in these species of Sceloporus were consistent with the hypothesis that more rapid embryogenesis, like egg retention, acts to reduce the time it takes embryos to develop in cold climates. It is also hypothesized that more rapid development evolves in response to cold climate and is capable of lowering the threshold temperature at which viviparity evolves.

SP  - E701-E712
AB  - Adverse environmental conditions constrain active flight and thereby limit reproduction in most insects. Butterflies have evolved various adaptations in order to thermoregulate, allowing females to search for nectar and to oviposit under unfavorable thermal conditions. We studied experimentally and with observational data the effect of low ambient temperatures experienced in the morning on the timing of oviposition and clutch size in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Comparisons were made between individuals with different forms of the gene Pgi, encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase, since naturally segregating variation at Pgi is known to be correlated with flight metabolic rate, flight performance, and fecundity. Experiencing low temperature in the morning delayed the initiation of oviposition and decreased clutch size. We used a thermal image camera to measure the thoracic surface temperature of butterflies immediately after voluntary flight. Single nucleotide polymorphism at Pgi was associated with thoracic temperature at low ambient temperatures. This has consequences for reproduction because females that are able to fly at lower ambient temperatures generally initiate oviposition earlier in the afternoon, when the environmental conditions are most favorable and the average egg clutch size is generally largest. These results suggest that variation in physiological and molecular capacity to sustain active flight at low ambient temperature has significant fitness-related consequences in insects. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Life history strategies of cladocerans: Comparisons of tropical and temperate taxa
VL  - 542
IS  - 1
SP  - 315-333
AB  - We review recent works on different life history variables of cladoceran taxa in tropical and temperate freshwater bodies, comparing the strategies that cladocerans have evolved to adapt to contrasting environmental conditions in the two geographical regions. These life-history parameters relate to age and size at maturity, survival, fecundity, life-expectancy at birth, lifespan, gross, and net reproductive rates, generation time, the rate of population increase, peak population density and day of peak abundance. We also discuss the role of photoperiod and temperature on some of these life history parameters. We found a general paucity of experimental work and field data in tropics on cladocerans. There is very limited information on the few Daphnia species found in the tropics. The misconception of low species diversity of cladocerans in the tropics arose due to several reasons including lack of extensive and intensive field collections. Higher water temperatures apparently promote permanent infestation of tropical waters with toxic cyanobacteria, which reduce the zooplankton diversity. In addition to higher temperatures in the tropics, the year-round high predation pressure of planktivorous fish probably causes the tropical species, particularly in pelagic habitats, to reach maturity earlier (< 3 days) than in temperate regions. Species of Daphnia in temperate regions are particularly adapted to living at food concentrations that are much lower and seasonably more variable than those for tropical genera such as Diaphanosoma. This is further corroborated by the more than an order of magnitude higher threshold food concentration (TFC) for tropical Cladocera than for their temperate counterparts. Fecundity patterns differ between tropical and temperate cladoceran taxa: cultured under optimal temperature regimes, tropical taxa have fewer eggs than temperate species of a comparable body size. Predation pressure may act differently depending on the size of the cladoceran neonates and thus on their population size structure. Global warming and climate changes seem to affect the behaviour (migration), distribution, and abundance of cladocerans. Apparently, in direct response to these changes, the possibility of encountering the tropical cladocerans in the northern, temperate hemisphere (bioinvasions) is on the rise. © Springer 2005.

VL  - 11

AB  - Climate change brings with it unprecedented rates of increase in environmental temperature, which will have major consequences for the earth's flora and fauna. The Odonata represent a taxon that has many strong links to this abiotic factor due to its tropical evolutionary history and adaptations to temperate climates. Temperature is known to affect odonate physiology including life-history traits such as developmental rate, phenology and seasonal regulation as well as immune function and the production of pigment for thermoregulation. A range of behaviours are likely to be affected which will, in turn, influence other parts of the aquatic ecosystem, primarily through trophic interactions. Temperature may influence changes in geographical distributions, through a shifting of species' fundamental niches, changes in the distribution of suitable habitat and variation in the dispersal ability of species. Finally, such a rapid change in the environment results in a strong selective pressure towards adaptation to cope and the inevitable loss of some populations and, potentially, species. Where data are lacking for odonates, studies on other invertebrate groups will be considered. Finally, directions for research are suggested, particularly laboratory studies that investigate underlying causes of climate-driven macroecological patterns. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 264

SP  - 717-723
AB  - Experiments on life history genetics are usually performed using constant temperature environments in the laboratory. However, the dynamics of insect growth can be influenced profoundly by daily fluctuations in temperature such as those which characterize field environments. We report here on experiments using different stocks and selected lines of a tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, to examine whether genotype-environment interactions occur for three traits describing pre-adult growth. These traits were measured over two pairs of environments differing in mean temperature, each of which had a constant, and a cycling temperature regime. Development time, pupal weight and growth rate show genotype-environment interactions, especially at comparatively low average temperatures. Researchers should, therefore, take care when extrapolating from the form of genetic covariance matrices and 'trade-offs' among life history traits found in constant temperature environments to those likely to occur in nature.

TI  - Transgenic cotton: Factors influencing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regeneration
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
SP  - 37-52
AB  - Various aspects of transformation and regeneration processes were examined in efforts to improve the efficiency of production of transgenic cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) proved to be a valuable tool in elucidating the timing and localization of transient gene expression and in visualizing conversion of transient events to stable transformation events. By day 4 after infection, there was maximal transient activity in the cells at the cut edge of Agrobacterium-infected cotyledon disks. We were able to visualize conversion of some of these events to stable transformation by day 8. The effects of Agrobacterium strains, acetosyringone, and temperature on stable transformation were also evaluated. Strain LBA4404 proved to be significantly better than EHA105. Acetosyringone increased significantly the stable transformation efficiency in cotton. Cocultivation at 21 degreesC, compared to 25 degreesC, consistently resulted in higher transformation frequencies. GFP expression in stably transformed callus was useful in studying the efficiency of selection during early stages of culture. We found that the survival of individual callus lines on selection medium was influenced by their original size and initial transgene expression status. Larger-size calluses and calluses expressing the transgene (GFP) had a higher rate of survival. Survival could be improved by an additional two-week culture on medium high in cytokinin and low in auxin before transfer to a medium to induce embryogenesis. However, this treatment delayed embryogenesis. Various other important aspects of the regeneration process are described and an overall scheme for producing transgenic cotton is presented.

VL  - 96
IS  - 2
SP  - 247-258
AB  - Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 and related strains are adapted to metal contaminated environments. A strong resistance to environmental stressors and adaptation make it ideal strains for survival in decreasing biodiversity conditions and for bioaugmentation purposes in environmental applications. The soil bacterium C. metallidurans is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically on hydrogen and carbon dioxide allowing a strong resilience under conditions lacking organic matter. The biofilm growth on soil particles allows coping with starvation or bad conditions of pH, temperature and pollutants. Its genomic capacity of two megaplasmids encoding several heavy metal resistance operons allowed growth in heavy metal contaminated habitats. In addition its specific siderophores seem to play a role in heavy metal sequestration besides their role in the management of bioavailable iron. Efflux ATPases and RND systems pump the metal cations to the membrane surface where polysaccharides serve as heavy metal binding and nucleation sites for crystallisation of metal carbonates. These polysaccharides contribute also to flotation under specific conditions in a soil-heavy metals-bacteria suspension mixture. An inoculated moving bed sand filter was constructed to treat heavy metal contaminated water and to remove the metals in the form of biomass mixed with metal carbonates. A membrane based contactor allowed to use the bacteria as well in a versatile wastewater treatment system and to grow homogeneously formed heavy metal carbonates. Its behaviour toward heavy metal binding and flotation was combined in a biometal sludge reactor to extract and separate heavy metals from metal contaminated soils. Finally its metal-induced heavy metal resistance allowed constructing whole cell heavy metal biosensors which, after contact with contaminated soil, waste, solids, minerals and ashes, were induced in function of the bioavailable concentration (Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Co, Ni, Tl, Pb and Hg) in the solids and allowed to investigate the speciation of immobilization of those metals. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

TI  - Temperature diagrams for preventing decomposition or side reactions in liquid-liquid semibatch reactors
VL  - 61
IS  - 10
SP  - 3068-3078
AB  - The operation of an indirectly cooled semibatch reactor in which an exothermic reaction occurs is usually considered safe if the characteristic time of the coreactant dosing is much higher than the characteristic times of all the other phenomena involved (chemical reaction and mass transfer), so that the conversion rate is controlled by the coreactant supply itself. Such operating conditions imply a small accumulation of the coreactant in the system and are characterized by a temperature evolution which quickly approaches a target temperature and remains close to it throughout the dosing period, at the end of which the conversion is almost complete. The so-called boundary diagrams are useful tools for identifying safe operating conditions without solving the mathematical model of the reactor. However, avoiding accumulation phenomena can be not sufficient for classifying a set of operating conditions as thermally safe when the maximum temperature reached by the system under normal operation exceeds a maximum allowable temperature (which can be related either to safety problems, when dangerous decomposition reactions can be triggered, or to productivity problems, when side reactions can significantly lower the product yield above a given threshold temperature). In this work the boundary diagrams for the prevention of excessive accumulation conditions in liquid-liquid semibatch reactors are coupled with new diagrams, called temperature diagrams. These new diagrams, involving the same dimensionless parameters used for the representation of the boundary diagrams, allow determining - for a given set of operating conditions - the maximum temperature increase with respect to the initial reactor temperature which can be expected to occur during normal operation. This information can be compared with the maximum allowable temperature for the reacting mixture. Then the operating conditions can be verified through the boundary diagrams in order to reject conditions of excessive coreactant accumulation. Several temperature diagrams are provided for various kinetically or diffusion controlled reactions with different reaction orders and their use together with a general procedure for calculating them is presented. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 274
SP  - 225-234
AB  - Positive parental effects, defined as the strategies displayed by sardine Sardina pilchardus adults to increase the survival of eggs and larvae, were studied off the coast of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain) by monthly sampling of eggs and larvae in Ria de Vigo, over a period of 4 yr. Two different parental strategies were observed over the spawning period: temporal variations in spawning intensity, and variation of egg quality. Sardine spawn outside the upwelling season, to avoid offshore transport of eggs and larvae to where food is less abundant. There is a negative correlation between the duration of embryonic development and egg organic content. Sardine employ a parental strategy that adapts the biochemical composition of eggs to the evolution of the temperature in the area during the spawning season. Eggs of higher organic content are produced in the coldest months, thereby compensating for the delay in embryonic development time due to low temperatures. This also has the effect of enhancing larval survival.

TI  - Selective growth and mortality of juvenile 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the Dutch Wadden Sea: A consequence of irreversible non-genetic adaptation during early pelagic life
VL  - 197
SP  - 273-283
AB  - In this paper, we have addressed the question of whether selective growth and mortality of juvenile 0-group plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L.) occurs in the Dutch Wadden Sea as a consequence of irreversible non-genetic adaptation to water temperature conditions during early pelagic life. As tracers, the number of vertebrae, and of dorsal and anal fin rays were used, since the variability in these characteristics reflects the phenotypic plasticity induced by differences in environmental conditions, and especially water temperature, during early pelagic life. From the onset of larval immigration in March 1995, the juvenile 0-group plaice population was sampled frequently and the variability in its meristic characteristics was analysed. The number of vertebrae appeared to be established by water temperature conditions during the egg stage, while the number of dorsal and anal fin rays seemed to be determined during the larval stage. As a consequence, the number of vertebrae was not correlated with either the number of dorsal fin rays or the number of anal fin rays, but the numbers of anal fin rays and dorsal fin rays were strongly correlated. Strong support was found for Kinne's (1962; Comp Biochem Physiol 5:265-282) 'irreversible non-genetic adaptation' hypothesis - that the variability induced by environmental conditions during early life still expresses itself later on in juvenile life - as there was a significant positive relationship in our study between growth and the number of vertebrae during the period April to July. Also, instantaneous mortality was positively related to the number of vertebrae. It is suggested that the relationship with mortality results from a correlation between vertebral number and some important characteristic involved in avoiding predators, such as locomotory performance. Also, mean growth rate during the growing season and instantaneous mortality rate were positively correlated for each meristic characteristic. It is argued that the relationship between growth and mortality will vary over the years and will depend on the combination of environmental conditions during egg and larval stage compared to those during the subsequent juvenile stage.

TI  - Directionality principles in thermodynamics and evolution
VL  - 94
IS  - 8
SP  - 3491-3498
AB  - Directionality in populations of replicating organisms can be parametrized in terms of a statistical concept: evolutionary entropy. This parameter, a measure of the variability in the age of reproducing individuals in a population, is isometric with the macroscopic variable body size. Evolutionary trends in entropy due to mutation and natural selection fall into patterns modulated by ecological and demographic constraints, which are delineated as follows: (i) density-dependent conditions (a unidirectional increase in evolutionary entropy), and (it) density-independent conditions, (a) slow exponential growth (an increase in entropy); (b) rapid exponential growth, low degree of iteroparity (a decrease in entropy); and (c) rapid exponential growth, high degree of iteroparity (random, nondirectional change in entropy). Directionality in aggregates of inanimate matter can be parametrized in terms of the statistical concept, thermodynamic entropy, a measure of disorder. Directional trends in entropy in aggregates of matter fall into patterns determined by the nature of the adiabatic constraints, which are characterized as follows: (i) irreversible processes (an increase in thermodynamic entropy) and (ii) reversible processes (a constant value for entropy). This article analyzes the relation between the concepts that underlie the directionality principles in evolutionary biology and physical systems. For models of cellular populations, an analytic relation is derived between generation time, the average length of the cell cycle, and temperature. This correspondence between generation time, an evolutionary parameter, and temperature, a thermodynamic variable, is exploited to show that the increase in evolutionary entropy that characterizes population processes under density-dependent conditions represents a nonequilibrium analogue of the second law of thermodynamics.

TI  - The dead of winter: size dependent variation and genetic differences in seasonal mortality among Atlantic silverside (Atherinidae : Menidia menidia) from different latitudes
VL  - 55
IS  - 5
SP  - 1149-1157
AB  - Genetic differences among populations of Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia) are hypothesized to be evolutionary responses to intense, size-selective winter mortality at high latitudes. Three experiments were conducted to test features of winter mortality. In the first experiment, we varied size and whether food was provided or withheld; temperatures were permitted to follow ambient (New York) wintertime fluctuations. Mortality and depletion of energy reserves were more rapid in the units receiving no food. Small fish died before larger fish in these units, but not in the units receiving food. Energy depletion of fish in the no-food treatment resembled that of fish in the wild. In the second experiment, we varied size and population of origin, representing high-latitude (Nova Scotia), midlatitude (New York), and low-latitude (South Carolina) populations. These fish were provided food and showed minimal depletion of energy reserves, but mortality rates were high when water temperatures were low. Mortality did not vary with size in New York and South Carolina fish, but was highest in intermediate-size fish from Nova Scotia. There was a pronounced population difference in survival rate (Nova Scotia > New York > South Carolina). In the third experiment, food was withheld and extreme low temperatures were moderated. Energy depletion was rapid and small fish died before large fish. We conclude that populations in seasonal environments are likely to he subject to size-selective winter mortality when energy reserves are depleted and that juvenile growth rates have evolved in response to this selection pressure. In addition, high-latitude populations have evolved greater tolerance to other winter stresses associated with low temperatures.

TI  - Thermal history of the enstatite chondrites from silica polymorphs
VL  - 40
IS  - 6
SP  - 855-868
AB  - Here we report the results of our petrologic and mineralogical study of enstatite (E) chondrites in order to explore their thermal histories. We studied silica phases in 20 E chondrites by laser micro Raman spectroscopy to determine the silica polymorphs they contain. Silica phases are commonly present in E chondrites and their polymorphs reflect the physical conditions of formation. The samples studied here include EH3-5, EL3-6, E chondrite melt rocks, and an anomalous E chondrite. We identified quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, and silica glass in the samples studied. EH4-5 and EH melt rocks are divided into high and low temperature classes based on niningerite-alabandite solid solutions. EH3, EL3, and some EH melt rocks of the high temperature class contain tridymite and cristobalite. We suggest that tridymite and cristobalite crystallized in chondrules and E chondrite melts, followed by rapid cooling, leading to the survival of these silica polymorphs. EH4 and EL4 chondrites also contain tridymite and cristobalite in their chondrules, indicating that these silica polymorphs survived low temperature metamorphism (as estimated from opaque mineral geothermometers) because of the sluggishness of the transition to a more stable polymorph. Tridymite and cristobalite in EL6 chondrites reflect the high temperature processes experienced by these meteorites. On the other hand, some EH5 chondrites and EH melt rocks of the low temperature class contain quartz, which may be a product of the transition from tridymite or cristobalite during a long period of low temperature metamorphism. Although the thermal history of E chondrites have been previously estimated from opaque minerals, such compositions mainly reflect low temperature processes. However, we can reconstruct the primordial thermal processes and subsequent cooling histories of E chondrites from their silica polymorphs. The E chondrites have complicated thermal histories, which produced the observed variations among them. © The Meteoritical Society, 2005.

TI  - Role of membrane lipid fatty acids in cold adaptation
VL  - 50
IS  - 5
SP  - 631-642
AB  - Psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria have evolved various strategies to adapt to low temperature. One important strategy, which is crucial to the survival of the cell at low temperature, relates to the ability of the cell to modulate the fluidity of the membrane. Bacteria in general modulate membrane fluidity by altering their fatty acid composition. But, bacteria could also achieve the same by various other strategies such as by altering the lipid head group, the protein content of the membrane, the type of carotenoids synthesized, the fatty acid chain length and the proportion of cis to trans fatty acids. In addition bacteria have a two-component signal transduction pathway consisting of a membrane-bound sensor and a soluble cytoplasmic response regulator involved in the perception and transduction of low temperature signals. This review on cold adaptation highlights the various strategies by which bacteria modulate the fluidity of the membrane and the process by which it senses and transduces the low temperature signal.

AB  - Fishes released from constraints of their previous thermal history tend to limit thermal exposure to a narrow range of temperatures. Thermoregulatory behavior (final preferendum) is a stable characteristic of each species studied, suggesting strong regulation by natural selection. However, the adaptive significance of the final preferendum has not been documented for most species. Species with wide geographic distributions, such as bluegill sunfish and largemouth bass exhibit constant laboratory final preferenda regardless of their geographic origin or thermal histories. This apparent evolutionary anomaly of the final preferendum requires further study. It is no longer adequate to describe responses of fish to thermal gradients, rather falsifiable hypotheses concerning adaptive relations between thermoselection, and physiological, biochemical, life-history and genetic correlates must be developed and tested experimentally. © 1979 by the American Society of Zoologists.

TI  - Geothermal convection in the Tengiz carbonate platform, Kazakhstan: Reactive transport models of diagenesis and reservoir quality
VL  - 90
IS  - 8
SP  - 1251-1272
AB  - A fundamental challenge in carbonate reservoir characterization is predicting the spatial distribution of diagenesis. We used a reactive transport model to investigate the viability of geothermal convection and associated patterns of diagenetic porosity modification in the Tengiz isolated carbonate platform reservoir. Before burial, forced convection generates significant calcite dissolution (locally up to 45%) toward the platform center, minor calcite cementation (up to 0.4%) in the slope, and moderate calcite dissolution and cementation (up to 1.6%) in Serpukhovian boundstone convective cells. The patterns and rates of diagenesis proved critically sensitive to specified vertical permeability. After burial with 200 m (660 ft) of salt, modeled subsurface temperature contrasts drive platform-scale free convection. Flow is hydraulically closed, but significant dissolution, up to 7.3% after 20 m.y., occurred in the Serpukhovian and Visean platform interior, and minor cementation up to 0.7% occurred toward the margin. A shale-filled salt-withdrawal basin, 500 m (1640 ft) deep, significantly modifies the subsurface temperature distribution and free convective flow. Ascending groundwaters beneath the withdrawal basin created a zone of calcite dissolution (up to 24.5% in 20 m.y.), with a mushroom geometry and minor cementation (up to 2.3% in 20 m.y.) in the distal platform interior and margin. Rates of diagenesis are dramatically reduced with increasing overburden as compaction retards convective flow. From a generic perspective, free convection persists if the salt overburden is substituted with shale, although flow is reversed, resulting in a different distribution of diagenesis. Simulations of geothermal convection provide a physically viable model for the integration of direct diagenetic observations to augment predictions of reservoir quality in Tengiz and other carbonate platform reservoirs.

TI  - Predictive control of polymerization batch reactors using hybrid models
VL  - 21
SP  - 1329-1334
AB  - The use of model based control for polymerization reactors is a very attractive alternative to the classical master slave control of temperature. However the bottleneck has been always the construction of a reliable model. Classical identification techniques fail in the control of batch processes because the operating point changes along the reaction. Rigorous modeling is sometimes a very complicated task because of the lack of knowledge about the process or because the fitting of the dynamic parameters demands specific experiments. Also the complexity of the model and the lack of observability represent a major obstacle for the online operation of a full dynamic rigorous model. This paper presents the development of a gray-box model that can be fitted with minimal experimentation time and provides reliable predictions and information for the INCA (Ipcos Novel Control Architecture) model based predictive controller (MPC). The model not only provides reliable predictions of the evolution of the temperature but also generates online information about the status of the conversion. The use of such controller improves the performance of the control system providing extra room to increase the temperature of the reaction in order to increase productivity. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Consequences of outbreeding on phenotypic plasticity in Drosophila mercatorum wings
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
SP  - 403-415
AB  - A multivariate morphometric investigation was conducted on wings of two parthenogenetic Drosophila mercatorum strains and offspring (F1) of crosses between these parthenogenetic strains with highly inbred sexual individuals of the same species. The parental flies and F1 offspring were reared at three different temperatures: 20, 25, or 28A degrees C. This design allows a comparison of completely homozygous individuals (parental generation) with identical heterozygote offspring (F1), which makes an analysis of phenotypic plasticity of morphometric traits possible, without a potentially confounding effect of genotype-environment interactions, which can increase the phenotypic variability. The same pattern of phenotypic plasticity of wing size between the homozygous parental strains and the heterozygous offspring was found in both strains with an apparent heterotic effect for wing size in the F1 at 25A degrees C. At 20 and 28A degrees C flies from the parental generation had the biggest wings. Phenotypic plasticity of shape was found to be strain dependent. A reduced level of developmental instability (DI) was found in the F1 as compared to the parental strain only in strain 1 reared at 20A degrees C for the wing size and 25A degrees C for the wing shape. For all the other treatments higher DI was found in the F1 when the difference was significant, which is suggestive of outbreeding depression. These findings are difficult to interpret since an apparent heterotic effect of size at 25A degrees C is accompanied by higher DI (though not significant in strain 2) and complex changes in wing shape. Hence, we cannot conclude whether outbreeding lowers or increases the capacity to respond to environmental change via plastic responses and via changes of the level of DI. The degree of change of phenotypic plasticity and DI is trait specific, depending on the environment and on the genotypes which are hybridizing.

VL  - 5039
SP  - 1433-1443
AB  - DUV resists are extremely sensitive to temperature variations on the wafer during bake and chill cycles. In resist-processing tracks today, the wafer is moved by a robot or transfer arm, from the bake to chill plate. During this move, since the resist is still above the activation temperature, the wafer temperature is uncontrolled until it is placed on a chill plate. In the new station design presented here, the wafer is heated to the desired bake temperature and chilled back to room temperature before being moved by the robot, resulting in a tight temperature control of the wafer, throughout the process. Two models, axi-symmetric and three-dimensional (geometrically similar to the new station), are generated for analyzing the thermal performance of the above station. The numerical simulations, solving the momentum and energy equations in the computational domain, are performed using the commercial CID software Fluent(R). The simulated temporal evolution of temperature from the beginning to the end of the bake-chill process is verified with the experimental data as measured by a 42-point OnWafer(TM) temperature sensor wafer on the new station. Methods to improve wafer surface temperature uniformity, in light of bake-chill-station mechanical and thermal design losses are discussed. Higher throughput of the cluster, a major productivity improvement contribution of this new design, is also highlighted.

AB  - Effective thermoregulation and the ability to select preferred temperature is an important factor influencing fitness in hatchling and juvenile turtles. Six-month-old Glyptemys insculpta acclimated to 20 degrees C selected the warmest temperature available and avoided the coldest temperature available in a gradient of 12-27 degrees C. Turtles visited fewer chambers and switched chambers in the gradient tank less frequently when the gradient was present than during control tests. Mean selection of chambers differed between control and gradient tests across all temperatures except at 21 degrees C, the temperature closest to the acclimation and control temperature (20 degrees C).

AB  - Seismic tomography studies provide clear evidence for a small-scale, finger-like body of low-velocity material extending from about 70 to 400 km depth (Ritter et al. 2001, Keyser et al. 2002, Ritter this volume) or to 650 km (Montelli et al. 2004) beneath the Eifel. The causes of such strong upper mantle plumes and their significance with respect to intra-plate volcanism are still a matter of controversial debate. The instabilities might either represent active thermal uplift driven by base heating of the 670 km discontinuity or a response to external tectonic developments, i.e. lithospheric stress might induce regions of decompression melting of fertile fusible patches within a heterogeneous upper mantle (e.g. Courtillot et al. 2003, Wilson 2003, Wilson and Patterson 2001). Thus the fundamental issue is whether elevated temperatures, the occurrence of partial melts, variations in modal composition, mineral anisotropy, or distinct combinations of these effects contribute to the upper mantle seismic anomalies. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Low repeatability of preferred body temperature in four species of Cordylid lizards: Temporal variation and implications for adaptive significance
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-79
AB  - Preferred body temperatures (Tsel) of ectotherms are important for ecological and evolutionary studies. In lizards, the measurement of T sel is controversial for several reasons, generally related to hypotheses addressing how Tsel may evolve in the wild. Although seldom explicitly tested, evolutionary hypotheses of adaptation to local climate require that Tsel meets the conditions of natural selection, which include repeatability, heritability and a link to fitness. Here, we investigated repeatability (τ, intra-class correlation coefficient) of Tsel at several time-scales using four Cordylid species from heterogeneous thermal habitats. Although there was significant inter-individual variation within days (P &lt; 0.005 in most cases), there was no significant inter-individual variation when calculated across several days (P &gt; 0.05). Repeatability was low in all species investigated (from 0 to 0.482) when compared against other estimates of repeatability of Tsel in the literature. Irrespective of how Tsel was calculated, it showed inconsistent and variable temporal effects across species. Furthermore, repeatability of Tsel did not change with acclimation to laboratory conditions. These data have implications for understanding the evolution of thermoregulation in these and other ectotherms. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - Adaptation to the thermal climate of North America by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii
VL  - 81
IS  - 5
SP  - 1262-1272
AB  - We are concerned with the climatic factors that affect the adaptive radiation of species into and within the temperate zone. As one progresses northward, there is a decrease in summer temperatures and a concomitant increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold. For the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, it has been shown previously that (1) range expansion and evolution has proceeded from south to north, and (2) either realistically hot summer temperatures or a simulated 7-mo winter reduce fitness by 60% or more in two New Jersey (40 degrees N) populations. Herein, we compare the relative fitness of nine populations of W. smithii from 30 degrees to 50 degrees N when exposed to these same stressful summer temperatures and simulated winter. We determined the survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of five cohorts from each population at each temperature in both environments, and we calculated the cohort replacement rate (R(0)) as the product of these three component traits. Survivorship declined with increasing latitude in the summer, but not the winter, environment. Fecundity was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Fertility declined with increasing latitude in both environments. R(0) was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Hence, the interpretation of the adaptive responses to climate can depend critically on the trait being examined. Because R(0) is a composite index of fitness that includes any trade-offs among its constituent traits, we place greater reliance on its noncorrelation with latitude. Therefore, we conclude that, despite their clear impact on fitness, summer heat and winter cold have had little impact on the adaptive evolution of W. smithii to the climatic gradient of North America. The decline in summer heat and increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold as one moves north also impose a latitudinal gradient in the length of the favorable growing season. Many plants and animals use daylength to cue the seasonal events in their life cycles. We then argue that the timing of seasonal development mediated by photoperiodic response constitutes the most immediate adaptation of populations to novel temperate climates, and that adaptation of thermal responsiveness to summer heat or winter cold takes place over a longer time scale or taxonomic distance.

TI  - Episodic layering of the early mantle by the 'basalt barrier' mechanism
VL  - 275
IS  - 3
SP  - 382-392
AB  - Subducted oceanic crust is buoyant between depths of 660 km and about 750 km, and this causes early episodes of layering and breakdown in numerical models of the dynamical evolution of the mantle from 4.5 Ga ago until the present. During layered periods, the upper mantle cools and the lower mantle warms, reaching temperature differences of up to 300 °C, and oceanic crust is only a few kilometers thick, which would facilitate subduction and plate tectonics. Layering inhibits heat loss, so that high average mantle temperatures persist. The layering breaks down roughly every 100-150 Ma, at which time hot, fertile lower mantle floods the upper mantle and there is a dramatic burst of magmatism lasting a few million years and manifest in the models as oceanic crustal thicknesses of tens of kilometers. As radioactive heating declines and the mantle gradually cools, subducted plates eventually become thick and heavy enough to penetrate and disrupt the 'basalt barrier', and no further layering occurs after 1.6-1.8 Ga in the models. The models yield mean residence times of mantle material (between passages through melting zones) consistent with the mantle lead-isotopic apparent age of about 1.8 Ga. Accumulations of (denser) basaltic material at the base of the models preserve a remarkably clear record of the early magmatic pulses. These accumulations persist strongly into the present, probably because of high internal temperature and consequent low viscosity, even though they are unlikely to form under present conditions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Identifying candidate genes affecting developmental time in Drosophila melanogaster: Pervasive pleiotropy and gene-by-environment interaction
VL  - 8
AB  - Background. Understanding the genetic architecture of ecologically relevant adaptive traits requires the contribution of developmental and evolutionary biology. The time to reach the age of reproduction is a complex life history trait commonly known as developmental time. In particular, in holometabolous insects that occupy ephemeral habitats, like fruit flies, the impact of developmental time on fitness is further exaggerated. The present work is one of the first systematic studies of the genetic basis of developmental time, in which we also evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the expression of the trait. Results. We analyzed 179 co-isogenic single P[GT1]-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster to identify novel genes affecting developmental time in flies reared at 25°C. Sixty percent of the lines showed a heterochronic phenotype, suggesting that a large number of genes affect this trait. Mutant lines for the genes Merlin and Karl showed the most extreme phenotypes exhibiting a developmental time reduction and increase, respectively, of over 2 days and 4 days relative to the control (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line). In addition, a subset of 42 lines selected at random from the initial set of 179 lines was screened at 17°C. Interestingly, the gene-by-environment interaction accounted for 52% of total phenotypic variance. Plastic reaction norms were found for a large number of developmental time candidate genes. Conclusion. We identified components of several integrated time-dependent pathways affecting egg-to-adult developmental time in Drosophila. At the same time, we also show that many heterochronic phenotypes may arise from changes in genes involved in several developmental mechanisms that do not explicitly control the timing of specific events. We also demonstrate that many developmental time genes have pleiotropic effects on several adult traits and that the action of most of them is sensitive to temperature during development. Taken together, our results stress the need to take into account the effect of environmental variation and the dynamics of gene interactions on the genetic architecture of this complex life-history trait. © 2008 Mensch et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Egg mass determines hatchling size, and incubation temperature influences post-hatching growth, of tuatara Sphenodon punctatus
VL  - 263
IS  - 1
SP  - 77-87
AB  - The size of reptile hatchlings can be phenotypically plastic in response to incubation temperature, and size is a trait likely to influence fitness - i.e. hatchling size is proposed as an indicator of quality. The parental and incubation temperature effects on the size of one of New Zealand's most biologically significant reptile species, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus are investigated. Artificial incubation at constant temperatures is used to produce founders for new captive and wild populations of tuatara and to augment existing rare populations. We compare size of hatchling tuatara from artificial and natural incubation treatments. The relationship of hatchling size with incubation temperature and sex is examined, and we investigate whether our results support differential fitness models for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara. Initial egg mass is the most important factor affecting size of hatchling tuatara and is still an important influence at 10 months of age. Incubation temperature does not greatly influence size of hatchlings, but significantly influences size by 10 months of age. Constant artificial incubation conditions result in larger, but possibly less aggressive, juveniles than those from more variable natural incubation conditions by 10 months of age. Evidence from size patterns of tuatara incubated in natural nests supports differential fitness models for the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination. Thermal variation has little effect on size of male hatchlings, but female embryos that develop in more stable thermal conditions, in more reliable sites for hatching, are bigger and have longer jaws.

VL  - 81

SP  - 33-37
AB  - 1) When a thermal gradient (20-40° C) was established along a laboratory nest, Camponotus mus nurse workers showed a photoperiodic circadian rhythm of temperature preferences for brood rearing. Two different temperatures were daily selected to translocate the brood, i.e. 30.8° C selected at the middle of the photophase, and 27.5° C selected during the scotophase, 8 h later. 2) The daily temperature response of nurse workers consisted of paired high and low-temperature translocations, with a 8 hs-interval in between: high-temperature translocation was shown to be entrained by the photophase length, whereas low-temperature translocation was shown to be dependent on the precedent one. 3) Prey deprivation to the colony modified the brood transport behaviors resulting in translocations of only cocoons and large (ripe) larvae, stages in which the pupation processes are triggered. Small larvae and eggs remained located at 27.5° C. 4) Evaluation of pupa developmental time as well as percentage of pupa mortality at different temperature regimes allowed to construct an efficiency index relating pupa survival and cocoon developmental time. In the range of temperatures selected by nurses, the index reached its maximal values. 5) The ecological significance of these results is discussed. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Comparison between Concentrated Complete Diets and Self-Selection for Feeding Sexually-Maturing Pullets at Hot and Cold Temperatures
VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 613-626
AB  - 1. Pullets in late growth and early lay were maintained at hot (25° to 35°C) or cold (6× to 16°C) ambient temperatures and either fed complete diets or allowed to self-select nutrients from separate energy- and protein-rich foods. 2. Manipulating the metabolisable energy (ME) and/or nutrient density (ND) of complete layer diets failed to improve egg output at hot temperatures to that obtained at cold temperatures. 3. At both temperatures self-selection increased protein, but not ME, intake. This increased egg output and body weight gain at the hot, but not cold, temperatures. At the hot temperatures pullets fed by self-selection were the only ones to gain weight between sexual maturity and 28 weeks of age. 4. Nutrient intake patterns, related to each pullet's physiological age of sexual maturity, identified distinctive changes in protein intake and the selected protein:ME intake ratio of pullets fed by self-selection. Pullets attempted to maintain a preferred protein:ME intake ratio, irrespective of the markedly different intakes of ME and protein at the two temperatures. 5. Pullets trained to self-select nutrients from separate energy- and protein-rich foods are better able to sustain egg output and body weight at sexual maturity when food intake is limited by high ambient temperatures. © 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We studied variations in genetic, physiological, and ecological traits, and the phylogenetic relationship among sexual and parthenogenetic populations of Asobara japonica, a larval parasitoid of drosophilid flies, in order to understand how they adapt to local environments and have differentiated. The strain from Iriomote-jima (IR) differed from other Japanese strains in the nucleotide sequences of its cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and in not undergoing diapause and having a shorter preimaginal period and a higher adult tolerance of cold. The strains other than IR showed a low level of nucleotide variation in COI but varied in their mode of reproduction; the strains from the Ryukyu Islands were sexual, whereas those from the main islands of Japan and Ogasawara were parthenogenetic. In addition, strains from higher latitudes generally showed a high incidence of diapause, although there were some exceptions. On the other hand, preimaginal period and adult cold tolerance varied little among the strains excluding IR, and pupal cold tolerance, oviposition preference and incidence of parasitism varied little among the strains including IR. Evolution and environmental adaptations in this species are discussed, particularly focusing on parthenogenetic populations.

AB  - Microevolutionary changes in the body size of the bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea) since the last glacial maximum were estimated from measurements of fecal pellets preserved in paleomiddens from the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau of the United States. The changes closely track regional temperature fluctuations simulated by the Community Climate Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and also those estimated from deuterium isotope ratios of plant cellulose recovered from paleomiddens. Body size decreased during periods of climatic warming, as predicted from Bergmann's rule and from physiological responses to temperature stress. Fossil woodrat middens, by providing detailed temporal sequences of body sizes from many locations, permit precise quantification of responses to climatic change that have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.

IS  - 4
SP  - 766-776
AB  - To examine the effects of incubation temperature and moisture levels on embryonic development and posthatching growth and behavior, we incubated a total of 123 eggs collected from 18 wild female Cuban rock iguanas at 28.0, 29.5, or 31.0 C on wet (-150 kPa), moist (-550 kPa), or dry (-1100 kPa) substrates. Although there was no effect of incubation temperature or water availability on egg survival, larger females exhibited higher infertility and greater mortality of initially viable eggs, suggesting that reproductive senescence may occur in this long-lived species. Incubation temperature, although it had little influence on size at hatching, significantly affected several measures of growth, including changes in body length, mass, and head dimensions. In general, hatchlings from higher incubation temperatures grew faster during their first year. However, by 16 months of age, growth rates no longer varied among hatchlings incubated at different temperatures. Incubation temperature had no detectable effect on thermal selection by hatchlings at 14 to 16 months of age, as there was no tendency for hatchlings incubated at higher temperatures to preferentially select higher basking temperatures. Moisture levels during incubation did not significantly affect size, growth, or thermoregulatory behavior of hatchlings. These results have important implications for understanding how environmental conditions experienced during embryonic development may affect future fitness and survivorship.

VL  - 212
IS  - 21
SP  - 3448-3454
AB  - Virtually all aspects of insect biology are affected by body temperature, and many taxa have evolved sophisticated temperature-control mechanisms. All insects, however, begin life as eggs and lack the ability to thermoregulate. Eggs laid on leaves experience a thermal environment, and thus a body temperature, that is strongly influenced by the leaves themselves. Because plants can maintain leaf temperatures that differ from ambient, e. g. by evapotranspiration, plant hosts may protect eggs from extreme ambient temperatures. We examined the degree to which leaves buffer ambient thermal variation and whether that buffering benefits leaf-associated insect eggs. In particular, we: (1) measured temperature variation at oviposition sites in the field, (2) manipulated temperatures in the laboratory to determine the effect of different thermal conditions on embryo development time and survival, and (3) tested embryonic metabolic rates over increasing temperatures. Our results show that Datura wrightii leaves buffer Manduca sexta eggs from fatally high ambient temperatures in the southwestern USA. Moreover, small differences in temperature profiles among leaves can cause large variation in egg metabolic rate and development time. Specifically, large leaves were hotter than small leaves during the day, reaching temperatures that are stressfully high for eggs. This study provides the first mechanistic demonstration of how this type of leaf-constructed thermal refuge interacts with egg physiology.

TI  - The importance of crisis progenitors in recovery from mass extinction
VL  - 102
SP  - 15
AB  - Progenitor taxa are defined as species or lineages which arise, commonly through punctuated or macroevolutionary processes, during the main phases of a mass extinction interval, and which then survive to seed the evolution of diminant groups during ensuing radiation and ecosystem recovery. Their success in surviving the servere environmental perturbations commonly associated with mass extinctions and their immediate aftermath lies in the fact that they are initially adapted in their evolution to these dynamically changing environments. This differentiates them from other surviving clades of ecological generalists, opportunists, disaster taxa, taxa with speicalized survival machanisms, etc., all of which may have a long pre-extinction evolutionary history. Progenitor taxa characterize those ecosystems which are most severely affected by mass extinction processes (perturbations and feedback loops), e.g. those of tropical to warm temperate climate zones. Progenitor taxa are rarer in those ecosystems with relatively minor response to environmental perturbations of mass extinction intervals (deep sea and more poleward areas), where many established perextinction lineages survive the extinction event(s) with little change. In several published records of 'explosive radiation' among new lineages following mass extinctions, high-resolution stratigraphic sampling has shown that many of these 'new' recovery taxa actually had their origins as small, relatively rare progenitor taxa during the preceding mass extinction intervals. Examples from Cretaceous mass extinction intervals are presented (Cenomanin-Turonian, Cretaceous-Tertiary).

TI  - Analysis of thin-slab casting by the compact-strip process: Part II. Effect of operating and design parameters on solidification and bulging
VL  - 35
IS  - 3
SP  - 561-573
AB  - The mathematical model to compute the thermal evolution and solidification of thin slabs, previously presented in Part I of this article, was used in combination with a three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element thermomechanical model to analyze how actual operation conditions can lead to excessive deflection and jamming of the slab shell at the pinch rolls. The models suggest that these phenomena arise from a sudden loss of control of the metallurgical length stemming from the coupling of inappropriate steel superheats and casting velocities to deficient heat-extraction conditions at the mold or secondary cooling system. The bulging deformation was calculated with an elastic and creep model that takes, into account the temperature distribution across the shell thickness and the different times that shell elements have to creep exposure, i.e., according to the time that rows of elements require to reach their current position in the casting direction at a given casting speed. The last point was simulated[ by varying the duration of application of the ferrostatic load to the inside surface of each row of elements. The conditions forecast by the models as being responsible for excessive bulging agree very well with those present during the occurrence of these events in the plant. Since bulging after the last containment roll is a major limitation to productivity, this article also presents a parametric evaluation of the casting-speed limits that two compact-strip process (CSP) casters with different supported lengths may have as a function of steel superheat, mold heat-extraction level, water flow rate of the spray and air-mist nozzles, and slab thickness.

TI  - Earthworm culture, maintenance and species selection in chronic ecotoxicological studies: A critical review
VL  - 43
SP  - S281-S288
AB  - A critical review of earthworm use in chronic ecotoxicological studies is presented. In laboratory studies, species selection has often been based on commercial availability or on field-collected earthworms. The validity of results employing earthworms of either unknown origin or previous exposures must be questioned. Many studies have relied heavily on methodologies adopted from acute testing where earthworm maintenance was not a priority. A number of studies have been published without reference to such critical factors as earthworm density, food, temperature or soil moisture levels. Earthworm death has been identified as a source of error particularly in reproduction tests where adult number is directly related to cocoon production. This has been partially addressed by growing individuals separately or culturing in pairs for reproduction studies. It is suggested that a further development could be the use of parthenogenetic species allowing reproduction to be assessed on an individual basis. The use of such species would also permit tests on genetically similar cohorts. It is (widely) recognised that there are problems of extrapolation from laboratory to field scale. However, field tests remain uncommon due to difficulties with experimental design and interpretation of results. Use of laboratory-reared earthworm cohorts and mark-release-recapture techniques may allow development of a standard comparative procedure across different sites. It is suggested that wider use of established culture techniques allied to ecological requirements and behaviour of species will increase the consistency and validity of sub-lethal earthworm toxicity tests.

VL  - 205

AB  - The recent revival of body size relationships in ecology has boosted our understanding of ecosystems. Here, a simple model, based on energy equivalency, integrates rate, age, density and area parameters that are important in ecological modelling. Allometric relationships for quantities as diverse as ingestion, mortality, age at maturity, maximum density, territory size of different species groups and trophic levels are derived from production and some ecological transfer efficiencies. The theory is supported by a meta-analysis of 230 allometric regressions derived from over 100 publications. The relationships are shown to be mutually consistent and fit into the model. Rate constants generally decrease with organism mass at an exponent of -1/4. Age and density parameters increase in the same direction following a slope of 1/4. Differences between plants, invertebrates, cold-blooded vertebrates and warm-blooded vertebrates are reflected in the intercepts and can be anticipated from temperature, trophic position and evolutionary history. Cold-blooded species have lower rate constants but reach higher ages and densities than equally sized warm-blooded organisms. Intercepts of body size distributions tend to decrease with trophic position, at a level that is predicted by ecological efficiencies. Area parameters, such as the territory size and geographic range, tend to decrease with species size, but slopes and intercepts were often different from the expected value. Occasionally, outliers were also noted for rate, time or density parameters. With the model at hand, such deviations can be easily identified and subjected to more extensive empirical and theoretical research. With these restrictions, specific issues can now be addressed by a framework that complies with extensive information on related parameters. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Cold cratonic roots and thermal blankets: How continents affect mantle convection
VL  - 45
IS  - 6
SP  - 479-496
AB  - Two-dimensional convection models with moving continents show that continents profoundly affect the pattern of mantle convection. If the continents are wider than the wavelength of the convection cells (-3000 km, the thickness of the mantle), they cause neighboring deep mantle thermal upwellings to coalesce into a single focused upwelling. This focused upwelling zone will have a potential temperature anomaly of about 200°C, much higher than the 100°C temperature anomaly of upwelling zones generated beneath typical oceanic lithosphere. Extensive high-temperature melts (including flood basalts and late potassic granites) will be produced, and the excess temperature anomaly will induce continental uplift (as revealed in sea level changes) and the eventual breakup of the supercontinent. The mantle thermal anomaly will persist for several hundred million years after such a breakup. In contrast, small continental blocks (<1000 km diameter) do not induce focused mantle upwelling zones. Instead, small continental blocks are dragged to mantle down-welling zones, where they spend most of their time, and will migrate laterally with the downwelling. As a result of sitting over relatively cold mantle (downwellings), small continental blocks are favored to keep their cratonic roots. This may explain the long-term survival of small cratonic blocks (e.g., the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons of western Australia, and the West African craton). The optimum size for long-term stability of a continental block is <3000 km. These results show that continents profoundly affect the pattern of mantle convection. These effects are illustrated in terms of the timing and history of supercontinent breakup, the production of high-temperature melts, and sea level changes. Such two-dimensional calculations can be further refined and tested by three-dimensional numerical simulations of mantle convection with moving continental and oceanic plates. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Introgressive hexaploid oats from the Avena abyssinica (♀) x A. sativa hybrid: Performance, grain lipids and proteins
VL  - 111
IS  - 3
SP  - 153-160
AB  - A fertile hexaploid oat plant was obtained after several generations of selection for seed set and plant type from a colchicine-produced decaploid hybrid, Avena abyssinica (2n = 4x = 28, AABB) x A. sativa (2n = 6x = 42, AACCDD). The selected line proved to be stably fertile and in many characteristics equal or superior to the hexaploid parent: The grain protein fractions showed two qualitative differences from those of the pollen parent and several differences from the maternal parent. The fractionating extraction used was new for oats. The fatty acid composition of grains of the hybrid derivative was similar to that of the pollen parent, but different from that of the maternal parent. The maternal parent (A. abyssinica) had a relatively high 16:0 fatty acid content (ca. 20.5 mol%) compared with the level of the hexaploid parent and the hybrid derivation (ca. 17.5 mol% each) in field-grown grain. However, in grain produced in the greenhouse, the hexaploids had ca. 20.5 mol% of 16:0 fatty acid and a decrease in 18:1 fatty acid, whereas seed of the A. abyssinica parent showed only a slight increase (ca. 21.5 mol%) in 16:0 fatty acid. These and other responses statistically significant may be due to adaptation to temperature conditions being wider in the hexaploids than in the East-African A. abyssinica. A new method of grain lipid extraction was introduced and showed good reproducibility. The derived hexaploid oat can be crossed with A. sativa for breeding purposes and due to its early maturity might also have direct use in northern or high-altitude cultivation.

VL  - 13

AB  - This chapter discusses the thermal conditions that set limits on the communication among animals or in a more direct way influence the processing of information. It illustrates how behaviors of importance for communication are constrained by environmental and body temperatures. Behaviors are limited by ambient and body temperatures. Animals often select temperature zones within which to carry out activities of individual survival and reproduction. Temperature thus acts as an environmental sink, drawing together individuals sharing particular temperature requirements, imposing diurnal cycles on social interaction, and assuring that interacting individuals exchange messages during periods of the day or night when their body temperature maximizes efficiency of functioning. Environmental temperature gradients act to isolate populations and species, thereby facilitating genetic differentiation. Environmental temperature also imposes constraints on ontogenetic growth and differentiation. The chapter further shows more specific influences of temperature on neural functioning and supports the notion that body temperature variations within the physiological range can substantially influence processes underlying communication. © 1983, Academic Press, Inc.

TI  - A phyloclimatic study of Cyclamen
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: The impact of global climate change on plant distribution, speciation and extinction is of current concern. Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants? Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective. Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost. © 2006 Yesson and Culham; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Temperature related fertility selection on body size and the sex-ratio gene arrangement in Drosophila pseudoobscura
VL  - 62
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-75
AB  - We measured temperature-dependent fertility selection on body size in Drosophila pseudoobscura in the laboratory. One hundred single females of each of the three karyotypes involving the ‘sexratio’ (SR) and the standard (ST) gene arrangement on the sex chromosome laid eggs at either 18 or 24°C. The experiment addressed the following hypotheses: (a) Fertility selection on body size is weaker at the higher temperature, explaining in part why genetically smaller flies appear to evolve in populations at warmer localities, (b) Homokaryotypic SR females are less fecund than homokaryotypic ST females, possibly mediated by the effect of body size on fertility, explaining the low frequencies of SR despite its strong advantage due to meiotic drive. The data were also expected to shed light on a mechanism for the evolution of plasticity of body size through fertility selection in environments with an unpredictable temperature regime. Hypothesis (a) was clearly refuted because phenotypically larger ST females had an even larger fertility surplus at the higher temperature and, more importantly, the genetic correlation between fertility and body size disappeared at the lower temperature. As to (b), we found that temperature affects fertility directly and indirectly through body size such that ST and SR females were about equally fecund at both temperatures, although different in size and size-adjusted fertility. We observed heterosis for both size and fertility, which might stabilize the polymorphism in nature. The reaction norms of body size to the temperature difference were steeper for ST females than for SR females, implying that fertility selection could change phenotypic plasticity of body size in a population. Selection on body size depended not only on the temperature, but also on the karyotypes, suggesting that models of phenotype evolution using purely phenotypic fitness functions may often be inadequate. © 1993, Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Adaptation of Drosophila to temperature: Heat‐shock proteins and survival in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 3
IS  - 4
SP  - 299-308
AB  - Two stocks of Drosophila melanogaster, one sensitive (6.5% survival) and one resistant (76.24%) to heat shock (40°C/25 min) were derived through indirect selection [1]. Genetic analysis of heat‐sensitive and heat‐resistant lines we had selected revealed that the survival rate is chiefly determined by cytoplasmic inheritance but also depends to some extent on the nucleus [1]. The ability of the fly to survive thermal stress was found to have an excellent correlation with the kinetics of protein synthesis in ovaries or glands subjected to heat treatment. The incorporation rate of 35S‐methionine into proteins was found to be higher for strains exhibiting higher survival (R1, R1S1) than for strains with a lesser ability (S1, S1 R1) to survive heat shock. Moreover, the intensity of labeling of the proteins synthesized and especially of the hsps (heat‐shock proteins) after the heat shock is higher in the R1 and R1S1 stocks than in the S1 and S1R1 stocks. This convergence between survival and the cellular level of hsps (both manipulated by selection) bears on the physiological significance of these proteins which seems to participate in the control of the survival as an additive component.

TI  - Evidence of a genetic bottleneck in an El Nino affected population of South American fur seals, Arctocephalus australis
VL  - 89
IS  - 8
SP  - 1717-1725
AB  - The South American fur seal, Arctocephalus australis, was one of the earliest otariid seals to be exploited by humans: at least 6000 years ago on the Atlantic coast and 4000 on the Pacific coast of South America. More than 750,000 fur seals were killed in Uruguay until 1991. However, a climatological phenomenonthe severe 1997-1998 El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO)was responsible for the decline of 72% of the Peruvian fur seal population due to starvation as a consequence of warming of sea-surface temperatures and primary productivity reduction. Currently, there is no precise information on global population size or on the species' conservation status. The present study includes the first bottleneck test for the Pacific and Atlantic populations of A. australis based on the analysis of seven microsatellite loci. Genetic bottleneck compromises the evolutionary potential of a population to respond to environmental changes. The perspective becomes even more alarming due to current global warming models that predict stronger and more frequent ENSO events in the future. Our analysis found moderate support for deviation from neutrality-equilibrium for the Pacific population of fur seals and none for the Atlantic population. This difference among population reflects different demographic histories, and is consistent with a greater reduction in population size in the Pacific. Such an event could be a result of the synergic effects of recurrent ENSO events and the anthropogenic impact (sealing and prey overfishing) on this population.

VL  - 19

AB  - Abstract: In addition to the well‐documented seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many animal populations. Challenging winter conditions (i.e., low ambient temperature and decreased food availability) can directly induce death via hypothermia, starvation, or shock. Coping with these challenges can also indirectly increase morbidity and mortality by increasing glucocorticoid secretion, which can compromise immune function. Many environmental challenges are recurrent and thus predictable; animals could enhance survival, and presumably increase fitness, if they could anticipate immunologically challenging conditions in order to cope with these seasonal threats to health. The annual cycle of changing photoperiod provides an accurate indicator of time of year and thus allows immunological adjustments prior to the deterioration of conditions. Pineal melatonin codes day length information. Short day lengths enhance several aspects of immune function in laboratory studies, and melatonin appears to mediate many of the enhanced immunological effects of photoperiod. Generally, field studies report compromised immune function during the short days of autumn and winter. The conflict between laboratory and field data is addressed with a multifactor approach. The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in lymphatic tissue size and structure, as well as immune function and disease processes, is reviewed. The role of pineal melatonin and the hormones regulated by melatonin is discussed from an evolutionary and adaptive functional perspective. Finally, the clinical significance of seasonal fluctuations in immune function is presented. Taken together, it appears that seasonal fluctuations in immune parameters, mediated by melatonin, could have profound effects on the etiology and progression of diseases in humans and nonhuman animals. An adaptive functional perspective is critical to gain insights into the interaction among melatonin, immune function, and disease processes. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 83

SP  - 398-407
AB  - Ten isofemale lines of Zaprionus indianus were analysed to study the reaction norms of five morphometrical traits (wing and thorax length, body weight, sternopleural bristle and ovariole number) in relation to growth temperature. All these traits exhibited nonlinear concave reaction norms and were characterized by the coordinates of their maximum: MV (maximum value), and TMV (temperature of maximum value). Wing/thorax ratio, which is related to flight capacity, was also calculated and exhibited a monotonically decreasing reaction norm. Intraclass correlations were on average quite low, with no significant differences between traits, temperature or sex; a highly significant trait-temperature interaction was, however, observed. Sex dimorphism was very low in Zaprionus, contrasting with data previously obtained in other species. MVs among lines were positively correlated for the three size-related traits, whereas sternopleural bristle and ovariole number were genetically independent. TMVs were different between the traits, but higher than in D. melanogaster and other cold-adapted species, in agreement with the hypothesis that the norm shape evolves according to species thermal adaptation. MVs and TMVs were never correlated, indicating that mean values and plasticity are genetically independent. Some positive correlations were observed among TMVs of different traits, suggesting that the same genetic system might regulate plasticity of different traits.

TI  - Cold-shock and chilling tolerance in Drosophila
VL  - 40
IS  - 8
SP  - 661-669
AB  - Adult flies of Drosophila melanogaster were examined for their tolerance to direct (cold-shock) and indirect chilling (chilling) injury. An exponential increase in mortality with low temperatures occurs. Chilling tolerance (T-ch) at 4 or 0 degrees C was 6.3 days or 37.91 h for 50% survival (LT(50)), respectively, while the cold-shock tolerance (LT(50) of T-cs) at -7 degrees C was only 1.5 h. The increase in cold-shock tolerance (T-cs) at -7 degrees C by acclimation at 4, or 0 degrees C was rapid: the LT(50) increased about 50% with only 2 h of treatment in comparison with the highest LT(50) obtained by acclimation. An equilibrium point (T-eq), the optimal acclimation time for maximal survival of chilling and/or cold-shock, was calculated from the survival data of experiments designed to assess T-ch and T-cs The T-eq was found to be the half time of the acclimation period which resulted in 90% mortality at the chilling temperature (LT(90) of T-ch). Selection for tolerance to cold-shock or chilling over several generations resulted in a significant increase in T-cs or T-ch, respectively. Higher contents of glycogen and total proteins were observed in the cold selected lines than in the control line. Exposure to chilling temperatures eventually depleted the energy reserves, but the highest concentrations of triacylglycerols and proteins were observed at the acclimation time with the highest T-cs. This suggests that systemic regulation in these energetic reserves may be an important part of the cold-hardening mechanisms to cope with the fluctuations of low temperatures causing cold-shock or chilling injury.

TI  - Ecological genetics of abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila falleni: A pleiotropic link to nematode parasitism
VL  - 58
IS  - 3
SP  - 587-596
AB  - Drosophila falleni belongs to the quinaria species group, whose species vary considerably in patterns of wing and abdominal pigmentation. Drosophila falleni itself exhibits substantial variation among wild flies in abdominal spotting patterns. A selection experiment revealed that natural populations of D. falleni harbor high levels of genetic variation for spot number; in 10 generations of selection modal spot number within populations declined from 18 (the modal number in wild-caught females) to as low as zero. Rearing flies at different temperatures shows that some of the variation among wild flies is likely to reflect variation in the environmental conditions under which they developed. Fitness assays did not reveal any cost of reduced spot number with respect to development time, adult survival, or female fecundity. However, spotless flies were almost twice as susceptible to infection by the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium. Thus, selection exerted by nematode parasites may influence pigmentation patterns and other, genetically correlated traits in natural populations D. falleni.

TI  - Thermoelastic instability in a thin layer sliding between two half-planes: Transient behaviour
VL  - 36
IS  - 3
SP  - 205-212
AB  - The susceptibility of brakes and clutches to the known phenomenon of frictionally-excited thermoelastic instability is estimated studying the interface temperature and pressure evolution with time. A simple model has been considered where a layer with half-thickness a slides with speed V between two rigid and non-conducting half-planes. The advantage of this fairly simple model is that it permits us to deduce analytically the critical conditions for the onset of instability, that is the relation between the critical speed V-cr and the growth rate b of the interface temperature and pressure. It has then been verified that as the thickness a reduces the system becomes more and more prone to instability, and that a symmetrical pressure/temperature distribution at the layer interfaces can be more unstable than an antisymmetrical one. Moreover, the analysis of the evolution of the system beyond the critical conditions has shown that even if low frequency perturbations are associated with small critical speed, they might be less critical than high frequency perturbations if the working sliding speed is much larger than the actual critical speed of the system.

TI  - Daily activity, thermoregulation and water loss in the tiger beetle Cicindela hybrida
VL  - 44
IS  - 3
SP  - 376-389
AB  - 1. The tiger beetle Cicindela hybrida is a diurnal predator inhabiting open sandy areas. The activity pattern on a sunny day in May with a mean maximum surface temperature of 40°C is described (Fig. 2). The inactive period is spent in burrows in the sand and it is suggested that a threshold of 19°C releases the daily round of activity (Fig. 5). The animals appear on the sand between 7.00 and 10.00 and the number reaches a maximum at 34-42°C (surface temp.). The duration of the activity period is indirectly determined by the number of available prey which is maximal at 36°C and decreases both at higher and lower temperatures. Mean onset and termination of activity occur at about 28°C (surface temp.) when the expected capture rate is 3 per hour. In actograph experiments, onset was controlled by the illumination and occurred several hours before "dawn" (Fig. 9). 2. The preferred body temperature is at about 35°C and thermoregulatory behaviour patterns are used in order to approach this. At low ambient temperatures, body temperature is increased by sun-basking, while at high temperatures stilting is used to prevent it from increasing above 35°C. If the temperature becomes intolerably high, the animals dig into the sand (Figs. 8, 16). Measurements of body temperatures in the field show that tiger beetles have partial regulation (Fig. 10) and it is suggested that this is because the cost of thermoregulation is low, but prey is not abundant enough to allow a full exploitation of this, and predation (hunger) interferes with the thermoregulation. 3. An estimation of the daily water loss under field conditions is presented based on measurements of the water loss in the laboratory at different temperatures and relative humidities. These values are weighted by the times actually spent at different combinations in the field (Figs. 17, 19). The loss amounts to about 10% per day of initial body weight, and it is concluded that tiger beetles have not evolved any special adaptations with respect to this factor. © 1980 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Does the probabilistic maturation reaction norm approach disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic change?
VL  - 335
SP  - 295-300
AB  - Two-dimensional probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) define the probability that individuals mature as a function of age and size. PMRNs have recently been used to derive empirical support for the hypothesis that high fishing mortality has induced genetic change towards earlier maturation in exploited populations. However, the 2-dimensional PMRN method does not, strictly speaking, disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic change in maturation. Instead, it disentangles the contribution of variation in growth and mortality from other sources of variation contributing to changes in maturation. After removing the contribution of variation in growth and mortality, any remaining change is not necessarily purely genetic. Environmental factors may exist that directly affect the propensity to mature at a certain size and age. An observed trend in the size-age PMRN may therefore be partly or fully explained by a co-incidental trend in an (environmental) factor. As pointed out by Grift et al. (2007; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 334:213-224), such co-dependence is captured conceptually by multi-dimensional PMRNs, as opposed to 2-dimensional (size-age) PMRNs, where the higher dimensions represent the relevant variables. Dimensions that may partly or fully explain the observed trends in size-age PMRNs, other than evolution, include temperature, polluting endocrine-disrupting chemicals, the social structure of the population, and body condition; changes in the last two may be fisheries-induced. To illustrate these views, I re-analysed data on North Sea plaice, and demonstrated that temperature explains part of the shift in the size-age PMRN but that a residual shift remains. The latter finding supports the hypothesis of genetic change. © Inter-Research 2007.

VL  - 6
IS  - 3
SP  - 355-368
AB  - The endangered Socorro Isopod, Thermosphaeroma thermophilum, is endemic to a single thermal spring in Socorro, NM. This species is cannibalistic, with males more cannibalistic than females, and with females and juveniles more vulnerable than males as prey. In 1990, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, created the Socorro Isopod Propagation Facility (SIPF) near the natural habitat, Sedillo Spring (SS), to increase total population size and to examine the effects of habitat heterogeneity on population growth. We report the genetic and morphological effects of this experiment, using the natural population as a control. Captive subpopulations experienced bottlenecks of known intensity and duration, as well as different intensities of cannibalism. Using 57 AFLP markers, we show that in 6 years (1990-1996), captive subpopulations diverged significantly from the natural population. Also during this 6-year period, body lengths of captive isopods diverged nearly 2-fold from the natural population, evidently because cannibalism and thus selection favoring large size was more intense in captive subpopulations than in nature. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that cannibalism and the apparent response to selection on body size became variable among captive subpopulations when physical structure was added to three of the four SIPF pools in April 1997. As expected if cannibalism was the source of selection for large body size, by August 1998 (15 months = 7-8 generations), the rate at which body size increased became inversely proportional to the amount of physical structure within pools. Although we are unable to separate the specific effects of population subdivision and cannibalism, our results show that these conditions in combination caused rapid changes in genetic variation and the external morphology of these captive subpopulations. Our results have important implications for future attempts to manage and propagate endangered species. © Springer 2005.

VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 497-507
AB  - Organisms have a limited number of responses that enhance survival in changing environments. They can: 1. Cope within existing physiological flexibility; 2. Adapt to changing conditions; or 3. Migrate to sites that allow survival. Species inhabiting coastal seabed sites around Antarctica have poorer physiological capacities to deal with change than species elsewhere. They die when temperatures are raised by only 5-10°C above the annual average, and many species lose the ability to perform essential functions, e.g. swimming in scallops or burying in infaunal bivalve molluscs when temperatures are raised only 2-3°C. The ability to adapt, or evolve new characters to changing conditions depends, at least in part, on generation time. Antarctic benthic species grow slowly and develop at rates often x5-x10 slower than similar temperate species. They also live to great age, and exhibit deferred maturity. Longer generation times reduce the opportunities to produce novel mutations, and result in poorer capacities to adapt to change. Intrinsic capacities to colonize new sites and migrate away from deteriorating conditions depend on adult abilities to locomote over large distances, or for reproductive stages to drift for extended periods. The slow development of Antarctic benthic species means their larvae do spend extended periods in the water column. However, whereas most continents have coastlines extending over a wide range of latitude, Antarctica is almost circular in outline, is isolated from other oceans by the circumpolar current, and its coastline covers few degrees of latitude. Thus in a warming environment there are fewer places to migrate to. On all three major criteria Antarctic benthic species appear less capable than species elsewhere of responding to change in ways that can enhance survival. © Antarctic Science Ltd.

TI  - Modification of the ribosome and the translational machinery during reduced growth due to environmental stress
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - Escherichia coli strains normally used under laboratory conditions have been selected for maximum growth rates and require maximum translation efficiency. Recent studies have shed light on the structural and functional changes undergone by the translational machinery in E. coli during heat and cold shock and upon entry into stationary phase. In these situations both the composition and the partitioning of this machinery into the different pools of cellular ribosomes are modified. As a result, the translational capacity of the cell is dramatically altered. This review provides a comprehensive account of these modifications, regardless of whether or not their underlying mechanisms and their effects on cellular physiology are known. Not only is the composition of the ribosome modified upon entry into stationary phase, but the modification of other components of the translational machinery, such as elongation factor Tu (EFTu) and tRNAs, has also been observed. Hibernation-promoting factor (HPF), paralog protein Y (PY), and ribosome modulation factor (RMF) may also be related to the general protection against environmental stress observed in stationary-phase E. coli cells, a role that would not be revealed necessarily by the viability assays. Even for the bestcharacterized ribosome-associated factors induced under stress (RMF, PY, and initiation factors), we are far from a complete understanding of their modes of action. © 2013 American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 41
IS  - 9
SP  - 765-780
AB  - New results acquired in the coesite-bearing terrane of the Dora-Maira massif, Italian Western Alps, indicate that the UHP unit extends over less than 45 km2 and is bounded by two lower-grade continental units. The contact to the footwall unit is a late, lowangle, top-to-the-SW extensional one, which probably cuts across the original thrust contact. The protolith of the pyrope “whiteschist” of the UHP unit is shown to be the metasomatic transformation product of granitic rock. Nearend member magnesiochloritoid and magnesiostaurolite occur in pyrope megablasts. Ordering in mag-nesiostaurolite leads to cross-hatched twinning and superstructures with either a doubled a or doubled c parameter. The Si3.5 phengite-3T from the same whiteschist contains nano- to microscale quartz platelets and talc layers parallel to (001) of the host mica, interpreted as in situ decompression products of the mica. Some of the pyrope megablasts contain late, crack-related granulite-facies mineral assemblages, which reflect very low H2O activities as a result of local closed-system evolution at temperatures as low as 550 to 600°C. Thermobarometry on successive mineral generations in the dark- and light-colored UHP eclogites (probably former dikes and/or volcanic tuffs with sedimentary components) better constrains the prograde path and confirms that decompression took place at temperatures just slightly higher than during burial. The geochemistry of the main rock types in this piece of subducted continental crust shows no evidence of interaction with mantle material. Localscale fluid evolution and control by deformation seem to be a general feature. New geochronological and fission-track data imply very high uplift rates, on the order of 2.2 cm/y. © 1999 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Distinct mechanisms underlying tolerance to intermittent and constant hypoxia in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
AB  - Background: Constant hypoxia (CH) and intermittent hypoxia (IH) occur during several pathological conditions such as asthma and obstructive sleep apnea. Our research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to injury or adaptation to hypoxic stress using Drosophila as a model system. Our current genome-wide study is designed to investigate gene expression changes and identify protective mechanism(s) in D. melanogaster after exposure to severe (1% O2) intermittent or constant hypoxia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our microarray analysis has identified multiple gene families that are up- or down-regulated in response to acute CH or IH. We observed distinct responses to IH and CH in gene expression that varied in the number of genes and type of gene families. We then studied the role of candidate genes (up-or down-regulated) in hypoxia tolerance (adult survival) for longer periods (CH-7 days, IH-10 days) under severe CH or IH. Heat shock proteins upregulation (specifically Hsp23 and Hsp70) led to a significant increase in adult survival (as compared to controls) of Pelement lines during CH. In contrast, during IH treatment the up-regulation of Mdr49 and l(2)08717 genes (P-element lines) provided survival advantage over controls. This suggests that the increased transcript levels following treatment with either paradigm play an important role in tolerance to severe hypoxia. Furthermore, by over-expressing Hsp70 in specific tissues, we found that up-regulation of Hsp70 in heart and brain play critical role in tolerance to CH in flies. Conclusions/Significance: We observed that the gene expression response to IH or CH is specific and paradigm-dependent. We have identified several genes Hsp23, Hsp70, CG1600, l(2)08717 and Mdr49 that play an important role in hypoxia tolerance whether it is in CH or IH. These data provide further clues about the mechanisms by which IH or CH lead to cell injury and morbidity or adaptation and survival. Copyright: © 2009 Azad et al.

VL  - 56

SP  - 119-137
AB  - The computational burden associated with applications of the Tolerable Windows Approach (TWA) considerably exceeds that of traditional integrated assessments of global climate change. As part of the ICLIPS (Integrated Assessment of Climate Protection Strategies) project, a computationally efficient climate model has been developed that can be included in integrated assessment models of any kind. The ICLIPS climate model (ICM) is implemented in GAMS. It is driven by anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons, S(F)6, and SO2. The output includes transient patterns of near-surface air temperature, total column-integrated cloud cover fraction, precipitation, humidity, and global mean sea-level rise. The carbon cycle module explicitly treats the nonlinear sea water carbon chemistry and the nonlinear CO2 fertilized biosphere uptake. Patterns of the impact-relevant climate variables are derived form empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and scaled by the principal component of temperature change. The evolution of the latter is derived from a box-model-type differential analogue to its impulse response function convolution integral. We present a description of the ICM components and some results to demonstrate the model's applicability in the TWA setting.

TI  - Heritable chilling tolerance improvement in rice through somaclonal variation and cell line selection
VL  - 44
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-105
AB  - Embryo-derived calli of four rice varieties (Oryza sativa L.) were submitted to different continuous or discontinuous periods of chilling stress at 4°C, with a total length varying from 2 to 6 weeks. Other calli were cultivated during different times without cold stress. The reduction of plant regeneration percentages induced by low temperature was more pronounced in the more cold-sensitive varieties. Regenerated plants (RO) and their descendants in R1, R2 and R3 generations were cold-screened together with control plants. A mass selection was applied to the control plants during three successive generations. In all varieties, significantly higher chilling survival rates were obtained in R3 with in vitro grown plants than with control plants. Higher plant survival rates were obtained with the more chilling-sensitive varieties when a short discontinuous chilling treatment or no treatment had been applied, with the intermediate variety with short or intermediate treatments, and with the more cold-tolerant variety with longer, continuous treatments. The relative importance of pre-existing versus in vitro-induced variation and of epigenetic versus heritable variation, along with the significance of such cold tolerance improvement for breeding purposes are discussed.

TI  - Temperature of egg incubation determines sex in Alligator mississippiensis
VL  - 296
IS  - 5860
SP  - 850-853
AB  - The factors controlling sexual differentiation in crocodilians are unknown, but heteromorphic sex chromosomes are absent from all species1. Nichols and Chabreck2 speculated that the sex of Alligator mississippiensis was not rigidly determined at the time of hatching but could be influenced by the post-hatching environment. They presented little evidence to support their hypothesis3 (no histological sections of hatchling gonads, no indication of the sex ratio at hatching), and their study failed to take account of habitat preferences of adult male and female alligators 4. Here we demonstrate by laboratory and field experiments, that in A. mississippiensis: (1) Sex is fully determined at the time of hatching and naturally irreversible thereafter, and depends on the temperature of egg incubation, temperatures ≤30 °C producing all females, ≥34 °C yielding all males. (2) The temperature-sensitive period is between 7 and 21 days of incubation. (3) Natural nests constructed on levees are hotter (34 °C) than those constructed on wet marsh (30 °C), thus the former hatch males and the latter females. (4) The natural sex ratio at hatching is five females to 1 male. (5) Females hatched from eggs incubated at 30 °C weigh significantly more than males hatched from eggs incubated at 34 °C. This weight difference constitutes a possible selective evolutionary advantage of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in alligators in that females become large and sexually mature as early as possible. The occurrence of TSD in alligators has wide-ranging implications for embryological, teratological, molecular, evolutionary, conservation and farming studies as well as for theories relating to the extinction of other Archosaurs. © 1982 Nature Publishing Group.

TI  - Genetics, fertility behaviour and molecular marker analysis of a new TGMS line, TS6, in rice
VL  - 123

SP  - 235-240
AB  - The thermosensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) system has great potential for revolutionizing hybrid rice production through simple, less expensive and more efficient seed production technology. For the successful utilization of this novel male sterility system, knowledge of the breeding and fertility behaviour of a TGMS line is essential. In this study, the fertility transformation behaviour, the critical fertility and sterility temperatures and the mode of inheritance of male sterility were studied for a new TGMS line, TS6, identified at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India. The pollen and spikelet fertilities recorded on plants raised at fortnightly intervals revealed that this line was completely sterile for 78 consecutive days (35/22 to 32/23degreesC, maximum/minimum temperatures) and reverted to fertile when the temperature was 30/18degreesC. It remained fertile continuously for 69 days and the maximum pollen and spikelet fertilities recorded were 75 and 70%, respectively. The fertility was highly influenced by daily maximum temperature followed by average and minimum temperatures. It was not influenced by relative humidity, sunshine hours or photoperiod. The critical temperature inducing sterility and fertility was 26.7 and 25.5degreesC, respectively. The male sterility in TS6 was inherited as a monogenic recessive in the F-2 and BC1 populations of TS6 x MRST9 as well as TS6 x IR68281B. Using bulked segregant analysis on an F-2 population of TS6 x MRST9, an RAPD marker, OPC05(2962), was identified to be associated with TGMS in TS6.

TI  - Temperature coupling as an emergent property: Parallel thermal effects on male song and female response do not contribute to species recognition in an acoustic moth
VL  - 61
IS  - 7
SP  - 1590-1599
AB  - Temperature coupling exists when changes in male signal production with temperature are paralleled by changes in female response. Such thermal effects have been observed in various ectothermic animals producing acoustic, visual, and electric signals in which the signal rate may be subject to stabilizing selection imposed by female preference. Often, coupling was considered as an adaptive function wherein male and female thermal effects coevolved under selection pressure favoring species recognition, although this assumption has not been tested definitively. We investigated thermal effects on pulse-pair rate in male song and female acceptance threshold for male song rate in an acoustic moth, Achroia grisella, in which male song rate is subject to directional selection. Male song rate and female acceptance threshold do exhibit parallel increases as temperature rises from 18°C to 30°C, but female thresholds are much lower than male song rates and the thermal effect on female response cannot augment species recognition. In further investigations using inbred lines of A. grisella we found that the male and female thermal effects are genetically correlated, and we discuss the likely sources of this covariance. We consider several explanations for the occurrence of temperature coupling in this species and suggest that it represents an emergent property arising from the neuromuscular responses to temperature that are common to several physiological systems. © 2007 The Author(s).

AB  - We studied the dynamics of the artificial thermal selection of siblings in individual hog slater families at various levels of environmental pollution with cadmium sulfate. At pollutant concentrations below 0.90 mg/1, thermal selection for families resistant to high temperature is inefficient due to the uneven and variable change of organism thermostability in individual families affecting their selective range. A double and higher increase in the dose decreases the mean population thermostability, which increases the expected survival rate of the families with relatively high thermostability. © 1998 MAK Hayka/Interperiodica Publishing.

VL  - 95

SP  - 2372-2377
AB  - Heteroplasmy, the presence of more than one type of mtDNA within cells, is common in animals and has been associated with aging and disease in humans, Changes in the frequencies of mtDNA variants between cell and animal generations thus bears on the evolution of mtDNA and the progression of diverse pathologies. We have used densitometry of Southern blots of individual heteroplasmic Drosophila melanogaster to study the effects of age, increased egg production after mating, and temperature on evolution of heteroplasmy within and between generations, The frequency of the longer mtDNA variant consistently increased between early and late cohorts of F-1 offspring derived from 18 independent heteroplasmic mothers as they aged, Neither temperature (flies maintained at 25 degrees C and 18 degrees C) nor the holding of flies as virgins for 10 days before mating had significant effects on transmission patterns, However, at the ends of their lives, flies that had laid eggs at 25 degrees C had a greater frequency of the long mtDNA than did their siblings who had laid eggs at 18 degrees C, The evolution of heteroplasmy within a generation was studied in samples of siblings that either were mated or held as virgins, and then scored for mtDNA haplotype frequencies at two different ages (day 2 and day 14), Mated flies showed a significantly greater increase in the frequency of the long mtDNA variant with age than did the unmated flies, This system provides a model for the joint analysis of generational and chronological age in the transmission dynamics of a molecular polymorphism.

TI  - GAS‐PRONE SOURCE ROCKS FROM CRATOGENE KAROO BASINS IN TANZANIA
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SP  - 169-184
AB  - Source‐rock quality and organic matter maturity of coals and sediments from several Tanzanian Karoo basins (Permian‐Triassic) have been evaluated by microscopic, pyrolytic and geochemical methods. The intracratonic Ruhuhu Basin (SW Tanzania) differs from two peripheral cratogene basins (Mikumi and Rufiji) with respect to the composition of organic matter, thermal evolution and probable hydrocarbon generation in a tensional tectonic stress field of the East African craton at the Palaeozoic/Mesozoic boundary. The Lower Permian sediments and coals and the Upper Permian sediments of the Ruhuhu Basin exhibit moderate source‐rock properties. They were not subjected to significant subsidence and are moderately mature source rocks. They possibly experienced temperatures in the range 60–110d̀ and vitrinite reflectance values of 0.5—0.8 were attained, thus placing them within the “oil window”. Kerogen Type III is typical for all the basins, and productivity indices indicate moderate to advanced stages of evolution. The coastal basins differ in most parameters. The sediments do not have source‐rock properties. High vitrinite reflectance values (1.0–2.0%) imply a higher degree of thermal maturation, and geochemical results confirm that organic matter in these sediments is postmature, and that hydrocarbon generation, if it occurred at all, ceased some time ago. The assumption of a stable geothermal gradient from Late Palaeozoic to recent times, combined with field observations, leads to the conclusion that no significant overburden has covered the Ruhuhu Basin. A mean subsidence of 1, 5OO‐3,000 m, depending on basin type and stratigraphic position, seems realistic, and this overburden is provided by the sediments of the “younger Karoo cycle” (Triassic). No post‐Karoo sedimentary cover was deposited in the Ruhuhu Basin. Migration probably occurred in Jurassic times, shortly after the end of the Karoo sedimentary cycle, and it is presumed that no significant tectonic activity during the Cenozoic affected pre‐existing accumulations.

AB  - Climate response functions for 125 Pinus contorta populations were updated to assess the impact of 16 climate change scenarios on forest productivity. Productivity was defined as the volume of wood expected per hectare at age 20 and was calculated as the product of predicted individual tree volumes, an initial stocking (1600 trees ha(-1)), and predicted survival. Impact was considered according to the transient effects of a changing climate governed by (1) physiological plasticity in the contemporary generation and (2) long-term evolutionary adjustments that provide adaptedness and optimize productivity in future generations. Direct short-term plastic responses were geographically complex and had repercussions throughout the species' distribution even when temperature fluctuations were small (+/- 1 degrees C) and changes in distribution were inconsequential. Evolutionary adjustments ameliorated negative short-term impacts while enhancing the positive. Scenarios that encompassed predictions for global warming produced short-term impacts that were negative in the south and positive in the north, but subsequent evolutionary adjustments projected substantial increases in productivity. The long-term adjustments may require only 1 to 3 generations in the north but 6 to 12 generations in the south, thereby taking between 200 and 1200 years.

VL  - 124
IS  - 3
SP  - 173-194
AB  - The pumiceous pyroclastic deposits known as the Sandy Bay Tuff on Macauley Island in the Kermadec Group represent a medium-scale silicic eruption in an oceanic subduction setting. The Sandy Bay eruption occurred about 6310 yr BP, forming a large submarine caldera in the summit of the mainly submarine and essentially basaltic Macauley Volcano. The Sandy Bay magma contained < 1 vol% phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite, hypersthene and accessory oxides together with crystals and fragments of basaltic origin and lithic fragments representing an earlier silicic eruptive episode. Although prolonged fractionation of basaltic magma to produce silicic daughter is a generic paradigm, it fails in detail to completely explain the observed compositions of the silicic rocks, the variety of compositions, the distribution of rock types, their aphyric nature. or their volumes. It also encounters difficulties as a general explanation for silicic magmatism in the Kermadec Arc. An alternative, that silicic magmas represent anatexis of underplated basaltic arc crust, explains more of these details and can be modelled as the logical consequence of the thermal evolution of an oceanic arc. In addition, this model can provide an explanation for the onset of silicic magmatism at the current stage in the evolution of the arc. A precondition for anatectic melting in an oceanic arc is the development of a suitable source at the base of the arc crust; this takes of the order of 10(6) years. The onset of silicic magmatism creates an infertile residue and complementary silicic magmas. Separation of silicic magma from its source and its rise into the upper crust removes heat from the system. Continuation of silicic magmatism depends on replenishment of fertile arc material. An alternative is that generation of silicic magmas is limited to a window of opportunity at an adolescent stage in the evolution of an oceanic arc. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The relative importance of genetic and environmental factors for explaining differences in trait distributions between populations is one of the major issues in evolutionary biology. In ectotherms, temperature can have a major impact on morphology, physiology, and life history strategies, and has often been inferred to explain differences between populations. In species with active thermoregulation, however, the ambient temperature may not be as important as the opportunity for thermoregulation. We studied growth in juvenile common lizards (Lacerta vivipara) originating from two environments differing in such thermal opportunity (i.e. day length). The populations differed significantly in their norms of reaction, with lizards experiencing long days in the wild showing a steeper increase in growth rate with increasing thermal opportunity. The environment with longer days also has a lower mean temperature tn the wild, and in accordance with evolutionary predictions, lizards from this population had higher endurance at low temperatures. Both populations showed genetic variation in degree of phenotypic plasticity in growth rate as evident from the extensive crossing in norms of reaction.

VL  - 20

SP  - 235-257
AB  - Habitat selection behavior is affected by complex interplays between competing requirements. Here we combine field observations with laboratory experiments to examine how thermal benefits and predator avoidance influences habitat selection by different color morphs of the pygmy grasshopper Tetrix undulata. The composition of substrate types and surface temperatures in areas selected by free-ranging individuals did not reflect relative availability, and varied among morphs and sexes. Surface temperatures of selected habitats deviated less from the range of preferred body temperatures than would result from a random utilization of surface temperatures, suggesting that grasshoppers selected habitats with thermal properties which were suitable for maintaining preferred body temperatures. The thermal property of habitats occupied by different color morphs suggests that darker morphs (which absorb more solar radiation) selected cooler habitats to avoid overheating. Dissimilarities in substrate use among color morphs in the field and laboratory emphasize a role also of predator avoidance by background matching for habitat choice. The degree of habitat selectivity was lowest in the striped morph, supporting the notion that a disruptive color pattern may constitute a solution to the trade-off between relative crypsis in different visual backgrounds. Finally, individuals modified their habitat use when subjected to elevated risk of predation, showing that habitat choice is governed by conflicting priorities. Collectively, our findings suggest that, as a result of direct and indirect effects of coloration on performance, alternative color morphs use different solutions to the trade-off between competing requirements. Our results also lend support to the notion that relative fitness of alternative color morphs and sexes may be dependent on microhabitat selection, as predicted by the theory of multiple niche polymorphisms. © Springer 2006.

VL  - 149

SP  - 152-156
AB  - An evolutionary method is proposed for minimising the operational cost in the scheduling of hydrothermal systems with multiple storage. The method combines the advantages of constructive dynamic programming and evolutionary programming. Instead of evolving the primal variables such as water releases and thermal generator outputs, it evolves the piecewise linear convex cost-to-go functions (i.e. the water value curves). The multistage problem of hydrothermal scheduling is thus decomposed into many smaller one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for large complex hydrothermal system with cascaded and pumped storages.

Mitotic gynogenesis diploid (mitotic-G2N) as first generation was produced by suppression of the first cleavage of the eggs inseminated with UV-irradiated sperm of rainbow trout by hydrostatic pressure shock. The yield of apparently normal gynogenetic embryos was 2.26% when the eggs were shocked at 650 kg/cm2 of hydrostatic pressure for 6 min at 5h 30 min (approximately 68h°C in cumulative temperature) after insemination. Homozygous evidence of gynogenetic juveniles was demonstrated by the segregation of Idh-3 and Pgm-1 loci. Five homozygous inbred strains were produced from the eggs of homozygous gynogenetic females by retaining the second polarbody, while outbred controls were produced for each strain by crossing with males of other strains. The clonal proof of these strains was demonstrated by the immunological acceptance of operculum allografts from inbred sisters. Similar survivals were shown among clones produced by mothers from identical strain. On the other hand, various survivals were seen between the clones using maternal parents from different strains. These results suggested that the line selection was a vital factor in clone production. © 1994, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study, conducted as a joint undertaking by the LCPC laboratory and the Quebec Transportation Ministry's Roads Laboratory Division (DLC/MTQ), has enabled evaluating various methods for modeling pavement evolution, in particular by testing their applicability to the data stemming from a test-section monitoring program. Three methods have been considered herein; they have been derived from: 1) association of an iterative adjustment process with a multilinear regression; 2) application of "survival laws" theory; and 3) non-linear regression. Each of these three methods is discussed in depth and it will be shown both how and to what extent they enable identifying the set of variables that govern pavement behavior (the so-called "explanatory" variables). These methods then get applied to data yielded from the Quebec Transportation Ministry's test section monitoring program in order to model the evolution of thermal shrinkage cracking on flexible pavements (i.e. pavements containing thick bituminous layers). This study has demonstrated both the importance and difficulty involved in identifying the explanatory variables behind the trends encountered during modeling. To overcome at least in part this difficulty, a so-called "robust" section hypothesis has been introduced; its purpose is intended to incorporate the explanatory variables heretofore unidentified and hence correlate with a greater level of precision the behavior of a given family with that of a specific section in this family.

SP  - 1587-1593
AB  - Objective. To analyze the feeding behavior of 50 Peltocephalus dumerilianus hatchlings (Testudines Podocnemididae) under different temperature conditions in laboratory. Materials and methods. The individuals for this experiment were obtained by incubation in the laboratory. They were divided randomly into 5 groups. Temperature trials were conducted for 2 months with 3 repetitions per week, using electric heaters. Temperatures were recorded continuously using a digital thermometer -10 to + 60 degrees C (+/- 0.1 degrees C). Temperatures were increased 0.25 degrees C every 10 minutes until reaching the selected temperature, which was then maintained for 60 minutes for each test. The temperatures selected for tests, were 26 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 38 degrees C, with an ambient temperature of 26.8 degrees C. We evaluated: feeding duration (in minutes), consumption (in volume), the time which turtles began agonistic behavior, and two characteristic displays: biting and disputes over food. Results. In general all parameters were significant, the higher the temperature the longer the time of ingestion; the lower the temperature the lower the consumption volume; the lower the temperature the greater the time to initiation of agonistic behavior, demonstrating an inverse relationship. Conclusions. There was a direct relationship between environmental temperature and feeding processes. Temperature was also related to basic aspects of behavior during agonistic displays.

AB  - Aims: In previous studies the microbial kinetics of Escherichia coli K12 have been evaluated under static and dynamic conditions (Valdramidis et al. 2005, 2006). An acquired microbial thermotolerance following heating rates lower than 0.82°C min-1 for the studied micro-organism was observed. Quantification of this induced physiological phenomenon and incorporation, as a model building block, in a general microbial inactivation model is the main outcome of this work. Methods and Results: The microbial inactivation rate observed (kobs) under time-varying temperature conditions is studied and expressed as a function of the heating rate (dT/ dt). Hereto, a model building block related to the microbial physiology (kphys) under stress conditions is developed. Evaluation of the performance of the developed mathematical approach depicts that physiological adaptation is an essential issue to be considered when modelling microbial inactivation. Conclusions: Consideration, at a mathematical level, of microbial responses resulting in physiological adaptations contribute to the reliable quantification of the safety risks during food processing. Significance and Impact of the Study: By taking into account the physiological adaptation, the microbiological evolution during heat processing can be accurately assessed, and overly conservative or fail dangerous food processing designs can be avoided. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 83

SP  - 460-468
AB  - In order to explain the worldwide latitudinal distribution and seasonal fluctuations in In(2L)t frequencies in Drosophila melanogaster, fitness differences among In(2L)t and Standard (ST) homo-and heterokaryotypes under high-temperature conditions were determined. Viabilities were measured for high-temperature treatment started at different juvenile stages. The capacity to restore fertility after high-temperature treatment was measured for adults and juveniles. Furthermore, genetic adaptation for increased temperature resistance for these traits was determined for strains which were reared at 33 degrees C for 10 generations. Whereas larva-pupa survival rates were high, highest juvenile mortalities and strongest karyotypic effects were observed during the pupal stage when preceding larval stages were reared at 33 degrees C. ST karyotypes showed lowest viabilities. Although mating rate was hardly influenced, sterility was induced for females and males after high-temperature treatment of adults as well as juveniles. Subsequent transfer to 25 degrees C, however, resulted in restored fertility in some of the individuals, depending on the length of the recovery period. Fertility restoration was significantly higher for heterokaryotype males and females. Heterokaryotype superiority for restored fertility as well as for viability was positively correlated with severity of the treatment. Tell generations of selection at 33 degrees C resulted in significant improvement of juvenile survival and fertility restoration for all karyotypes. These fitness components were positively correlated (r = 0.91; P < 0.001), which might suggest pleiotropic effects. It is concluded that the capacity to restore fertility after heat stress is an important fitness component, especially with respect to the In(2L)r polymorphism The observed heterokaryotypic superiority fits with the idea that the latitudinal distribution of In(2L)t frequencies is maintained by balancing selection, with equilibrium values decreasing with latitude.

TI  - Plasticity of size and growth in fluctuating thermal environments: Comparing reaction norms and performance curves
VL  - 44
IS  - 6
SP  - 450-460
AB  - Ectothermic animals exhibit two distinct kinds of plasticity in response to temperature: Thermal performance curves (TPCs), in which an individual's performance (e.g., growth rate) varies in response to current temperature; and developmental reaction norms (DRNs), in which the trait value (e.g., adult body size or development time) of a genotype varies in response to developmental temperatures experienced over some time period during development. Here we explore patterns of genetic variation and selection on TPCs and DRNs for insects in fluctuating thermal environments. First, we describe two statistical methods for partitioning total genetic variation into variation for overall size or performance and variation in plasticity, and apply these methods to available datasets on DRNs and TPCs for insect growth and size. Our results indicate that for the datasets we considered, genetic variation in plasticity represents a larger proportion of the total genetic variation in TPCs compared to DRNs, for the available datasets. Simulations suggest that estimates of the genetic variation in plasticity are strongly affected by the number and range of temperatures considered, and by the degree of nonlinearity in the TPC or DRN. Second, we review a recent analysis of field selection studies which indicates that directional selection favoring increased overall size is common in many systems - that bigger is frequently fitter. Third, we use a recent theoretical model to examine how selection on thermal performance curves relates to environmental temperatures during selection. The model predicts that if selection acts primarily on adult size or development time, then selection on thermal performance curves for larval growth or development rates is directly related to the frequency distribution of temperatures experienced during larval development. Using data on caterpillar temperatures in the field, we show that the strength of directional selection on growth rate is predicted to be greater at the modal (most frequent) temperatures, not at the mean temperature or at temperatures at which growth rate is maximized. Our results illustrate some of the differences in genetic architecture and patterns of selection between thermal performance curves and developmental reaction norms.

TI  - Potamodromy in Salmonidae—Living and Moving in the Fast Lane
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 1029-1045
AB  - Potamodromy is examined for river-dwelling populations of 13 coregonine species, 2 thymalline species, and 19 salmonine species to uncover common and contrasting migratory patterns in flowing waters. Members of these subfamilies probably have recolonized rivers and streams repeatedly over the past million years or more in the face of several glaciations, ice recessions, and interglacial periods. To do so they may have evolved migratory behavioral patterns adapted to life in fast-running, cold, highly turbid, changeable, and unpredictable lotic systems. Their migratory behavior coalesces into three cyclic patterns of movement (trophic, refuge, and reproductive) to gain access at appropriate times in their life histories or seasonal periods to three patchily distributed but critical types of habitat (feeding, survival, and spawning). Trophic and refuge movements to respective feeding and survival habitats show considerable site fidelity and, though changing over individual life spans of some species considered, remain similar between successive generations. Reproductive movements to spawning habitats show high levels of site fidelity (homing) from parent to offspring and for repeat-spawning individuals. Specialized features of potamodromy are briefly discussed in relation to long-term occupation of riverine systems. Comments are made on the complexity of salmonid potamodromy in relation to fisheries management practices. © 1997 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 270
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-56
AB  - Two modes of sex determination occur in squamates: genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature‐dependent sex determination (TSD). Within each of these two major modes, there are many different variants, or mechanisms. Male heterogamety, female heterogamety, multiple sex chromosome systems, and homomorphic sex chromosome systems are all types of GSD found in squamates. Two patterns of TSD have been reported. Only three snakes have been investigated for their sex‐determining mechanisms, each having GSD, although incubation temperature does cause differential mortality and affects post‐hatching physiology. Less than 50 lizard species have been investigated, but there is considerable diversity in the sex‐determining mechanisms reported thus far. Apparently, TSD (and/or GSD) has evolved multiple times within a given taxon. Presently, both GSD and TSD are found in the Agamidae, Eublepharidae, and Gekkonidae, and possibly in the Iguanidae, Lacertidae, and Varanidae as well. Only GSD has been reported for the Scincidae and Teiidae. Correlations within the Eublepharidae suggest an adaptive explanation for the evolution of sexdetermining mechanisms; a shift from male‐larger dimorphism to female‐larger (or no sexual size dimorphism) is accompanied by a shift in sex‐determining mode. These shifts are in agreement with similar correlations observed in turtles. © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1994 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - The strain Rhodococcus erythropolis E-15, which grows well on hydrocarbons at law positive temperatures, was selected by screening a collection of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria. This strain was introduced into tundra soil contaminated with oil (I kg/m(2)). The natural hydrocarbon-oxidizing microflora of non-polluted tundra soils (isolated on liquid media) accounted for 10(4) cells per g and mainly contained rhodococci. All indigenous rhodococci were of the S-type, with low oxidizing: activity toward hydrocarbons. Fertilizing the soil only slightly increased (by 10%) the rate of hydrocarbon biodegradation by indigenous oil-oxidizing microflora. Five weeks after introduction of the active strain, the soil content of hydrocarbons decreased by approximately 40%. The concentration of the introduced bacterium remained 10(7) cells/g even seven weeks after the beginning of the experiment.

AB  - This paper is a report on a research project. It shows how the past experience of adaptive strategies that have evolved in the long history of survival under hazardous conditions is inspiring for us in facing future uncertainty. Based on a study of several ancient cities in the Yellow River floodplain, this paper discusses the disastrous experience of floods and waterlogging and finds three major adaptive landscape strategies: siting on high ground, constructing walls and protective dikes, and reserving or digging ponds within cities. These adaptive strategies create three types of water city: water-within-city, city-in-water, and ying-yang-city. It is argued that all these traditional experiences and landscape heritages help us to understand the vernacular cultural landscape of cities in the Yellow River floodplain, and that they have important value for landscape architecture and urban planning as universally applicable strategies in facing global warming and regional climate change as well as practical landscape strategies for better urban design in this region. It is further argued that the water-adaptive landscapes are valuable features of the cultural heritage, and should be integrated into landscape and urban planning for urban development today. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 97
IS  - 2
SP  - 179-185
AB  - Embryonic development times and the stage at which embryonic diapause occurs varied dramatically among 23 populations of the Melanoplus sanguinipes/devastator species complex in California, USA. Grasshoppers were collected from a wide range of latitudes (32-degrees-57N to 41-degrees-20N) and altitudes (10 m to 3031 m), spanning much of the variation in climatic conditions experienced by these insects in California. When reared in a ''common garden'' in the laboratory, total embryonic development times were positively correlated to the mean annual temperature of the habitat from which the grasshoppers were collected (varying from about 19 days to 32 days when reared at 27-degrees-C). These grasshoppers overwinter as diapausing eggs and the proportion of embryonic development completed prior to diapause was significantly higher in populations collected from cool habitats (>70%) than in populations collected from warm environments (<26%). The length of pre-diapause development time is determined by the stage of embryonic development at which diapause occurs, and varies considerably among populations of these grasshoppers; grasshoppers from warmer environments tend to diapause at very early stages of embryogenesis, while grasshoppers from cooler environments diapause at very late stages. The combined effect of variation in embryonic development times and variation in the stage at which diapause occurs results in a dramatic reduction in the time needed to hatch in the spring; populations from warm environments required up to 20 days (at 27-degrees-C) to hatch while populations from cool environments required as few as 5 days to complete embryonic development prior to hatching. Egg size also varied significantly among populations, but tended to be larger in populations with shorter embryonic development times. Significant family effects were observed for development time and stage of diapause, suggesting significant heritabilities for these traits, although maternal effects may also contribute to family level variation. We interpret these findings to support the hypothesis that embryonic development time and the stage of embryonic diapause have evolved as adaptations to prevailing season lengths in the study populations.

TI  - Exophenotypic effects of chromosomal change: The case of Leptysma argentina (orthoptera)
VL  - 79
IS  - 6
SP  - 631-637
AB  - Most of the literature about phenotypic effects of chromosomal change has dealt with its effects on chiasma frequency and/or distribution, whereas whether or not they affect the exophenotype has received less attention and has remained controversial. In the present paper morphometrical variables of the species Leptysma argentina were analysed in connection with chromosome polymorphisms for a centric fusion and a supernumerary segment. The centric fusion between pairs 3 and 6 (fusion 3/6) and a supernumerary segment in the smallest pair of the complement (s(1)) were consistently proved to have effects on chiasma frequency and position; preliminary analyses had shown, however, that fusion 3/6 could be correlated with some effects on body size (Colombo, 1989). In the present paper the analysis of femur, tibia, prothorax and total length as well as prothorax height on larger samples were consistent in showing that both polymorphisms are positively correlated with increasing total length; in the case of the supernumerary segment, however, this effect is not constant over all the populations sampled. An adaptive change in body size may be achieved through selection on: (i) genetic factors that affect this trait; or (ii) chromosome polymorphisms with exophenotypic effects. This latter case would be more effective, because genetic factors are usually polygenic and hence their response to selection would be slow. It is tempting to say that this could be the case for L. argentina, because in grasshoppers increased body size can be related to tolerance to cold or dry environments.

VL  - 28

SP  - 3979-3994
AB  - We examine the ability of SAR-derived landfast sea ice thermodynamic state surrounding the North Water Polynya to predict the timing of a shallow, stably stratified summer ocean mixed layer in the region. Radarsat-1 ScanSAR is used to derive melt and pond onset dates over landfast sea ice surrounding the polynya, describing its thermodynamic evolution. Salinity and temperature profiles, connected in time and space, are complemented by potential density profiles and mixed layer depths, which describe the evolution of the upper ocean mixed layer between 4 April and 21 July 1998. Surface salinity driven potential density stratification and summer mixed layer depths are temporally coincident. Sea ice-ocean connection is first described at the local scale, then regionally. At the local scale, a reduction in surface salinity occurs between the melt and pond onsets over landfast sea ice. At the polynya scale, interpolated pond onset date is highly effective at predicting the timing of a thin, stably stratified summer ocean mixed layer; this has consequences for the potential prediction of timing of maximum ecosystem productivity.

TI  - Evidence for parallel ecological speciation in scincid lizards of the Eumeces skiltonianus species group (Squamata : Scincidae)
VL  - 56
IS  - 7
SP  - 1498-1513
AB  - We identify instances of parallel morphological evolution in North American scincid lizards of the Eumeces skiltonianus species group and provide evidence that this system is consistent with a model of ecological speciation. The group consists of three putative species divided among two morphotypes, the small-bodied and striped E. skiltonianus and E. lagunensis versus the large-bodied and typically uniform-colored E. gilberti. Members of the group pass through markedly similar phenotypic stages during early development, but differ with respect to where terminal morphology occurs along the developmental sequence. The morphotypes also differ in habitat preference, with the large-bodied gilberti form generally inhabiting lower elevations and drier environments than the smaller, striped morphs. We inferred the phylogenetic relationships of 53 skiltonianus group populations using mtDNA sequence data from the ND4 protein-coding gene and three flanking tRNAs (900 bp total). Sampling encompassed nearly the entire geographic range of the group, and all currently recognized species and subspecies were included. Our results provide strong evidence for parallel origins of three clades characterized by the gilberti morphotype, two of which are nested within the more geographically widespread E. skiltonianus. Eumeces lagunensis was also nested among populations of E. skiltonianus. Comparative analyses using independent contrasts show that evolutionary changes in body size are correlated with differences in adult color pattern. The independently derived association of gilberti morphology with warm, arid environments suggests that phenotypic divergence is the result of adaptation to contrasting selection regimes. We provide evidence that body size was likely the target of natural selection, and that divergences in color pattern and mate recognition are probable secondary consequences of evolving large body size.

TI  - Influence of pregnancy on locomotor and feeding performances of the skink, Mabuya multifasciata: Why do females shift thermal preferences when pregnant?
VL  - 111
IS  - 3
SP  - 188-195
AB  - It has been documented in the many-lined sun skink (Mabuya multifasciata) that pregnant females select lower body temperatures (27.6-30.8 degrees C) than do nonpregnant females and adult males (29.7-35.7 degrees C). We therefore used the skink to test the hypothesis that the maximization of reproductive benefits should be achieved in pregnant females by shifting thermal preferences towards the levels optimal for embryonic development but entailing relatively small costs of reproduction. Data on adult males showed that temperatures maximizing swimming stamina (indicative of locomotor endurance) fell within the range of body temperatures selected by nonpregnant females and adult males. Data on swimming stamina and feeding performance of pregnant females, nonpregnant females and adult males measured at 26 and 30 degrees C showed that: (1) pregnancy impaired locomotor and feeding performances, but such impairments did not persist after parturition; (2) the degree of locomotor impairment during pregnancy was greater at 26 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, but the degree of feeding impairment during pregnancy was greater at 30 degrees C than at 26 degrees C. Pregnant females of M. multifasciata selecting body temperatures at about 29 degrees C could not only produce good-quality offspring in a relatively short gestation length but also reduce reproductive costs associated with locomotor and feeding impairments to some extent. Thus, data from M. multifasciata validate the above hypothesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-67
AB  - In the present work, the viability of the selective fractionation of carbohydrate mixtures (lactose-lactulose) using supercritical CO2 has been evaluated. As a first step towards the optimization of the fractionation process, the composition of the co-solvent used in the supercritical phase was studied by considering different ethanol:water mixtures, which undoubtedly determined the selectivity of the extraction process. The co-solvent which provided a purity higher than 95% in lactulose (a mixture ethanol:water 95:5) was selected to perform the optimization of the extraction conditions able to provide high extraction recoveries. Optimization was carried out using a full factorial (2 levels) design and considering as factors the extraction pressure (from 100 to 300 bar), the extraction temperature (from 60 to 100 degrees C and the modifier flow rate (from 0.2 to 0.4 mL/min, which corresponded to a total co-solvent percentage ranging from 4 to 18 vol.%). The responses evaluated were the amount (mg) of lactulose and lactose extracted and their recoveries (%). The statistical analysis of the results provided mathematical models for each response variable. The corresponding parameters were estimated by multiple linear regression (NILR) and high determination coefficients (higher than 0.98) were obtained. Then, the mathematical model was employed to predict the behavior of the different responses selected, as a function of the main variables involved in the process. The optimum conditions for selectively extracting lactulose with high recoveries were 100 bar, 100 degrees C and 0.2 mL/min of co-solvent (4% modifier in the supercritical phase); at these conditions, a 45% recovery was achieved with a purity higher than 95%.

TI  - Physiological constraints on organismal response to global warming: Mechanistic insights from clinally varying populations and implications for assessing endangerment
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SP  - 135-139
AB  - Recent syntheses indicate that global warming affects diverse biological processes, but also highlight the potential for some species to adapt behaviourally or evolutionarily to rapid climate change. Far less attention has addressed the alternative, that organisms lacking this ability may face extinction, a fate projected to befall one-quarter of global biodiversity. This conclusion is controversial, in part because there exist few mechanistic studies that show how climate change could precipitate extinction. We provide a concrete, mechanistic example of warming as a stressor of organisms that are closely adapted to cool climates from a comparative analysis of organismal tolerance among clinally varying populations along a natural thermal gradient. We found that two montane salamanders exhibit significant metabolic depression at temperatures within the natural thermal range experienced by low and middle elevation populations. Moreover, the magnitude of depression was inversely related to native elevation, suggesting that low elevation populations are already living near the limit of their physiological tolerances. If this finding generally applies to other montane specialists, the prognosis for biodiversity loss in typically diverse montane systems is sobering. We propose that indices of warming-induced stress tolerance may provide a critical new tool for quantitative assessments of endangerment due to anthropogenic climate change across diverse species. © 2005 The Royal Society.

VL  - 189

SP  - 23-37
AB  - The optimal conditions for the retention of the second polar body in sea bass eggs were investigated by altering the timing, intensity and duration of application of pressure and cold shocks. Treatment optima for cold shocks were 0-1 degrees C for 15-20 min at 5 min after fertilisation (a.f.) and 8500 psi for 2 min at 6 min a.f. for pressure shocks. Meiogenesis was obtained by fertilising eggs with UV-irradiated homologous sperm (32,000 erg mm(-2)) and pressure or cold shocking eggs as above. 100% triploidy was induced following definition of liable periods for the disruption of the meiotic spindle obtained in gynogenesis. Ploidy investigations were performed on experimental groups by flow-cytometry. Verification of uniparental transmission in meiogens was carried out by microsatellite marker loci analysis. This work highlights the degree of variation in individual responses of selected broodstock to these agents. Finally, some preliminary results on heterologous fertilisation in sea bass with potential applications for gynogenetic studies are also provided. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The dynamical evolution of the short-period extrasolar planet around ν Andromedae in the pre-main-sequence stage
VL  - 632
IS  - 2
SP  - 1140-1156
AB  - We study the dynamical evolution of short-period planets in the multiple planetary system during the epoch of protostellar disk depletion. Through a detailed case analysis for the triple-planet system around v Andromedae, we identify the necessary condition for the survival of its short-period planet b. In this study, we calculate the planets' orbit evolution including effects of the post-Newtonian potential of the host star, the potential of an evolving disk, and the potential due to the flattening of the star produced by the stellar rotation and the tide from the planet. At its present-day semimajor axis of 0.059 AU, the negligible eccentricity of planet b is most likely damped by the dissipation of the tidal perturbation induced by the star on the planet. But this process also leads to the heating of the planets' interior and probably the inflation of their sizes. If planet b once had an eccentricity greater than 0.1 at its present location, the tidal dissipation process would induce it to overflow its Roche lobe, lose its mass, and undergo an orbital expansion. Using this constraint, we reconstruct the eccentricity evolution of planet b. We find that even if planet b arrives at its present location on a nearly circular orbit, its eccentricity could have been excited by the sweeping secular resonances of two outer planets, c and d, during the disk depletion. In addition to the contribution from the disk potential, the resonant condition is also modified by the precession of planet b due to the post-Newtonian correction and rotational distortion of v And's gravitational potential. Today, the former effect offsets the secular resonance, whereas the latter effect is weak. But during the depletion of the disk, precession due to the relativistic correction is outpaced by that due to the disk potential. The passage of the sweeping secular resonance near the surface of ν And cannot be avoided unless it had a sufficiently fast spin to provide a flattened shape with a finite quadrupole moment, which dominates the precession of the planet's orbit. Finally, we show that the survival of planet b requires its eccentricity to be low at all times, which would be possible only if the spin period of ν And was shorter than 2 days during the depletion of the disk. 2005.

VL  - 56
IS  - 1
SP  - 27-37
AB  - Experiments are described that are to prove that the apparent selective responses at the Adh locus in Drosophila melanogaster are not independent from its genetic background and from the variation at the gene pool level brought about by the changes of selection pressure. The dynamics of allozyme frequencies were observed at the Adh locus, of five metric traits and of reproductive fitness in two synthetic populations of Drosophila melanogaster originated from the same cross between Canton and Oregon strains, homozygotes for different Adh alleles and reared at different temperature (25 °C and 28 °C), until all above mentioned characters showed no more variations. The results obtained by univariate and multivariate statistical analyses can be summarized as follows:- Adhs allele frequency keeps high and reaches very similar values in spite of the different environmental temperatures, whose selective effects at the Adh locus are therefore unlikely; - both populations evolve toward the stabilization of Adh frequencies and other characters with a process strictly dependent on the permanence of coadapted blocks of genes which were contributed to the F2 generation by the parental Canton and which are identified phenotypically by the association of Adhs/s with short wing; - at the stabilization point the flies classified on the basis of their Adh genotype exhibit different shapes, namely their metric phenotypes can be discriminated considering all the respective traits together by means of multivariate analyses. Owing to the presence in the initial populations of heterosis and epistatic interactions between loci, the observed differences between Adh genotype groups should represent the outcome of selection upon coadapted blocks of genes rather than on individual loci. Therefore, these results are argued as further evidence that each Adh genotype can be associated to different gene arrangements and its adaptive value cannot be isolated from that of its genetic background. © 1981 Dr W.

VL  - 66
IS  - 6
SP  - 294-297
AB  - Belgium Two-hundred 40 week old Leghorn-selected line (L.S.L.) laying hens were randomly allotted to five equal groups. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was added at the levels of 0, 200, 400, 600 and 800 mg/kg feed for groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, during 10 weeks of a hot summer in Upper Egypt. The effects of ASA supplementation on feed intake, egg production, egg weight, egg volume, egg specific gravity, egg shell weight, feed conversion efficiency and incidence of mortality were determined. ASA supplementation at the levels of 600 and 800 mg/ kg significantly (P < 0.01) improved the daily feed intake, egg production, eggshell weight and feed conversion efficiency and, in addition, it reduced the incidence of mortality from 15 % in the control group to 5 % in the two highest supplemented groups. The addition of 200 or 400 mg ASA/kg feed resulted in no significant difference in hen performance, although these levels did markedly reduce the incidence of mortality from 15 % to 10 %. ASA can decrease both the detrimental effect of heat stress on the productive performance of hens and the incidence of mortality, though not until after three weeks of supplementation. The optimal level was 600 mg ASA/kg feed.

AB  - An experimental design has been used to develop and optimize a new high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of Vancomycin in an extemporaneous ophthalmic solution. After the preliminary studies and literature review, the optimized method was carried out on a second generation of a C18 reverse-phase column (Luna 150 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size) and using methanol as organic phase, a less toxic solvent than acetonitrile, described in the extended literature. The experimental design consisted of a Placket-Burman design where six different variables were studied (flow rate, mL/min; temperature, °C; pH mobile phase; % buffer solution; wavelength; and injection volume) to obtain the best suitability parameters (Capacity factor-K′, tailing factor, resolution, and theoretical plates). After the optimization of the chromatographic conditions and statistical treatment of the obtained results, the final method uses a mixture of a buffer solution of water-phosphoric acid (85%) (99.83:0.17, v/v) adjusted to pH 3.0 using triethylamine and mixed with methanol (87:13, v/v). The separation is achieved using a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at 35°C. The UV detector was operated at 280 nm. The validation study carried out, demonstrates the viability of the method, obtaining a good selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and sensitivity.

TI  - Growth and thermal stability of interfaces in ion beam sputtered Mo/Si mirrors
VL  - 5963
AB  - In the field of microelectronics, the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography operating at λ,=13,5 nm, appears, today, as the most promising future technology. The viability of this next generation technology has, however, to face several technical issues. Among them, the realisation of highly reflective EUV mirrors is one of the key issues and concerns the mirrors for light transport as well as the lithography masks. In this last case, the mirrors which consist in a periodic Mo/Si multi-layer coating deposited by ion beam sputtering suffer from reflectance limitations and thermal instabilities. In this paper, an experimental investigation on IBS deposited Mo/Si multi-layers is presented. The study is mainly focused on the formation of Mo/Si interfacial zones and their evolution with thermal annealing up to 600°C. Detailed investigations by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy filtering TEM have been performed in association with differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analyses. For the purpose, dedicated samples were prepared enabling the identification of phase transformations occurring during thermal annealing. It will be shown, in particular, how this coupled characterisation approach (TEM+DSC) can help understanding the interface growth in such metal/silicon systems. The characterisation results are presented and discussed.

TI  - Developing the advanced tokamak-recent progress at DIII-D
SP  - 183-189
AB  - The DIII-D tokamak has made a remarkable series of contributions to the fusion science program. These contributions are due to the continual evolution of the experimental systems led by research results and technological developments. The recent completion of core and edge diagnostics allows comprehensive time-dependent profile data, including plasma current and rotation profiles to be available on each discharge. This data combined with rapid mhd calculation of the flux surfaces is used to carry out extensive analysis between discharges (10-15 min cycle) and permits a shot-by-shot strategy to optimize research productivity. The control of the plasma internal profiles has emerged as key in developing advanced tokamak discharges. RF power has become a key tool in achieving this control. The DIII-D ECH system is presently being expanded to a capability of six MW level gyrotrons. The radiative divertor configuration has evolved as an effective tool for edge plasma management. The recent commissioning of the upper outer divertor cryopump and battle along with the existing installation in the lower divertor has allowed understanding of the role of upper and lower divertors, double-null divertors, and the location of the X-point. This fall, installation of an upper inner cryopump and baffle will allow further investigation of the role of pumping of the private flux region of the high triangularity divertor.

AB  - Cold environments impose several ecological and physiological constraints upon arthropods, including reduction of metabolic rate, locomotory activity, and feeding. These result in slow growth rates and extended life cycles. Additionally, the probability of freezing is accentuated at subzero temperatures. Using data for Antarctic mites, the interplay of such constraints is examined, and the resultant ecophysiological adaptations outlined for a common oribatid mite (Alaskozetes antarcticus) of the maritime Antarctic. The synthesis suggests that its survival strategy is comprised of two components. First, the utilization of above-zero temperatures during the short austral summer to maximize growth and production, and thereby reproduce. These processes are aided by an elevation of its standard metabolic rate, commonly termed cold adaptation. Second, the tolerance of freezing temperatures by supercooling of all its postovum life stages throughout the entire year. Its supercooling potential is enhanced by the presence of glycerol and other polyols in the body fluids, the production of which is mediated by environmental temperature and desiccation at low relative humidities. Thus this species, in common perhaps with many other freezing susceptible arthropods, has ensured its survival in southern polar habitats by the evolution of a bipartite adaptational strategy. © 1981.

TI  - Contrasting enrichments in high- and low-temperature mantle xenoliths from Nushan, Eastern China: Results of a single metasomatic event during lithospheric accretion?
VL  - 45

SP  - 321-341
AB  - Distinct equilibration temperatures, deformation and trace element characteristics are observed in amphibole-bearing and amphibole-free peridolite xenoliths from Nushan, Sino-Korean Craton, eastern China. Amphibole-free peridotites are predominantly deformed, fine-grained (similar to1 mm) and equilibrated at 990-1110degreesC. Their cpx are characterized by either light rare earth element (LREE)-depleted or relatively flat REE patterns with only a slight depletion in high field strength elements (HFSE). LREE enrichment is generally associated with Fe-rich samples.. consistent with 'wall-rock' metasomatism adjacent to basaltic veins. In contrast, amphibole-bearing peridotites are less deformed, coarse-grained (>3 mm) and display chemical zonation in the pyroxenes suggesting cooling from 1050 to 850degreesC. Their cpx show a large variation in LREE (Ce-n = 1.7-68) and almost constant heavy rare earth element (HREE) contents (Yb-n = 9(.)8-11(.)6). The highest LREE contents occur in cpx from amphibole-rich samples, coupled with Fe enrichment, strong enrichment in Th and U, and marked depletion in the HFSE. These characteristics may be accounted for by combined 'wall-rock' and 'diffuse' metasomatism involving an agent rich in volatiles and incompatible elements. As such the Nushan xenoliths could represent samples from two spatially separate metasomatic aureoles. Conversely, the cryptic and modal metasomatism could be genetically related, because the amphibole-peridotites and Fe-rich amphibole-free samples show similar Sr-Nd isotopic ranges that are indistinguishable from those of the Cenozoic basalts from eastern China. The different metasomatic assemblage and the trace element composition can be accounted for in terms of P-T control on amphibole stability and progressive chemical evolution of asthenosphere-derived melts during upward migration. Trace element signatures and metasomatic assemblages, together with the fertile composition of the Nushan peridotites, suggest an origin as newly accreted lithosphere rather than as relic cratonic mantle. Metasomatism may have occurred after late Mesozoic lithospheric thinning, which marked a dramatic change in lithospheric architecture beneath the Sino-Korean Craton.

VL  - 78
IS  - 5
SP  - 839-846
AB  - We measured temperature preferences of 12 species of hylid frogs (Litoria and Cyclorana) from northern Australia in a laboratory thermal gradient. These species represented a range of ecological habitat use (aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal), adult body size (0.5-60 g), and cutaneous resistance to water loss (Rc = 0.6-63.1 s cm-1). We found significant differences among species in selected skin temperature and gradient temperature but not in the variances of these measures (an index of precision of temperature selection). The species' differences correlated significantly with cutaneous resistance to water loss, with more-resistant frogs selecting higher skin and substrate temperatures in the thermal gradient, even after phylogenetic relationships are taken into account. Because cutaneous resistance to water loss also correlates with ecological habit (arboreal &gt; terrestrial &gt; aquatic), we suggest that their higher resistance to water loss allows arboreal and terrestrial species better ability to tolerate high temperatures, where growth or locomotory speed may be higher, without the associated risk of desiccation. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 5

SP  - 263-279
AB  - The opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana (formerly M. relicta) performs large amplitude diel vertical migrations in Lake Ontario and its nighttime distribution is influenced by temperature, light and the distribution of its predators and prey. At one location in southeastern Lake Ontario, we measured the vertical distribution of mysids, mysid predators (i.e. planktivorous fishes) and mysid prey (i.e. zooplankton), in addition to light and temperature, on 8 occasions from May to September, 2004 and 2005. We use these data to test 3 different predictive models of mysid habitat selection, based on: (1) laboratory-derived responses of mysids to different light and temperature gradients in the absence of predator or prey cues; (2) growth rate of mysids, as estimated with a mysid bioenergetics model, given known prey densities and temperatures at different depths in the water column; (3) ratio of growth rates (g) and mortality risk (μ) associated with the distribution of predatory fishes. The model based on light and temperature preferences was a better predictor of mysid vertical distribution than the models based on growth rate and g:μ on all 8 occasions. Although mysid temperature and light preferences probably evolved as mechanisms to reduce predation while increasing foraging intake, the response to temperature and light alone predicts mysid vertical distribution across seasons in Lake Ontario. © Inter-Research 2009.

By using a constant dam line (Large White ∗ German Landrace) six sire breeds were included Hampshire, Duroc, Pietrain-NN, Pietrain-nn, Hampshire ∗ Pietrain-nn, Duroc ∗ Hampshire). 18 gilts and 18 castrates of each terminal crossbred were fattened aecording to the guidelines ofthe progeny-Testing. <br><br> In the traits evaluating the Status of PSE (pH, electrical conduetivity, colour, drip loss) the descendants ofthe Pietrain-nn boars clearly decrease. Regarding different characteristics for the loss during heating (cooking loss, grilling loss, Rendement Napole) Duroc and Pietrain-NN sires cause positive and Hampshire sires negative effects. With respect to sensory traits and intramuscular fat content the descendants of Pietrain-nn are the worst and those of Duroc are the best. The latter however provide, together with Duroc ∗ Hampshire offspring, the fattest carcass. © 2000 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - A novel eggplant tissue homogenate-based membrane electrode with high selective response to catechol (5×10-6-2.5×10-5 M concentration) has been constructed by immobilizing tissue of eggplant (Solanum melangena L.) at dissolved oxygen probe. In order to optimize the stability of the electrode, general immobilization techniques are used to secure the eggplant tissue section physically in a gelatin-glutaraldehyde cross-linking matrix. The electrode response was maximum when 50 mM phosphate buffer was used at pH 7.0 and 35°C. The sensor is stable for more than 3 months.

TI  - Predicting the fate of a living fossil: How will global warming affect sex determination and hatching phenology in tuatara?
VL  - 275

SP  - 2185-2193
AB  - How will climate change affect species' reproduction and subsequent survival? In many egg-laying reptiles, the sex of offspring is determined by the temperature experienced during a critical period of embryonic development (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD). Increasing air temperatures are likely to skew offspring sex ratios in the absence of evolutionary or plastic adaptation, hence we urgently require means for predicting the future distributions of species with TSD. Here we develop a mechanistic model that demonstrates how climate, soil and topography interact with physiology and nesting behaviour to determine sex ratios of tuatara, cold-climate reptiles from New Zealand with an unusual developmental biology. Under extreme regional climate change, all-male clutches would hatch at 100% of current nest sites of the rarest species, Sphenodon guntheri, by the mid-2080s. We show that tuatara could behaviourally compensate for the male-biasing effects of warmer air temperatures by nesting later in the season or selecting shaded nest sites. Later nesting is, however, an unlikely response to global warming, as many oviparous species are nesting earlier as the climate warms. Our approach allows the assessment of the thermal suitability of current reserves and future translocation sites for tuatara, and can be readily modified to predict climatic impacts on any species with TSD. © 2008 The Royal Society.

VL  - 92

AB  - Ammonium nitrate (AN) is one of the main nitrogen fertilizers used in fertilization programs. However, AN has some serious disadvantages - being well soluble in water hardly 50% of the N-species contained are assimilated by plants. The second disadvantage of AN is associated with its explosive properties. The aim of this paper was to clarify the influence of different lime-containing substances - mainly Estonian limestone and dolomite - as internal additives on thermal behaviour of AN. Commercial fertilizer grade AN was under investigation. The amount of additives used was 5, 10 or 20 mass%, or calculated on the mole ratio of AN/(CaO, MgO)=2:1 in the blends. Experiments were carried out under dynamic heating condition up to 900°C (10°C min-1) in a stream of dry air or N2 by using Setaram Labsys 2000 equipment coupled to Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR). The results of analyses of the gaseous compounds evolved at thermal treatment of neat AN indicated some differences in the decomposition of AN in air or in N2. At the thermal treatment of AN's blends with CaCO3, MgCO3, limestone and dolomite samples the decomposition of AN proceeds through a completely different mechanism - depending on the origin and the content of additives, partially or completely, through the formation of Mg(NO3)2 and Ca(NO3)2. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics investigations of the temperature dependence of the local ordering in liquid cyclopropane
VL  - 90
IS  - 5
SP  - 817-828
AB  - The structure of the liquid cyclopropane and the evolution of the local ordering with temperature has been investigated along the liquid-vapour coexistence curve between the melting point (T m ≈ 146 K) and room temperature by neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulation. Experimentally, the intramolecular structure factor is well described using the molecular parameters close to those reported from spectroscopic calculations and is found to be almost temperature independent. In contrast, the intermolecular structure factor shows a strong variation in the translational and orientational ordering by cooling the liquid from room temperature to a temperature close to the melting point. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using an atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential to model the intermolecular interaction between cyclopropane molecules. Excellent reproduction of thermodynamical and dynamical data reported for cyclopropane has allowed an assessment of the validity of the potential parameters used. Moreover, good agreement between the experimental and the simulated pair correlation function has been obtained, allowing the use of the simulated functions to discuss the evolution of the liquid structure with temperature. It is found that g CC(r) is the correlation function best able to describe the variation in the orientational order in the first shell of neighbours, from the relative evolution against temperature of the first two peaks observed at about 4·0 and 5·1 Å, respectively. A discussion of this evolution using angular pair correlation function and geometrical models based upon solid-phase data shows that, at low temperatures, the favoured configurations of cyclopropane molecules are those where, on average, their symmetry axes are perpendicular or parallel. When the temperature increases, configurations where the molecular axes are more randomly distributed tend to increase, thus leading to a more orientationally disordered liquid. It is emphasized that this trend is also consistent with the interpretation of light scattering experiments. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper describes the application of the evolutionary programming (EP) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of thermal unit commitment (UC). The EP algorithm tends to generate new creatures of increasing fitness over time, and performs a global search over the solution space. The proposed constraint handling techniques are integrated in the EP searching model to efficiently deal with diverse constraints of the UC problem. Numerical results tested on the practical Taiwan Power (Taipower) system of 38 thermal units over a 24-hour period show that the features of easy implementation, fast convergence, and near-optimal solution of the UC problem can be achieved by EP. Results of comparison with the related stochastic search methods, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm methods, and the Lagrangian relaxation method are also presented.

SP  - 109-119
AB  - Changes in allele frequencies at the esterase 6 (Est 6) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) enzyme loci of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans are examined in natural populations and artificial populations maintained at two temperatures. Results from cage populations at 18 °C and 25 °C provide evidence for temperature selection at both loci. Seasonal population samples show no significant change in gene frequencies for either locus, a reasonable outcome given the small selection coefficients found in cage populations. The temperature effect for the Adh locus appears to be direct: natural selection of the fast allele in cool environs and of the slow allele in warm environs. The temperature effect for Est 6 is weaker and complicated by sex differences and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectation. This evidence and different Est 6 frequencies found for melanogaster and simulans, in conjunction with evidence of the male reproductive function of this enzyme, suggest that Est 6 polymorphisms are maintained in natural populations by a complex form of sexual selection. © 1982 Dr W.

AB  - Wood frogs, Rana sylvatica, tolerate the freezing of their body tissues as an overwintering adaptation. Various parasites infect wood frogs of northern populations, but nothing is known about their strategies for surviving within a frozen host. We examined winter-conditioned wood frogs that were experimentally exposed to 0°C (nonfrozen) or -4°C (frozen) to determine whether endoparasites survive the freezing of their host. We found no differences in the prevalence or intensity of adult lungworms Rhabdias ranae (Nematoda) or of larvae of an unidentified species of digenetic trematode between these groups. Live individuals of both species were observed in hosts that recovered from experimental freezing at -4°C. Within the host, R. ranae also tolerated exposure to -5°C, a temperature near the lower limit of survival of the wood frog. Cryostage experiments showed that, like its host, R, ranae was highly susceptible to inoculative freezing and tolerant of the freezing of its tissues. Rhabdias ranae frozen in vitro in the presence or absence of 250 mM glucose, the cryoprotectant used by wood frogs, recovered from a 10-h exposure to -4°C. The mechanism of cold tolerance used by larval trematodes was not investigated; however, we hypothesize that freeze avoidance by supercooling may be important in this species. Freeze-tolerant anurans, such as the wood frog, are useful subjects in the study of coevolution of thermal tolerance in parasites and their host.

VL  - 35

SP  - 93-103
AB  - Circadian rhythms of activity were compared in ground-dwelling Tenebrionid beetles from the Kara Kum sand desert: Trigonoscelis gigas Reitter, Trigonoscelis sublaevicollis Reitter, Pisterotarsa gigantea Fish.-W., Sternodes caspicus Pall, Blaps faustii Seidlitz, and Ocnera imbricata Fish.-W. For the observations, artificial pens (enclosures) 60 x 60 cm and 80 cm deep were arranged in field conditions and filled with various kinds of sand to simulate natural habitats as closely as possible. The activity of individually marked beetles was assessed visually and recorded every 30 min. The beetle species studied had different types of behavior, from strictly crepuscular to strictly nocturnal. Closely related species sharing one habitat differed in activity pattern - they occupied different time niches; hence their circadian rhythms contribute to reproductive isolation. In contrast, non-closely related species could have similar circadian patterns as a result of convergent evolution. In experiments with T. gigas, we failed to stimulate individual variability among beetles in circadian pattern by applying additional light and heat at night. Therefore, the circadian rhythms in field conditions were found to be remarkably stable, which can be explained by our model of the beetle circadian system consisting of two strongly coupled oscillators. However, in laboratory conditions, we previously observed a wide range of individual variability in free-running circadian rhythms. The strong coupling between two putative endogenous circadian oscillators is a crucial tool for beetles to survive in a harsh arid environment. Such organization of the circadian system ensures synchronous activity of beetles despite individual differences, thus preserving the variability of circadian clock properties in a population, which increases chances for survival of a population in a changing environment.

VL  - 297
IS  - 1
SP  - 17-29
AB  - The Kozjak (Possruck) and Pohorje mountains form the southwestern basement rim of the Neogene Styrian Basin. This region was affected by two Tertiary magmatic events: the emplacement of the Oligocene Pohorje tonalite, and of Early/Middle Miocene dacites in the western Pohorje. Vitrinite reflectance and fission-track data are used to reconstruct the thermal history and to constrain the exhumation of the Pohorje/Kozjak area. Early Miocene sediments lacking a thermal overprint contain apatite grains of Eggenburgian (~19 Ma) cooling age, only 1-2 Ma older than the time of deposition. The cooling rate of the mainly Austroalpine source units was very fast, denoting tectonic denudation. It means that in the Eastern Alps during Early/Middle Miocene time the Pohorje/Kozjak region in addition to the Tauern and Rechnitz windows was supplying sediment into the surrounding basins with nearly syn-sedimentary apatite cooling ages. Vitrinite reflectance anomalies in Early Miocene sediments in the Ribnica-Selnica trough, located between the Kozjak and Pohorje mountains, and at the eastern margin of the Kozjak mountains give evidence for a strong post-depositional thermal overprint. Thermal models based on nearby wells suggest that Miocene temperatures were as high as 220°C. Apatite fission-track ages indicate that the thermal overprint had terminated by middle Badenian (14.4 ± 2.3 Ma) time. Vitrinite reflectance anomalies in the Ribnica-Selnica trough are a result of Early/Middle Miocene volcanic activity. Another vitrinite reflectance anomaly, situated at the eastern margin of the Kozjak mountains, extends eastward into the Somat-Radkersburg area. The heat source in this region is not obvious. Possible heat sources are: (1) a shallow pluton beneath this area, which easily can explain the reconstructed Early/Middle Miocene heat flow of more than 250 mW/m2; and (2) advective heat transport due to rapid exhumation of hot metamorphic rocks in the Pohorje/Kozjak region. Rapid exhumation is proven by fission-track dating. It would explain the appearance of the nearly syn-sedimentary detrital apatite FT ages in the sediments and the post-depositional heating.

TI  - Evolutionary pressure on reproductive strategies in flatfish and groundfish: Relevant concepts and methodological advancements
VL  - 58
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-34
AB  - Flatfish and groundfish show many similarities in reproductive strategies and tactics, both in types present and in responses to fishing pressure or changes in their environment. Over the last 20-30 years the reproduction of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus, plaice Pleuronectes platessa, sole Solea solea, and turbot Scophthalmus maximus have been extensively studied in the North Atlantic. For cod, halibut and turbot, the research has progressed rapidly due to interest from the aquaculture industry. Extensive overexploitation over many years in combination with climate change represents a potential evolutionary pressure towards changes in growth, lower age at maturity, increased fecundity, smaller egg size (and thereby larval size) and change in spawning time. Early sexual maturity/precocious maturation is also seen in aquaculture and is problematic economically due to a reduction in fillet production. In this paper information is reviewed from studies on both wild and captive populations in experiments, the latter considered important because overexploitation, such as observed in the North Sea, often reduces the natural dynamics in growth and reproduction and complicates collection of sufficiently large samples. Evidence from laboratory experiments demonstrates the inherent plasticity of fecundity production and how this is controlled by food availability and length of photoperiod, while recent information from field studies demonstrates the evolution of genotypes in response to fishing mortality. Today several laboratories have adopted modern techniques for analysis of reproductive investments (fecundity, atresia and sperm characterisation) in controlled experimental situations to explore the effect of temperature or other environmental parameters (such as salinity) on reproduction. These developments, in combination with the rapid implementation of molecular techniques, should make it possible in the future to present highly precise information on reproductive potential, both at the individual and stock level. Of particular interest, and a major goal, would be to dissociate genetic and phenotypic control of reproductive traits arising from a better understanding of gene expression in captive populations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soot formation in diffusion flames: Flow rate, fuel species and temperature effects
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SP  - 997-1006
AB  - A detailed study of soot particle formation in diffusion flames has been made for a series of laminar diffusion flames using a laser scattering/extinction technique. The effects of flow rate, fuel species and temperature on the evolution of the soot particle field have been investigated. Temperature effects have been examined through nitrogen dilution of the fuel. Fluorescence measurements from gas phase species in the initial particle formation region have been used to examine the relationship between these potential soot precursors and the observed particle formation. Flow rate, fuel species and temperature variations have been observed to significantly effect the annular region of the flame, where particles first appear. Increasing the fuel flow rate results in a larger soot volume fraction while the maximum particle size observed in the flame remains nearly constant. Thus, particle number concentration appears to be the quantity most sensitive to the flow rate variation. Temperature measurements made in the flames indicate that fuel flow rate increases result in higher temperatures in the particle formation region, leading to increased soot formation. At later stages, the flames with larger soot concentrations exhibit lower temperatures which facilitates soot particle survival in the oxidation region of the flame. Measurements made in flames with different fuels but similar adiabatic flame temperatures, indicate that the temperature exerts the strongest influence on soot formation. However, distinct effects due to fuel structure still need to be considered. © 1985 Combustion Institute.

TI  - Why should we closely monitor fecundity in marine fish populations?
VL  - 41
SP  - 93-106
AB  - Reproductive success, best defined as lifetime total offspring to reach maturity, is the product of the number of eggs produced (i.e., fecundity) per season, adult reproductive life span and offspring survival to maturity. Life history traits at the population level can be seen as a representation of the fate of individuals through their life cycle. For practical purposes, reproductive success is often separated in two components: reproductive potential and offspring survival to maturity. In studies of exploited marine fish populations, spawning stock biomass (SSB) is commonly used as a proxy of reproductive potential instead of direct measures of the egg production of the stock. This technique assumes, however, that egg production per unit of biomass is time-invariant. This assumption is unsupported by a review of the literature. Seasonal fecundity varies in relation to parental quality (e.g., size, condition), resource availability (e.g., food abundance and quality), environmental (e.g., temperature) and evolutionary factors (e.g. stock biomass, fishing pressure). Recent studies and use of generalized linear models to hindcast fecundity variations demonstrate that stock reproductive potential estimated by the total egg production can lead to different perceptions of the state and productivity of the stock. The recent development of cost-effective methods to count egg numbers of fish now makes it practical to routinely determine potential fecundity. Adding measures of fecundity to other demographic parameters that are already commonly measured for exploited marine fish stocks allows a more precise measurement of the reproductive potential. One possible outcome of measuring reproductive potential as demonstrated using northern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod as a case study is the calculation of the intrinsic rate of population increase (r), an essential parameter in population dynamics and evolutionary ecology, which can be used in determining sustainable harvesting, resilience, and potential rates of recovery of populations.

VL  - 84

AB  - The statistical methods Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence analysis (CCA) are used to determine the ecological preferences of dinoflagellate cyst species from the upper part of the Italian Singa section (2.8-2.2 Ma). Using DCA, gradients that have major influence on the species composition have been determined. By using existing environmental information for the Singa section based on planktic foraminifera, such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Productivity (SSP) and stable oxygen isotopes as well as the ecological information of extant dinoflagellate cysts, these gradients are interpreted in terms of temperature, inshore-offshore trends and evolutionary and other time-related gradients. Using CCA, the position of species optima in this dataset in relation to these temperature, inshore-offshore and evolutionary and other time related gradients are determined. For the studied period, the extinct species Melitasphaeridium pseudorecurvatum and Acritarch sp. B are related to temperate to warm intervals. Amiculosphaera umbracula is related to the cooler older intervals whereas Nematosphaeropsis rigida is related to the warmer younger intervals. © 1994.

VL  - 27

SP  - 257-268
AB  - McNamara, K.J. 1994 10 15: Diversity of Cenozoic marsupiate echinoids as an environmental indicator. Marsupiate echinoids are today largely confined to the seas around Antarctica. Consequently, it has often been inferred that the presence of marsupiate echinoids in the fossil record is indicative of the former existence of low oceanic temperatures. In this study the distribution of marsupiate echinoids through the Cenozoic succession of southern Australia is compared with palaeo‐temperature data to test this assumption. The analysis reveals that there is no positive correlation between high marsupiate echinoid diversity during the Cenozoic and low oceanic temperatures. An alternative hypothesis, based on life‐history strategies, is investigated. This reveals that marsupiate echinoids show many characteristics typical of organisms with slow growth, long life spans and production of few, large offspring. It is suggested that the northward migration of Australia during the Cenozoic from an original high‐latitude location in the early Cenozoic was accompanied by an increase in environmental instability in the southern Australian region in the late Cenozoic. This led to a consequent decrease in marsupiate echinoid diversity. During the Pliocene these direct brooding echinoids were replaced by non‐brooders with pelagic lecithotrophic larvae, which dominate the southern coastal echinoid fauna of Australia today. The environmental stability experienced in southern Australia in the early Cenozoic persisted throughout the Cenozoic in the Antarctic region, particularly with regard to predictability of nutrient supply. The result has been the dominance of marsupiate echinoids in that region today. Temporal changes in the diversity of marsupiate echinoids in southern Australia therefore supports the view that their spatial and temporal distribution may be more closely correlated with aspects of their life‐history strategy and environmental stability than with low temperature.

AB  - Comparison of the life-histories of two species pairs of caridean decapods, each pair containing a polar and a more temperate-water species (Chorismus antarcticus (Pfeffer, 1887)/Pandalus montagui Leach, 1814 and Notocrangon antarcticus (Pfeffer, 1887)/ crangon crangon (Linnaeus, 1758), suggested that in each case the polar species was more of a K-strategist than was the temperate species. In particular there were striking differences in brood size, egg weight and maturity of the newly hatched larvae. Measurements of individual annual reproductive effort, RE, as g fresh weight eggs per g fresh weight female indicated that in both species pairs the RE of the polar K-strategist was significantly less than that of the comparable temperate water r-strategist. Results expressing RE as g total egg lipid per g fresh weight female were equivocal. These data are discussed in relation to available autecological information for Anterctic marine invertebrates and it is concluded that many features of the polar benthos are explicable in terms of a general evolution of typical K-strategies. The role of low temperature in the widespread evolution of K-strategies may be crucial; consideration of this leads to a re-appraisal of "cold-adaptation". © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

SP  - 2994-3001
AB  - In this paper, we pose and solve an adaptive extremum control problem to optimize the productivity of a van de Vusse reaction taking place in a tubular reactor governed by a set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. Estimation and control algorithms that take into account control input constraints are developed by using a Lyapunov-based procedure, ensuring stability and convergence under a persistency of excitation condition. Here, we assume that the temperature information along the reactor is the only available on-line measurement to estimate the unmeasured objective function at the reactor exit. Numerical application of the proposed method shows that the resulting feedback algorithm steers the system to its optimum using a non-distributed jacket temperature actuation. The time evolution of the cost function is compared with an idealized distributed version of the algorithm presented previously. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modelling exposure to selected temperature during pregnancy: The limitations of squamate viviparity in a cool-climate environment
VL  - 96
IS  - 3
SP  - 541-552
AB  - Behavioural thermoregulation is important for the success of cool-climate lizards, and a basis of the cold-climate hypothesis for the evolution of viviparity in squamate reptiles. The temperature (T-sel) selected by pregnant females in a thermal gradient is considered to be optimal for embryonic development; however, exposure to T-sel throughout pregnancy has been difficult to estimate in small-bodied lizards as temperature-sensitive telemetry is impractical. In addition, the value of maternal thermophily during pregnancy is controversial: some studies have shown elevated T-sel, whereas others have found lowered T-sel or no change during pregnancy. We estimated indirectly the overall exposure to T-sel during the 4-5 months of pregnancy of the cool-climate, sub-alpine species Oligosoma maccanni (McCann's skink, 3-6 g) from southern New Zealand. The thermal environment available to skinks was modelled using temperature loggers inside validated copper models in basking and retreat sites. Pregnant skinks were able to achieve mean T-sel (28.9 degrees C) in the field very infrequently (4-15% of each month during the final 4 months of pregnancy). In field thermoregulatory studies, pregnant females did not bask more frequently and did not show altered field body temperature compared with non-pregnant adults, suggesting that all skinks (whether pregnant or not) thermoregulate maximally whenever conditions allow. Further research on cool-climate lizards should address the significance for offspring phenotypes of low and variable exposure to T-sel during pregnancy, as well as the significance of temperatures for embryos in maternal bodies (viviparity) versus nest sites (oviparity) arising from differences in maternal body size.

TI  - Modelling species distributions without using species distributions: The cane toad in Australia under current and future climates
VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 423-434
AB  - Accurate predictions of the potential distribution of range-shifting species are required for effective management of invasive species, and for assessments of the impact of climate change on native species. Range-shifting species pose a challenge for traditional correlative approaches to range prediction, often requiring the extrapolation of complex statistical associations into novel environmental space. Here we take an alternative approach that does not use species occurrence data, but instead captures the fundamental niche of a species by mechanistically linking key organismal traits with spatial data using biophysical models. We demonstrate this approach with a major invasive species, the cane toad Bufo marinus in Australia, assessing the direct climatic constraints on its ability to move, survive, and reproduce. We show that the current range can be explained by thermal constraints on the locomotor potential of the adult stage together with limitations on the availability of water for the larval stage. Our analysis provides a framework for biologically grounded predictions of the potential for cane toads to expand their range under current and future climate scenarios. More generally, by quantifying spatial variation in physiological constraints on an organism, trait-based approaches can be used to investigate the range-limits of any species. Assessments of spatial variation in the physiological constraints on an organism may also provide a mechanistic basis for forecasting the rate of range expansion and for understanding a species' potential to evolve at range-edges. Mechanistic approaches thus have broad application to process-based ecological and evolutionary models of range-shift. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 243

SP  - 241-254
AB  - The objective of the present study was to understand the immune response induced by different forms of the probiont Lactobacillus rhamnosus JCM 1136 in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and to clarify the carry over effect after withdrawal of the probiotic diet. A prebiotic-based diet was formulated, which served as the control diet, and to it the selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was incorporated in one of the three forms: (1) heat-killed, (2) live-sprayed or (3) freeze-dried. A rearing trial was conducted in triplicate with juvenile rainbow trout (average 126 g), which were fed on the control and three other diets containing the respective forms of the probionts, two times daily until the satiation level for a period of 30 days, following which the test diets were withdrawn and control diet was fed up to 45 days. Sampling was done at 10, 20, 30 and 45 days for gut microflora composition and the non-specific humoral and cellular immune responses of the fish. The viable forms (live spray or freeze-dried) were found to induce better phagocytic activity and complement activity compared to that of the non-viable heat-killed form. The plasma immunoglobulin level showed an increasing trend in the fish groups that received the viable probiont, but the trend did not exist towards the end of the study. Upon withdrawal of the probiotic diets, the LAB disappeared from the intestine and the elevated immune parameters returned to the prefed level. This study elucidates that probiont viability could probably influence the immune responses they induce. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy availability influences microclimate selection of hibernating bats
VL  - 210
IS  - 24
SP  - 4345-4350
AB  - Many species hibernate to conserve energy during periods of low food and water availability. It has long been assumed that the optimal hibernation strategy involves long, deep bouts of torpor that minimize energy expenditure. However, hibernation has ecological (e.g. decreased predator avoidance) and physiological (e.g. sleep deprivation) costs that must be balanced with energy savings; therefore, individuals possessing sufficient energy reserves may reduce their use of deep torpor. We tested the hypothesis that energy (fat) availability influences temperature selection of two fat-storing bat species during hibernation. We predicted that individuals with small energy reserves would select colder temperatures for hibernation in order to minimize energy expenditure, while individuals with larger energy reserves would choose warmer temperatures to minimize the costs of hibernation. Results from our field experiment indicate that little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) hibernating in warm microclimates were significantly heavier than individuals hibernating in cooler microclimates. To determine if energy availability was mediating this relationship, we limited fatty acid availability with mercaptoacetate (MA) and quantified its effect on torpid metabolic rate (TMR) and thermal preference of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). Administration of MA caused a 43% drop in TMR at 10°C and caused bats to choose significantly colder temperatures for hibernation. Our results suggest that fat-storing bats minimize torpor expression using both physiological and behavioral mechanisms.

TI  - Windows of embryonic sexual lability in two lizard species with environmental sex determination
VL  - 88
IS  - 7
SP  - 1781-1788
AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in all major reptile lineages, but the selective forces and physiological mechanisms that link sex to incubation temperature may differ among and within those groups. Different models for TSD evolution make different predictions about when offspring sex will respond to environmental cues. Although TSD has evolved in several lizard lineages, there is less detailed information on these taxa than in turtles and crocodilians with TSD. We incubated eggs of an agamid lizard (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), two species with TSD. Rather than manipulate incubation temperature to identify periods of sexual lability (as in most previous studies of this topic), we topically applied the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole to eggs at a variety of times through the incubation period. Fadrozole application sex-reversed the resultant hatchlings if applied from the time of oviposition until at least 60% of the way through incubation. In all of the TSD lizard species studied so far, offspring sex is determined either while the eggs are held inside the mother's body or soon after oviposition, providing substantial maternal control over incubation temperatures at this critical period. Hence, the hypothesis that TSD evolves because it enables offspring sex to be matched to conditions that are unpredictable at the time of laying is less likely to apply to squamates than to turtles, sphenodontians, and (especially) crocodiles, in which the period of sexual lability is delayed until long after oviposition. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 57
SP  - 253-264
AB  - Freshwater and anadromous populations of a species often differ in life history traits that are associated with their dichotomous migratory pattern. Although regularly used to support life history theory, the relative contributions of environmental and genetic influences to such intraspecific heterogeneity are not commonly known. We used a "common garden experiment" to examine the influence of these factors on life history differences of freshwater and anadromous inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) from the Mackenzie River system, northwestern Canada. In the common environment, rate of egg development differed among life history types whereas juvenile growth rates did not, indicating that the former is under a substantial degree of genetic control, but the latter is more strongly influenced by environmental differences in nature. Differences in rates of egg development may have evolved to match different temperature regimes within spawning rivers. In contrast, observed differences in growth rate of freshwater and anadromous inconnu in the wild are probably a result of phenotypic plasticity to different local environments.

AB  - Insects inhabit extreme temperature environments and have evolved mechanisms to survive there. Small insects are especially susceptible to rapid changes in body temperature. Therefore, the rapid detection of environment and body temperature is important for their survival. Little, however, is known about the thermosensors that detect those temperatures. Using rapid thermosensitivity assays with temperature step gradients and a spatial learning paradigm (the heat-box) in which elevated temperature serves as the negative reinforcer, two thermosensors were identified and their behavioral functions assessed. A low-temperature thermosensor is located on the antenna, detects relatively low temperatures, and can detect spatial temperature gradients directly. Thus, the antennae can be used by Drosophila to quickly orient with respect to temperature cues. A high-temperature thermosensor of unknown location appears to have a roughly similar sensitivity to temperature differences as the low-temperature thermosensor (less than or equal to 3 degreesC) and is both necessary and sufficient for memory formation in the heat-box spatial learning paradigm. Therefore, the high-temperature thermosensor is important for remembering spatial positions in which dangerously high temperatures were encountered.

TI  - The evolution of the phenotypic covariance matrix: Evidence for selection and drift in Melanoplus
VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 1104-1114
AB  - Phenotypic variation in trait means is a common observation for geographically separated populations. Such variation is typically retained under common garden conditions, indicating that there has been evolutionary change in the populations, as a result of selection and/or drift. Much less frequently studied is variation in the phenotypic covariance matrix (hereafter, P matrix), although this is an important component of evolutionary change. In this paper, we examine variation in the phenotypic means and P matrices in two species of grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes and M. devastator. Using the P matrices estimated for 14 populations of M. sanguinipes and three populations of M. devastator we find that (1) significant differences between the sexes can be attributed to scaling effects; (2) there is no significant difference between the two species; (3) there are highly significant differences among populations that cannot be accounted for by scaling effects; (4) these differences are a consequence of statistically significant patterns of covariation with geographic and environmental factors, phenotypic variances and covariances increasing with increased temperature but decreasing with increased latitude and altitude. This covariation suggests that selection has been important in the evolution of the P matrix in these populations Finally, we find a significant positive correlation between the average difference between matrices and the genetic distance between the populations, indicating that drift has caused some of the variation in the P matrices. © 2005 European Society of Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Dynamical modelling of lithospheric extension and small-scale convection: Implications for magmatism during the formation of volcanic rifted margins
VL  - 176
IS  - 1
SP  - 327-350
AB  - Enhanced melt productivity delivered by buoyant upwelling and small-scale convection of the mantle during rifting may play an important role in determining the fundamental structure of igneous crust produced during and following continental breakup. This thesis investigates the relationship between rift-related decompression melting and the influence of small-scale mantle convection and rift geometry on the subsequent production and distribution of melt-related crust. A two-dimensional plane-strain finite element method for viscous-plastic creeping flows is used to numerically model extension of the lithosphere. The evolving temperature and pressure fields within the model are coupled to an algorithm for predicting the amount and timing of decompression melting of upwelling mantle. Predicted melt fractions are converted to equivalent thicknesses of igneous crust, and the predicted crustal thicknesses for a series of models are compared to the observed crustal structure of rifted margins inferred from seismic data. Reference models characterized by passive plate-driven flow predict stable formation of ∼7 km thick igneous crust. Models characterized by small-scale mantle convection can to first order reproduce the general architecture of most volcanic rifted margins, that is, a relatively narrow band of thick (12-13 km) igneous crust (inferred to occur along strike of the margin), juxtaposed with thinner oceanic crust farther offshore. The variability in thickness (4-7 km) predicted for the later-stage thinner igneous crust is however difficult to reconcile with global observations of oceanic crustal thickness (7±1 km). Also, the peak 13 km thickness of igneous crust predicted for models with convectively enhanced upwelling fails to match the great thicknesses (≥ 20 km) of igneous crust observed at many volcanic margins; a small increase to mantle potential temperature appears necessary to predict generation of such thick igneous crust. Composite models that include both small-scale convection and an increase to mantle potential temperature predict large pulses in initial magmatism and generation of 17-21 km thick crust, followed by unstable production of thinner igneous crust. The results indicate that models with small-scale convection and no temperature anomaly may play a role in explaining the formation of volcanic margins with only moderately thick (11-15 km) igneous crust. Further, convection coupled with small increases to mantle temperature may be important during the initial phase of very thick igneous crust generation at some volcanic margins. The geometry of the lithosphere during extension appears to influence only moderately the spatial distribution of produced igneous crust. Predicted distributions of igneous crust are only weakly sensitive to asymmetric rifting of the lithosphere; this suggests that the degree of symmetry in the thermal structure of the upwelling sublithospheric mantle is the dominant control on the final distribution of igneous crust produced during rifting.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

TI  - Shifts in body temperature and escape behaviour of female Podarcis muralis during pregnancy
VL  - 66
IS  - 2
SP  - 216-222
AB  - Average field body temperatures of pregnant female Podarcis muralis (32.62-degrees-C) were significantly lower than that of males and non-pregnant females (overall average: 33.74-degrees-C). However, when tested in terrarium with a strong thermal gradient in a limited space, which represents a low-cost environment for thermoregulation, neither body temperature nor position in the thermal gradient differed among groups of sex and reproductive condition. Body temperatures selected in thermal gradient (overall average: 33.77-degrees-C) was similar to those exhibited in the field by males and non-pregnant females. This means that low body temperature exhibited by pregnant females in the field is not a consequence of a change of the thermal preferences at this stage, but might be explained on the basis of constraints related to their reproductive condition. Pregnant females stay closer to the refuge and allow approach to a shorter distance than do males and non-pregnant females. Approach distance was partially explained by the distance to refuge, but even when the effects of the distance to refuge were removed by applying the residuals of the regression, the approach distance for pregnant females was significantly lower than for other individuals. This reflects the existence of a behavioural component of motion-less in addition to the tendency to remain closer to a shelter, and means a shift in the predator-avoidance tactic from flight to crypsis, presumably because effectiveness of the flight tactic would be reduced during pregnancy. The behavioural changes associated with pregnancy may preclude careful thermoregulation, as this requires frequent movements to exploit the variability of the thermal environment.

AB  - The present study has been carried out to know the effect of temperature on behaviour, equilibrium loss and tolerance limit of the post larvae of shrimp Penaeus indicus. The experimental temperatures were selected based on the thermal tolerance limit. The experiments were conducted at a specific temperature for duration of 48 hr. The thermal tolerance experiments were conducted in two ways : in direct exposure and in gradually increasing temperature. The upper and lower lethal temperatures for the post larvae of shrimp P. indicus were 43.5°C and 8°C respectively. During tolerance experiment, no mortality was observed at 33°C and 35°C. But at 38°C with gradual increase in temperature, 30% loss of equilibrium and mortality were recorded in 24.31 hrs and 25.07 hrs, and the remaining 70% were alive. On the contrary, when the post larvae of shrimps were directly exposed to 38°C, almost 80% loss of equilibrium and mortality were recorded in 30.22 hrs and 30.40 hrs, remaining 20% were alive. At 40°C with gradual increase in temperature, 100% loss of equilibrium and mortality were recorded in 25.32 hrs and 25.56 hrs. On the other hand, when the post larvae of shrimps were directly exposed to 40°C, 100% loss of equilibrium was observed in 0.37 hrs and mortality in 1.40 hrs. These behavioral responses include an elevated temperature of 12°C, surfacing, dashing against glass wall, jumping out of the water, etc. In general, the rate of oxygen consumption and ammonia excretion was found to enhance with increasing temperature. In the present study, it was found that gradual increase in temperature favours the shellfish population to escape from the thermal exposure as compared to direct exposure.

AB  - During recent climate warming, some species have expanded their ranges northwards to keep track of climate changes. Evolutionary changes in dispersal have been demonstrated in these expanding populations and here we show that increased dispersal is associated with reduced investment in reproduction in populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria. Evolutionary changes in flight versus reproduction will affect the pattern and rate of expansion at range boundaries in the future, and understanding these responses will be crucial for predicting the distribution of species in the future as climates continue to warm.

AB  - We mapped QTL effects on the X and third chromosomes affecting Drosophila bristle number, to describe quantitative variation in terms of complex genetics, rather than statistically. Recombinant inbred mapping populations for each chromosome were derived by crossing lines selected for low or high sternopleural or abdominal bristle number to a standard inbred strain with wild type bristle numbers ( Sam). Recombination breakpoints were determined using polymorphic roo transposable element insertion sites. In order to estimate additive and dominance QTL effects, as well as QTL × environment interaction, each RI line was crossed to Sam and the other parental strain, and the progeny were raised in three temperatures: 18, 25, 28 degrees Celsius. Bristle number QTL were mapped separately for each chromosome, trait and environment, using composite interval mapping. A total of 142 QTL were mapped for sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, pooled over all six mapping populations, three temperature environments, and two sexes. Generally the effects of the QTL were moderately large. QTL effects were often sex- and environment-specific. The significance of QTL × sex, QTL × temperature interactions and epistatic (QTL × QTL) interactions was determined by analysis of variance, with the significance level determined using Bonferroni correction. Interactions with sex and temperature were common for QTL affecting both sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, but were more frequent for the latter trait. There were 30 (9.0%) and 25 (11.0%) significant epistatic interactions affecting sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, respectively, after Bonferroni correction. Comparisons made between the six populations showed a total of 53 individual QTL, of which 11 mapped to the X and 42 to the third chromosome. A total of 33 and 31 QTL were found to affect sternopleural and abdominal bristle number, respectively; of these 11 QTL affected both bristle traits. Many of the QTL mapped to the same location as candidate bristle development loci, but several QTL regions did not encompass obvious candidate genes.

AB  - We experimentally tested a series of hypotheses proposed by Masaki (1979, 1986) for the evolution of ovipositor length in crickets. Female crickets use the ovipositor to bury eggs in the soil, where it was hypothesized to protect their eggs from desiccation, cold and other disturbance. However, we found no effect of depth on the overwinter survival of eggs of three species of Nemobiinae. The probability of hatchlings reaching the soil surface was negatively correlated with depth documenting a significant cost to females laying eggs deep in the soil. Hatchling survival may be an important agent of selection on ovipositor length in habitats of different soil moistures. Hatchling survival in the soil was also correlated with body size, which may impose a constraint on egg-size fecundity trade-offs. Females of a bivoltine population of Allonemobius socius lay eggs at shallower depths when reared under summer compared to fall conditions and, therefore, may be able to respond to selection through behavioral plasticity when morphological adaptation is constrained by allometry. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Advanced evolutionary phases of large-metallicity low-mass stars and the problem of the ultraviolet excess of elliptical galaxies
VL  - 381
IS  - 2
SP  - 393-408
AB  - We present a set of evolutionary tracks of large-metallicity low-mass stars, covering the advanced evolutionary phases from the zero-age horizontal branch to the final white dwarf cooling phase, at the onset of crystallization. These star models are intended to be representative of the hot component of the stellar population of elliptical galaxies and are suitable for population synthesis purposes. Physical parameters of the evolved stars have been selected to search for models leaving the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase before the onset of the thermal pulses (TP) and evolving to the blue side of the H-R diagram according to an evolutionary scheme earlier defined as post-early AGB (P-EAGB) evolution (Brocato et al.). Star models have been first evolved at constant mass. A selected sample of more massive models, which in absence of mass loss have been found to enter the TP-AGB, has been successively evolved adopting a moderately large rate of mass loss at the red side of the H-R diagram. As a consequence of mass loss, these models skip the thermal pulsing phase and evolve following a post-EAGB evolutionary path. We find that the maximum UV flux that post-AGB models can provide is not enough to account for the ultraviolet emission (UV) of the most UV-emitting elliptical galaxies, whereas models following the P-EAGB evolutionary behavior produce much more UV flux. Among the star models evolving off the early AGB, before the onset of thermal pulses, those maximizing the production of the UV flux give enough UV light to explain even the most UV upturned branches observed in the spectra of the most metal-rich elliptical galaxy. This is because in post-EAGB models the excursion toward the blue side of the H-R diagram is supported by the additional energy source provided by the He-burning shell. However, the fact that just the strongest UV emitters of the P-EAGB progeny appear able to produce the needed amount of flux to explain the most UV-emitting elliptical galaxies, and that a fine tuning of the stellar parameters is required to produce such an evolutionary behavior, which occurs for a restricted value of these parameters, suggests that it is likely that not only P-EAGB stars are at work in nature to produce the UV light of these galaxies.

AB  - The processing stages used in 'sous vide' technology, i.e. vacuum packaging, mild pasteurization treatments and extended storage at chill temperatures may select for survival and growth of psychrotrophic strains of Clostridium botulinum. This organism can produce toxin within 31 days at 3.3 °C and within 12 days at 8.0 °C but is relatively heat-sensitive and may therefore be destroyed using a suitable pasteurization treatment. This paper discusses the growth and heat resistance characteristics of psychrotrophic C. botulinum in sous vide foods with recommendations for the safe manufacture of these products. © 1995.

AB  - The gametogenic cycle of the smooth clam Callista chione off the Arrábida region was studied throughout a 17-month period (from January 2004 to May 2005) using standard histological techniques, mean oocyte diameters and a condition index. This species showed a synchronism between sexes both in terms of gametogenic development and spawning. The results indicated that sex-ratio was not significantly different from parity. In January 2004, the gametogenic cycle had already begun and ended in late October 2004. Three spawning peaks were detected: January-March, April-May and August-October. No resting period was observed and a new gametogenic cycle began in early November, immediately after the spawning period. The analysis of the oocyte diameter enabled predicting the main spawning periods, which appear to be largely governed by seawater temperature. The condition index evolved according to the reproductive cycle of the species, with the highest values being observed prior to the main spawning periods. The size at first maturity estimated for C. chione was 50.81 mm. © 2008 Marine Biological Association in the United Kingdom.

VL  - 218

SP  - 657-665
AB  - A modern injection mould is a high-technology tool for mass production. The products typically have to meet high quality demands because they are often visible to the user. In order to manufacture high quality parts, the temperature of the mould has to be kept at an appropriate level and the temperature has to be equally distributed within the form. A net of interconnected deep-hole bores leads a water-oil emulsion to the critical areas for controlling the temperatures in the tool. Usually, the layout of the bores is constructed by means of human expert knowledge. In this paper an objective mathematical measure for the multiobjective quality of a mould temperature control system is introduced. Two different encoding approaches for cooling systems are compared. An approach to solve the complex layout problem using an evolutionary algorithm is described. To show the complexity of this multiobjective problem and to interpret and compare the quality of the existing algorithms, a new software environment called KEA (kit for evolutionary algorithms) is used. © IMechE 2004.

VL  - 419

SP  - 596-614
AB  - This series of papers comprises a systematic exploration of the hypothesis that the far-ultraviolet radiation from star clusters and elliptical galaxies originates from extremely hot horizontal-branch (HB) stars and their post-HB progeny. This first paper presents an extensive grid of calculations of stellar models from the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) through to a point late in post-HB evolution or a point on the white dwarf cooling track. The grid will be used to produce synthesized UV fluxes for the interpretation of existing and future short-wavelength (900-3000 Å) observations. Our sequences have been computed for a range of masses which concentrates on models that begin their HB evolution very close to the hot end of the ZAHB. We have calculated tracks for three metal-poor compositions ([Fe/H] = -2.26, -1.48, -0.47 with [O/Fe] &gt; 0), for use with globular cluster observations. We have also chosen three metal rich compositions (Z = 0.017 = Z⊙, Z = 0.04, 0.06) for use in the study of elliptical galaxy populations. For each of the two super-metal-rich compositions, for which the helium abundance is unconstrained by observation, we have computed two sets of sequences: one assuming no additional helium, and a second with a large enhancement (YHB = 0.29 and 0.36 for Z = 0.04), and (YHB = 0.29 and 0.46 for Z = 0.06). For each set of sequences, our lowest ZAHB envelope masses (M0env) are in the range 0.002 &lt; M0env &lt; 0.006 M⊙. We use the term extreme horizontal branch (EHB) to refer to HB sequences of constant mass that do not reach the thermally pulsing stage on the AGB. These models evolve after core helium exhaustion into post-early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, which leave the AGB before thermal pulsing, and AGB-manqué stars, which never reach the AGB. We describe various features of the evolution of post-HB stars, discussing the correspondence between slow phases of evolution at high temperature and the early-AGB evolution. We note that the relationship between core mass and luminosity for stars on the upper AGB is not straightforward, because stars arrive on the ZAHB with a range of masses and subsequently burn different amounts of fuel. We determine from our models an upper bound to the masses of EHB stars, finding that it varies little for [Fe/H] &lt; 0, but that it is sensitive to the helium abundance. We show that for each composition there is a range of M0env (at least a few hundredths M⊙) in which the models have a slow phase of evolution at high temperature. The duration of this phase is found to increase with the metallicity, but its luminosity is lower, so that total UV energy output is not significantly different from metal-poor sequences. The properties of very metal rich stars are, however, made uncertain by our lack of knowledge of the helium abundance for [Fe/ H] &gt; 0; the range of stellar masses in which high temperatures are attained for significant periods of time increases with Y. There is no intrinsic composition dependence of the peak UV output from evolved stars; the output from a stellar population depends most directly on the mass distribution of stars arriving on the ZAHB. This is determined mainly by the mass loss that occurs on the red giant branch.

VL  - 30
IS  - 1
SP  - 79-83
AB  - Diet composition can affect body temperatures selected by lizards in a thermal gradient (SBT) but there is very little evidence to Support a similar effect due to fasting. The latter could represent a means of energy conservation during periods of low food availability. This study investigated the impact of short-term food deprivation (5 days) on diurnal thermal preferences of male (n = 10) and non-reproductive female (n = 22) Anolis carolensis using a repeated measures design. Mean SBT varied significantly over the 4 h measurement period, and was higher for males than females, overall. A small but significant change in SBT was detected between the two feeding treatments, with food deprivation leading to a mean decrease ranging from 0.43 +/- 0.55 to 0.72 +/- 0.46 degreesC (at different times of day) in females and from 0.61 +/- 0.71 to 2.13 +/- 0.76 degreesC in males. Previous studies may have failed to detect such subtle trends due to a lack of statistical power arising from small sample sizes. An explanation of these differences is they represent a feeding status dependent trade-off for maintenance of energy balance versus optimal food assimilation. However, (1) the estimated energy saving, and (2) the impact on food assimilation appear rather negligible even assuming that the observed decrease in SBT produces a similar lowering of field body temperature in the wild.

TI  - Bench to bedside strategies for optimizing neuroprotection following perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia in high and low resource settings
VL  - 83
IS  - 12
SP  - 801-811
AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia gathers impetus in the developed world as a safe and effective therapy for term asphyxial encephalopathy. Although many questions still remain about the optimal application of hypothermic neuroprotection it is difficult to ignore the developing world where the prevalence of asphyxial encephalopathy is much higher. Experimental studies to optimize high tech cooling need to run in parallel with trials to determine the possible benefits of therapeutic hypothermia in low resource settings. Methods: We used a validated newborn piglet model of transient HI to determine (i) whether optimal neuroprotection occurs at different temperatures in the cortical and deep grey matter; (ii) the effect of body size on regional brain temperature under normothermia and hypothermia; (iii) the effect of insult severity on the therapeutic window duration; (iv) whether cooling using a water bottle is feasible. In this model hypoxia-ischaemia is induced by reversible occlusion of the common carotid arteries by remotely controlled vascular occluders and simultaneous reduction in the inspired oxygen fraction to 0.12. Intensive care can be administered to the piglet maintaining metabolic and physiological homeostasis throughout the experiment, and cerebral energy metabolism is monitored continuously providing quantitative measures of the HI insult, latent phase and secondary energy failure using phosphorus-31 (31P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Results: (i) The optimal temperature for cooling was lower in the cortex than deep grey matter. (ii) Cerebral temperatures were body-weight dependent: a smaller body weight led to a lower brain temperature especially with selective head cooling. (iii) Latent-phase duration is inversely related to insult severity. (iv) Low tech, simple cooling methods using a water bottle can induce and maintain moderate hypothermia. Conclusions: Small shifts in brain temperature critically influence the survival of neuronal cells and body size critically influences brain-temperature gradients - smaller subjects have a larger surface area to brain volume and hence more heat is lost. The clinical implication is that smaller infants may require higher cap or body temperatures to avoid detrimental effects of over-zealous cooling. Latent-phase brevity may explain less effective neuroprotection following severe HI in some clinical studies. "Tailored" treatments which take into account individual and regional characteristics may increase the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in the developed world. Low tech cooling methods using water bottles may be feasible although adequate staffing and monitoring would be required. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural selection of organisms results in differences between populations in response to environmental conditions - that is, local adaptation. Understanding heterogeneity at this level requires identification of the different selection pressures that cause this differentiation. Tadpoles of the common frog, Rana temporaria, from northern Sweden show superior growth in warmer incubation conditions than tadpoles from the south, and vice versa in cooler conditions. A plausible explanation for this is that the thermal optimum in the northern population has been shifted by selection to correspond better with the relatively warmer developmental conditions experienced in the north compared with the south (northern ponds are warmer because they are shallower and tend to heat more quickly following the melting of snow). To test this hypothesis, we performed an experiment in which frogs from both regions were allowed to develop in water temperatures representative of those in their natural breeding ponds and in those at the other climatic extreme. Tadpoles in the 'warm' (northern) part of the range had markedly reduced survival at low temperatures compared with those from the cooler region in the south, with a non-significant difference at relatively high temperatures. Thus, northern frogs appear to have evolved towards becoming high-temperature 'specialists', with local adaptation being upheld by hard selection on tadpole survival.

AB  - We investigated individual nest site choice behaviour and its fitness consequences in female hawksbills nesting at Trois Ilets, Guadeloupe. We found a significant repeatability of nest site choice, suggesting that this behaviour is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. By looking at possible consequences of nest site choice, we found that hatching success was similar among different beach zones, but the ability of hatchlings to emerge from the nest was impaired in areas subject to tidal inundation. Sea-finding tests showed that hatchlings were more susceptible to disorientation in areas deeper in the forest. Maintaining phenotypic diversity in nest site choice could derive from variation in the environment, where a constantly shifting balance between phenotypes would be promoted by environmental change over time. Alternatively, the different nesting behaviours could be maintained though frequency-dependent selection. Phenotypic sex of sea turtle embryos is determined by the incubation temperature of the nests, and different beach zones have different thermal properties. Females that nest in areas that produce the rarer sex may therefore gain a fitness advantage. (c) 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Free-living nematodes are endowed with a set of properties that make them specially attractive for experimental work. Geneticists and evolutionists may be especially interested in their easy cultivation, great fecundity and polymorphism. As an example, some results are brought concerning Caenorhabditis elegans and related species: (1) Sex determination occurs as the expression of a genic balance involving differences in the number of chromosomes. The alternatives gynogenesis, amphimixis, or auto-heterofecundation take a prominent place in the reproductive processes of these species. (2) Polyploidy may be obtained by heat-shock, giving rise to individuals showing characteristic chromosomal unbalance and variability. (3)C. elegans, which cannot normally be raised at a higher temperature than 22°C, has been gradually adapted to temperatures up to 24.5°C. This acclimatization implies an adaptive transformation of the ovarian physiology; this effect is obtained after long training, taking more than 1000 generations. Study of the process of acclimatization shows that its genetical basis may be partly of a non-genic nature, partly of a genic type. Hypotheses are developed for explaining this phenomenon and for the understanding of the evolution from free-living to parasitic nematodes. © 1967 Birhhäuser Verlag.

TI  - Energy expenditure during overfeeding
VL  - 3
AB  - The large inter-individual variation in weight gain during standardized overfeeding together with a weight gain that is often less than theoretically calculated from the energy excess suggest that there are differences between persons in the capacity to regulate energy expenditure and hence metabolic efficiency. Adaptive thermogenesis is defined as the regulated production of heat in response to environmental changes in temperature and diet, resulting in metabolic inefficiency. The question is whether adaptive thermogenesis can be identified in overfeeding experiments. From the numerous human overfeeding experiments we selected those studies that applied suitable protocols and measurement techniques. Five studies claimed to have found evidence for adaptive thermogenesis based on weight gains smaller than expected or unaccounted increases in thermogenesis above obligatory costs. Results from the other 11 studies suggest there is no adaptive thermogenesis as weight gains were proportional to the amount of overfeeding and the increased thermogenesis was associated with theoretical costs of an increased body size and a larger food intake. These results show that in humans, evidence for adaptive thermogenesis is still inconsistent. However, they do not rule out the existence, but emphasize that if present, adaptive changes in energy expenditure may be too small to measure considering measurement errors, errors in assumptions made and small (day-to-day) differences in physical activity. In addition, it is not clear in which component or components of total energy expenditure adaptive changes can occur and whether components can overlap due to measurement limitations. © 2006 Joosen and Westerterp; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Six cohorts of the silver-stripe round herring Spratelloides gracilis, a fast-growing and short-lived tropical clupeid, were collected as juveniles and then as adults during austral summers from November to February in 1998-1999 and 1999-2000, using light traps in the Dampier Archipelago, Western Australia. Otolith analysis allowed backcalculation of size and growth rate at age to examine the relative influences of selective mortality and water temperature on early growth. Negative size-selective mortality and growth-selective mortality between the juvenile and the adult stages was found only in the cohort that was the smallest and slowest growing in the period immediately following hatching. Selective mortality preferentially removed members of this cohort that were smaller from age 0 to 15 days, and slower growing from 0 to 10 days, resulting in an elevation of size at age to, or even above, that of cohorts that had not undergone this process. Size and growth rate at 5 day age intervals in the first 20 days after hatching differed among cohorts within and between summers and were strongly and positively correlated (r 2 = 0·61- 0·83) with water temperature. © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB  - Using data from bottom-trawl surveys conducted each summer, winter and spring on the Cretan shelf from 1988 to 1991, we examined the bathymetric distribution of red mullet Mullus surmuletus. Additionally, we used data from 3 yr (1991 to 1993) of monthly sampling in the Iraklion Gulf. Depth, temperature and salinity data were combined with biological data on abundance, biomass, fish size, age, sex and maturity. The ranges of bottom depth, temperature and salinity over which red mullet is distributed were established. In general, fish size increased with bottom depth, and smaller individuals tended to be found in shallower and warmer water. Abundance increased in mid-shelf waters during spring, indicating a movement across the shelf towards deeper water. The latter seemed to be associated with spawning behavior. The factor controlling the timing of that movement to deep water seemed to be the maturity of individual fish.

VL  - 29

SP  - 121-124
AB  - The glass receiver tubes used in evacuated tubular collectors are currently vacuum coated with a selective surface in a batch process. Solar-selective absorber foils can be produced successfully by a number of methods and offer economic advantages over batch collector coatings in many instances. Bonding of these foils to a variety of surfaces is done at present with adhesives whose upper temperature limit is about 250°C. However, many absorber coatings are stable to much higher temperatures. Thus, suitable techniques for bonding solar-selective absorber foils to high-temperature (up to 400°C) glass receivers would be desirable. This paper describes possible foil-glass bonding techniques and the results of experiments on selected techniques, principally electrical field-assisted bonding and the use of glass sealing frits. Foil-bonded samples were thermally cycled in a vacuum to temperatures typical of stagnation in evacuated collectors, and changes in bond strength and foil optical properties were observed. Finally, the economic viability of foil bonding processes is discussed. © 1982.

VL  - 308

SP  - 439-445
AB  - A flow-injection procedure for spectrophotometric determination of cadmium in fertilizers based on formation of the blue ternary complex between cadmium, iodide and Malachite Green (MG) is proposed. Addition order and concentrations of reagents, interaction time between iodide and MG, flow rates, pH and temperature for ternary complex formation, surfactant addition, and presence of potential interferent ions were studied. A 30-s interaction between iodide and MG, a temperature of 20 degrees C and use of picolinic acid for copper masking were selected. Linearity of the calibration graph was improved with cadmium addition. For selectivity enhancement, masking agents, kinetic discrimination, and ion-exchange separation were investigated and a Chelex-100 resin minicolumn (50-100 mesh) was employed for in-line interferent removal. The proposed system is very stable and handles about 60 samples per hour (10.0-100.0 mu g Cd l(-1)) corresponding to 0.105 mg MG and 166 mg KI consumed per determination Linearity of the calibration plot is observed up to 200 mu g Cd l(-1), the detection limit being 2 mu g Cd l(-1). Results are precise (R.S.D. = 1.3% and 4.0% for 93.0 and 35.3 mu g Cd l(-1)) and in agreement with tungsten coil atomic absorption spectrometry. Accurate results are also obtained for lobster and soya bean samples.

VL  - 2

SP  - 111-117
AB  - We investigated population divergence in body melanisation in wild samples of Drosophila melanogaster across an elevational gradient (512-2202 m) in the Western Himalayas. Wild populations are characterized by higher phenotypic variability as compared with laboratory populations. Significant differences in elevational slope values for three posterior abdominal segments (fifth, sixth and seventh) in wild versus laboratory populations suggest plastic effects. However, elevational slope values do not differ for the three anterior abdominal segments (second, third and fourth). Thus, elevational changes in melanisation include genetic as well as plastic effects. Fitness consequences of within population variability were analyzed on the basis of assorted darker and lighter flies from two highlands as well as from two lowland localities. There is lack of correlation of melanisation with body size as well as ovariole number in assorted darker and lighter flies. For each population, darker flies showed higher desiccation resistance, lower rate of water loss, longer copulation duration and greater fecundity as compared with lighter flies. Phenotypic variations in body melanisation can be interpreted in relation with seasonal changes in temperature as well as humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations. Thus, elevational changes in body melanisation may represent genetic response to selection pressures imposed by colder and drier climatic conditions in the Western Himalayas. © 2008 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - A strong homogeneity in morphological and cytological features characterize all the specimens of Phyllanthus urinaria L. observed in French Guiana. Considering further that they present a good allofecondity, their descendants being fertile, it is strongly suggested that they all own to the same genotype. On the other hand, a biométric study of populations from twelve localities silting by the coast or inside the country, set forth significative differences between some of these populations, the classification of which showing several statistical groups. A correlation with some climatic parameters has been found. It is thought as a conclusion of our study, that the observed differences would be the morphological expressions of the genotype selective response to climatic constraints, specially to the temperature-relative air humidity couple. © 1978 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 66

SP  - 149-179
AB  - Sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles can be divided into two convenient classifications: genotypic (GSD) and environmental (ESD). While a number of types of GSD have been identified in a wide variety of reptilian taxa, the expression of ESD in the form of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in three of the five major reptilian lineages has drawn considerable attention to this area of research. Increasing interest in sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles has resulted in many data, but much of this information is scattered throughout the literature and consequently difficult to interpret. It is known, however, that distinct sex chromosomes are absent in the tuatara and crocodilians, rare in amphisbaenians (worm lizards) and turtles, and common in lizards and snakes (but less than 20 % of all species of living reptiles have been karyotyped). With less than 2 percent of all reptilian species examined, TSD apparently is absent in the tuatara, amphisbaenians and snakes; rare in lizards, frequent in turtles, and ubiquitous in crocodilians. Despite considerable inter- and intraspecific variation in the threshold temperature (temperature producing a 1:1 sex ratio) of gonadal sex determination, this variation cannot confidently be assigned a genetic basis owing to uncontrolled environmental factors or to differences in experimental protocol among studies. Laboratory studies have identified the critical period of development during which gonadal sex determination occurs for at least a dozen species. There are striking similarities in this period among the major taxa with TSD. Examination of TSD in the field indicates that sex ratios of hatchlings are affected by location of the nests, because some nests produce both sexes whereas the majority produce only one sex. Still, more information is needed on how TSD operates under natural conditions in order to fully understand its ecological and conservation implications. TSD may be the ancestral sex-determining condition in reptiles, but this result remains tentative. Physiological investigations of TSD have clarified the roles of steroid hormones, various enzymes, and H-Y antigen in sexual differentiation, whereas molecular studies have identified several plausible candidates for sex-determining genes in species with TSD. This area of research promises to elucidate the mechanism of TSD in reptiles and will have obvious implications for understanding the basis of sex determination in other vertebrates. Experimental and comparative investigations of the potential adaptive significance of TSD appear equally promising, although much work remains to be performed. The distribution of TSD within and among the major reptilian lineages may be related to the life span of individuals of a species and to the biogeography of these species. Answers to many of the questions and tests concerning TSD in reptiles would be facilitated by controlling the conditions of incubation, by standardizing the experimental design, and by depositing voucher specimens in accessible collections after completion of the study. Goals for future research are discussed.

VL  - 86

SP  - 139-147
AB  - The effects of fresh thalli and culture medium filtrates from two species of marine macroalgae, Ulva pertusa Kjellm (Chlorophyta) and Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Bory) Dawson (Rhodophyta), on growth of marine microalgae were investigated in co-culture under controlled laboratory conditions. A selection of microalgal species were used, all, being identified as bloom-forming dinoflagellates: Prorocentrum donghaiense Lu sp., Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour) Balech, Amphidinium carterae Hulburt and Scrippsiella trochoide (Stein) Loeblich III. Results showed that the fresh thalli of either U. pertusa or G. lemaneiformis significantly inhibited the microalgal growth, or caused mortality at the end of the experiment. However, the overall effects of the macroalgal culture filtrates on the growth of the dinoflagellates were species-specific (inhibitory, stimulatory or none) for different microalgal species. Results indicated an allelopathic effect of macroalga on the co-cultured dinoflagellate. We then took P. donghaiense as an example to further assess this hypothesis. The present study was carried out under controlled conditions, thereby excluded the fluctuation in light and temperature. Nutrient assays showed that nitrate and phosphate were almost exhausted in G. lemaneiformis co-culture. but remained at enough high levels in U pertusa co-culture, which were well above the nutrient limitation for the microalgal growth, when all cells of P. donghaiense were killed in the co-culture. Daily f/2 medium enrichment greatly alleviated the growth inhibition on P. donghaiense in G. lemaneiformis co-culture, but could not eliminate it. Other environmental factors, such as carbonate limitation, bacterial presence and the change of pH were also not necessary for the results. We thus concluded that allelopathy was the most possible reason leading to the negative effect of U. pertusa on P. donghaiense, and the combined roles of allelopathy and nutrient competition were essential for the effect of G. lemaneiformis on P. donghaiense.

AB  - The complex effects of global climate change on freshwater ecosystems limit our ability to predict biological responses in a standard way and may compromise ecosystem management with respect to potential changes. I present a theoretical framework that shows the usefulness of resurrection ecology for standardizing cross-system comparisons of ecological responses to global climate change. Resurrection ecology makes use of plant seed and animal resting-egg (propagule) banks that integrate past environmental histories in the gene pools of their organisms. Resurrected organisms that have undergone different periods of dormancy can be studied comparatively using evolutionary/genetic and experimental approaches. Both approaches combined can provide insights into how the dimensions of species' ecological niches have shifted over time and could help reveal whether direct effects of climate change (increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations and hydrological alterations) or other anthropogenic stressors (e.g., contamination, landuse change) have caused microevolution. Insights gained from resurrection ecology could be used to manage gene flow between populations and to help prevent extinctions of threatened populations. These insights could be used to help manage ecosystem structure and function and maintain ecological sustainability. However, our ability to apply results from resurrection ecology to organisms that do not have long-term dormancy stages in their life cycles may be limited, and the usefulness of resurrection ecology will have to be evaluated along gradients of hydroperiod and flood frequency, which may determine rates of microevolution in aquatic ecosystems. © 2007 by The North American Benthological Society.

TI  - Properties of Inbred Drosophila melanogaster Lines Derived from a Population Selected for an Increased Rate of Embryonic Development
VL  - 32
IS  - 9
SP  - 1046-1051
AB  - Two heterogeneous Drosophila melanogaster populations were subjected to selection for an increased rate of embryonic development by picking out the first 10% of hatching larvae. After repeating this procedure in 15 generations, ''fast'' populations were obtained, in which the duration of embryonic development at high temperature (31-32 degrees C) was 30-40 min less than in nonselected control populations. The results of preliminary experiments on substituting the second and third chromosomes in the selected and control populations provide evidence that selected genes responsible for accelerated development are located on the second chromosome. Inbreeding in 12 generations of selected populations was used to obtain about 40 lines homozygous, in particular, at time alcohol dehydrogenase gene. In four lines, the developmental rate was higher than in a homozygous control line, but others did nor differ from control or developed more slowly. The duration of embryonic development ae 32 degrees C in fast lines was 50-70 min shorter than in control, but this difference was significantly less at lower temperatures (25 and 17 degrees C). Hence, high temperature is primarily a factor in providing conditions for the expression of genes determining the developmental rate, rather than a factor of selection for these genes. It is suggested that selected genes modify developmental rate dependence on temperature.

TI  - Physiology and phylogeny: the evolution of locomotor energetics in hylid frogs
VL  - 141
IS  - 1
SP  - 26-50
AB  - North American hylid frogs exhibit patterns of locomotor energetics that are generally similar to those found among most terrestrial vertebrates: steady-state rate of oxygen consumption increases within a range of sustainable speeds, above which it becomes independent of speed and endurance decreases. Species differences in the capacity to sustain locomotion are related to the interaction of locomotor cost and the maximal capacity for aerobic energy production during exercise. Hence, analyses of metabolic correlates of behavioral activity should incorporate estimate of economy as well as capacity. Resting and maximal rates of metabolism are positively correlated, even when the confounding effects of body size and phylogeny are removed. Inferred evolutionary changes in metabolic rate proceeded from low rates in neotropical ancestors to higher rates among descendant species in temperate habitats. Adaptation to facilitate activity at low temperatures may have been responsible for this evolutionary shift. Findings support the "aerobic capacity' hypothesis for the evolution of metabolic rate in which evolutionary increases in metabolic rate are brought about by natural selection favouring increased abilities for sustained activity. -from Author

TI  - Optimal sex ratio as a function of EGG incubation temperature in the crocodilians
VL  - 54
IS  - 1
SP  - 123-148
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing consensus as to the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination in the Crocodilia. The observationally and experimentally motivated hypotheses are that male fitness depends more strongly on quality of incubation environment than female fitness, and that there is a strong correlation between a female's egg incubation temperature choice and her own egg incubation temperature. A population genetics model based on these hypotheses is derived. A method for finding the optimal sex ratio as a function of temperature, which is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), is stated and applied under various assumptions. This extends ESS theory to the functional case. Cases where there is no ESS and the population sex ratio oscillates in evolutionary time are discovered. Numerical computation is needed to solve the full problem and the resulting optimal sex ratio is compared to laboratory sex ratio data. The general pattern of TSD in crocodilians (female-male-female with female biased overall sex ratio) agrees well with the theory, but details of the pattern are problematic. © 1991 Society for Mathematical Biology.

TI  - Laboratory production of early hatching Artemia sp. cysts by selection
VL  - 282
IS  - 1
SP  - 19-25
AB  - The goal of this study was to test whether it is possible to produce early hatching cysts of Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay (SFB) by truncation selection. The starting material was an SFB cyst sample, harvested in nature. After selection of early hatching nauplii had taken place, these selected individuals were cultured to maturity, and the hatching rate of their offspring (F-1) was compared with that of the parental generation and with the non-selected control F1. The possible differences in hatching rate were used to estimate heritability. Two different selection experiments were run, accompanied with a number of additional tests studying the influence of the hatching set-up, the hatching temperature and diapause termination using hydrogen peroxide, on the hatching rate. Also the influence of different culture salinities on hatching rate and on possible success of selection was studied. The results revealed an influence of all those abiotic factors on the hatching rate, but also a marked interference of the hatching percentage with the hatching rate. Choosing the individuals based on their own phenotypic values (hatching within a certain time span of hatching incubation) and using those to produce the next generation, revealed a positive response. The selection in different salinities showed a different response. Depending on the strength of the selection pressure, the samples were advanced in time, starting with the highest selection pressure, and ending with the control and the parental sample. In spite of the strong interference of environmental factors, our results suggest that selection of early hatching cysts is possible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 41

AB  - Oviposition site choice, which is one of the most important forms of parental care in oviparous reptiles, has major effects on incubation duration, reproductive success, and offspring phenotype. We determined the thermal characteristics of nest-sites selected by females of the lacertid lizard Psammodromus algirus in laboratory thermal gradients, and we linked results with information on the effects of temperature on incubation times and hatchling phenotypes. Temperatures at oviposition sites (mean ± SD = 26.0 ± 1.9°C) were on average lower and had a lower variance than those at available sites (32.0 ± 6.2°C). The duration of incubation decreased dramatically as temperature increased. In fact, the hatching dates predicted by the temperatures selected in the thermogradients were delayed with respect to the mean emergence dates observed in the field. Such disparity might occur because (1) natural incubation temperatures are variable rather than constant, (2) they are expected to rise later in the season, and (3) temperatures that are too high can severely compromise embryonic survival. In addition, females might select relatively low nest-site temperatures because hatching too early can force juveniles to face limited growth opportunities caused by food shortage in the Mediterranean environments in which they live.

AB  - Relationships between morphological variation trends in individuals of the genus Hegeter and several environmental variables of altitudinal sites were investigated. Classification (UPGMA) and ordination (PCA) techniques were used to examine these data. Several grouping trends showing high taxonomic variability were observed, although some dominance by individuals of certain species was found in each group. The major trend was related to body size (robust bodies) especially with the dimensions of the abdomen (subelytral capsule) and legs (ambulation) and was conditioned by temperature and broad soil types (xeric habitats). The second trend (broad bodies) was related to burrowing habits and was influenced by rainfall, vegetational parameters and soil carbon and organic matter content (moist habitats). Climatic and edaphic variables are factors limiting both growth of populations and evolutionary change in these detritivorous darkling beetles and co-occurring individuals of these species show the same adaptations to the environment.

AB  - Adaptive mutations appear in response to selection. In the best-studied system, the two most controversial issues were resolved this year. The mutations are neither Lamarckian nor a peculiarity of bacterial sex, as had been suggested. They occur genome-wide in a hypermutable subpopulation of stressed cells. Genomic 'hot' and 'cold' regions may explain previous failures to detect similar mutations in other systems and at other sites. Stationary phase specific limitation of mismatch repair has also been discovered. (C) Current Biology Ltd ISSN 0959-437X.

VL  - 2

SP  - 95-109
AB  - Crop management practices impact soil productivity by altering the soil environment, which in turn affects microbial growth and decomposition processes that transform plant-produced C to soil organic matter (SOM) or CO2. Long-term reduced tillage increases SOM, but little is known about the seasonal dynamics of soil CO2 evolution as affected by tillage and crop. The objectives were as follows: (1) To determine the effect of tillage (conventionally disked (CT) and no tillage (NT)) in monoculture sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench,), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) on the seasonal dynamics and soil depth distribution of, gravimetric soil water content (SWC), soil temperature, bulk density (ED), and water-filled pore space (WFPS). (2) To relate soil CO2 evolution to changes in these parameters. The soil was a Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) located in southcentral Texas. Soil CO2 evolution, using the static chamber method with alkali absorption, and physical parameters were measured 57 times during 2 years. Soil water content was greater under NT than under CT during the fallow period in all crops, but not always during the growing season. Soil ED was reduced shortly after tillage, but increased to levels observed under NT during wet and cold intervals in the fallow period and during the growing season in all crops. Soil temperature at sunrise was 0.7-1.6 degrees C greater under NT than under CT during spring and autumn months in all crops. Mean soil CO2 evolution was greater during the growing season than during fallow in all crops. Mean soil CO2 evolution during the fallow period was not different between tillage regimes in sorghum (1.25 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)), but was greater under NT compared with CT in wheat (1.88 vs. 1.65 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)) and in soybean (1.04 vs. 0.86 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)). During the growing season, soil CO2 evolution was greater under NT compared with CT in sorghum (2.04 vs. 1.84 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)) and in soybean (2.08 vs. 1.58 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)), but was lower under NT compared with CT in wheat (2.09 vs. 2.52 g CO2-C m(-2) day(-1)). Mean soil CO2 evolution during both periods was related to soil organic C (SOC) under CT, but not under NT. The combined effects of soil temperature, SWC (or WFPS), temperature-water interactions, days after harvest during the fallow period, and days after planting during the growing season explained 73 to 92% of the seasonal variation in soil CO2 evolution depending upon tillage regime and crop. In situ soil CO2 evolution responded to soil temperature and SWC differently depending upon tillage and crop management, suggesting that C budgets of agroecosystems derived from climatic data alone could be misleading. Conversion from CT to NT increased C sequestration in soil, but soil under NT released the same or more C as CO2 depending on crop during Year 9 and Year 10 after initiation, suggesting that the dynamics of C sequestration/mineralization had changed during the 10 year period.

VL  - 193

SP  - 241-260
AB  - Duration of emergence increases with tidal height on rocky shores therefore, emergence adaptations in intertidal species such as littorine and other prosobranch gastropods have been considered correlated with zonation patterns; temperature tolerance, desiccation resistance and aerial respiration rate all commonly assumed to increase progressively with increasing zonation level. Such direct correlations are rarely observed in nature. Maximal aerial gas exchange occurs in mid-shore, not high shore species. Temperature tolerance and desiccation resistance do not increase directly with shore height. Thus, hypotheses regarding physiological correlates of zonation require revaluation. A new hypothesis is presented that the high tide mark presents a single major physiological barrier on rocky shores. Above it, snails experience prolonged emergence and extensive desiccation; below it, predictable submergence and rehydration with each tidal cycle. Thus, desiccation stress is minimal below the high tide mark and maximal above it. Therefore, species restricted below high tide (the eulittoral zone) should display markedly different adaptive strategies to emergence than those above it (the eulittoral fringe). A review of the literature indicated that adaptations in eulittoral species are dominated by those allowing maintenance of activity and foraging in air including: evaporative cooling; low thermal tolerance; elevated aerial O2 uptake rates; and high capacity for radiant heat absorption. Such adaptations exacerbate evaporative water loss. In contrast, species restricted to the eulittoral fringe display adaptive strategies that minimize desiccation and prolong survival of emergence including: foot withdrawal, preventing heat conduction from the substratum; aestivation in air; elevated thermal tolerance reducing necessity for evaporative cooling; position maintenance by cementation to the substratum and increased capacity for heat dissipation. In order to test of this hypothesis the upper thermal limits, tissue and substratum temperatures on emergence in direct sunlight and evaporative water loss and tissue temperatures on emergence in 40 °C were evaluated for specimens of six species of eulittoral and eulittoral fringe gastropods from a granite shore on Princess Royal Harbour near Albany, Western Australia. The results were consistant with adaptation to the proposed desiccation barrier at high tide. The eulittoral species, Austrocochlea constricta, Austrocochlea concamerata, Nerita atramentosa and Lepsiella vinosa, displayed adaptations dominated by maintenance of activity and foraging during emergence while the eulittoral fringe littorine species, Bembicium vittatum and Nodilittorina unifasciata displayed adaptations dominated by minization of activity and evaporative water loss during emergence. The evolution of adaptations allowing tolerance of prolonged desiccation have allowed littorine species to dominate high intertidal rocky shore gastropod faunas throughout the world's oceans. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Aspects of thermal ecology and reproductive cyclicity are compared in two populations of the dice snake (Natrix tessellata), a semi-aquatic natricine species widely distributed across Europe. One population was studied near Leibnitz, Styria (south-eastern Austria), and the other one was studied in the Mounts of Tolfa near Rome (Latium, central Italy). The climate was strongly colder in the Austrian than in the Italian site. Snakes of both populations were similar in various traits, including average body temperature, higher mean body temperature of gravid than non-gravid individuals, significantly higher substratum temperatures selected by gravid than by non-gravid individuals, trends of relationships between body, air and substratum temperatures, average length of reproductive females, and average preparturition mass of reproductive females. However, Austrian snakes were found in water significantly less often than their Italian conspecifics (although in both populations nearly all individuals occurred close to water bodies), and showed a lower frequency of reproduction (biannual rather than annual) than Italian ones. The presented data are discussed in the light of suboptimal occupation of the colder area by Austrian snakes, and conservative rigidity of natural history and ecological traits of such a widespread species as N. tessellata.

AB  - Microbial populations have been found at the depth of 2621-2804 m in a borehole near the center of Triassic Taylorsville Basin, Virginia. To constrain possible scenarios for long-term survival in or introduction of these microbial populations to the deep subsurface, we attempted to refine models of thermal and burial history of the basin by analyzing aqueous and gaseous fluid inclusions in calcite/quartz veins or cements in cuttings from the same borehole. These results are complemented by fission-track data from the adjacent boreholes. Homogenization temperatures of secondary aqueous fluid inclusions range from 120° to 210°C between 2027- and 3069-m depth, with highest temperatures in the deepest samples. The salinities of these aqueous inclusions range from 0 to ∼ 4.3 eq wt% NaCl. Four samples from the depth between 2413 and 2931 m contain both two-phase aqueous and one-phase methane-rich inclusions in healed microcracks. The relative CH4 and CO2 contents of these gaseous inclusions was estimated by microthermometry and laser Raman spectroscopy. If both types of inclusions in sample 2931 m were trapped simultaneously, the density of the methane-rich inclusions calculated from the Peng - Robinson equation of state implies an entrapment pressure of 360 ± 20 bar at the homogenization temperature (162.5 ± 12.5°C) of the aqueous inclusions. This pressure falls between the hydrostatic and lithostatic pressures at the present depth 2931 m of burial. If we assume that the pressure regime was hydrostatic at the time of trapping, then the inclusions were trapped at 3.6 km in a thermal gradient of ∼ 40°C/km. The high temperatures recorded by the secondary aqueous inclusions are consistent with the pervasive resetting of zircon and apatite fission-track dates. In order to fit the fission-track length distributions of the apatite data, however, a cooling rate of 1-2°C/Ma following the thermal maximum is required. To match the integrated dates, the thermal maximum would have occurred at ∼ 200 Ma. The timing of the maximum temperature is consistent with rapid burial of the Taylorsville Basin to twice its present-day depth and thermal re-equilibration with a 40°C/km geothermal gradient, followed by slow exhumation. The results may imply that the microorganisms did not survive in situ, but were transported from the cooler portions of the basin sometime after maximum burial and heating.

AB  - 1. Climate change is affecting species distributions and will increasingly do so. However, current understanding of which individuals and species are most likely to survive and why is poor. Knowledge of assemblage or community level effects is limited and the balance of mechanisms that are important over different time-scales is poorly described. Laboratory experiments on marine animals predominantly employ rates of change 10-100 000 times faster than climate induced oceanic warming. To address this failure we investigated differences in individual and species abilities to tolerate warming, and also how rate of warming affected survival. 2. This study identifies community level effects of thermal biology by applying a multi-species, multi-trophic level approach to the analysis of temperature limits. 3. Within species analyses of 14 species from 6 phyla showed smaller individuals survived to higher temperatures than large animals when temperatures were raised acutely. If this trend continues at slower warming rates, the early loss of larger individuals has marked consequences at the population level as larger individuals form the major reproductive component. 4. Between species comparisons showed active species survived to higher temperatures than sessile or low activity groups. Thus active groups (e.g. predators) and juvenile or immature individuals should fare better in rapid warming scenarios. This would be expected to produce short-term ecological imbalances in warming events. 5. The rate of warming markedly affected temperature limits in a wide range of Antarctic marine species. Different species survived to temperatures of 8.3-17.6 degrees C when temperatures were raised by around 1 degrees C day(-1). However they only survived to temperatures between 4.0 degrees C and 12.3 degrees C when temperatures were raised by around 1-2 degrees C week(-1), and temperatures of only 1.0-6.0 degrees C were tolerated for acclimations over periods of months. 6. Current models predicting range changes of species in response to climate change are either correlative or mechanistic. Mechanistic models offer the potential to incorporate the ecophysiological adaptation and evolutionary processes which determine future responses and go beyond simple correlative approaches. These models depend on the incorporation of data on species capacities to resist and adapt to change. This study is an important step in the provision of such data from experimental manipulations.

VL  - 5
IS  - 3
AB  - [1] Toward understanding of the subduction mass balance in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) convergent margin, we present an inventory of N and C concentrations and isotopic compositions in sediments obtained on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 129 and 185. Samples from Sites 1149, 800, 801, and 802 contain 5 to 661 ppm total N ( organic, inorganic combined) with delta(15)N(Air) of - 0.2 to + 8.2parts per thousand (all delta(15)N values <+ 2.5 parts per thousand from Site 800). At Site 1149, N content is higher in clay-rich layers and lower in chert and carbonate layers, and delta N-15 shows a distinct down-section decrease from 0 to 120 mbsf ( near + 8.0 at shallow levels to near + 4.0 parts per thousand). Reduced-C concentration ranges from 0.02 to 0.5 wt.%, with delta C-13(VPDB) of - 28.1 to - 21.7 parts per thousand. The down-section decreases in delta N-15 and N concentration ( and variations in concentrations and delta C-13 of reduced C, and C-reduced/N) at Site 1149 could help reconcile differences between delta N-15 values of modern deep-sea sediments from near the sediment-water interface and values for forearc metasedimentary rocks. At Site 1149, negative shifts in delta N-15, from marine organic values (up to similar to+ 8 parts per thousand) toward lower values approaching those for the metasedimentary rocks (+ 1 to + 3 parts per thousand), are most likely caused by complex diagenetic processes, conceivably with minor effects of changes in productivity and differing proportions of marine and terrestrial organic matter. However, the forearc metamorphic suites (e.g., Franciscan Complex) are known to have been deposited nearer continents, and their lower delta N-15 at least partly reflects larger proportions of lower-delta N-15 terrestrial organic matter. Subduction at the Izu-Bonin (IB) margin, of a sediment section like that at Site 1149, would deliver an approximate annual subduction flux of 2.5 x 10(6) g of N and 1.4 x 10(7) g of reduced C per linear kilometer of trench, with average delta N-15 of + 5.0 parts per thousand and delta C-13 of - 24 parts per thousand. Incorporating the larger C flux of 9.2 x 10(8) g/ yr/ linear-km in carbonate-rich layers of 1149B ( average delta C-13 = + 2.3 parts per thousand) provides a total C flux of 9.3 x 10(8) g/yr/linear-km (delta C-13 = + 1.9 parts per thousand). Once subducted, sediments are shifted to higher delta N-15 by N loss during devolatilization, with magnitudes of the shifts depending on the thermal evolution of the margin.

TI  - Fisheries-induced evolutionary changes in maturation reaction norms in North Sea sole Solea solea
VL  - 351
SP  - 189-199
AB  - Age and size at maturation decreased in several commercially exploited fish stocks, which, according to life history theory, may be due to fisheries-induced evolutionary change. However, the observed changes may also represent a plastic response to environmental variability. To disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary change, the probabilistic reaction norm approach was applied to 43 cohorts (1960 to 2002) of female sole Solea solea from market samples. The reaction norm for age and size at first maturation has significantly shifted towards younger age and smaller size. Size at 50% probability of maturation at Age 3 decreased from 28.6 cm (251 g) to 24.6 cm (128 g). This change was even stronger when condition was included as a third dimension in the reaction norm estimation. The influence of alternative factors was tested on the population level by regression of reaction norm midpoints on annual estimates of condition, temperature and competitive biomass. Although effects of temperature and competitive biomass were significant, the variation in the midpoints was best explained by the decreasing time trend. Therefore, the results provide strong evidence for a fisheries-induced evolutionary change in the onset of sexual maturity. © Inter-Research 2007.

VL  - 59

SP  - 176-181
AB  - In many countries increased winter mortality from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) has been documented. A causal relationship between change in air temperature and change in number of deaths has been suggested. There is also evidence for a delay between a fall in air temperature and death (lag effect). We have investigated these relationships using mortality data for CVD (ICD-9: 390-459) and daily air temperatures in selected winter months (December to March) from two densely populated areas in Norway and Ireland, Oslo/Akershus and Dublin. A specially designed computer programme was used to select data from specific days in the ten years period. The days selected depended on the temperature change chosen between two consecutive days. We examined 2 types of temperature change, a large change and little or no change. An analytical technique involving the use of Spearman's correlations coefficients was used to investigate delays in mortality following a particular change in temperature. For groups of selected days, an inverse relation between mortality and air temperature was found. For neither the Oslo/Akershus nor the Dublin data was it possible to see a sudden increase in mortality following a large, sudden decrease in temperature and no evidence for a delay between a change in temperature and a change in mortality rate was found.

AB  - New methods of weather analysis accompanied by microhabitat 'bioassays' have been applied in several case studies to demonstrate effects of atmospheric processes on patterns of community composition and structure and potential species evolution. Average spatial and seasonal airmass dynamics which determine regional and elevational patterns of relative microhabitat favorability, were found to vary between a recent global warming trend (ca 1900 to 1940) and the subsequent global cooling trend (ca 1940 to 1970). These apparently systematic spatial and temporal shifts in weather were related to plant establishment patterns and community composition and structure. The proposed causal mechanisms function, in part, through regional shifts in microhabitat size. These effects are similar to larger scale, longer term shifts deduced from the late Quaternary fossil record. By modifying the spatial approach, month-to-month and year-to-year variability of weather has been examined for the last 130 years at individual points in southwestern North America. Three climatic regimes (the end of the Little Ice Age, the recent warming trend and the recent cooling trend) exhibited distinct year-to-year patterns of weather that can be related to the establishment of different kinds of plants (e.g., C4 grasses versus C3 shrubs). Oscillations between different temporal climatic regimes appear to promote the episodic establishment of different life forms, but not necessarily their local extinction. The two methods of weather analysis have been combined in a regional assessment of climatic controls of different biomes in space and time with a primary focus on the Chihuahuan desert. Natural ecotones between the Chihuahuan desert and neighboring biomes are clearly related to large scale airmass dynamics associated with seasonal oscillations in jetstream position. The weather patterns controlling ecotonal positions result from seasonal topographic influences on the general circulation of the atmosphere. The apparent stability of these patterns allows causal hypotheses of biogeographic dynamics and the evolution of physiological traits and life history characteristics. © 1987 Dr W. Junk Publishers.

VL  - 62

SP  - 83-92
AB  - In the present study, various body size scaling relationships describing the physiological performance of plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L) were derived using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model and compared with allometric relationships derived from a static energy budget (SEB) model. Results indicated that DEB models can correctly predict the physiological performance of plaice within variable environments. Dynamic energy budgets are preferred over static energy budgets because they are not descriptive but based on first principles, they are not species-specific, and they can be used for extrapolations beyond the range of experimental data. Nevertheless, some aspects of the DEB model can still be improved. These include: I I I processes underlying the temperature tolerance range, temperature acclimation and the relationship between optimal temperature and body size; [21 the contribution of various processes to metabolism; and [3] the incorporation and quantification of Fry's scheme of the environment, especially of masking factors (e.g., sub-optimal salinity conditions which load the minimum metabolism) and limiting factors (e.g., low oxygen conditions that constrain the maximum metabolic rate). These improvements would offer a wide range of opportunities for further application. such as the reconstruction of food and growth conditions; the validation of age determination by means of otolith readings: the analysis of intraspecific genetic variability versus non-genetic phenotypic adaptations: and the interspecific comparison of energy flows by means of variability in the various DEB model parameters.

AB  - One concept of evolutionary ecology holds that a living fossil is the result of past evolutionary events, and is adapted to recent selective forces only if they are similar to the selective forces in the past. We describe the present environment of the living coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae Smith, 1939 at Grande Comore, western Indian Ocean and report depth-dependent cave distribution, temperature, salinity and oxygen values which are compared to the fish's distribution and its physiological demands. We studied the activity pattern, feeding behaviour, prey abundance and hunting success to evaluate possible links between environmental conditions, feeding ecology and evolutionary success of this ancient fish. Transmitter tracking experiments indicate nocturnal activity of the piscivorous predator which hunts between approximately 200 m below the surface to 500 m depth. Fish and prey density were measured between 200 and 400 m, both increase with depth. Feeding tracks and feeding strikes of the coelacanth at various depths were simulated with the help of video and laser techniques. Along a 9447 m video transect a total of 31 potential feeding strikes occurred. Assuming 100% hunting success, medium-sized individuals would obtain 122 g and large females 299 g of prey. Estimates of metabolic rates revealed for females 3.7 ml O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) and for males 4.5 ml O-2 kg(-1) h(-1). Today coelacanths are considered to be a specialist deep-water form and to inhabit, with their ancient morphology, a contemporary environment where they compete with advanced, modern fish.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity and developmental temperature in drosophila: Analysis and significance of reaction norms of morphometrical traits
VL  - 22
IS  - 6
SP  - 441-451
AB  - In ectotherm species like Drosophila, morphometrical quantitative traits exhibit a large amount of phenotypic plasticity as a consequence of developmental temperature. Generally the response curves called reaction norms, are non-linear and exhibit either single max-ma or minima, or a sigmoid shape. Up to now, such complex shapes were mainly considered as non-adaptive, reflecting interactions between internal developmental constraints and the environment. We show that the general, all purpose method of polynomial adjustment provides a convenient way for the description of the norms. From the polynomial parameters, characteristic values with an obvious biological significance (e.g, the temperature of a maximum size), can be calculated and used for comparing populations or species. Experimental data on body pigmentation and body size show that the shapes of the reaction norms are genetically variable and suggest adaptive responses to the environment. The possible occurrence of specific regulatory genes acting on norm shape will be a matter fur further investigations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of biologically low temperature (12 degrees C) on the parameters of microbial population such as survival, catalase activity and its isoenzyme spectrum have been investigated on the models of Escherichia coli and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The quantity of nucleic acids, plasmid spectrum and temperature effect on the level of plasmid DNA spiralization were studied under these conditions. The process of molecular genetic adaptation of bacterial populations having the broad temperature limits of growth and demonstrating the increased genetical expression when affected by the biologically low temperature has been found to be regulated on the transcriptional level. The inducible catalase isoenzymes participate in adaptation. The effect of biologically low temperature on the level of the plasmid DNA superhelicity and DNA quantity during the short period of poststress was not demonstrated.

TI  - Insect thermal tolerance: What is the role of ontogeny, ageing and senescence?
VL  - 83
IS  - 3
SP  - 339-355
AB  - Temperature has dramatic evolutionary fitness consequences and is therefore a major factor determining the geographic distribution and abundance of ectotherms. However, the role that age might have on insect thermal tolerance is often overlooked in studies of behaviour, ecology, physiology and evolutionary biology. Here, we review the evidence for ontogenetic and ageing effects on traits of high- and low-temperature tolerance in insects and show that these effects are typically pronounced for most taxa in which data are available. We therefore argue that basal thermal tolerance and acclimation responses (i.e. phenotypic plasticity) are strongly influenced by age and/or ontogeny and may confound studies of temperature responses if unaccounted for. We outline three alternative hypotheses which can be distinguished to propose why development affects thermal tolerance in insects. At present no studies have been undertaken to directly address these options. The implications of these age-related changes in thermal biology are discussed and, most significantly, suggest that the temperature tolerance of insects should be defined within the age-demographics of a particular population or species. Although we conclude that age is a source of variation that should be carefully controlled for in thermal biology, we also suggest that it can be used as a valuable tool for testing evolutionary theories of ageing and the cellular and genetic basis of thermal tolerance. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Drying of single porous bodies by convection was investigated in order to determine if the moisture is only partially miscible. 2-Propanol, water, and 1-butanol and mixtures of these solvents were used as model solvents. Drying experiments were performed at various air temperatures, air velocities, body sizes, initial compositions, and porosity of the sample material. Large bodies do not dry selectively until most of the moisture is removed. Porosity, air velocity and air temperature influences the selectivity if the moisture separates into two liquid phases.

AB  - Ethylene oxide was experimentally produced by using ethylene recovered from catalytic cracking dry gas in the presence of YS silver catalyst. The initial selectivity of the reaction reached 80%. The productivity remained unchanged after the 2000-hr experiment; the selectivity was reduced by 3-4%, and the reaction temperature was raised by ∼ 10°C. Compared with the reaction with the polymerization grade ethylene as feed, the initial selectivity was 2-3% lower.

TI  - Some like it cool? Intermorph comparison of preferred body temperature in a colour-dimorphic snake
VL  - 59
IS  - 1
SP  - 31-39
AB  - Organismal characteristics of ectotherms are profoundly affected by body temperature (T-b). Despite constraints imposed by environmental factors, they can adjust T-b by several means. However, if thermoregulatory ability is limited by their own property such as coloration and this constraint affects individuals fitness, selection may promote coevolution of coloration and thermal aspects. I investigated this topic using a colour-dimorphic (melanistic/striped) snake Elaphe quadrivirgata as a model species. Recent laboratory experiment revealed slower body warming in striped individuals than in melanistic individuals. Under this circumstance, one way that striped individuals can manage their slower body warming is to prefer low Tb. Contrary to this prediction, there was no intermorph difference in preferred Tb. Coupled with the results of field studies, I suggest that striped individuals manage their slower body warming by behavioural thermoregulation and that constraints (e.g., high predation risk due to conspicuousness under thermally superior habitats) imposed on melanistic individuals lessen their thermal advantages. The effect of melanism on thermal aspects may not be so advantageous for melanistic animals than generally thought. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2009.

AB  - Geographic morphological variation of Bufo kerinyagae Keith, 1968 and Bufo regularis Reuss, 1834 (Anura Bufonidae) related to ecological conditions has been studied using bivariate and multiple regression analyses. B. kerinyagae exhibits variation in body size which is negatively correlated with altitude and mean annual rainfall and positively correlated with mean annual temperature. This pattern may have been produced by natural selection acting to lessen rate of loss of body water in drier environments by affecting surface to volume ratios. It may also reflect faster growth rates at higher temperatures. B. regularis shows clinal variation of body size that is positively correlated with mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall but not directly related to altitude. This too may represent growth rates related to different primary and secondary productivities of localities with their different temperatures. It could also represent an adaptive strategy favoring small body size in drier areas to facilitate behavior that would limit the rate of water loss. The effects of clinal variation in B. asmarae, B. kerinyagae and B. regularis produce convergence of body size in the Ethiopian highlands at elevations where the three species are most likely to be syntopic. Possible origins of B. asmarae Tandy et al., 1982 are considered. Because of its chromosome number, we know that B. asmarae must have arisen from one or more species of the B. regularis complex which have a diploid number of 20 and which are restricted to Africa. Its morphology, mating call structure, ecological preferences and geographic distribution suggest close relationship to both B. kerinyagae and B. regularis. Evidence suggests that it may be an allotetraploid which developed through hybridization between Ethiopian populations of these two species. Potential interactions and the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms among B. asmarae, B. kerinyagae and B. regularis are discussed. B. asmarae is not known to be syntopic with any other species of Bufo, although its ecological range overlaps those of others, including B. kerinya- gae and B. regularis. The three species appear to have evolved toward spatial isolation involving altitude-related ecological preferences. Character displacement of climatic requirements of Ethiopian B. kerinyagae away from those of B. asmarae and B. regularis appears to contribute to this isolation. Differences in ecological preferences may now function as the main premating isolating mechanisms among these species. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Allometry for sexual size dimorphism: Testing two hypotheses for Rensch's rule in the water strider Aquarius remigis
VL  - 166
IS  - 4
SP  - S69-S84
AB  - Within any given clade, male size and female size typically covary, but male size often varies more than female size. This generates a pattern of allometry for sexual size dimorphism (SSD) known as Rensch's rule. I use allometry for SSD among populations of the water strider Aquarius remigis (Hemiptera, Gerridae) to test the hypothesis that Rensch's rule evolves in response to sexual selection on male secondary sexual traits and an alternative hypothesis that it is caused by greater phenotypic plasticity of body size in males. Comparisons of three populations reared under two temperature regimes are combined with an analysis of allometry for genital and somatic components of body size among 25 field populations. Contrary to the sexual-selection hypothesis, genital length, the target of sexual selection, shows the lowest allometric slope of all the assayed traits. Instead, the results support a novel interpretation of the differential-plasticity hypothesis: that the traits most closely associated with reproductive fitness (abdomen length in females and genital length in males) are "adaptively canalized." While this hypothesis is unlikely to explain Rensch's rule among species or higher clades, it may explain widespread patterns of intraspecific variation in SSD recently documented for many insect species. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Antioxidant status and stress resistance in long- and short-lived lines of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 36
IS  - 3
SP  - 441-463
AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the nature of the biochemical and physiological variations between genetically different lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Selection for early or delayed reproduction has given rise to lines with substantial and heritable differences in longevity. The hypotheses tested were that either: (i) a compensatory slowing of metabolism, (ii) increased antioxidative enzyme activities, or (iii) elevated resistance to stressful conditions underlie these differences in longevity. The metabolic rate, metabolic potential (i.e. total amount of oxygen consumed during average lifespan) and speed of walking were all greater in long-lived than in short-lived flies, but then was no enhancement of antioxidant defenses. In fact, catalase activity was significantly lower in the long-lived dies. Long life was largely maintained under heat stress and starvation conditions, and was maintained to a lesser extent upon exposure to paraquat, a superoxide radical generator. In contrast, the 'short-lived' flies had a longer lifespan under cold stress and hyperoxia, also an inducer of radical generation. These results contradict the first two hypotheses and suggest that alleles underlying either long or short life are linked with enhanced resistance to specific kinds of stress, which may account for the preservation of these alleles in the parental population.

AB  - The object of this account is to show how much one can interprete and predict about the present state of material forming planet size objects, despite the fact we do not and could never have the kind of exact or prior knowledge of initial conditions and in situ material behaviour that would make a formal mathematical analysis of the dynamical problems of planetary evolution an efficient or meaningful exercise The interest and usefulness of results obtained within these limitations stem from the highly non linear nature of planetary scale heat transfer problems when posed in any physically plausible form. The non linearity arising from a strongly temperature dependent rheology assumed for in situ planetary material is particularly valuable in deriving results insensitive to such uncertainties. Qualitatively, the thermal evolution of a planet is quite unlike that given by heat conduction calculation below a very superficial layer, and much unnecessary argument and confusion results from a persistent failure to recognise that fact. At depths that are no greater on average than a few tens of kilometres in the case of Earth, the temperature distribution is determined by a convective flow regime inaccessble to the laboratory experimenter and to the numerical methods regularly employed to study convective movement. A central and guiding quantitative result is the creation in homogeneous planet size objects having surface temperatures less than about half the absolute melting temperature of their material, of internal states with horizontally a veraged viscosity values ∼1021 poise. This happens in times short compared with the present Solar System age. The significance of this result for an understanding of such processes and features as isostasy, continental drift, a minimum in seismic S wave velocity in Earth's upper mantle, a uniformity of mantle viscosity values, the survival of liquid planetary cores and the differentiation of terrestrial planet material is examined. After a discussion and definition of 'lithospheric' material, it is concluded that endogenous tectonic activity only continues on Earth's surface on account of water enhancing the deformability of its rocks. Metal/silicate differentiation of terrestrial planet material is predicted to have been a global scale catastrophic process in the many objects it formed predating the existing planets, but intersilicate and volatile/silicate separations are necessarily protracted, quasi continous processes arising from local shear instabilties in the convective flow of such a viscous material. In particular, these local magma producing instabilities require the involvement of 'lithospheric' planetary material in convective movements and it is shown how this unsteadiness accounts for the distribution and salient features of planetary seismicity and vulcanicity at the present time. The picture that emerges for the state of Earth's silicate shell material after more than four billion years of average viscosity regulation and shear instability is one of chemical and isotopic heterogeneity on a wide range of length scales. The larger length scales of this range are introduced by the pattern of heterogeneity remixing rather than its generation. For example, at the largest scale, the predicted heterogeneity is radial and a feature indirectly arising from properties conferred on the shell material by major mineral phase transitions at depths ∼700km. These increase the adiabatic temperature gradient and have the effect of a barrier adequate in strength to prevent wholesale mixing of the material above and below for at least a large fraction of the Earth's history in which radiogenic heat has been the dominant cause of large scale internal movements. That such a barrier actually marks a chemical and isotopic heterogeneity of the mantle is because only the convective movements above it are prone to the shear heating instabilities on which differentiation absolutely depends. Many millions of such instabilities in this shallower shell material would by now have created a three dimensional heterogeneity extending downward in length scale to ∼1km. However, only 10% of this shell material has yet experienced these highly localised shear heating instabilities and one would predict a continuing emission of primitive volatile phases and a widespread metasomatism even if the same convective movements had not recycled material from the hydrosphere. Such recycling is a further aspect of convective self regulation. The mesoscale and lateral heterogeneity of near surface material more familiarly referred to as continental crust and its underlying mantle is another cumulative feature of the remixing process-in this case the result of separated ultrabasic and less refractory fractions of the upper shell material from many shear heating events being able to form superficial blocks, whose net buoyancy and coherency make them immune to entrainment and remixing by the radiogenically driven flow. This partial but permanent concentration of lower melting point silicate and volatile phases near the external surface has in turn caused a gradual increase of the horizontally averaged temperatures associated with the self regulating convective state at upper mantle depths. This thermal evolution has strengthened the barrier to convective mixing of the whole silicate shell presented by its major phase transitions but it could explain a persistent small scale incorporation of more primitive, i.e. less differentiated shell material from the phase transition region into the upper shell convective circulation. © 1985 D.

TI  - The evolution of high-temperature mylonitic microfabrics: Evidence from simple shearing of a quartz analogue (norcamphor)
VL  - 18
IS  - 5
SP  - 689-710
AB  - Plane strain simple shearing of norcamphor (C7H10O) in a see-through deformation rig to a shear strain of gamma = 10.5 at a homologous temperature of T-h = 0.81 yields a microfabric similar to that of quartz in amphibolite facies mylonite. Synkinematic analysis of the norcamphor microfabric reveals that the development of a steady-state texture is linked to changes in the relative activities of several grain-scale mechanisms. Three stages of textural and microstructural evolution are distinguished: (1) rotation and shearing of the intracrystalline glide planes are accommodated by localized deformation along three sets of anastomozing microshears. A symmetrical c-axis girdle reflects localized pure shear extension along the main microshear set (S-a) oblique to the bulk shear zone boundary (abbreviated as SZB); (2) progressive rotation of the microshears into parallelism with the SZB increases the component of simple shear on the S-a microshears. Grain-boundary migration recrystallization favours the survival of grains with slip systems oriented for easy glide. This is associated with a textural transition towards two stable c-axis point maxima whose skeletal outline is oblique with respect to the S-a microshears and the SZB; and (3) at high shear strains (gamma > 8), the microstructure, texture and mechanism assemblage are strain invariant, but strain continues to partition into rotating sets of microshears. Steady state is therefore a dynamic, heterogeneous condition involving the cyclic nucleation, growth and consumption of grains. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

TI  - Costs and benefits of symbiont infection in aphids: Variation among symbionts and across temperatures
VL  - 273
IS  - 1586
SP  - 603-610
AB  - Symbiosis is prevalent throughout the tree of life and has had a significant impact on the ecology and evolution of many bacteria and eukaryotes. The benevolence of symbiotic interactions often varies with the environment, and such variation is expected to play an important role in shaping the prevalence and distributions of symbiosis throughout nature. In this study, we examine how the fitness of aphids is influenced by infection with one of three maternally transmitted bacteria, 'Candidatus Serratia symbiotica', 'Candidatus Hamiltonella defensa' and 'Candidatus Regiella insecticola', addressing how symbiont benevolence varies with temperature. We find that the effects of these 'secondary' symbionts on Acyrthosiphon pisum depend on when and whether aphids are exposed to a brief period of heat shock. We also demonstrate that symbionts - even closely related isolates - vary in their effects on hosts. Our results indicate similar effects of S. symbiotica and H. defensa in conferring tolerance to high temperatures and a liability of R. insecticola under these same conditions. These findings reveal a role for heritable symbionts in the adaptation of aphids to their abiotic environments and add to an expanding body of knowledge on the adaptive significance of symbiosis. © 2005 The Royal Society.

TI  - Effect of diesel fuel on exhaust smoke and odor
SP  - 509-520
AB  - This paper reports the results of an extensive program of laboratory investigation of diesel exhaust smoke and odor carried out on two popu lar automotive-type diesel engines. Highlights follow: Although fuels may be chosen to give desired results along any selected lines of engine per formance, it is not possible to obtain all desirable results with a single fuel, at least not without re course to additives. The only present solution appears to be fuel selection on the basis of a compromise amongst the various factors involved. Proper interpreta tion of the engine performance characteristics most desired and consideration to the type and mechanical condition of the engine used should result in selection of fuels for utmost satisfaction. Althoughpronounced exhaust smoke and odor occur under full load, the most objectionable con ditions were those occurring during idling, acceleration after idling and, occasionally, deceler ation with the clutch engaged. From this finding and the results of the tests made, it appears that an increase in cetane number will produce a de cided decrease in exhaust smoke by virtue of its ability to support combustion under adverse con ditions of low output. In an attempt to minimize the obnoxious smoke and odor from exhaust gases of diesel-powered vehicles, numerous operators have resorted to kerosene-type fuels. While this expedient did re sult in a substantial reduction in exhaust smoke, it was accompanied by a pronounced loss in power and economy due to the lower available heating value on a volume basis.

TI  - Life at body temperatures below 0 degrees C: the physiology and biochemistry of Antarctic fishes
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
SP  - 25-34
AB  - Fishes of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica are dominated by species of the suborder Notothenoidei. For approximately 14MY, these highly successful fishes have evolved under stable thermal conditions that result in a body temperature of ca. 0 degrees C throughout their life histories. Evolution in this chronically cold environment has led to unusual physiological and biochemical characteristics. In some cases, these characteristics are essential to survival and normal biological function at cold body temperature (e.g., development of antifreeze glycoproteins, structural modification of enzymes, cold-stable microtubules, and cardiovascular adaptations). In other instances, mutations that probably would have been lethal in warmer, less oxygen-rich environments than the Southern Ocean have been retained in Antarctic fishes (e.g., loss of hemoglobin production and variable expression of myoglobin in one notothenioid family, the Channichthyidae). These unique animals offer opportunities for insight into evolutionary processes leading to physiological and biochemical characteristics that either arise from strong selective pressure or persist through relaxation of selective pressure. After briefly describing the Antarctic marine environment, I discuss several unique aspects of the physiology and biochemistry of Antarctic fishes, specifically emphasizing our laboratory's recent studies of an unusual pattern of myoglobin expression in the Channichthyid icefishes.

TI  - Olefin polymerization using supported metallocene catalysts: Process representation scheme and mathematical model
VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 285-311
AB  - A mathematical model, including the main morphological features of the polymerization process, is developed to study olefin polymerization with supported metallocene catalysts. Because the relatively large amount of methyl alumoxane (MAO) usually needed as a cocatalyst represents a disadvantage, the model introduces a scheme that simulates the results of the efforts being made in a supported catalyst to reduce MAO requirements to commercially acceptable levels. Critical fragmentation steps in the initial support-catalyst particles that render all active sites effectively available to the monomer are specifically considered, on the basis of the support morphological characteristics. With the available reaction data, fragmentation representation alternatives are discussed and a scheme proposed. Then, a mathematical model is developed based on the above representation scheme, to calculate monomer-concentration, temperature, and macroparticle-size evolutions. The main features of the scheme are displayed and discussed. Both for laboratory and high-productivity conditions, the model is used to predict changes in macro- and microparticle size, porosity, and concentration distribution. Predictions are employed to evaluate the impact of the initial support microparticle arrangement and fragmentation processes on the overall catalyst performance. Polymer yield, concentration profiles, and temperature transients predicted by the model are presented, showing the model application after verifying its accordance with the available experimental data.

VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 105-109
AB  - Fecundity, egg weight, hatching success of eggs, and adult (offspring) weight were compared between three geographically separated populations (i.e., subspecies) of the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe. All these traits differed substantially between populations. Our data suggest that, on an interpopulational level, egg size is traded off against egg number, egg size varies independent of adult size, and there is (given equal egg size) a positive relationship between adult weight (body size) and fecundity. The significantly heavier eggs of the alpine population Lycaena hippothoe eurydame showed strikingly increased hatchability, especially at high temperatures, as compared to the other populations. However, the ultimate reasons favoring large egg size in the alpine population, whether as a result of direct selection on egg size, as a correlated response based on other selective pressures, or reflecting relaxed selection for maximized fecundity, remain to be discovered.

VL  - 34

SP  - 447-464
AB  - 1. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled for 1 year to assess functional and taxonomic differences in invertebrate biomass and production with respect to habitat types, reaches and catchments in Wine Spring Basin, western North Carolina. Quantitative samples were collected from depositional, cobble‐riffle and bedrock outcrop habitats at four stream reaches (two headwater sites, one second order, and one third order). Other measures included physical parameters, periphyton and organic matter standing crops. Invertebrate data from the Wine Spring catchment were also compared with data from another catchment (Ball Creek) within the same region. 2. The three habitat types had different current velocities and mean substratum particle sizes; both measures were greatest in bedrock outcrop habitats and lowest in depositional habitats. Organic matter standing crops, invertebrate functional group productivity and biomass also differed significantly with respect to habitat type. Cobble‐riffle areas had the lowest standing crops of organic matter, invertebrate productivity and biomass. 3. Both invertebrate communities and organic matter standing crops differed significantly between the two headwater reaches. First‐ to third‐order reaches differed in taxonomic composition at the genus level, yet had similar relative functional group productivity and biomass. 4. Annual mean invertebrate biomass and secondary production were greater in the Wine Spring Basin than in Ball Creek. Sites in both the Wine Spring and Ball Creek catchments, however, exhibited similar functional group distributions per habitat type. 5. Local geomorphology and related physical parameters influenced the structure of invertebrate functional group composition, and the distribution of organic matter standing crops. Furthermore, comparison of community structure in Wine Spring with that in Ball Creek suggested that taxonomic composition was more related to catchment‐specific parameters (e.g. thermal regime, evolutionary history) than stream size.

TI  - Terminal Cretaceous environmental and evolutionary changes
VL  - 190

AB  - Significant changes of the chemistry, temperatures and plankton fertility in the oceans took place in the first fifty thousand years of the Tertiary. Those changes are recorded by the bulk chemical, the oxygen-isotope and the carbon-isotope compositions of the oldest Tertiary sediments. Detailed analyses of a Cretaceous/Tertiary section from a South Atlantic drillsite indicated that the extinction of the Cretaceous nannoplankton species took place during the times of the environmental changes. Taking into consideration the various evidences for a terminal Cretaceous large-body impact, it is proposed that the impact event was the cause of the changes in ocean environments, which in turn led to the rapid extinction of marine plankton species. -AuthorsGeological Inst.

SP  - 299-304
AB  - A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to study the effect of dietary lipid level on growth performance of juvenile Sacramento splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus at 18°C. We selected this temperature to simulate their natural habitats, although an earlier study showed that their optimum temperature was 22-26°C. Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets were formulated to contain 2-12% lipid in 2% increments, and dietary lipid was an equal mix of corn oil and cod liver oil. Fish with an average initial body weigh of 9.0 ± 0.2 g (mean ± SE, n = 24) were kept in a 24-tank, flow-through system with 15 fish per tank, and each diet was randomly assigned to four replicate tanks of fish. Fish were fed 3.0% of their body weight per day by automatic feeders, which dispensed a small amount of feed every few minutes in daylight hours. Body weight and feed efficiency increased significantly with increasing dietary lipid level up to 8%. Fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid showed significantly higher body weight increase and feed efficiency than those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Dietary lipid level did not affect the hepatosomatic index, condition factor, and intraperitoneal fat ratio. Whole-body moisture was significantly lower but lipid was higher in fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid than in those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Histological analysis revealed a higher prevalence of hepatocellular fatty vacuolation in fish fed the diet containing 12% lipid. Based on a broken-line analysis, a dietary lipid level of 8.4% is recommended for juvenile splittail reared at 18°C.

TI  - In vitro sensitivity of human hematopoietic progenitor cells to hyperthermia: Critical temperature for cells to survive and its application to in vitro purging
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SP  - 243-246
AB  - Normal tissue toxicity is a major concern in cancer therapy. Since the hyperthermic killing of normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells including multilineage progenitor cells (CFU-mix) other than committed granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (CFU-GM) is not known, we have studied the thermal sensitivity of various types of human hematopoietic progenitor cells: early and late erythroid progenitors (CFU-E and BFU-E), CFU-GM and CFU-mix using semisolid clonogenic assays. When these progenitor cells were exposed at 42-44°C for 2 h, their thermal sensitivity always appeared to be in the order of CFU-E>BFU-E>CFU-GM>CFU-mix; the CFU-mix was the most tolerant to heat damage. In addition, the survival of human hematopoietic progenitor cells decreased exponentially in exposure time- and temperature-dependent manner. At 44°C human hematopoietic progenitor cells including CFU-mix dropped dramatically in number and therefore were unable to form colonies in vitro after exposure for 2 h. This suggests that 44°C may be the critical temperature for the CFU-mix to survive in vitro. Thus temperatures selected for hyperthermia used to purge residual leukemic cells in remission marrow grafts should be 43°C or lower.

VL  - 8

SP  - 309-326
AB  - The fossil record of land isopods is of little help in tracing the evolution of their terrestrial adaptations; however, we can usefully correlate the traits of various extant species with their various environments. Loss of cuticular water varies greatly between species, generally in relation to habitat, although the mechanism restricting loss is unclear. Both endocuticular and epicuticular barriers have been reported, the latter in Venizillo arizonicus. Pseudotracheae are advantageous for respiration in dry air, but again the mechanism is not clear. Excess nitrogen is excreted mainly as ammonia gas. Wide osmotic variation in the hemolymph resulting from dehydration is tolerated. Lethal temperatures vary in general according to habitat, and are affected by size, humidity, permeability of the cuticle, and previous temperature history. Evaporative cooling is sometimes of survival value for short periods. Metabolic rate is affected by season, and both long photoperiod and high temperatures are necessary for gonadal development and breeding. Responses to light, temperature, and humidity are more labile than previously thought. A peripheral hygro-receptor has tentatively been identified. The mechanism of bunching is largely thigmotactic, but olfaction may play a part, as it does in shelter-seeking. More information is now available about the micro-climates of habitats. In Porcellio scaber, nightly activity on trees in some situations permits elimination of excess water by transpiration. In Armadillidium vulgare nightly activity is greater in moister air, and drowning is a density-dependent mechanism for population control during heavy rains. Isopods are successful as land animals. Further study of population and distribution limits by combined ecological and physiological methods would be fruitful. © 1968 American Society of Zoologists.

VL  - 51
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-76
AB  - Dysdercus superstitiosus (F.) is capable of utilising a much wider range of food-plants than was previously supposed, and is able to complete a full breeding cycle on the several diets other than cotton. This has been demonstrated by rearing and breeding adults and nymphs in the laboratory, in Uganda, on selected food material, e.g., Sorghum vulgare, Pennisetum typhoides, Zea mays and Vigna unguiculata, immature seeds of each being used. Diets other than mature cotton seeds are less suitable for breeding, as judged by fecundity of females and development of nymphs, but the influence of nymphal diet on adult fecundity is not consistent. Females reared on sorghum are smaller than those reared on cotton seed and they may lay fewer eggs. There is an indication that varieties of sorghum may differ in their suitability for producing maximum fecundity and fertility. Those varieties to which the stainer exhibits a predisposition in the field may not be the most suitable. When adults are fed on cotton bolls of ages 1–10 weeks, the fecundity of females, and the rate of egg-production increase with increasing age of boll, and the preoviposition period decreases. Stored cotton seed may be less suitable for egg-production than freshly harvested seed cotton. Extraction of oil from cotton seed with petroleum ether does not wholly impair the fecundity rate of females fed on the seed, but may reduce the fertility and nymphal survival in the first instar. A diet of cotton seed, heat treated at 150–190°C. for one hour, reduces the fecundity in the females, possibly by destroying the accessary food factors. Nymphal survival is possible on such treated seed, but not when thus heated for two hours at or above 150°C. © 1960, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - No seasonal sex-ratio shift despite sex-specific fitness returns of hatching date in a lizard with genotypic sex determination
VL  - 60
IS  - 10
SP  - 2131-2136
AB  - Sex allocation theory predicts that mothers should adjust their sex-specific reproductive investment in relation to the predicted fitness returns from sons versus daughters. Sex allocation theory has proved to be successful in some invertebrate taxa but data on vertebrates often fail to show the predicted shift in sex ratio or sex-specific resource investment. This is likely to be partly explained by simplistic assumptions of vertebrate life-history and mechanistic constraints, but also because the fundamental assumption of sex-specific fitness return on investment is rarely supported by empirical data. In short-lived species, the time of hatching or parturition can have a strong impact on the age and size at maturity. Thus, if selection favors adult sexual-size dimorphism, females can maximize their fitness by adjusting offspring sex over the reproductive season. We show that in mallee dragons, Ctenophorus fordi, date of hatching is positively related to female reproductive output but has little, if any, effect on male reproductive success, suggesting selection for a seasonal shift in offspring sex ratio. We used a combination of field and laboratory data collected over two years to test if female dragons adjust their sex allocation over the season to ensure an adaptive match between time of hatching and offspring sex. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effect of laying date on sex ratio, nor did we find any evidence for within-female between-clutch sex-ratio adjustment. Furthermore, there was no differential resource investment into male and female offspring within or between clutches and sex ratios did not correlate with female condition or any partner traits. Consequently, despite evidence for selection for a seasonal sex-ratio shift, female mallee dragons do not seem to exercise any control over sex determination. The results are discussed in relation to potential constraints on sex-ratio adjustment, alternative selection pressures, and the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Variation, selection and heritability of thermal reaction norms for juvenile growth in Orchesella cincta (Collembola : Entomobryidae)
VL  - 104
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-46
AB  - Genetic variation for thermal plasticity plays an important role in the success or failure of a species with respect to the colonization of different thermal habitats and the ability to deal with climatic change. The aim of this paper is to study the relative contribution of the additive and non-additive components of genetic variation for the slope of the temperature reaction norm for juvenile growth rate in the springtail Orchesella cincta. We present the outcome of an artificial selection experiment for steep and flat temperature reaction norms and the results of a parent-offspring heritability experiment. There was a considerable phenotypic variation for the slope of the reaction norm. The selection experiment and the offspring to parent regression analysis, however, yielded no evidence for significant additive genetic variance. There were also no indications for maternal effects. The full-sib analysis, on the other hand, revealed a significant broad sense heritability of 0.76. An unforeseen result was that the slopes of females were steeper than those of males. This influenced the broad sense heritability of the full-sib analysis, since accidental female or male biased broods inflate the estimate of heritability. A randomization test showed that the probability level of the observed "between group" variance on the basis of the sexual differences alone was less than 10(-5). From this we conclude that autosomal genetic variation played its own separate role. In conclusion, the thermal reaction norm for growth in juvenile O. cincta is not very much determined by the additive effects of a large number of independent genes, but more likely based on a still unknown but mainly non-additive, partially sex-related genetic mechanism, possibly including both dominance and epistatic effects. Hypotheses about the role of phenotypic plasticity in processes of local adaptation and speciation should thus be alert to such a complex genetic architecture.

AB  - During 1989 ovigerous females of Calanus finmarchicus were sampled in fjord areas near Tromso, northern Norway, at seawater temperatures of 4-5-degrees-C. The offspring were cultivated at 1.5-2-degrees-C to naupliar stage III-VI, and then separated into three different temperature regimes almost-equal-to 40 days after hatching. A significant difference in abundance and stage composition in the three different experimental series evolved within 6 days after differentiation in temperatures, and greater similarities were found for those series which experienced a temperature increase. The stage composition of C. finmarchicus in the three different series was equal at the start of the experiments with the dominance of nauplius stage IV (NIV). In one series, with a constant temperature increase of 0.2-degrees-C day-1, the populations gradually changed into copepodites and a small proportion appeared as copepodite stage IV (CIV) in the period 18-24 days after incubation. At a lower rate of temperature increase (i.e., 0.1-degrees-C day-1) CIV did not appear in the populations, and only three copepodite stage II (CII) and one copepodite stage III (CIII) were found at the end of the experiment. In a third series at a constant temperature of 2-degrees-C population abundance decreased constantly throughout the experimental period, and only a low proportion of the population appeared as copepodite stage I (CI) at Day 18. A tendency for arrested development was observed since CI was not present in the populations at Day 24. The present experiments demonstrate that C. finmarchicus is dependent on a certain temperature increase for successful stage development at low temperatures. However, the results differ from earlier experiments conducted in 1980 on the same species from the same region, since the naupliar developmental rates at 2-degrees-C obtained in 1980 were definitely higher than those obtained in 1989. The overwintering temperature, which female C. finmarchicus experienced, differed markedly between 1980 and 1989. This indicates that different overwintering temperatures experienced by adults could shift the low temperature tolerance of the offspring. The formulated hypothesis for ontogenetic differences in the physiological response to temperature in C. finmarchicus (Tande, 1988) must also be considered in relation to the possibility that the maternal acclimation to the overwintering temperature could modify the rate-temperature response in the offspring later in the spring. This means that caution should be applied when adopting the commonly used empirical temperature functions for estimating stage durations of copepods in high-latitude environments until the possible effect of acclimation has been ruled out in quantitative terms.

AB  - Proceedings include 55 papers dealing with the physiological and genetic adaptations of animals to thermal stresses and the effects of thermal effluents upon the diversity and stability of natural aquatic systems and communities. These studies were prompted by the need for more detailed analysis of the impact of vast quantities of heated water released by both fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants on natural ecosystems. The papers presented describe the effects of thermal effluents on the physicochemistry, physiology, thermal tolerance and adaptation, population growth, individual and community behavior, productivity, and diversity of a broad spectrum of aquatic organisms and marine plant life.

VL  - 74

AB  - We modify and apply a nonlethal technique for rapidly quantifying the cold tolerance of large numbers of Drosophila and other small insects. Flies are transferred to individual vials, cooled in groups in progressive 0.5 degreesC steps, and checked for loss of righting response (chill-coma temperature [T-cc]). Flies recover quickly when transferred to ambient temperature, and thus this technique potentially can be used in selection experiments. We applied this technique in several experiments. First, we examined the sensitivity of T-cc to developmental temperature. Drosophila melanogaster (Congo, France), Drosophila subobscura (Spain, Denmark), and Drosophila ananassae (India) were reared from egg to adult at 15 degrees, 18 degrees, 25 degrees, or 29 degreesC, transferred to 15 degreesC for several days, and then progressively chilled: T-cc was positively related to developmental temperature, inversely related to latitude of the population, but independent of sex. The sensitivity of T-cc to developmental temperature (acclimation flexibility) was marked: T-cc shifted on average 1 degrees for each 4 degreesC shift in developmental temperature. Among 15 species of the obscura group of Drosophila, T-cc varied from -0.1 degrees to 4.5 degreesC; T-cc was inversely related to latitude in both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetically based ANCOVA (standardized independent contrasts) and was unrelated to body size.

VL  - 67
IS  - 10
SP  - 2557-2568
AB  - Females nest in dense aggregations, the offspring emerging in great numbers the following year. Large males search and dig for females about to emerge from the ground. Mating success here is correlated with body size, primarily because larger males are better able to carry the female in flight away from the emergence area and avoid further harassment. The largest males, representing c25% of the population, obtained >90% of matings initiated in the emergence area; males below average size were never successful there. Because some females leave the area without mating, a pool of virgins is available to small males, who patrol just outside the emergence area and intercept passing females. Males below average size (and all females) are black with pale white bands on the abdomen. In males above mean size, the proportion of yellow pigmentation on the dorsal and lateral surfaces increases with body size. Males undertaking alternative tactics experience differing thermal environments. Yellow colouration was correlated with higher cuticular reflectance. Yellow pigmentation apparently acts as a thermoregulatory mechanism allowing larger males to increase their tolerance of the high temperatures and solar radiation loads in the emergence area. The mating tactics represent condition-dependent behavioural tactics, with flexibility maintained by sexual selection, and the colour patterns represent condition-dependent morphological tactics, with the developmental response favoured by selection for thermoregulatory ability. -from Authors

SP  - 223-244
AB  - The relationship between temperature-specific (11.3-27.1°C) rates of yolk utilization and temperature preference of California grunion, Leuresthes tenuis (Ayres), have been compared. Yolk-sac larvae experienced difficulty metabolizing protein at and above 25°C, and below 15°C they encountered problems with fat metabolism. These temperatures limited the range for normal embryonic development. The oil globule persisted longer than the yolk and may provide buoyancy to the anterior end as well as energy. Thermoregulatory precision increased with number of days post-hatching. Yolk-sac larvae preferred ≈ 25°C; this temperature minimized duration of the yolk-sac stage but was outside the range for maximum growth efficiency (18-23°C). Following yolk resorption, non-feeding larvae preferred 18°C, which conserved energy but still maximized growth efficiency. Until at least 69 days post-hatching, larvae past the yolk-sac stage selected temperatures that maximized growth efficiency. Physiological and behavioural results indicate that larvae selected cooler temperatures when not feeding. This has been discussed and related to an apparent general adaptive behaviour to maximize bioenergetic efficiency. © 1982.

TI  - Thermal biology of reproduction in viviparous skinks, Eulamprus tympanum: why do gravid females bask more?
VL  - 88
IS  - 4
SP  - 562-569
AB  - In some reptiles, gravid females bask more, and/or maintain higher body temperatures than do males or non-gravid females. This phenomenon is usually explained in terms of the female or her offspring benefitting from accelerated embryogenesis and early birth, but the effect of increased basking on gestation period has not been studied. In a laboratory experiment, gestation periods of gravid female skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) decreased with the duration of access to radiant heat. Embryonic development was more rapid in the laboratory than in the field, and there were no apparent adverse effects of this accelerated gestation on females or offspring. Number and mass of offspring, survival rates of embryos, relative clutch mass and female mass before and after parturition were not influenced by the decrease in gestation period caused by increased basking. Females selected similar temperatures in the laboratory and field (32° C), despite the availability of higher temperatures in the laboratory. Thus, gestation in the laboratory was accelerated by spending longer periods at usual basking temperatures, rather than by selecting higher temperatures. In the field, mean and modal body temperatures of active animals were similar in gravid females, males and non-gravid females, but gravid females appear to bask more of the time, even in cloudy weather when other members of the population do not bask. Hence, an apparent similarity in thermal regimes of gravid and non-gravid animals may mask significant underlying differences in thermoregulatory strategies. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 56

AB  - High μ (HIMU) islands such as St. Helena in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and Tubuaii and Mangaia in the Australes (Polynesia), are known for having mantle sources relatively enriched in some high field-strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb, and, as deduced from their extremely enriched lead isotopic compositions, long-lived high U Pb (μ) ratios. A second group of HIMU mantle reservoirs is well identified in the Pacific Ocean, at Ua Pou (Marquesas), Mururoa and Fangataufa (Gambiers), Guadalupe; and in the Atlantic Ocean, in the New England seamounts, Azores, Cape Verde, and Canarias. In contrast to Group I, these exhibit a much less pronounced enrichment in radiogenic lead due to only a recent increase in the μ ratio, whereas HFSE enrichment and lead depletion (as visible from high Ce Pb ratios) are more pronounced than in Group I. If the HIMU reservoir is related to recycling of subducted lithosphere impoverished by dehydration in some elements enriched in arc magmas, the evolution of the thermal régime in subduction zones makes the HIMU reservoir progressively more abundant with time. During the early to middle Precambrian, a large part of the subducted lithosphere was melted; hence the residue recycled in the mantle was not sufficiently fertile to allow further basaltic melt extraction. In contrast, in modern, cooler subduction zones, dehydration and the subsequent extraction by fluids of mobile elements leaves behind a fertile residue. © 1992.

TI  - Temperature‐dependent sex determination in Alligator mississippiensis
VL  - 200
IS  - 2
SP  - 143-177
AB  - The structure of the reproductive systems of hatchling and 1 ‐year‐old alligators was investigated macroscopically and histologically. Sex is fully determined at the time of hatching and irreversible thereafter. Constant temperature laboratory experiments revealed that the sex of Alligator miuissippiensis is determined by the temperature of egg incubation, 30°C or below producing females, and 34°C or above, males. Experiments in which eggs were shifted from female‐producing temperatures to male‐producing temperatures and vice versa at weekly intervals during incubation demonstrated that the temperature‐sensitive period for sex determination is around 20 and 35 days after egg laying. In the wild, temperature probes were placed in alligator nests constructed in three different habitats: wet marsh, dry marsh and levee (elevated firm ground). The position of the eggs in the nests were mapped at 60 days incubation and the sex of the enclosed hatchlings correlated with the nest temperatures at that site. Levee nests were hot (34°C) and hatched approximately 100% males. Wet marsh nests were cool (30°C) and hatched approximately 100% females. Dry marsh nests had an intermediate temperature profile, the hottest location (34°C) being the top centre of the nest. Males developed from eggs in this location and females from eggs around the periphery and base of the nest. The sex ratio in dry marsh nests was five females to one male. The natural sex ratio at hatching was determined for a large area of representative habitat for four consecutive years and averaged five (±0.7) females to one male. Females hatched from eggs incubated at 30°C weighed more than males hatched from eggs incubated at 34°C because the former contained more absorbed abdominal yolk. These extra energy reserves enable females to grow faster and become larger than males in the early years of life. This means that heavy females become sexually mature ahead of either light females or light males, and because of the reproductive lifestyle of alligators, this early maturity constitutes a selective biological advantage for the evolution of temperature‐dependent sex determination in Alligator mississippiensis. The occurrence of temperature‐dependent sex determination in alligators has wide‐ranging implications for embryological, teratological, molecular, phylogenetic, conservation and farming studies.

VL  - 102

SP  - 195-200
AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the small and random departures from perfect symmetry of an organism's bilateral traits, has been used as a measurement of developmental stability and an indicator of stress in endangered populations. We were interested in testing if the level of developmental stability is the same in different populations experiencing the same conditions, as the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress is only meaningful if this is true. In order to do this, the effect of thermal stress on wing size FA over a range of temperatures was determined on three different lines of Drosophila melanogaster: two lines were maintained at one of two different constant temperatures (18 degrees C or 28 degrees C) and one under a fluctuating thermal regime (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C) for eight years. The differences in viability of these lines, when reared at a range of different temperatures, are associated with the temperature conditions they previously experienced. All lines showed a similar increase in FA at the two ends of the thermal range but with significantly different mean values. The two units of wing development (compartments) differed in their FA response depending on the selective history of each line. We discuss the implication of our results for the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress.

AB  - Eight artificial ponds were maintained, 4 at each of 2 environmental treatment: constant water level, to simulate fish- free permanent breeding ponds, and gradual drying out, to simulate temporary breeding ponds. The quality of the growth environment for larvae, as measured by body size and survivorship, was the same in the 4 experimental treatments. Frequency of metamorphosis was significantly higher in the drying treatment than under constant water level, and also differed between populations. Frequency of paedomorphosis was significantly different between populations but not between water level treatments. Effects of water level were potentially confounded by those of water temperature, density of larvae, and amount of food. Population differences in the frequency of metamorphosis and paedomorphosis could potentially represent genetic differences resulting from the different selective regimes that individuals encounter in breeding ponds varying in drying frequency, though phenotypic plasticity and non-genetic maternal effects cannot be dismissed without futher experimentation.-from Authors

VL  - 62
IS  - 4
SP  - 833-843
AB  - Life history theory predicts that fishing may select for increased reproductive investment. A model of the reaction norm for reproductive investment in a capital breeder was developed to disentangle changes in reproductive investment from changes in growth rate in North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Trends in reproductive investment since 1960 were estimated as (i) the decrease in body weight of mature males and females between the start and end of the spawning period, (ii) the difference in weight of ripe and spent females, and (iii) the ovary weight of prespawning females. These estimates were related to somatic growth estimated by back-calculation of otoliths and temperature. The ovary weight and weight loss of females that had just started and just finished spawning did not reveal any trends. There was a significant increase in weight loss over the spawning season in both sexes, but much of this increase was likely due to changes in environmental conditions. Evidence for a fisheries-induced change in reproductive investment from our analyses thus remained inconclusive. However, fecundity and ovary-weight data from previous studies tentatively suggest that an increase in reproductive investment occurred between the late 1940s and the 1960s. Such an increase is consistent with a fisheries-induced evolutionary change. © 2005 NRC.

VL  - 60
IS  - 1
SP  - 142-156
AB  - Variation in fitness generated by differences in functional performance can often be traced to morphological variation among individuals within natural populations. However, morphological variation itself is strongly influenced by environmental factors (e.g., temperature) and maternal effects (e.g., variation in egg size). Understanding the full ecological context of individual variation and natural selection therefore requires an integrated view of how the interaction between the environment and development structures differences in morphology, performance, and fitness. Here we use naturally occurring environmental and maternal variation in the frog Bombina orientalis in South Korea to show that ovum size, average temperature, and variance in temperature during the early developmental period affect body sizes, shapes, locomotor performance, and ultimately the probability of an individual surviving interspecific predation in predictable but nonadditive ways. Specifically, environmental variability can significantly change the relationship between maternal investment in offspring and offspring fitness so that increased maternal investment can actually negatively affect offspring over a broad range of environments. Integrating environmental variation and developmental processes into traditional approaches of studying phenotypic variation and natural selection is likely to provide a more complete picture of the ecological context of evolutionary change. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - A study was made of the effect of thermal selection of parental spermatozoa on the heat resistance of the whole organism and of muscles in progeny of Rana temporaria, as well as of the organismal resistance to pesticides (0.0025 M chlorophos). The thermal selection of spermatozoa was performed by exposing their suspension to 36 degrees C for 30-40 minutes. With tadpoles, the resistance of muscles to 38 degrees C, was determined, in addition to the resistance of the organism to 34 degrees and to 0.0025 M chlorophos. The results of selection were stage--specific: at stages of growth (stages 39, 42, 50) the heat resistance of the organism was lower and that of muscles was higher than in controls. At the stage of metamorphosis proper (stage 52) the heat resistance of both the organism and muscles increased. The thermal selection of parental spermatozoa exerted no effect on the resistance of the progeny to 0.0025 M chlorophos.

TI  - Keeping up with a warming world; assessing the rate of adaptation to climate change
VL  - 275
IS  - 1635
SP  - 649-659
AB  - The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity.The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod.Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions.Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient. © 2008 The Royal Society.

TI  - Real-time phase-contrast x-ray imaging: A new technique for the study of animal form and function
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Despite advances in imaging techniques, real-time visualization of the structure and dynamics of tissues and organs inside small living animals has remained elusive. Recently, we have been using synchrotron x-rays to visualize the internal anatomy of millimeter-sized opaque, living animals. This technique takes advantage of partially-coherent x-rays and diffraction to enable clear visualization of internal soft tissue not viewable via conventional absorption radiography. However, because higher quality images require greater x-ray fluxes, there exists an inherent tradeoff between image quality and tissue damage. Results: We evaluated the tradeoff between image quality and harm to the animal by determining the impact of targeted synchrotron x-rays on insect physiology, behavior and survival. Using 25 keV x-rays at a flux density of 80 μW/mm-2, high quality video-rate images can be obtained without major detrimental effects on the insects for multiple minutes, a duration sufficient for many physiological studies. At this setting, insects do not heat up. Additionally, we demonstrate the range of uses of synchrotron phase-contrast imaging by showing high-resolution images of internal anatomy and observations of labeled food movement during ingestion and digestion. Conclusion: Synchrotron x-ray phase contrast imaging has the potential to revolutionize the study of physiology and internal biomechanics in small animals. This is the only generally applicable technique that has the necessary spatial and temporal resolutions, penetrating power, and sensitivity to soft tissue that is required to visualize the internal physiology of living animals on the scale from millimeters to microns. © 2007 Socha et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 55

AB  - Daphnia longispina showed life-history traits probably evolved in response to size-selective predation on larger prey individuals. D. pulex and D. magna had comparatively high rates of increase, which is of special importance in temporary rockpools. D. magna is presumably adapted to more eutrophic conditions than the other 2 species. In laboratory experiments, D. pulex was the best competitor. The outcome between D. magna and D. longispina depended on temperature and food conditions; the larger D. magna did better at the lower temperature and in the higher food density. Body size alone could not be used to predict the outcome of competition experiments. In field experiments lasting 2 summers, competitive exclusion did not occur. This study supports the view that closely related species are often unable to exclude each other, even though competition may be intense. Local distribution patterns of rockpool Daphnia probably depend more on species-specific responses to abiotic factors, food density and predation, rather than on colonization, extinction and competitive exclusion.-from Author Daphnia longispina Daphnia magna Daphnia pulex

VL  - 24

AB  - By means of directional elimination of the parental gametes in frogs, the effects of two basic forms (i.e. normalizing and canalizing ones) of natural selection on the heat resistance level of muscle fibers in the progeny have been reproduced. Experimental evidence is presented that both male and female gametes account for hereditary transformation of cellular heat resistance as a quantitative physiological parameter. Polymodal pattern of regulation of this parameter is suggested which includes indispensable participation of both thermal and non-thermal factors of selection. The environmental temperature, as a selective factor, accounts for the formation of cellular heat resistance directly, whereas non-thermal factors exert their control on this parameter indirectly, associatively. It is suggested that the polymodal pattern of regulation of physiological functions presents the main mode of realization of canalizing form of natural selection.

VL  - 169

SP  - 175-183
AB  - Heat hardening increases thermal resistance to more extreme temperatures in the laboratory. However, heat hardening also has negative consequences, and the net benefit of hardening has not been evaluated in the field. We tested short-term heat hardening effects on the likelihood of Drosophila melanogaster to be caught at different temperatures at baits in field sites without natural resources. We predicted that hardened flies should be more frequently caught at the baits at high but not low temperatures. Under cool conditions, flies hardened at 36°C, and to a lesser extent at 34°C, were less frequently caught at baits than nonhardened flies a few hours after release, indicating a negative effect of hardening. In later captures, negative effects tended to disappear, particularly in males. Under warm conditions, there was an overall balance of negative and positive effects, though with a different temporal resolution. Under very hot conditions, when capture rates were low, there was a large benefit of hardening at 36°C and 34°C but not 33°C. Finally, based on climatic records, the overall benefit of hardening in D. melanogaster is discussed as an evolved response to high temperatures occasionally experienced by organisms at some locations. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Thermal exposure of juvenile fall chinook salmon migrating through a lower Snake River Reservoir
VL  - 77
IS  - 2
SP  - 100-109
AB  - Impoundment of the Snake River, Washington, has resulted in high water temperatures and late seaward migration of juvenile fall chinook salmon during summer months. To determine if juvenile fall chinook salmon are exposed to temperatures higher than the upper incipient lethal, we tagged groups of fish with temperature-sensing radio tags and tracked them in Little Goose Reservoir on the Snake River during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Spatial and temporal patterns of the reservoir's thermal environment were described using a bathythermograph. Little Goose Reservoir was generally homothermic, and temperatures selected by fish were typically not significantly different from mean water temperatures. No areas of thermal refugia existed in Little Goose Reservoir. Thermal exposure was most influenced by fish residence time in the reservoir within each year and by temperature differences between years. Current augmentation of Snake River summer flows with cold-water releases from Dworshak Dam in Idaho reduces the thermal exposure of juvenile fall chinook salmon by lowering water temperatures up to 4degreesC and may therefore increase their survival. Continued flow augmentation using water from Dworshak Reservoir may be the only mechanism to meet the temperature standard for the lower Snake River.

AB  - Chronic mortarities up to 0.2-0.3 % a day occurred in Osaka, Aichi and Nara Prefectures from 1980 to 1981 at some farms of tilapia, Sarotherodon niloticus. Two types of clinical features were observed among the diseased fish. One was characterized by fine white nodules in the spleen and abscesses in the swimming bladder. The other was characterized by hemorrhagic lesions in the gonad, especially ovary. Pseudomonas fluorescens and Edwardsiella tarda were associated with the respective types. These bacteria were proved to kill tilapia by intramuscular injection and to cause essentially the same features as those naturally infected. Ps. fluorescens infection occurred mainly in winter and spring while E. tarda infection took place at warmer seasons. These epizootiological phenomena were supported by experimental infections performed at selected water temperatures. The mortalities of tilapia due to Ps. fluorescens and E. tarda became highest at 15-20°C and at 20-30°C, respectively. © 1984, The Japanese Society of Fish Pathology. All rights reserved.

VL  - 26

AB  - The dynamics of organic matter (OM) in prairie soils play an important role in long-term soil productivity and in the global carbon cycle. Temporal fluctuations in OM occur primarily in the readily-decomposable, labile fractions. We analyzed soils from a long-term study on a Brown Chernozem (Aridic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan to determine the effect of cropping practices on OM content and composition under arid conditions. Soils (0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers) from various rotations of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), winter wheat, flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) and fallow were analyzed for organic C, total N and selected indicators of labile OM [light fraction(LF)-C, LF-N, mineralizable-C, mineralizable-N, microbial biomass(MB)-C and MB-N]. The indicators of labile OM were all more sensitive than total OM to agronomic variables. Treatment effects on air characteristics were usually similar in the 0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm layers, but effects in the surface layer were often more highly significant. Frequency of fallow in the rotation was the dominant factor influencing labile OM. For example, LF-C in the 0-7.5 cm layer of well-fertilized continuously-cropped spring wheat, bare fallow-wheat-wheat and bare fallow-wheat was 3.15, 1.55 and 1.17 mg C kg(-1) soil, respectively. The corresponding values for CO2-C mineralized at 21 degrees C in 30 days were 371, 184 and 158 mg C kg(-1) soil and those for cumulative net N mineralized in 16 weeks at 35 degrees C were 126, 96 and 80 mg N kg(-1) soil. MB-C and MB-N exhibited similar trends (e.g. MB-C was 368, 256 and 257 mg C kg(-1) soil for the three treatments, respectively). Application of N fertilizer and substitution of winter wheat (with chemical fallow) for spring wheat (with tilled bare fallow) tended to increase labile OM, while substitution of flax or lentil for spring wheat had little effect or reduced labile OM. Differences in labile OM appeared to be related, not only to residue inputs, but also to moisture and temperature conditions. Our findings suggest that it may be possible to manipulate the timing of residue inputs and moisture through cropping practices and thereby maintain adequate labile OM concentrations and improve the synchrony of mineralization with crop requirements. Our results also imply that LF and mineralizable fractions may be useful as early indicators of OM change.

AB  - The cohesive zone in the blast furnace, where ferrous burden materials soften and melt, greatly affects the furnace's performance. Minimizing the width of the cohesive zone will improve productivity and decrease the coke rate. This work was designed to better understand the softening and melting phenomena of ferrous feed materials. The pellets were reduced to wustite, 60% or 80% reduction degree. Different experimental techniques were used to allow the observation of different stages of softening and melting. For X-ray observation, they were placed in a graphite crucible and heated under N2 gas flow, while recording the temperature and the contraction of the pellets. In the interrupted experiments, a specially designed apparatus was used allowing interruptions, at selected temperatures for microstructural observation. The melt onset experiments allowed the observation of the appearance of liquid, and by cooling from select temperatures allowed the analysis of the evolution of the microstructure. These experiments showed that the dripping of liquid from the pellets occurred at different conditions depending on the reduction degrees, in addition, the melt onset occurred before softening. Furthermore, this early liquid acts as a trigger to the microstructural transformations surrounding softening. These techniques were successful in separating the variables involved in blast furnace metallic burden softening and melting.

AB  - A group of isolated populations of the natterjack toad, Bufo calamita Laur., occur on small and rocky islands in the outer archipelago at the Swedish west coast. Breeding pool characteristics were studied in one of these populations. Egg strings were deposited in 31 of 95 possible rock pools from mid May to mid August. Significant correlations were found between breeding and 1) pool size, 2) pool water depth, 3) shore line inclination, 4) height of pool above sea level, and 5) distance to nearest sea shore line. The breeding pool selected may be a compromise between highest possible water temperature and the risk that a shallow pool dries up before metamorphoses. © 1985, Brill. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does habitat fragmentation affect temperature-related life-history traits? A laboratory test with a woodland butterfly
VL  - 272
IS  - 1569
SP  - 1257-1263
AB  - Habitat fragmentation may change local climatic conditions leading to altered selection regimes for life-history traits in small ectotherms, including several insects. We investigated temperature-related performance in terms of fitness among populations of the woodland butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.) originating from populations of a closed, continuous woodland landscape versus populations of an open, highly fragmented agricultural landscape in central Belgium. Female fecundity and longevity were evaluated in a temperature-gradient experiment. As predicted, females of woodland landscape origin reached higher maximum daily fecundity and lifetime number of eggs than did agricultural landscape females at low ambient temperatures, but this reversed at high ambient temperature. Egg weight decreased with temperature, and eggs of woodland butterflies were smaller. Contrary to what is generally assumed, remaining thorax mass was a better predictor of lifetime reproductive output than was abdomen mass. Since we used the F2 generation from wild-caught females reared under common garden conditions, the observed effects are likely to rely on intrinsic, heritable variation. Our results suggest that differential selection regimes associated with different landscapes intervene by intraspecific variation in the response of a butterfly to variation in ambient temperature, and may thus be helpful when making predictions of future impacts on how wild populations respond to environmental conditions under a global change scenario, with increasing temperatures and fragmented landscapes. © 2005 The Royal Society.

VL  - 85

SP  - 621-637
AB  - Normal and irregular blunt clam-shells were found. Blunt shells increased with depth, because of increasing anoxia. Minimal weight-indices and reproductive stages were found at 40 m depth (near thermo-haline stratification) probably due to spawning just before sampling. Clams from shallower stations were more ripe and heavier due to higher temperatures and re-development than at deeper stations since temperatures were still below threshold levels for spawning (10 degreesC). Respiration was at ambient temperatures acclimated to standard rates. Consequently, clams from deeper stations (with lower ambient temperatures) had 2 times higher respiration at the same test-temperature. Clams from the most shallow station (Puck Lagoon 5 m) showed the worst performance due to adverse hydrodynamics (stagnated water, anoxia). Heterozygotes showed better performance than homozygotes (heterosis). In 1995 genetic differentiation was found (Idh was diagnostic): clams below 30 m resembled Atlantic populations; shallow stations formed a distinct group (Baltic race). In later years all populations were Atlantic, probably due to inflow of North Sea water. Before 1996 ecophysiological differences between clams in the Gdansk Bay can possibly be related to genetic differentiation (adaptations of Atlantic vs. Baltic types), in later years differences were due to acclimation to ambient temperatures, salinity and oxygen levels.

AB  - Nodulation was studied in 161 legumes (9 Caesalpinioideae, 19 Mimosoideae and 133 Papilionoideae) native in Pakistani rangelands. This consisted of two tribes of Caesalpinioideae, three tribes of Mimosoideae and 16 tribes of Papilionoideae. Legume species in Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae were all nodulated to various degrees. However, all the 9 legume species in Caesalpinioideae (tribe Caesalpinieae and Cassieae) appeared non-nodulated after repeated investigation in the field. Nodulation of a wide range of legume species in Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae indicates a widespread distribution of compatible rhizobia across the Pakistani rangelands. Nodules were observed even under adverse rangeland conditions which included extreme temperatures, salinity, drought, waterlogged, marginal and eroded soils with low fertility. The legume distribution brings out the importance of this family in the rangelands in terms of abundance of leguminous herbs, shrubs and trees. Nodulation study of these legumes will stimulate their utilization in soil fertility improvement programs, up grading rangeland soils and reforestation of derelict sites. Further research on nodulation status, nitrogen fixation capacity, physiological adaptations and genetic diversity of these legumes will provide fundamental knowledge for their conservation and utilization in different agro-climatic and physiographical regions.

TI  - Temperature effects on different organization levels in animals
VL  - 41
SP  - 429-449
AB  - One of the central concepts in present biology is the recognition of different organization levels and their hierarchical array. Complex multicellular animals are constituted of organ systems, the organs of cells, the cells of organelles, membranes, and molecules. The primary effects of many environmental factors (e.g. light, concentrations of ions and molecules) can be delimited mainly to one level. Temperature, being the macroscopic physical measure of the random motion of smallest material particles, affects directly the animal life at all organization levels. The special physical nature of temperature means also, that during the history of life, organisms have always been subjected to temperature variations. Many different ways to evade the pervasive effects of temperature have been evolved during the course of evolution. The study of the temperature relations of organisms can therefore give models for other branches of environmental biology. The temperature limits and relations of an animal cannot be explained by the temperature relations and limits of its cells without taking into account such interactions between different types of cells, which are found only through the study of the organs. Also, the temperature limits and relations of animal cells cannot be explained just through the study of the constituent molecules. The possible interactions of the molecules (e.g. lipids and proteins in a cell membrane) are so manifold and complex that in order to ascertain the relative importance of them in the temperature relations of the cells we must rely in part on studies done on organelles (e.g. on the plasma membrane). The study of the thermal biology of animal cells thus exemplifies the situation often found in biology: the attainment of a reductive explanation is not always a one-way deduction, but it may involve modifications of the lower level concepts according to the knowledge derivable only from studies of the higher level systems.

VL  - 57

SP  - 605-613
AB  - The evolution of "fertile" mantle has been studied by proton microprobe (PIXE) analysis of minerals of a high-temperature sheared xenolith from the Thaba Putsoa kimberlite in Lesotho, southern Africa. Analyzed elements include Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Sr, Y, and Zr. Garnets are homogeneous in Ni and Zn but have rims enriched relative to cores in Zr and Y. Compositions of olivine neoblasts define intergranular gradients of Fe, Zn, and Ni; Fe-rich olivine is relatively Zn-rich but Ni-poor. Although individual clinopyroxene grains are nearly homogeneous, clinopyroxene associated with Fe-rich olivine is relatively Fe- and Zn-rich but Sr- and Cr-poor. The trace-element abundances and compositional gradients constrain the processes of peridotite enrichment and the thermal history. Enrichment of Zr, Y, and Fe in garnet rims documents infiltration of a silica-undersaturated melt. The Fe-rich olivine compositions and the Zn and Fe gradients establish that the xenolith was sampled from near a melt conduit. Mechanical mixing of inhomogeneous peridotite and melt infiltration may have been concurrent. Because garnets appear homogeneous in Ni, mantle temperature changes affecting PHN 1611 occurred before or over a longer period than the melt infiltration. Measured and calculated abundances of many incompatible trace elements in the rock are similar to those proposed for primitive mantle. Calculated chondrite-normalized abundances of Sr, Ti, Zr, and Y are like those of appropriate REE. Enrichment processes in PHN 1611 proceeded at unusually high recorded temperature and in the apparent absence of minor phases common in lower-temperature metasomatized rocks, but similar processes may be common. In particular, mechanical mixing near mantle dikes may frequently occur. These enrichment mechanisms may produce xenolith compositions that resemble some proposed for primitive mantle but that have different implications for mantle evolution. © 1993.

VL  - 173

SP  - 239-246
AB  - Temperature selection in tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) is strongly influenced by hydration state and this response varies between two distinct neighbouring populations on semi-arid Carnac Island and mainland wetland (Herdsman Lake). Fed and hydrated (control) Carnac Island snakes selected a preferred body temperature of 26.2 +/- 1.2 degreesC and an average maximum temperature of 32.5 +/- 0.5 degreesC in a photo-thermal gradient. Dehydrated Carnac Island snakes selected a significantly lower preferred body temperature (19.7 +/- 1.6 degreesC) and average maximum temperature (27.7 +/- 1.0 degreesC). Control Herdsman Lake snakes selected a preferred body temperature of 27.5 +/- 10.6 degreesC and an average maximum temperature of 33.3 +/- 0.4 degreesC. Dehydrated Herdsman Lake snakes selected a significantly lower preferred body temperature (23.3 +/- 1.1degreesC) and a lower average maximum temperature (31.8 +/- 0.6 degreesC). Thermal depression (decreased preferred body and average maximum temperatures) in response to dehydration was greater for Carnac Island than Herdsman Lake snakes. As decreases in temperature and activity can reduce water loss, our laboratory data suggest that the survival of the relict population of tiger snakes on Carnac Island is associated with thermoregulatory modifications, which may have the effect of enhancing water conservation in this waterless habitat.

VL  - 129
IS  - 2
SP  - 335-341
AB  - Cold sensitivity of entomopathogenic nematodes severely restricts their biological control potential in some environments. We selected the SN strain of Steinernema feltiae together with its bacterial symbiont, Xenorhabdus bovenii, for improved cold tolerance by repeated passage through the wax moth Galleria mellonella larvae at 15 degrees C. Nematode virulence (total insect mortality and speed of kill) and establishment (initiation of nematode development following penetration) were evaluated after six (=12-24 generations) and 12 passages (=24-36 generations). Cold selection enhanced nematode virulence at the cooler temperatures. Virulence measured as total insect-mortality at 8 degrees C improved by 5.3- and 6.6-fold after six and 12 passages, respectively. Only small improvements (1.2-1.5-fold) were observed in speed of kill. Nematode establishment improved at all temperatures after 12 passages; the highest increase of 9-fold was observed at 8 degrees C. Our results lend support to the hypotheses that functional traits along a continuously distributed environmental variable are genetically correlated and that the area under the fitness function is not always constant. Trade-offs in percentage mortality and speed of kill by the selected nematodes were observed at the warmer extreme after six passages of selection only. The implications of rapid changes in thermal sensitivity for economic mass-production of nematodes are discussed.

TI  - Heat induced male sterility in Drosophila melanogaster: Adaptive genetic variations among geographic populations and role of the Y chromosome
VL  - 207
IS  - 16
SP  - 2735-2743
AB  - We analyzed genetic variation among geographically diverse populations of Drosophila and showed that tropical flies are more tolerant than temperate ones to heat-induced male sterility, as assessed by the presence of both motile sperm and progeny production. In tropical populations, the temperature inducing 50% sterility (median threshold) is 1 C above the value for temperate populations (30.4 vs. 29.4degreesC). When transferred to a mild permissive temperature (21 C), males recover fertility. Recovery time is proportional to pre-adult culture temperature. At these temperatures, recovery time is greater for temperate than for tropical populations. Crosses between a temperate and a tropical strain (F-1, F-2 and successive backcrosses) revealed that the Y chromosome was responsible for much of the geographic variation. Sterile males exhibited diverse abnormalities in the shape and position of sperm nuclei. However, impairment of the spermatid elongation seems to be the major factor responsible for sperm inviability. Heat-induced male sterility seems to be quite a general phenomenon in Drosophilid species and variation of threshold temperatures may be important for explaining their geographic distributions.

TI  - The phosphorus status of eutrophic lake sediments as related to changes in limnological conditions - total, inorganic, and organic phosphorus
VL  - 3
IS  - 2
SP  - 133-138
AB  - As an initial phase in a program to evaluate the role of sediments in eutrophic processes, this study was undertaken to determine whether changes in the P status of sediments were related to changes in limnological conditions. Field measurements lack the singular control over critical parameters which is obtainable in the laboratory but were selected for this study because they serve to integrate the influence of complex interdependent parameters. The study was designed to (i) determine if detectable quantities of P were released from sediments by monitoring changes in the concentration of total sediment P, inorganic P, and organic P and (ii) correlate sediment P levels with limnological parameters which may have affected the release of P. To aid in the assessment of the role of sediments as a source of P to lake waters and to provide insights into the factors which may influence sediment P release, changes with time in the P status of noncalcareous sediments of a eutrophic lake were related to changes in sediment C and N, surface water composition, pH, temperature, and phytoplankton growth. The nature and extent of changes in sediment P status and the relationship of these changes to limnological conditions differed with location in the lake. Changes in sediment composition were greatest in a bay which received agricultural runoff in the early spring. This additional supply of nutrients apparently provided the initial impetus for increased surface water biological activity in the spring relative to other locations as reflected in increased surface water organic C and N, turbidity, and phytoplankton growth. At this location, total sediment P, C, and N decreased during the late spring and early summer. These changes corresponded to the period of exponential growth of the lake phytoplankton population. During the late summer and early fall when plankton growth entered the stationary and declination phases, sediment organic C, total N and P increased, evidently as a result of the deposition of detritus containing these elements. Changes in inorganic P accounted for most of the changes in total sediment P. Combining data from all sampling locations in the lake, sediment inorganic P was not correlated with changes in surface water temperature or pH, but was inversely correlated with surface water organic C. The results thus indicate that sediment inorganic P was directly related to the biological productivity of the surface waters, and in at least one location, sediments served as a significant source of P to these waters supporting increased biological growth.

AB  - The body sizes and shapes of poikilothermic animals generally show clinal variation with latitude. Among the environmental factors responsible for the cline, temperature seems to be the most probable candidate. In the present work we analysed natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected at different geographical localities to determine whether the same selective forces acting on wing development in the laboratory are also at work in the wild. We show that the temperature selection acting on wing development in the laboratory is only one of the selective forces operating in the wild. The size differences between natural populations seem to depend exclusively on cell number whereas they depend on cell area in the laboratory. The two wing compartments behave as distinct units of selection subjected to different genetic control, confirming our previous observations on laboratory populations. In addition, subunits of development defined as regions of cell proliferation centres restricted within longitudinal veins can, in turn, be considered as subunits of selection. Their interaction during development and continuous natural selection around an optimum could explain the high wing shape stability generally found in natural populations.

VL  - 31

SP  - 80-88
AB  - The thermoregulation behaviour of the adult codling moth, Cydia pomonella, is investigated in the laboratory using temperature gradient experiments. Unmated males and females are tested at dawn when moths typically move to resting sites. Mated females are tested during oviposition over a complete diurnal cycle. Temperature strongly affects microhabitat selection in adult moths. Unmated males and females prefer to rest at the low-temperature ends of temperature gradients between 15 and 32°C. Relative humidity does not influence the thermal response in unmated females, whereas males show a less distinct temperature selection under high humidity. By contrast to unmated moths, ovipositing females prove to be highly thermophilous (i.e. they deposit the highest proportions of their eggs in the zones of highest temperatures of gradients between 15 and 36°C). This striking discrepancy in thermal response of females between their premating and oviposition period is likely to reflect an adaptation to different selection pressures from the thermal environment. Unmated moths may benefit from low temperatures by a longer lifespan and crypsis within the tree canopy, whereas the choice of warmer oviposition sites by mated females will favour a faster development of eggs. © 2006 The Authors.

VL  - 16

SP  - 996-1005
AB  - Adaptive genetic differentiation along a climatic gradient as a response to natural selection is not necessarily expressed at phenotypic level if environmental effects on population mean phenotypes oppose the genotypic effects. This form of cryptic evolution - called countergradient variation - has seldom been explicitly demonstrated for terrestrial vertebrates. We investigated the patterns of phenotypic and genotypic differentiation in developmental rates of common frogs (Rana temporaria) along a ca. 1600 km latitudinal gradient across Scandinavia. Developmental rates in the field were not latitudinally ordered, but displayed large variation even among different ponds within a given latitudinal area. In contrast, development rates assessed in the laboratory increased strongly and linearly with increasing latitude, suggesting a genetic capacity for faster development in the northern than the southern larvae. Experiments further revealed that environmental effects (temperature and food) could easily override the genetic effects on developmental rates, providing a possible mechanistic explanation as to why the genetic differentiation was not seen in the samples collected from the wild. Our results suggest that the higher developmental rates of the northern larvae are likely to. be related to selection stemming from seasonal time constrains, rather than from selection dictated by low ambient temperatures per se. All in all, the results provide a demonstration of environmental effects concealing substantial latitudinally ordered genetic differentiation understandable in terms of adaptation to clinal variation in time constrains.

VL  - 191

SP  - 77-84
AB  - We explored two mutually nonexclusive hypotheses on autumnal leaf colouration. The co-evolutionary hypothesis states that autumnal leaf colouration functions as a handicap signal to herbivorous insects, whereas the photoprotection hypothesis posits that plant pigments primarily protect the plant against cold-induced photoinhibition and enhance nutrient transfer. To contrast both hypotheses, we compared yellow and red leaf colouration in three groups of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.). Two montane groups of different age were characterised by low aphid numbers and low temperature, and a lowland group by high aphid numbers and high temperature. There were no consistent altitudinal differences in leaf colouration. Compared to young trees, adult trees developed fewer red but more yellow leaves at high altitude. In the lowland population, the development of red leaf colour was related to decreasing daytime temperature, whereas the appearance of yellow leaf colouration corresponded to the decreasing photoperiod. This is consistent with the photoprotection hypothesis. Individual differences in red and yellow leaf colouration were inversely correlated to the number of fruits, which might be interpreted as a trade-off between reproductive and protective commitment. Temperature effects explained variation in aphid numbers over time and leaf colouration explained aphid distribution on a given day. As predicted by the co-evolutionary hypothesis, strongly coloured individuals harboured fewer aphids than green or dull-coloured ones. Since decreasing temperature reduced the number of migrating aphids but induced red leaf colouration, these processes are not mutually fine-tuned, which likely restricts the potential for co-evolution between mountain ash and aphids. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - An electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometric method (ET-AAS) was developed for the direct determination of iron in intestinal Caco-2 cells after studying cell viability and proliferation using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT test). Zeeman background correction and end-capped graphite tubes with L'vov platforms were used. Samples were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and pipetted directly into the graphite tube. The preashing, pretreatment and atomization steps were optimized. The temperatures selected were 600, 1200, and 2100 °C, respectively. Stability measurements were performed using iron standard solutions in DMSO on the one hand and acidified cell solutions on the other. Direct measurement and standard addition were compared in order to determine possible influences of the matrix. The low detection limit of the ET-AAS method (1.3 μg/L or 3.3 μg/g) combined with the small sample quantities required are ideal for the determination of iron in cells due to the low iron content and the limited growth area of the cells. The method was developed for iron uptake studies for toxicological purposes. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - This study examined intrasexual size variation in the sexually dimorphic mountain stone weta Hemideina maori. We were unable to determine the proportion of weta maturing at different instars, because linear variation in adult head sizes was continuous and not discrete. However, by measuring the growth increment from subadult to adult of weta raised in the laboratory, we estimated that 11% of the males in our main study site were maturing two instars earlier than the largest male. Similar variation in size at maturation has been observed in male Wellington tree weta Hemideina crassidens, which are known to mature at three different instars, but is unusual for insects in general. The variation in head and femur sizes of H. maori was greater between sites (= isolated populations) than within sites, corresponding to an altitude gradient. Females showed a similar altitude gradient, although they showed less variation in body size than males. These data suggest that at any given local environmental temperature, there may be selection for an optimum body size. Whether there is further selection on the smallest males within each site to exhibit alternative mating tactics, as part of a conditional reproductive strategy, remains to be determined.

VL  - 74

SP  - 1562-1579
AB  - This study investigated behavioural thermoregulation by subyearling fall (autumn) Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in a reservoir on the Snake River, Washington, U.S.A. During the summer, temperatures in the reservoir varied from 23 degrees C on the surface to 11 degrees C at 14 m depth. Subyearlings implanted with temperature-sensing radio transmitters were released at the surface at temperatures > 20 degrees C during three blocks of time in summer 2004. Vertical profiles were taken to measure temperature and depth use as the fish moved downstream over an average of 5.6-7.2 h and 6.0-13.8 km. The majority of the subyearlings maintained average body temperatures that differed from average vertical profile temperatures during most of the time they were tracked. The mean proportion of the time subyearlings tracked within the 16-20 degrees C temperature range was larger than the proportion of time this range was available, which confirmed temperature selection opposed to random use. The subyearlings selected a depth and temperature combination that allowed them to increase their exposure to temperatures of 16-20 degrees C when temperatures < 16 and > 20 degrees C were available at lower and higher positions in the water column. A portion of the subyearlings that selected a temperature c. 17.0 degrees C during the day, moved into warmer water at night coincident with an increase in downstream movement rate. Though subyearlings used temperatures outside of the 16-20 degrees C range part of the time, behavioural thermoregulation probably reduced the effects of intermittent exposure to suboptimal temperatures. By doing so, it might enhance growth opportunity and life-history diversity in the population of subyearlings studied.

AB  - Newly hatched larvae of D. melanogaster and D. simulans are attracted to and have very similar responses to acetic acid, ethyl acetate, and lactic acid, while D. immigrans, belonging to a different subgenus, is attracted less strongly. The latter species avoids alcohol, while D. simulans has little response, and D. melanogaster is attracted to it. The ecological biology of the sibling species differs from D. immigrans by whatever criterion is selected - larval responses, resources utilized, oviposition, nutritional requirements, temperatures tolerated and preferred, habitats occupied, and wasp parasitism. Such comprehensive investigations at various taxonomic levels may provide information on evolutionary divergence in Drosophila, especially where larval studies can be incorporated. © Australian Journal of Zoology.

AB  - Thermal preferences of well-fed and food-limited fire ant colonies (Solenopsis invicta) were studied in relation to colony growth and metabolic costs. The growth curve for well-fed colonies was strongly skewed toward warmer temperatures with maximal growth occurring near 32-degrees-C (Fig. 2 A). The growth curve for food-limited colonies was skewed toward cooler temperatures with maximal colony size occurring around 25-degrees-C (Fig. 2 B). Food-limited colonies apparently grew larger at cooler temperatures because metabolic costs of workers were reduced. A series of binary choice tests confirmed three predictions concerning fire ant thermal preferences (Figs. 3-4). First, well-fed colonies preferred brood temperatures very near the optimum for colony growth (31-degrees-C versus 32-degrees-C). Colonies were also able to select appropriate suboptimal growth temperatures when the optimal range was unavailable. Secondly, as predicted, a large percentage of colony workers (approximately 30% in well-fed colonies) consistently chose cooler temperatures than those selected for the brood. This strategy probably increases longevity of workers not directly associated with brood care. Thirdly, food-limited colonies preferred cooler temperatures than well-fed colonies. Metabolic costs of food-limited colonies were reduced by approximately 7% because of (1) slightly cooler brood temperatures (30-degrees-C versus 31-degrees-C) and because (2) an additional 20-30% of the workers selected cooler temperatures. The addition of excess food reversed food-limited thermal preferences within 12 h for the brood (Fig. 5) and several days for the workers. Contrary to expectations, thermal preferences for brood in food-limited colonies did not match the food-limited growth curve, perhaps because fire ant colonies can choose to rear brood at warm temperatures while maintaining accumulated colony biomass at cooler temperatures.

TI  - Transfer analysis of provenance trials reveals macroclimatic adaptedness of european beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)
VL  - 5
SP  - 47-62
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse provenance tests of beech situated close to the Southeastern-continental limits of the species, in order to develop a response model of adaptation and plasticity of populations on evolutionary-ecological basis, following sudden climatic changes as a result of transplanting. Modelling of juvenile height was performed with the help of ecodistance variables. The concept of transfer analysis and ecodistance is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic response to macroclimatic changes depends on the inherited adaptive potential of the population and on the magnitude and direction of experienced environmental change. In common garden experiments, the transfer to the planting site is interpreted as simulation of environmental change. The application of ecodistance of transfer for evaluating common garden experiments provides much needed quantitative information about response of tree populations to predicted climatic changes. The analysis of three field experiments of European beech in SE Europe invalidate earlier doubts about the existence of macroclimatic adaptation patterns in juvenile growth and justify restrictions of use of reproductive material on the basis of evolutionary ecology. The presented model illustrates that response to climatic change is regionally divergent, depending on testing conditions and on hereditary traits. In particular, climatic warming in the central-northern part of the range may lead to production increase. However, under the stressful and uncertain conditions at the lower (xeric) limit of the species, growth depression and vitality loss are predicted. The deviating behaviour of higher elevation provenances support their separate treatment. The results may be utilised in climate change adaptation and mitigation policy in forestry and nature conservation, to revise rules for use of reproductive material and also for validating evolutionary and ecological hypotheses related to climate change effects.

VL  - 25

SP  - 1329-1333
AB  - Mature ova of frogs have been subjected to doses thermal effects causing death or injury of 5, 50 and 95% of ova. With the increase of intensity of thermal selection all the ova undergo complex internal changes, abruptly shift the ratios of muscle tissue heat resistance values of larvae developed from the ova selected by heating, cause the disappearance of low resistant variants and the appearance of a number of highly resistant variants absent from the control series. The pattern of changes of the heat resistance allows an assumption that these may be due to the existence of at least two groups of ova which response quite differently to the thermal effect. Hence, during an intensive thermal selection of ova, two processes are under way going in parallel: the first, the elimination of low-resistant ova and, consequently, of individuals with low tissue resistance, and the second, a reactive change in ova due to which the larvae with high tissue resistance appear.

SP  - 111-125
AB  - Four populations of the cactophilous species D. buzzatii have been compared with respect to the phenotypic variation of thorax and wing length of wild versus laboratory reared flies. Three of the strains were intercrossed to provide parent, F1 and F2 comparisons as a test of co-adaptation. The genetic contribution to phenotypic variation of laboratory reared flies was estimated from the correlation between sibs derived from random pair mating and reared individually in separate cultures. The average natural temperature during development was estimated from the relations between the wing/thorax ratio and temperature in laboratory tests. The variance of thorax and wing length of wild flies was several times greater than that of laboratory reared flies and the increase was attributed primarily to variation in larval food supply although temperature fluctuation is also important. There was no evidence of heterosis or F2 break-down in the crosses. For two of the populations the heritability of thorax length was high, 60-70%, and substantially lower for the third. The average temperature estimated from the wing/thorax/temperature relationship differed between sites. The reduction of body size below the potential maximum averaged 30% for two and 20% for the other population, with a wide spread about these values. The evidence is discussed in relation to assessing the nature of ecological variation by comparing the variation of morphological traits in wild and laboratory reared flies. © 1987 Dr W.

VL  - 16

SP  - 495-528
AB  - Behavioral reactions of fishes are measureable, adaptive features which contribute to their evolutionary fitness and, hence, can serve as biomarkers of stress. For a behavior to serve as an efficacious biomarker, it should be important to an individual's survival, growth and/or reproduction, be relatively stable under control conditions, and have a “concentration-effect” relationship with the stressor. This review summarizes the influence of numerous environmental stimuli on seven different behaviors in fishes. Avoidance-attractance behavior does not assess for stress, but rather allows a fish to avoid stressful chemicals. Of the 75 chemicals surveyed, about 13 are avoided at threshold concentrations that should mitigate harm, while approximately 23 were either not actively avoided or produced inconsistent results. Temperature selection behavior meets several criteria of a good indicator of stress. Several stimuli produced significant changes in selected/avoidance temperatures of various fishes. While only a few stimuli caused an increase, several resulted in a decrease in selected temperatures. Although conditioned learning appears to be a sensitive measure of environmentally induced stress, few studies have been published, and direct field validations are not possible. A variety of stimuli can disrupt the components of feeding, often in the parts per billion range of concentrations. Predator-prey interactions are sensitive to a variety of stressors. In trials where only prey were exposed to a potential stressor, 94% of the stressors caused an increase in prey vulnerability, usually at levels less than 96-hour LC50s. Neither of the other social behaviors reviewed, intraspecific and reproductive, although promising, has received large research attention. Studies featuring several different methods demonstrate that there is no single best behavioral bioassay method. However, depending upon the expected effects and possible mode of action, there probably is a “best” behavioral bioassay to illustrate the effects of each potential stressor. © 1990, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

VL  - 391
SP  - 121-137
AB  - In this review we detail the impact of climate change on marine productivity, on marine environmental stochasticity and cyclicity, and on the spatio-temporal match-mismatch of seabirds and their prey. We thereby show that global warming has a profound bottom-up impact upon marine top-predators, but that such effects have to be studied in conjunction with the (top-down) impact of human fisheries upon seabird food resources. Further, we propose seabird ecological features, such as memory effects and social constraints, that make them particularly sensitive to rapid environmental change. We provide examples of how seabirds may nonetheless adapt when facing the consequences of climate change. We conclude that our understanding of the spatial ecology of seabirds facing environmental change is still rudimentary, despite its relevance for the conservation of these vulnerable organisms and for the management of marine ecosystems. We define the following research priorities. (1) Determine the factors affecting seabird distribution and movements at sea using biotelemetry, as well as colony dynamics on land. (2) Link seabird distribution patterns to those of their prey. (3) Determine further the role of historical and metapopulation processes in contributing to the dynamics of the spatial distribution of seabirds. (4) Assess phenotypic plasticity and the potential for microevolution within seabird spatial responses to climate change, since both will greatly affect the quality of modelling studies. (5) Adapt existing models to define and predict the impact of climate change onto seabird spatial dynamics. (6) Synthesize all gathered information to define marine protected areas and further conservation schemes, such as capacity reduction of fisheries. This research effort will require maintaining existing long-term monitoring programmes for seabirds, as well as developing new approaches to permit the integration of processes occurring at various scales, in order to be able to fully track the population responses of these long-lived vertebrates to environmental changes.

AB  - (1) Hoplodactylus maculatus, is a nocturnal, viviparous gecko that inhabits a cool-temperate region. (2) To determine if pregnant females expend more effort thermoregulating than non-pregnant females or males, we compared field body temperature (T-b) with microhabitat thermal maxima (T-top), thermal minima (T-bot) and selected temperature (T-sel) among males, non-pregnant females and pregnant females. (3) An index of hermoregulatory effectiveness that incorporated diurnal variation in T-sel was used to compare among reproductive conditions. (4) Relationships between T-b, T-top and T-bot varied between reproductive conditions and seasons, suggesting complex diurnal thermoregulatory strategies in this nocturnal species. (5) Pregnant females achieved higher indices of thermoregulatory effort than males in both seasons, with the highest value in late spring and a slightly lower index similar to that of non-pregnant females in summer.

AB  - Cell cultures of Nicotiana sylvestris and Capsicum annuum, both without and following exposure to the mutagen, EMS, have been submitted to chilling for 21 days at -3°C and +5°C respectively and the cell lines derived from the surviving cells tested for their subsequent resistance to the chilling treatment. Some of the cell lines when again submitted to the chilling stress showed no enhanced survival, others retained their resistance after an extended period of growth at 24°C. The application of the mutagen promoted the isolation of such stable resistant cell lines. Studies of the response of the respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria to temperature from a resistant and from a sensitive cell line of C. annuum revealed a difference similar to that previously reported from studies on isolated mitochondria from chilling-sensitive and chilling-resistant plants of various species. © 1976 Annals of Botany Company.

TI  - Temperature-dependent xerographic depletion discharge studies of a-Se:Te alloys
VL  - 1253
SP  - 212-222
AB  - The time evolution of the surface potential of xerographic photoreceptors charged in the dark can yield valuable information concerning the underlying thermal generation processes and the energetic distribution of emission centres. Xerographic dark discharge of a-Se:Te films proceeds according to the xerographic depletion discharge (XDD) model. According to this model the depletion time td should be singly activated. We find that for a-Se:Te alloys in the alloying regime 5-12wt% Arrhenius plots of td are non-linear and yield characteristic attempt-to-escape frequencies typically 108 times greater than phonon frequencies in these materials. This result can be only partially accounted for by the recent fourth-order approximation of the demarcation energy concept. The presence of exponential distributions of emission centres in this material system is shown by the application of the field-enhanced XDD model at constant temperature. A theoretical fit of temperature-dependent data is then achieved by consideration of the occupation function of emission centres close to EF and the temperature dependence of the mobility gap. For the materials studied, the best fit to the experimental data was achieved with EF located at an energy corresponding to half the optical gap from the mobility edges. The thermal generation mechanism is identified as the process C3+ → C30+h followed by C30 → C1- + h.

TI  - Convection of two-phase fluid in a layered porous medium driven by the heat of magmatic dikes and sills
VL  - 40
SP  - S69-S81
AB  - In order to quantify the rate of filtration of the liquid and gas phases of pore-water and hydrocarbon fluids, convection processes were explored in the framework of the two-dimensional problem of convective heat transfer, taking into account phase transitions under the influence of the heat of sheet igneous bodies. Various regimes of the convection of pore-water fluid were simulated. In the case of a homogeneous fluid (without boiling), regular convection cells are formed, showing periodicity with respect to flow velocity and temperature. When a sheet igneous body is emplaced near the surface, flow patterns and the evolution of the temperature field change dramatically owing to boiling of interstitial liquid. The cellular structure does not form, and heat advection is observed via an ascending flow of a gas or gas-liquid mixture in the form of a "mushroom" or a plume. The initial stage of heating of fluid-bearing rocks is accompanied by the generation of excess pressure below the lower contact of a sill. The lifetime of such anomalously high pressures is estimated for the watervapor system, where they may be higher than hydrostatic pressure by a factor of 1.5-1.8. Models including sills of finite extensions show the viability of mechanisms of long lateral fluid migration below impermeable igneous bodies toward discharge zones. The application of the results of modeling to oil- and gas-bearing sedimentary basins with flood basalt magmatism demonstrated that sheet intrusions played a significant role in the transformation of hydrocarbon matter and influenced the character of convection flows. Magmatic heat causes phase transitions of liquid hydrocarbons into gas phase in a country rock volume comparable with that of the igneous body (sill or dike).

TI  - Quantitative genetic analysis of the body size and shape of Drosophila buzzatii
VL  - 85
IS  - 5
SP  - 598-608
AB  - Body size in Drosophila is known to be closely related to a number of traits with important life history consequences, such as fecundity, dispersal ability and mating success. We examine the quantitative genetic basis of body size in three populations of the cactophilic species Drosophila buzzatii, which inhabit climatically different areas of Australia. Flies were reared individually to eliminate any common environmental component in a full-sib design with families split between two temperatures (18° and 25 °C). The means of several size measures differ significantly among populations while the genetic correlations among these traits generally do not differ, either among populations from different natural environments or between the different laboratory temperatures. This stability of correlation structure is necessary if laboratory estimates of genetic correlations are to have any connection with the expression of genetic variation in the field. The amount of variance due to genotype-by-environment interactions (family x temperature of development) varied among populations, apparently in parallel with the magnitudes of seasonal and diurnal variation in temperature experienced by the different populations. A coastal population, inhabiting a relatively thermally benign environment, showed no interaction, while two inland populations, inhabiting thermally more extreme areas, showed interaction. This interaction term is a measure of the amount of genetic variation in the degree of phenotypic plasticity of body size in response to temperature of development. Thus the inland flies vary in their ability to attain a given body size at a particular temperature while the coastal flies do not. This phenotypic plasticity is shown to be due primarily to differences among genotypes in the amount of response to the change in temperature. A possible selective basis for the maintenance of genetic variation for the levels of phenotypic plasticity is proposed. © 1993 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 302
IS  - 5
SP  - 410-441
AB  - The thermal history of subducted/exhumed crustal fragments is explored to depths of 125 km using a forward modeling approach. The finite element code uses an adaptive gridding technique that allows deformation and differential movement of subgrids to simulate tectonic mass flow. The geometry and velocity of plate convergence and the large-scale strain partitioning (for example, subduction channel, mobile tectonic fragments) are described explicitly as functions of time. The evolution of metamorphic conditions during descent and subsequent exhumation of a terrane within the subduction channel is computed for different kinematic scenarios. These include a range of velocities, relative to a stable continental block, for the subducting slab, the exhuming (UHP) fragment, and a subduction channel of given width. Though essentially generic in emphasis, our models are designed to help understand real UHP occurences, most especially their exhumation history. Boundary conditions and the geometric set-up were chosen according to three case studies of known UHP terranes (eastern China, Western Norway, Western Alps). Simulations indicate that the temperature reached at a given depth during the subduction stage is crucially dependent on the convergence rate, width of the subduction channel, location of the fragment within the subduction channel, and on rates of shear heating and convection of the subcontinental mantle. The P-T-t path experienced by a tectonic fragment during its exhumation from Pmax is determined chiefly by its size (thickness) and exhumation velocity; the rate of ongoing subduction is less relevant given the rapid exhumation required to preserve UHP assemblages. The depth at which Tmax is reached by an exhuming UHP fragment and the dP / dT slope of its exhumation path may critically affect the extent of irreversible phase transitions during decompression. Comparing data for the three UHP case studies with corresponding simulation results indicates general agreement of the P-T paths. Predicted T-t evolution paths are also compatible with well-constrained mineral chronometry from the study areas. This agreement between field data and simulation results leads to a number of observables that may be useful in relating UHP occurences to their evolution. For example, no metamorphic field gradients are expected for fragments of less than 5 km thickness, and the spread in mineral ages reflecting the high-pressure stage is predicted to be less than 1 Ma. Therefore, observed variations in metamorphic conditions for the stage near Tmax and P(Tmax) may reflect real differences of evolution in very large fragments only; and the same is valid for a substantial spread in metamorphic age data pertaining to stages near Pmax or Tmax. Tectonic extrusion of fragments along a subduction channel is not the only mechanism proposed to explain UHP occurrences. However, the broad agreement between several test cases and the present simulation results lend support to the viability of the kinematic scenario adopted. Where field evidence indicates a similar emplacement mechanism and allows the (initial) size of the UHP fragment to be inferred, the MELONPIT model provides a powerful integrative tool to produce a quantitative picture of the dynamics of UHP terranes.

SP  - 645-648
AB  - The stability of indigenous enteric viruses in samples of settled primary and mixed-liquor activated sludges was studied at 2, 23, and -70°C. Changes of virus titer which occurred in these samples were followed during an 84-day observation period, with rates of changes then calculated by least-squares regression. Virus survival was found to be statistically dependent (p ≤ 0.05) upon storage temperature but not sludge solids content. Based upon the observed rates of inactivation, the average times which would be required for a 90% decrease in virus titer are 26 days at 23°C, 180 days at 2°C, and 163 days at -70°C. As a group, the rates of virus inactivation observed at 2°C were statistically different (p ≤ 0.05) from those observed at 23°C, but not different from those observed at -70°C. The three study temperatures were selected to approximate holding of samples in an air-conditioned room, on wet ice (H2O), and on dry ice (CO2).

SP  - 549-555
AB  - Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of self-select feeding to 40 weeks of age on food, protein and metabolizable energy (ME) intakes and egg mass output of pullets previously trained to this feeding system between 15 and 19 weeks of age and kept at cool (10°-20°C) and hot (25°-35°C) temperatures. In two experiments different lighting patterns were also compared without noticeable effect. Except for ME intake on the low-ME diet in Experiment 2, protein and ME intakes were significantly improved when pullets fed a low-ME (10.2 MJ/kg) or high-ME (12.0 MJ/kg) complete layer diet at both temperatures were offered a separate protein concentrate on a self-select basis. Increases in egg mass output were most pronounced when the high-ME complete diet was fed with the protein concentrate at the hot temperatures. The resulting egg mass output was similar to that obtained when the low-ME complete diet was fed with the protein concentrate or when a highly concentrated, complete diet, based on the intakes of the high-ME diet and the separate protein concentrate selected by pullets of similar age in an earlier study, was fed. Providing a separate granular source of calcium had no significant effect on the responses to self-select feeding. © 1990 CSIRO. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Differences between sexes in physiological performance have received little attention in animals. We tested for sex differences in maximum sprint speed and maximal exertion over a range of temperatures in a population of Platysaurus intermedius wilhelmi lizards. We also examined sex-based differences in selected temperature range, mean field body temperatures (T-b), and thermal activity limits. Finally, we conducted field studies to quantify male and female responses to a potential predator, which may be affected by their respective performance capabilities. Males were faster than females at all temperatures, and body size had no significant effect on sprint speeds. Males and females also selected similar T-b's when placed in a thermal gradient, but in the field, male lizards' T-b's were different from those of the females. However, predicted sprint speeds for males and females at their field T-b's are similar. No significant differences were found between males and females with regard to maximal exertion. When approached in the field, adult male lizards took refuge significantly earlier than did adult females and also fled over shorter distances, suggesting that females rely on crypsis as an escape strategy.

AB  - The exchange and release properties of the natural phillipsite tuff from the Aritain area in Jordan were evaluated by studying the exchange properties of this natural zeolite in the NH4+-Na+ system. Exchange isotherms at 18, 35, and 50°C showed that phillipsite exchanged NH4+ preferably over Na4+ at all temperatures. However, the selectivity coefficient for NH4+ decreased with decreasing temperature. The release of NH4+ from phillipsite saturated with ammonium sulfate took place in two stages characterized by different SO2-4; NH+4 ratios. Aritain phillipsite from NE Jordan could be processed and used as NH+4 phillipsite tuff offers an option to the widely used soluble NH4 fertilizers in agriculture to avoid environmental problems associated with nitrogen contamination of surface water and ground-water.

AB  - Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short peptides able to penetrate cell membranes and translocate different cargoes into cells. Although recently the topic of many research articles, to our best knowledge no single systematic study of CPPs has been carried out as yet, meaning information can only by gathered piece by piece from different sources. We therefore decided to start analytical screening of CPP specificity in cell lines. We used 22 different CPPs, which have all been published before, and present the first analytical screen in 4 selected cell lines (MDCK, HEK293, HeLa, and Cos-7). Furthermore, we examined the influence of different conditions, such as protease inhibitors, incubation conditions, endocytosis inhibitors, temperature, and cytotoxicity. We clearly demonstrate that the 22 CPPs can be classified into 3 groups based on their internalization properties, even after trypsinization. Moreover, we show that additional agents, which should increase cellular uptake or dissolve endosomal/lysosomal entrapped CPPs, only have low effects. Our intensive screening under standardized conditions provides the opportunity to compare cellular uptake of CPPs, an important step for the use of CPPs as peptidic vectors in the medical field. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 58

SP  - 317-331
AB  - Laying hens have physiological responses that affect their productive performance when given different ambient temperatures. The objectives of this study were, first, to quantitatively describe the relationship between different constant environmental temperatures and egg production characteristics of laying hens by a statistical analysis and assessment of the published literature. Second, to compare the effect of different cycling environmental temperatures on the egg production characteristics of laying hens. Twenty-nine experiments were selected that had compared different constant temperatures and that included 21degreesC within their range. Differences in egg production were expressed as a proportion of the treatment group given 21degreesC within that experiment. An exponential curve with the addition of a linear trend gave the best (P<0.001) description of egg numbers, weight and mass, feed intakes and egg composition variables. There was a linear decrease (P<0.001) in measures of shell strength with increasing temperature. A second statistical analysis compared eight published experiments that had described the egg laying responses of laying hens kept in daily fluctuating temperatures and had been compared to a treatment group kept at 21degreesC within the same experiment. The results indicated that the egg laying responses of the hens were best predicted by computing the mean of the predicted responses to each of the temperatures that occurred during the day. However, information on the low temperature, the proportion of the day at the low temperature and the amplitude of the temperature cycle were required to give a precise prediction of the egg laying responses.

TI  - Incapacitating the evolutionary capacitor: Hsp90 modulation of disease
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 264-272
AB  - The nature-nurture argument surrounding the mechanisms of disease causation cannot be resolved, as the roles of genes and environment are inextricably entwined. Environmental fluctuation is clearly a major modifier of phenotype, as well as a promoter of evolutionary change. Both types of variability can be mediated by the stress response pathway, with the Hsp90 chaperone family as key components. Hsp90 has been hailed as a capacitor for evolutionary change, because partial inhibition of its functions can uncover cryptic mutations, leading to unexpected phenotypes that, although generally deleterious, will under rare new environmental conditions provide improved survival to the carrier of that variant. There is, therefore, a strong environmentally elicited link between the capacity to reveal hidden variation as human disease phenotype and as novel morphological forms for evolutionary selection. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Major carbon and nitrogen fluxes through crop and soil were studied in a series of field experiments. Barley, winter wheat, a grass mixture cut for hay and the energy crop reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) were studied. The treatments ranged from drought to daily irrigation/fertilization with high doses of water and nitrogen. Crop biomass and nitrogen dynamics above and below ground and incident light as well as soil temperature, moisture and mineral N content were monitored. Litter decomposition experiments were also performed in the field. The results were used to parameterize, validate and improve a set of soil/plant simulation models. Selected experimental results and experiences gained from the water, C and N budgeting and modelling work are presented.

TI  - Cytotoxicity and metabolism of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal and 2-nonenal in H2O2-resistant cell lines: do aldehydic by-products of lipid peroxidation contribute to oxidative stress?
VL  - 267
IS  - 2
SP  - 453-459
AB  - Toxic aldehydes, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE) and 2-nonenal (2NE), formed during lipid peroxidation have been isolated and implicated in the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress. We have investigated the cytotoxicity and metabolism of 4HNE and 2NE in control (HA-1) cells and in two H2O2-resistant Chinese hamster fibroblast cell lines. The H2O2-resistant cells were found to be significantly more resistant than HA-1 cells to the cytotoxicity of 4HNE, as determined by clonogenic cell survival (dose-modifying factors at 10% isosurvival of 2.0-3.0). The H2O2-resistant cells demonstrated a significant 2-3 fold increase in the amount of 4HNE removed (mol/cell) from culture media containing 72 μM-4HNE when compared with HA-1 cells. The enhanced ability of H2O2-resistant cells to metabolize 4HNE was abolished by heating the cells at 100 °C for 45 min. Similar results were obtained with 2NE. Total glutathione and glutathione transferase activity, believed to be involved in cellular detoxification of 4HNE, were found to be significantly increased (2-3-fold) in the resistant cells when compared with the HA-1 cells. These results show that cell lines adapted and/or selected in a highly peroxidative environment are also resistant to the cytotoxicity of aldehydes formed during lipid peroxidation. This resistance appears to be related to increased cellular metabolism of these aldehydes, possibly through the glutathione transferase system. These findings suggest that the formation of aldehydes due to lipid peroxidation may contribute significantly to the mechanisms of oxidant-induced injury and the selective pressure exerted by H2O0-mediated cytotoxicity in culture.

AB  - Effects of different combinations of stressors (viz. temperature, food level) on growth, developmental and survival rates of Rana temporaria tadpoles from two geographically widely (approximate to 1500 km) separated populations were studied in a common garden experiment. In both populations, low temperature and low food level lead to lowered growth rates and delayed metamorphosis, whereas high temperature and high food level had the opposite effect. Tadpoles from north metamorphosed earlier and exhibited higher growth rates than tadpoles from south, suggesting local adaptation to shorter growth period and cooler ambient temperature in north. Size at metamorphosis did not differ between the two populations, but when the differences in metamorphic age were accounted for, then the tadpoles from north were larger than those from south. These results suggest considerable adaptive genetic differentiation in growth rates, size and timing of metamorphosis between northern and southern R. temporaria populations. In both populations, high food levels tended to reduce tadpole survival rates and there was a negative correlation between growth and survival rates across different treatments in both populations. In general, tadpoles from north experienced high mortality rates in high food level - low temperature treatments, whereas southern tadpoles experienced high mortality in high food level-high temperature treatments. This suggest that there may be genetic differences among different populations as how they would be influenced by high nutrient loads, such as brought along for example by fertilization of forest or agricultural soils.

AB  - We compared the reproductive phenology and tadpole thermal physiology of two populations of Buergeria japonica in Taiwan. The population in Jentse breeds in a geothermal hot spring whose water is a warm, over 35 degreesC year-round, whereas the population in Chukou breeds in a stream whose water temperature is closely correlated with fluctuations in air temperature and averages 23 degreesC. The B. japonica population in Jentse breeds year-round, but the Chukou population breeds only from March to October. Tadpoles from Jentse that reared at 32 degreesC attained larger sizes than tadpoles from Chukou that reared at 32 degreesC, whereas tadpoles from both sites attained similar body size when reared at 22 degreesC. Chukou tadpoles reared at 40 degreesC died within 1-2 d, whereas Jentse tadpoles survived for 9 d at 40 degreesC. All tadpoles tolerated heat well, but Jentse tadpoles had higher critical thermal maxima (CTMax) than Chukou tadpoles. Tadpoles from Jentse showed no metabolic compensation but those from Chukou showed an "inverse" metabolic compensation. Results suggest that B. japonica that breed in the geothermal hot spring has a prolonged breeding season, high growth rates and the reduction or absence of intra- and inter-specific competition. Evolution of a high level of heat tolerance and, possibly, behavioral temperature selection, enable tadpoles in the hotsprings to offset the thermal stress imposed by warm water.

TI  - Seasonal adaptations in Arctic insects
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
SP  - 85-94
AB  - Many insect species live in the arctic and show a wide range of adaptations to its extreme severity and seasonality. Long, cold winters are met, for example, by cold hardiness and choice of protected sites. Cold hardiness includes both widespread tolerance to freezing and extreme supercooling ability, as well as unusual responses in a few species, such as lack of typical cryoprotectants. Adaptations to short, cool summers include activity at low temperatures, selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, melanism and hairiness coupled with basking behaviour, and prolonged or abbreviated life cycles. Diapause ensures that many species emerge early in summer, with brief synchronized reproduction that maximizes the time for offspring development before winter returns. Some species overwinter in sites that thaw earliest in spring, even if they are relatively exposed in winter. Other adaptations respond to year-to-year variability: for example, prolonged diapause can provide insurance against unsuitable summers. All of these adaptations are co-ordinated. For example, cold hardiness relies on physiological and biochemical adaptations but also on habitat choice and timing. Because the adaptations are complex, predicted climatic warming probably will have unexpected effects. In particular, an increase in temperature that increases summer cloud when sea ice melts would likely reduce temperatures for insect development and activity, because sunshine provides critical warmth to insects and their microhabitats. Changes in moisture will also be important. Moreover, responses differ among species, depending especially on their microhabitats. The complexity of the responses of insects to arctic conditions reinforces the need for research that is sufficiently detailed.

TI  - Stress responses in lactic acid bacteria
VL  - 82
IS  - 1
SP  - 187-216
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) constitute a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are traditionally used to produce fermented foods. The industrialization of food bio-transformations increased the economical importance of LAB, as they play a crucial role in the development of the organoleptique and hygienic quality of fermented products. Therefore, the reliability of starter strains in terms of quality and functional properties (important for the development of aroma and texture), but also in terms of growth performance and robustness has become essential. These strains should resist to adverse conditions encountered in industrial processes, for example during starter handling and storage (freeze-drying, freezing or spray-drying). The development of new applications such as life vaccines and probiotic foods reinforces the need for robust LAB since they may have to survive in the digestive tract, resist the intestinal flora, maybe colonize the digestive or uro-genital mucosa and express specific functions under conditions that are unfavorable to growth (for example, during stationary phase or storage). Also in nature, the ability to quickly respond to stress is essential for survival and it is now well established that LAB, like other bacteria, evolved defense mechanisms against stress that allow them to withstand harsh conditions and sudden environmental changes. While genes implicated in stress responses are numerous, in LAB the levels of characterization of their actual role and regulation differ widely between species. The functional conservation of several stress proteins (for example, HS proteins, Csp, etc) and of some of their regulators (for example, HrcA, CtsR) renders even more striking the differences that exist between LAB and the classical model micro-organisms. Among the differences observed between LAB species and B. subtilis, one of the most striking is the absence of a sigma(B) orthologue in L. lactis ssp. lactis as well as in at least two streptococci and probably E. faecalis. The overview of LAB stress responses also reveals common aspects of stress responses. As in other bacteria, adaptive responses appear to be a usual mode of stress protection in LAB. However, the cross-protection to other stress often induced by the expression of a given adaptive response, appears to vary between species. This observation suggests that the molecular bases of adaptive responses are, at least in part, species (or even subspecies) specific. A better understanding of the mechanisms of stress resistance should allow to understand the bases of the adaptive responses and cross protection, and to rationalize their exploitation to prepare LAB to industrial processes. Moreover, the identification of crucial stress related genes will reveal targets i) for specific manipulation (to promote or limit growth), ii) to develop tools to screen for tolerant or sensitive strains and iii) to evaluate the fitness and level of adaptation of a culture. In this context, future genome and transcriptome analyses will undoubtedly complement the proteome and genetic information available today, and shed a new light on the perception of, and the response to, stress by lactic acid bacteria.

AB  - Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to study samples taken from three paintings during treatment in the Conservation Department of the Tate Gallery. The paintings include two from the 16th century: (1) "Queen Elizabeth 1" by Nicholas Hilliard (National Portrait Gallery, London NPG 190), (2) "An Allegory of Life" (unattributed ca. 1570 British School To 5729) and (3) 19th century, Turner's 'The Opening of the Walhalla, 1842' (Tate Gallery N00533). Knowledge of the type of paint media used is of interest both to the conservator who needs to select the appropriate materials for cleaning the painting and to the art historian for documentation of artists' techniques. In the case of the Hilliard painting it was found that a mixed oil egg medium had been used. With regard to the unattributed 16th century British painting it was found that an oil-based medium had been used. The ground layer contained, as expected, a natural glue. Samples from the Turner painting showed that different regions of the painting had been executed with different materials; the region of the sky was painted predominantly with a drying oil, the lower regions of the painting contained mixtures of oil and resin and in some cases the samples were further complicated by the presence of proteinaceous material and wax. The recorded accompanying weight change gave information on the pigment volume concentration of the samples. In each case measurements were made of both the temperature and the heat evolved during the exothermic reactions. Thermomicroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the presence of complex mixtures, particularly in the case of the Turner samples. © 1995.

TI  - Factors affecting the hydrogen cyanide potential of forage sorghum
VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 1093-1100
AB  - The effect of seven factors, namely genotype, plant maturity, nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus fertilizer, water stress, light intensity and temperature, on the hydrogen cyanide potential (HCNp) of forage sorghum was studied in three pot experiments. Fivefold differences occurred between genotypes in HCNp, with a breeder’s line, X45106, selected for low HCNp having a maximum of 520 mg HCN kg-1 DM (dry matter) compared with 2300 and 2450 mg kg-1 DM for cvs Zulu and Silk respectively. In X45 106, HCNp (mg HCN kg-1 DM) declined curvilinearly with age d (days from sowing) (HCNp=8460 - 320d + 3.1d2) and linearly in Silk (HCNp = 9020 - 110d), but the decline in Zulu was not statistically significant. Nitrogen (equivalent to 200 kg ha-1 of N) increased HCN, (P&lt; 0.001), but more so in full light (100 mg kg-1 compared with 1430 mg kg-1) than in 50% shade (190 mg kg-1 compared with 690 mg kg-1). In one experiment, acute water stress appeared to reduce HCNp, but this was confounded with the strong decline due to aging. In another study, acute water stress had no effect on HCNp. Neither the application of superphosphate nor change in light intensity, nor change in temperature had a direct significant effect on HCNp in these studies. Breeding and selection for low HCNp appears a promising approach to ensuring that sorghum plants will provide non-toxic forage from an early stage of growth. © 1990 CSIRO. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phosphoglucose isomerase genotype affects life-history traits and cold stress resistance in a Copper butterfly
VL  - 22
IS  - 5
SP  - 887-894
AB  - 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) locus is under thermal selection. In the Copper butterfly Lycaena tityrus PGI allele frequencies show altitudinal variation, with a single genotype occurring in c. 90% of high-altitude animals. In low-altitude populations variation at this locus is much higher. 2. Here, we investigate variation in life-history traits and temperature stress resistance across PGI genotypes in L. tityrus from different lowland populations reared at two temperatures (19 and 24 °C). 3. PGI genotype significantly affected larval and pupal development time, growth rate, pupal mass and chill-coma recovery time, but had no effect on heat knock-down resistance. The latter suggests that heat and cold stress resistance are based on differential mechanisms. 4. As expected temperature also influenced all traits under investigation, its effect being more pronounced compared to that of PGI genotype (except for pupal mass). 5. Patterns found for the PGI genotype dominating in high-altitude populations were consistent with those found for high-altitude animals. Therefore, and because of the direct link between PGI genotype and cold stress resistance, we conclude that PGI is likely to contribute to thermal adaptation in L. tityrus. 6. Genotypes promoting rapid development and largest body size were rather rare, suggesting weak selection on both traits and/or rather high associated costs. © 2008 The Authors.

VL  - 48

SP  - 73-84
AB  - This paper reports on a simplified approach for analysing the temperature evolution in a semi-transparent thin membrane of the amorphous polyethylene terephtalate type (PET) exposed to a radiative source. It is based on a 3D finite elements method. The thermophysical properties of the PET are assumed independent of temperature while the internal radiative intensity absorption is taken as one-dimensional and is governed by the Beer-Lambert law. To avoid the difficult problem of computing the shape factors, a semi-analytical approach is used. Finally, the numerical simulations have allowed to validate the analytical and experimental results. In the first place, we have written the energy conservation equation in absence of convection (based on the first law of thermodynamics) (1.a), the radiative source term (1.b) and the boundary conditions (2). As for the finite elements method, the Galerkin approach is used for the formulation of the 3D heat transfer equation (3) and the diagonalisation of the heat capacity matrix, "lumped matrix", is adopted [M.A. Dokainish, K. Subbaraj, A survey of direct time-integration methods in computational structural dynamics, Comput. Struct. 32 (6) (1989) 1371-1386]. A single step implicit time integration scheme is used for the computation [M.A. Dokainish, K. Subbaraj, A survey of direct time-integration methods in computational structural dynamics, Comput. Struct. 32 (6) (1989) 1371-1386]. After recalling the classical expressions for the radiative flux divergence (5) and the flux itself (6), we have rewritten the radiative source term for an homogeneous medium as a function of spectral intensity (7) and given the integro-differential equation of radiative transfer [R. Siegel, J.R. Howel, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, Washington, 1992], Eq. (8). The spectral relations linking coefficients of extinction, absorption, scattering and scattering albedo are given by Eqs. (9) and (10), while Eq. (11) expresses the boundary conditions. In the second place, on the basis of the non-scattering behaviour of amorphous PET [K. Esser, E. Haberstroh, U. Hüsgen, D. Weinand, Infrared radiation in the processing of plastics: Precise adjustment-the key to productivity, Adv. Polymer Technol. 7 (2) (1987) 89-128; M.D. Shelby, Effects of infrared lamp temperature and other variables on the reheat rate of PET, in: Proceedings of ANTEC'91 Conference, 1991, pp. 1420-1424; G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249], we have assumed that extinction and absorption coefficients are equal, the corresponding albedo being zero. The radiative transfer equation can thus be rewritten in a reduced form (12). Moreover, for the temperature range prevailing in the processes of PET thermoforming and preforms blowing, temperatures of radiation sources are generally much higher than those used for the forming of these thermoplastic media. Under these conditions, the cold medium hypothesis is used [Y. Le Maoult, F.M. Schmidt, V. Laborde, M. El Hafi, P. Lebaudy, Measurement and calculation of perform infrared heating: a first approach, in: Proceeedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Advanced Infrared, 1997, pp. 321-331], which allows to express transmission of spectral intensity across the material as a function of position and direction (13), and to write the radiative flux divergence in a simplified form as well (14). For one-dimensional radiation, solution of the radiative transfer equation [R. Siegel, J.R. Howel, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, Washington, 1992] is given by Eq. (15), which combines with Eq. (14) to yield the spectral flux generated inside the semi-transparent medium, Eq. (16). In case of radiation propagation in the same direction as the normal to the polymeric membrane surface, radiation intensity can then be expressed by the Beer-Lambert law (17). This permits to deduce the expression of spectral flux transmitted across the PET membrane thickness (18). Infrared radiation intercepted by the membrane. For determining the infrared radiation intercepted by the membrane surface, the medium between the radiation source and the thermoplastic material is assumed to be completely transparent to radiation. It is also assumed that the surface of the source is diffuse. This allows to infer, from spectral expressions of the energy emitted by the source (Eqs. (19) and (20)) and of the energy received by the semi-transparent membrane (Eq. (21)), a relation for radiation intercepted by the surface at all wavelengths (Eqs. (22) and (23)). For an isotropically radiating source (Lambertian source) when considering an average emissivity of the heating source, Eq. (24), total radiation intercepted by the surface is given by Eq. (25). Infrared radiation absorbed by the membrane. For the determination of infrared radiation absorbed by the polymeric membrane, first, based on the principle of energy conservation, spectral relation (27) which links reflectivity, absorptivity and transmissivity is recalled, as well as relation (28) associating spectral absorption and transmission coefficients following the Beer-Lambert law. Consequently, this allows to find the spectral energy absorbed by the semi-transparent medium (29) with the aid of Eq. (25). Concentrating on wavelength bands that constitute the transmission spectrum of the medium, Eq. (29) is then replaced by Eq. (30) where average values of reflectivity (31) and transmissivity (32) are considered. As a result, the volumetric total energy absorbed by the medium, the flux divergence, is then given by Eqs. (33) and (34). Furthermore, considering that reflectivity is low for polymeric materials (generally lower than 5%), the latter is neglected leading to Eq. (35) instead of Eq. (34). Fig. 1 illustrates a typical transmissivity curve for PET [G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249]. Shape factor. In order to take into account arbitrary shapes of sources and preforms, a semi-analytical approach is used for the computation of shape factors [G. Venkateswaran, M.R. Cameron, S.A. Jabarin, Effect of temperature profiles trough preform thickness on the properties of reheat-blown PET containers, Adv. Polymer Technol. 17 (3) (1997) 237-249]. The definition of shape factor is recalled in Eq. (36) and Fig. 2. An equivalent form based on the contour principle [R. Rammohan, Efficient evaluation of diffuse view factors for radiation, Int. J. Heat Mass Transfer. 39 (1996) 1281-1286] is given by Eq. (37), while the semi-analytical formula [F. Erchiqui, N.G. Dituba, Analyse comparative des méthodes de calcul des facteurs de formes pour des surfaces à contours rectilignes, Internat. J. Thermal Sci. 46 (2007) 284-293] is expressed by Eq. (39). Validation of this semi-analytical approach is obtained by comparison with the analytical solution [H.C. Hottel, Radiant heat transmission between surfaces separated by non-absorbing media, Trans. ASME 53 (1931) 265-273, FSP-53-196; A. Feingold, Radiant-interchange configuration factors between various selected plane surfaces, Proc. Roy. Soc. London Ser. A 292 (1996) 51-60; J.R. Ehlert, T.F. Smith, View factors for perpendicular and parallel rectangular plates, J. Thermophys. Heat Trans. 7 (1993) 173-174] as well as with results yielded by three different techniques, i.e. the area-integration method, the Gauss quadratic technique and the contour method. Table 1 summarizes the numerical results obtained in each case and gives the relative error. Analytical validation of the reheating. Regarding the numerical validation, we have considered a PET semi infinite medium subjected to a uniform incident radiative flux density. The boundaries of the semi transparent medium are taken as adiabatic. Thermophysical properties and geometrics are given in Table 2. The one-dimensional Laplace equation which governs the radiation heat transfer is solved analytically with the aid of Laplace transforms. The temperature evolution within the depth of the semi transparent medium is obtained by analytical solution [A.B. De Vriendt, in: G. Morin, (Ed.), La transmission de la chaleur, vol. 1, Chicoutimi, Québec, 1984], Eq. (40). Fig. 3 shows a comparison between the numerical solution obtained by the 3D finite elements method and the analytical one. It is seen that, for the three cases, the relative error between numerical and analytical results stays lower than 0.1%. Numerical modeling of infrared heating. An amorphous PET sheet is considered. The face of the membrane is a square of side 20 cm with a thickness of 1.5 mm. The lateral walls are assumed adiabatic. For modeling with the 3D finite elements method, the sheet is meshed with identical hexahedra comprising eight nodes. The thermophysical properties used for this study are given in [S. Monteix, F. Schmidt, Y. Le Maoult, R Ben Yedder, R.W. Diraddo, D. Laroche, Experimental study and numerical simulation of perform or sheet exposed to infrared radiative heating, Journal of Materials Processing Technology 119 (2001) 90-97] and the reheating time is 35 seconds. The heat transfer coefficient h on front and rear faces is 10 W m-2 K-1. Heat flux received by the polymer during heating. To estimate the incident heat flux distribution on the surface of the polymer, we first calculate the shape factors between each pair of emitting/receiving surfaces. Then the flux distribution is obtained with Eq. (25). Fig. 4 illustrates this distribution. Validation against experimental results.

AB  - EOLE is a hydrodynamic thermal model (one-dimensional vertical model) which simulates the evolution of the seasonal thermal stratification of a reservoir. It is a model based on representation of individual physical mechanisms, which takes into account the bathymetry of the reservoir, surface energy exchanges, and throughflow in the reservoir (rivers, pumping, turbining, residual stream flow, etc.). EOLE was applied to two reservoirs with extremely different characteristics: Pareloup Lake, a hydroelectric reservoir with a long residence time (1 year), and Rochebut, a reservoir, with a short residence time (1 month). The good agreement between the calculated and measured thermal profiles in both cases indicates that the model enables very good reproduction of the thermal stratification in each reservoir, the vertical dynamics of water masses, the thermal regime of water restituted downstream, and year-to-year fluctuations over extended periods (12 consecutive 1 year cycles for Pareloup). The model was applied using the same set of coefficients in both studies, demonstrating that the predominant hydrodynamic phenomena in both reservoirs are well taken into account, providing the input data are sufficiently representative of the site under study. The precision of the results obtained and the relative simplicity of the EOLE representation have enabled us to use the model as a basic structure for modeling of an ecosystem.

AB  - The behavioral and physiological thermoregulation of three Atacama desert-dwelling Liolaemus lizards was studied and compared with previous data on Liolaemus from other ecosystems. The thermoregulatory mechanisms of the desert-dwelling species differed from those of the others, a consequence of differences in the habitat structure of the species. Desert species have higher critical thermal minima and, contrary to expectations, lower selected body temperatures than Liolaemus from Mediterranean environments. Results of the rate,, of thermal time constants suggest mechanisms to cope with the fast decrease of environmental temperature that occurs in the desert during the mid-afternoons. Finally, the manner in which selection of low body temperatures may allow survival in desert conditions is discussed. Keywords: thermal time constants, operative temperature, physiological and behavioral thermoregulation.

VL  - 33

SP  - 277-307
AB  - 1. 1. The bristles on the ventral side of the fourth and fifth abdominal segments and the sternopleural chaetae were counted on 4 wild type populations of Drosophila melanogaster. 2. 2. From one of these populations 10 inbreeding lines were derived by brother-sister mating, and bristle counts were undertaken during the first 20 generations. After the 60th generation of inbreeding the counts were taken up again on 5 remaining lines. 3. 3. Crosses were made between the inbred lines and bristles were counted on the F1, F2, and F3 offspring. 4. 4. Differences were found between the bristle means of the wild type populations except for female abdominal bristles. Between the inbred lines there were great differences in means. The F1 crosses showed some heterosis for bristle numbers, and significant differences between reciprocal crosses were found for males. It is suggested that these differences are due to genes in the Y chromosome. A cytoplasmic effect on bristle number was found in one of the lines. It is shown that temperature and crowding affect the bristle number. 5. 5. To be able to compare the variation of populations with different means the logarithmic transformation was used. Variation was compared in analysis of variance using the logarithmic values of the variances. 6. 6. Variation shows no difference between the original strains except for female sternopleurals. Ordinary laboratory breeding does not influence the variation up to at least 50 generations. 7. 7. Inbreeding in most cases reduces the variation after a slight increase during the first five generations. After about 10 generations the variation is stabilized a little under the values of the original strains. 8. 8. The amount of variation in the inbred lines seems to depend on their genotype. There is a significant heterogeneity of intraculture variation between the lines except for female sternopleurals. Some of the lines show a variation in abdominal bristle number much higher than that found for the original strains. 9. 9. Selection experiments undertaken with one of the inbred lines showed that no differences in sternopleural means could be obtained after 20 generations of inbreeding. As regards abdominal bristles, one line, inbred for 64 generations, with abnormally high variation of these bristles, could be separated in a high and a low line with significantly different means after one single generation of selection and these lines could be reverted after one generation of counter selection. It is inferred that genetical heterogeneity does not account for the high abdominal bristle variation, but some genetical factor in cooperation with environmental influences during egg stage. 10. 10. Variation within cultures is lowest in the F1 offspring from crosses between the inbred lines. There are no differences in variation between the line combinations. Males are more variable than females and sternopleurals more than abdominal bristles. 11. 11. Variation within cultures increases in F2 and F3 after the crosses, especially for the abdominal bristles. Differences in variation are obtained between the line combinations, due to diverse degree of genetical concordance between the parentall lines of the crosses. 12. 12. It is concluded that the partners in a gene pair can establish a cooperation that results in a better resistance against environmental influences. This cooperation is less effective in homozygotes than in heterozygotes where the partners are not identical. The unpaired genes in the X-Y pair of the heterogametic sex makes the variation due to environmental causes greater in this sex than in the homogametic one. This is correlated with Fabergé's observation that tetraploids are less variable than diploids. © 1952.

TI  - On convective style and vigor in sheet-like magma chambers
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 479-530
AB  - The well known absence of magrnatic superheat is held here to be a direct reflection of the ease and efficiency of large Rayleigh number (Ra) convection in evacuating all convectable heat from the magma. Magmatic temperature is thus continually buffered at or below the convective liquidus where the temperature difference driving convection is vanishingly small and the governing Ra is also always small regardless of body size. It is further held here that for bodies where side wall cooling is of lesser importance, the more common perception of magma chambers is of cooling from above and below where both the initial, isothermal (i.e. isodensity), and final (solid) states are dynamically stable and that convection is necessarily a transient process connecting these states. Extensive theoretical and experimental studies of cooling from above show that regardless of boundary conditions transient, small Ra convection is independent of layer thickness. Instead, convection is driven by formation of a thin, cool, and dense sublayer along the top boundary, and the characteristic length scale of the governing Rayleigh number, which is time-dependent, is the sublayer thickness (d&lt;&lt;L). All dynamic features of the flow, including heat transfer rely on this length scale and not body thickness; virtually any sheet-like magmatic body appears infinitely thick to such convection. Because Ra is small, this transient stage persists for most, if not all, of the period of solidification to mush, whence the body is dynamically dead.Under conditions of strongly variable viscosity, only the leading part of d (i.e. d'), forward of a critical rheological front, is unstable. Convection itself is restricted to a region where viscosity changes by no more than a factor of about 3 to 10. Most of the cool, dense sublayer is rigid, immobile crust, unable to participate in convection and cool the body. Rapid advance of this crust due to cooling inhibits convection by consuming instabilities before maturation to finite amplitude. Inclusion of solidification in the stability analysis changes the length scale in the governing Rayleigh number (Rav) to K/V (thermal diffusivity/advance velocity). Ra is subcritical for large V0 (early times) and only with time becomes supcrcritical. This is in striking contrast to the usual RaL, which is initially the largest it will ever be. Because of continual collapse of the unstable sublayer, convection may remain near the critical Rav. Convection is thus initially weak and, because the heat flux from the system monotonically decreases with time due to the thickening conductive crust and cooling, it is prevented from becoming indefinitely strong and instead slowly diminishes with time.Conduction through the advancing crust is balanced by latent heat of crystallization at the crystallization front and convection occurs in response to this cooling. Because convection is confined to the nearly isoviscous, nonsuperheated magma, crust growth is unaffected by convection, even when it is artificially forced at unnatural rates. The crusts of Hawaiian lava lakes reflect this in growing at the same rate regardless of lake thickness and, in numerical convective modeling, imposed Rayleigh number. Overall cooling is well approximated by that of a stagnant, purely conducting layer whose central temperature is constant until arrival of the slowly moving cooling front In fact, the rate of change of a body's central temperature is a direct measure of the total rate of heat transfer (i.e. Nusselt number, Nu) from that region. This is shown to be very nearly zero for Hawaiian lava lakes, precluding all but the weakest of convective heat transfer within the magma itself.The maximum heat transfer in terms of Nusselt number of any unheated body within a conductive medium and always kept perfectly well mixed thermally, relative to the same stagnant body, is shown to be Nu=2 regardless of shape and size. This thermal evolution is closely followed by previous calculations that assume a large Rayleigh number based on layer thickness.Thermal convection in unheated, sheetlike magma chambers is a transient, sluggish process governed by solidification and small scale, small Rayleigh number instabilities; thermally driven convective turbulence, in the usual sense, is out of the question. © 1989 Oxford University Press.

AB  - India, in contrast to two other oxides of group IIIA metals (alumina and gallia), is active for dehydrogenation as well as dehydration. Furthermore, india is selective for the formation of 1-alkenes from 2-ols. Neither the alkene selectivity nor the dehydrogenation-dehydration selectivity changed uniformly as one progressed through the group IIIA metal oxide catalysts. Primary and secondary alcohols reduced indium oxide to an undetermined oxide composition at the reaction temperatures. The dehydrogenation-dehydration selectivity depended on the degree of reduction of the catalyst. © 1978 Academic Press, Inc. All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

TI  - Diversifying selection and host adaptation in two endosymbiont genomes
VL  - 7
AB  - Background. The endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis infects a broad range of arthropod and filarial nematode hosts. These diverse associations form an attractive model for understanding host:symbiont coevolution. Wolbachia's ubiquity and ability to dramatically alter host reproductive biology also form the foundation of research strategies aimed at controlling insect pests and vector-borne disease. The Wolbachia strains that infect nematodes are phylogenetically distinct, strictly vertically transmitted, and required by their hosts for growth and reproduction. Insects in contrast form more fluid associations with Wolbachia. In these taxa, host populations are most often polymorphic for infection, horizontal transmission occurs between distantly related hosts, and direct fitness effects on hosts are mild. Despite extensive interest in the Wolbachia system for many years, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate its varied interactions with different hosts. We have compared the genomes of the Wolbachia that infect Drosophila melanogaster, wMel and the nematode Brugia malayi, wBm to that of an outgroup Anaplasma marginale to identify genes that have experienced diversifying selection in the Wolbachia lineages. The goal of the study was to identify likely molecular mechanisms of the symbiosis and to understand the nature of the diverse association across different hosts. Results. The prevalence of selection was far greater in wMel than wBm. Genes contributing to DNA metabolism, cofactor biosynthesis, and secretion were positively selected in both lineages. In wMel there was a greater emphasis on DNA repair, cell division, protein stability, and cell envelope synthesis. Conclusion. Secretion pathways and outer surface protein encoding genes are highly affected by selection in keeping with host:parasite theory. If evidence of selection on various cofactor molecules reflects possible provisioning, then both insect as well as nematode Wolbachia may be providing substances to hosts. Selection on cell envelope synthesis, DNA replication and repair machinery, heat shock, and two component switching suggest strategies insect Wolbachia may employ to cope with diverse host and intra-host environments. © 2007 Brownlie et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Thermal tolerance was studied in a rainbow trout strain successively selected through high temperature breeding at 20-2 degrees C since 1966 in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The hatching rate and fry mortality at high temperatures were examined in the selected strain along with normal strains cultured at water temperature of 9-17 degrees C. The hatching rate of embryos fertilized at either 10 or 14 C and subsequently subjected to high temperatures in the blastula or neurula stage of the selected strain, was marginally higher than that of the normal strain counterparts. The upper 50% lethal temperatures (LT50) for embryos in the early segmentation, blastula and neurula stages of the selected strain were also higher than those of the normal strain counterparts. Death temperatures and LT50 of fries acclimated to 20 degrees C of the selected strain were significantly higher than those of the normal strains. However, no difference in the critical thermal maximum was detected between the different strains. These results suggest that the selected strain of rainbow trout established by selecting successively for many generations at high temperatures acquired a degree of thermal tolerance.

TI  - Temperature-related physiological adaptations promote ecological divergence in a sympatric species pair of temperate freshwater fish, Coregonus spp
VL  - 22

AB  - 1. Understanding the ecological forces that are responsible for the evolution and coexistence of closely related sympatric species is a major interest in evolutionary ecology. In a freshwater system context, flocks or pairs of sympatrically occurring fishes are commonly studied to identify causes and mechanisms of ecological divergence and speciation. 2. Whereas habitat and diet segregation along the pelagic-benthic axis is frequent in many species pairs in temperate freshwaters, two pelagic planktivores coexist in the post-glacial Lake Stechlin, Germany (common vendace, Coregonus albula and the endemic Fontane cisco, C. fontanae). Accordingly, disruptive selection on traits not related to feeding may have contributed to divergence. Since both species differ slightly in their vertical distribution, species-specific physiological adaptations related to temperature are likely. 3. We investigated standard and active metabolic rates (AMR) over the range of environmental temperature, which both species experience naturally (4-15 degrees C). Eighty-four specimens of 7-22 cm length were exposed to five relative flow velocities between 0.5 and 2.0 body lengths per second (BL s(-1)) in swim tunnel respirometers. 4. Fontane cisco showed a reduced standard metabolic rate (SMR) compared to vendace over the entire temperature range. Further, activity metabolism was associated with lower energetic costs in Fontane cisco at 4 degrees C, but higher costs than in vendace at 8 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Total metabolic costs when swimming at 2 BL s(-1) were higher for vendace at < 8 degrees C, but higher for Fontane cisco if temperature exceeds 8 degrees C. 5. The results indicate that species-specific physiological adaptations contribute to ecological divergence, thus preventing competitive exclusion between the pelagic coregonids of Lake Stechlin. The existence of a vertical gradient in water temperature was probably a crucial factor for the evolution of both competing temperature-related physiological strategies.

TI  - Survival of Salmonella spp. on the surfaces of fresh tomatoes and selected packing line materials
VL  - 15
IS  - 4
SP  - 831-836
AB  - Multi-state outbreaks of salmonellosis due to the consumption of contaminated fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) have recently occurred in the United States. This study investigated the survival of a five-serovar (serotype) Salmonella cocktail artificially inoculated onto tomato and packing line surfaces when held at various temperature and relative humidity (RH) combinations over 28 days. Packinghouse surfaces included stainless steel, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), sponge rollers, conveyor belts, and unfinished oak wood surfaces. Packinghouse climates were generated to simulate conditions in Florida during late spring (30 degrees C/80% RH) and fall/winter (20 degrees C/60% RH) months. Additionally, survival of Salmonella on tomatoes in standard ripening room conditions (20 degrees C/90% RH) was evaluated. Recovery of inocula was by a vigorous shake/hand rub method. After 28 days, Salmonella populations remained detectable on tomato surfaces regardless of environmental conditions. Inoculated Salmonella populations tested at spring conditions declined to undetectable levels on all packing line materials by day 11, with the exception of the unfinished oak, which reached undetectable levels by day 21. In contrast, inoculated Salmonella populations tested at fall/winter conditions declined to undetectable levels on sponge rollers and conveyor belts by day 7 and day 21, respectively. Stainless steel, PVC, and wood surfaces supported the survival of detectable populations of Salmonella over the 28-day sampling period. 1 Results of this study demonstrate the potential for Salmonella to persist on tomato and packing line surfaces under common environmental conditions.

AB  - Although exposure to environmental stress is common in most populations, and the physiological effects of stress on individuals are well studied, the evolutionary importance of stress to populations is not well understood. To address multitrait responses to environmental change and potential constraints on character evolution, we analysed, in 100 isofemale lines of Drosophila buzzatii, the genetic relationships between resistance to a short heat shock and several life-history traits: survival in benign conditions, larval developmental time, fecundity and longevity. Estimates of heritability of larval thermotolerance were low, but significant, and all life-history traits varied significantly among isofemale lines. Several of these traits covaried significantly. Most correlations indicated positive life-history relationships, but males and females from lines where female fecundity was higher developed more slowly in the absence of stress, which is a negative life-history relationship. The stress reduced or negated many trait associations, and showed one additional relationship; more larvae from lines that developed fast at 25 degrees C survived to adult after stress than did larvae from slow developing lines. These shifts in fitness relationships, when a single stress bout is applied, suggest that even small increases in environmental stress can have profound effects on evolutionary relationships among life-history traits.

TI  - Melanic body colour and aggressive mating behaviour are correlated traits in male mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki)
VL  - 270
IS  - 1519
SP  - 1033-1040
AB  - Correlated traits are important from an evolutionary perspective as natural selection acting on one trait may indirectly affect other traits. Further, the response to selection can be constrained or hastened as a result of correlations. Because mating behaviour and body colour can dramatically affect fitness, a correlation between them can have important fitness ramifications. In this work, melanic (black) male mosquitofishes (Gambusia holbrooki) with temperature-sensitive body-colour expression are bred in captivity. Half of the sons of each melanic sire are reared at 19 degreesC (and express a black body colour) and half are reared at 31 degreesC (and express a silver body colour). The two colour morphs are placed in the same social setting and monitored for behavioural differences. Mating behaviour and colour are correlated traits. Mating behaviour differs markedly between the two phenotypes, despite high genetic relatedness. Melanic (black) phenotypes are more aggressive towards females, chasing them and attempting more matings than their silver siblings. Females avoid melanic-male mating attempts more than silver-male mating attempts. When males with temperature-sensitive colour expression are melanic and aggressive, they probably experience a very different selective regime in nature from when they are silver and less aggressive. Under some conditions (e.g. predation), melanic coloration and/or aggression is advantageous compared with silver coloration and/or less aggressive behaviour. However, under different conditions (e.g. high-frequency melanism), melanism and/or aggression appears to be disadvantageous and melanic males have reduced survival and reproduction. Selective advantages to each morph under different conditions may enable the long-term persistence of this temperature-sensitive genotype.

VL  - 18
IS  - 4
SP  - 884-892
AB  - Maternal effects on progeny wing size and shape in a homozygous parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum were investigated. The impact of external maternal factors (heat stress) and the impact of internal maternal factors (different maternal and grand maternal age) were studied. The offspring developed under identical environmental conditions, and due to lack of genetic variation any phenotypic difference among offspring could be ascribed to maternal effects. Wing size was estimated by centroid size, shape was analysed with the Procrustes geometric morphometric method and variation in landmark displacement was visualized by principal component analysis. Both kinds of maternal effects had a significant impact on progeny wing size and shape. Maternal heat stress led to the same pattern of response in size and shape among the progeny, with increased difference between the control group and progeny from heat stressed flies in both size and shape with increased maternal heat stress temperature. The effects of maternal age, however, led to different responses in size and shape between the different progeny groups. The observed variation in landmark displacements was similar, and in both cases mainly associated with shape differences of the posterior part oi the wing. Finally, our results suggest that maternal effect has some evolutionary implications by altering the genetic correlations among traits, which can affect the response to selective pressures. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - We explored the ecological conditions, which influence the female Melolontha hippocastani F. in their selection of the locality for laying eggs. In the region of mass outbreak of M. hippocastani in the south-eastern part of the Czech Republic in selected experimental sample plots including 1 to 8 year-old forest plantations we explored the extent of losses caused by white grub feeding and the relation between the extent of the damage and the individual characteristics of the experimental plots. The relation between the extent of the damage and the method of establishment of the stands and degree of weed infestation at the time of swarming was evaluated statistically. The daily temperatures at the time of M. hippocastani swarming were recorded by means of automatic meteorological stations. A light trap was used to monitor the course of swarming.

TI  - Local adaptation in brown trout early life-history traits: Implications for climate change adaptability
VL  - 275
IS  - 1653
SP  - 2859-2868
AB  - Knowledge of local adaptation and adaptive potential of natural populations is becoming increasingly relevant due to anthropogenic changes in the environment, such as climate change. The concern is that populations will be negatively affected by increasing temperatures without the capacity to adapt. Temperature-related adaptability in traits related to phenology and early life history are expected to be particularly important in salmonid fishes. We focused on the latter and investigated whether four populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are locally adapted in early life-history traits. These populations spawn in rivers that experience different temperature conditions during the time of incubation of eggs and embryos. They were reared in a common-garden experiment at three different temperatures. Quantitative genetic differentiation (QST) exceeded neutral molecular differentiation (FST) for two traits, indicating local adaptation. A temperature effect was observed for three traits. However, this effect varied among populations due to locally adapted reaction norms, corresponding to the temperature regimes experienced by the populations in their native environments. Additive genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity suggest that although increasing temperatures are likely to affect some populations negatively, they may have the potential to adapt to changing temperature regimes. © 2008 The Royal Society.

TI  - Plasticity in butterfly egg size: Why larger offspring at lower temperatures?
VL  - 84
IS  - 12
SP  - 3138-3147
AB  - Dividing sister pairs of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana (reared in a common environment) between high and low temperature shows that oviposition temperature induces a plastic response in egg size. Females at a lower temperature laid significantly larger (but fewer) eggs than their sisters kept at a higher temperature, whereas total reproductive investment increased with temperature. Cross-transfer experiments demonstrated that this plastic response in egg size is reversible. Interestingly, this pattern parallels an almost universal temperature-induced developmental response in ectotherm body size. In both cases, however, we do not yet understand the underlying mechanisms or the potential adaptive significance. By cross-transferring the experimentally manipulated eggs between temperatures, we showed that the larger eggs produced at a lower temperature had a higher hatching success, and yielded larger hatchlings with a slightly higher probability of reaching maturity and shorter larval development time (at the lower temperature) compared to the smaller eggs produced at a higher temperature. Overall, the lower temperature was slightly more detrimental for smaller than for larger eggs. The slight differences in survival across temperatures, together with more substantial differences in fecundity, indicate that it could pay off to produce fewer but larger offspring (with increased fitness) at a lower temperature, but more and smaller offspring at a higher temperature where offspring survival was generally high. Our data present for the first time evidence that selection may favor larger eggs at a lower temperature, and thus that a. plastic response. of egg size to temperature in ectotherms could be adaptive.

AB  - The variation of the magnetoelastic resonance frequency as a function of the temperature is investigated for sensing purposes in two samples with different properties. It is observed that maximum sensitivity is reached when biasing the sample close to the anisotropy field. A compensation field is also found at which the resonance frequency is insensitive to temperature changes. It is demonstrated that the observed behavior is determined mainly by the temperature dependence of the anisotropy constants of the samples. The results suggest the viability of remote temperature monitoring even trough opaque barriers. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ANN is used to make the relationship between corrosion rate and the effect factors for general corrosion. Fitness - For - Service models are used to analyze the local corrosion. Based on the ANN and Fitness - For - Servic models, ESFFSR can make suggestions for lower temperature and pressure if the defect is incompetent automatically. In addition, ESFFSR would give out the corrosion type, mechanism, characteristics and effect factors on line in petrochemical. The selected material of commended tables to anti - corrosion for distillation, catalysis and coking equipment were also given in ESFFSR.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 321-338
AB  - In oviparous species that lack parental care, fitness of the mother depends on the selection of a high-quality nest site, as mothers do not compensate for poor incubation environment post-hatching. Near the northern range limit of Glyptemys insculpta (Wood Turtle), short summers and cool temperatures may be factors that limit population persistence because potential nest sites may not provide adequate conditions for successful egg incubation in some years. We quantified nest-site selection by examining soil temperature and substrate composition of real Wood Turtle nests (n = 5) and constructed false nests. False nests comprised two treatments: negative-test false nests (n = 5) constructed on beaches not used by females, and positive-test false nests (n = 5) constructed on beaches used by females but in microsites not chosen by females. Temperature was measured as total thermal units and mean temperature during the diel cycle. Soil composition was quantified using moisture content, organic content, and grain-size distribution. Soil temperature was the most important factor in nest-site selection. Temperatures and total thermal units were significantly higher and more variable in real nests than in false nests, except during the night. Soil composition was not significantly different among treatments. Grain sizes ranged from fine to gravel, and real nests contained mainly (58% to 96%) medium sand or larger grains. There was little variation in soil moisture among real nests, suggesting that females were choosing specific humidity conditions for nesting. Our findings can be directly applied to protecting nesting beaches for Wood Turtles, which are considered a species at risk.

Both orange-coloured and melanistic in situ embryos were present in pregnant females, showing that colour polymorphism is not the result of ontogenetic changes induced by environmental conditions, but rather has a genetic basis. The presence of orange-coloured embryos in melanistic females and vice-versa shows that breeding in these two colour morphs is not isolated. The functional significance of colour polymorphism in M. litoralis remains unclear, but intraspecific communication or background colour matching as possible selective advantages of melanism are ruled out. Microacontias litoralis is endemic to the west coast of South Africa where there is in general a high incidence of melanistic lizard species and populations associated with zones of upwelling of cold water in the Atlantic Ocean. That the melanistic morph may represent past or present selection for thermal melanism can not be ruled out and further investigation is required. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Temperature‐related divergence in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster. III. Fourier and centroid analysis of wing shape and relationship between shape variation and fitness
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-159
AB  - From a laboratory stock of Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon), reared for more than 20 years at 18°C, two new populations were derived and maintained at 25° and 28°C for 8 years. The chromosomal and cytoplasmic contribution to genetic divergence between the two more extreme populations was estimated at 18°C and 28°C. Wing shape and two fitness components (fecundity and fertility) were taken into account. Fourier descriptors and the position of the centroid were taken as indicators either of wing shape variation, determined by a different response of the two wing compartments to temperature selection, or of wing shape variation determined by both compartments. The descriptors appear to be good characters: they show a variability which is genetically controlled and ascribable to genes located on specific chromosomes. The third chromosome is responsible for the adaptive difference to temperature. The genes which control wing shape are located on the second and third chromosome, although the contribution of each chromosome depends on the environment in which the flies develop. Cytoplasmic genes display an effect as large as that of chromosomes, and nucleus × cytoplasm interaction is present. The correlation between the genetic contributions to compartment‐dependent wing shape variation and the contributions to fitness is highly significant, especially at 28°C. Wing shape has, therefore, an adaptive significance in relation to temperature, which is particularly expressed in the environment where selection occurred. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

VL  - 32

SP  - 287-293
AB  - Tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae) are said to have strong dispersal tendencies. Gene flow among these populations is estimated to be the theoretical equivalent of no more than one or two reproducing flies per generation, thereby raising the hypothesis of local regimes of natural selection. Flies were sampled from four environmentally diverse locations in Kenya to determine whether populations are homogeneous in desiccation tolerance and cuticular lipids. Cuticular hydrocarbon fractions known to act as sex pheromones do not differ among populations, thereby eliminating sexual selection as an isolating mechanism. Cuticular lipid quantities vary among populations and are not correlated with prevailing temperatures, humidities, and normalized density vegetation indices. Females demonstrate a stronger correlation than males between cuticular lipid mass and body weight. Desiccation rates also vary among populations, but are not correlated with the amounts of cuticular lipid. Chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy shows that one of the four populations has more 11,15- and 11,21-dimethyl-31 hydrocarbon on females. These results are discussed in the context of population differences and estimates of gene flow. © 2007 The Royal Entomological Society.

After touching upon the metallography of the high temperature materials, he singles out the reformer as the topic of discussion. Apart from metals, ceramic materials like silicon ca%rbide (Si//4C) are being tried for reformer tubes. The reforming of naphtha with steam has become the most viable route to the synthesis of ammonia. As a sequel to the development in the process, the economics in the production of fertilizers have undergone a revolutionary change. Further improvements are possible with higher pressure operation of the reformer.

VL  - 73
IS  - 2
SP  - 200-208
AB  - Marine intertidal organisms are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses, including aerial exposure and wide ranges of temperature. Intertidal species generally have higher thermal tolerance limits than do subtidal species, and tropical species have higher thermal tolerance limits than do temperate species. The adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limits of intertidal organisms, however, has not been examined within a comparative context. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the adaptive significance of upper thermal tolerance limits in 20 congeneric species of porcelain crabs, genus Petrolisthes, from intertidal and subtidal habitats throughout the eastern Pacific. Upper thermal tolerance limits are positively correlated with surface water temperatures and with maximal microhabitat temperatures. Analysis of phylogenetically independent contrasts (from a phylogenetic tree on the basis of the 16s rDNA gene sequence) suggests that upper thermal tolerance limits have evolved in response to maximal microhabitat temperatures. Upper thermal tolerance limits increased during thermal acclimation at elevated temperatures, the amount of increase being greater for subtidal than for intertidal species. This result suggests that the upper thermal tolerance limits of some intertidal species may be near current habitat temperature maxima, and global warming thus may affect the distribution limits of intertidal species to a greater extent than for subtidal species.

TI  - Physiological responses to freezing in hatchlings of freeze-tolerant and -intolerant turtles
VL  - 176
IS  - 7
SP  - 697-707
AB  - Freeze tolerance is a complex cold-hardiness adaptation that has independently evolved in a diverse group of organisms, including several ectothermic vertebrates. Because little is known about the mechanistic basis for freeze tolerance in reptiles, we compared responses to experimental freezing in winter-acclimatized hatchlings representing nine taxa of temperate North American turtles, including ones that tolerated freezing and others that did not. Viability rates of hatchlings frozen to -3°C for 72 h ranged from 0 to 100%. Tolerance to freezing was poor in Sternotherus odoratus, Graptemys geographica and Trachemys scripta, intermediate in Chelydra serpentina, and high in Emydoidea blandingii, Chrysemys picta bellii, C. p. marginata, Malaclemys terrapin, and Terrapene ornata, and generally reflected the winter thermal ecology of each taxon. Plasma activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a novel in vivo index of freeze/thaw damage, corroborated viability assessments and demonstrated that cryoinjury occurred even in surviving turtles. Irrespective of taxon, cryoinjury tended to be higher in smaller individuals and in those having relatively low water contents; however, bases for these associations were not apparent. Screening for certain organic osmolytes that might promote freezing survival by colligatively reducing ice content and limiting cell dehydration showed that the plasma of unfrozen (control) turtles contained small quantities of glucose (1.3-5.8 mmol l-1) and lactate (0.6-3.2 mmol l-1) and modest amounts of urea (range of mean values for all taxa 8.2-52.3 mmol l-1). Frozen/thawed turtles of all taxa accumulated modest amounts of glucose and lactate that jointly raised the plasma solute concentration by 30-100 mmol l-1. We conclude that organic osmolytes accumulated both before and during freezing may promote survival in species that have evolved a tolerance to freezing, but are not necessarily accumulated for that purpose. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

AB  - Moths from the S Saskatchewan River valley laid significantly more eggs over a longer period than those from the surrounding plains. The upper threshold for oviposition was higher (27oC) for valley than for plains borers (25oC). Optimum temperatures for egg viability were also higher for valley (25-27oC) than for plains borers (22oC). Fluctuating temperatures increased survival of both sexes compared with equivalent constant temperatures. Differences in male and female longevity likely arose in response to selection for different reproductive strategies in each sex. Long-lived individuals achieved high fecundity by reproducing at a low rate over many age-classes, while short-lived individuals reproduced at a high rate over few age-classes, with less total fecundity.-from Authors

VL  - 99

SP  - 1085-1100
AB  - Diapause in the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), remains a contentious issue despite intense investigation. In particular, the roles and interactions of photoperiod, temperature, and adult diet are poorly understood. We reexamined the influences of these factors by using a feeding regime typical of previous studies (group, one square per five weevils per day) as well as one known to promote reproductive development (single, one square per weevil per day). Three separate studies each incorporated all combinations of the following: photoperiod (short day, 11: 13; long day 13:11 [L:D] h), temperature regime (constant 29.4 degrees C; warm day, cool night, 29.4 degrees C:10 degrees C [day:night]), feeding regime, and age at dissection (3, 6, 9, and 12 d after adult eclosion). Studies differed in the source of weevils (Lower Rio Grande Valley, Brazos Valley of Texas), and the photoperiod used to rear weevils to adulthood (11:13 or 13:11 [L:D] h). Interpretable effects of photoperiod on diapause induction were not observed. Cool nights delayed development of fat bodies, oocytes with yolk, and the occurrence of diapause, especially in weevils fed in groups. However, these effects were not apparent by day 12. The most marked responses were to feeding regime. Hypertrophied fat bodies and diapause generally occurred more often, and oocytes with yolk less often, for weevils fed in groups compared with those fed singly. Fundamental differences in diapause response corresponding to rearing conditions or source of weevils were not observed. These results suggest improved understanding of the dynamics of adult diapause could be achieved through continued investigation of the effects of adult diets.

TI  - Juvenile growth response of European beech (fagus sylvatica L.) to sudden change of climatic environment in SE European trials
VL  - 2
SP  - 213-220
AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse provenance tests of beech situated close to the south-eastern continental limits of the species, in order to develop a response model of adaptation and plasticity of populations on evolutionary-ecological basis, following sudden climatic changes, as a result of transplanting. Modelling of juvenile height was performed with the help of ecodistance variables. The concept of transfer analysis and ecodistance is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic response to macroclimatic changes depends on the inherited adaptive potential of the population and on the magnitude and direction of experienced environmental change. In common garden experiments, the transfer to the planting site is interpreted as simulation of environmental change. The application of ecodistance of transfer for evaluating common garden experiments provides much needed quantitative information about response of tree populations to predicted climatic changes. The analysis of three field experiments of European beech in SE Europe indicates that macroclimatic adaptation patterns exist in juvenile growth and justify restrictions of use of reproductive material on the basis of evolutionary ecology. The presented model illustrates that response to climatic change is regionally divergent, depending on testing conditions and on hereditary traits. In particular, climatic warming in the central-northern part of the range may lead to production increase. However, under the stressful and uncertain conditions at the lower (xeric) limit of the species, growth depression and vitality loss are predicted. The deviating behaviour of higher elevation provenances support their separate treatment. The results may be utilised in climate change adaptation and mitigation policy in forestry and nature conservation, to revise rules for use of reproductive material and also for validating evolutionary and ecological hypotheses related to climate change effects. ©iForest - Biogeosciences and Forestry.

TI  - Asymptotic Giant Branch evolution at varying surface C/O ratio: Effects of changes in molecular opacities
VL  - 387
IS  - 2
SP  - 507-519
AB  - We investigate the effects of molecular opacities on the evolution of TP-AGB stars that experience the third dredge-up, i.e. with surface abundances of carbon and oxygen varying with time. To this aim, a routine is constructed to derive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium calculations, and estimate the opacities due to H2, H2O, OH, C2, CN, and CO for any given density, temperature and chemical composition of the gas. Then, synthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either adopting the newly developed routine, or interpolating between fixed opacity tables for solar chemical composition. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the dominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity, crucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a notable cooling of the carbonrich models (with C/O&gt; 1). From the comparison with observational data, it turns out that TP-AGB models with variable molecular opacities are able to reproduce the observed range of effective temperatures, mass-loss rates, and wind expansion velocities of C-type giants in the solar neighbourhood, otherwise failed if assuming fixed molecular opacities for solar-scaled mixtures. Finally, we mention other possibly important evolutionary and observational effects that result from the adoption of the variable opacities, such as: i) significant shortening of the C-star phase due to the earlier onset of the super-wind; ii) consequent reduction of the carbon yields; iii) reproduction of the observed range of near-infrared colours of C-stars.

SP  - 463-472
AB  - At the request of Volkswagen AG, the Institut für Aufbereitung von Rohstoffen und Reststoffen of the Technical University of Clausthal has developed a method by which phosphating slimes may be recycled. Research on the solubility of phosphate slimes shows that after artificial ageing at temperatures >60°C, selective separation of zinc, nickel and manganese can be achieved by leaching with diluted phosphoric acid. This process is able to provide up to 35 percent reagent recycling in a production integrated process. After leaching, the iron phosphate contains no other metal ions. This pure product can then be converted with slags from steel production to form a fertilizer with a quality comparable to that of Thomasmehl. In the case of a centrally located recycling plant, a throughput of 2000 tons per year would be cost effective.

TI  - Morph-associated JH titer diel rhythm in Gryllus firmus: Experimental verification of its circadian basis and cycle characterization in artificially selected lines raised in the field
VL  - 55
IS  - 5
SP  - 450-458
AB  - Previous studies demonstrated a high-amplitude, diel cycle for the hemolymph JH titer in the wing-polymorphic cricket, Gryllus firmus. The JH titer rose and fell in the flight-capable morph (long-winged, LW(f)) above and below the relatively temporally invariant JH titer in the flightless (short-winged, SW) morph. The morph-specific JH titer cycle appeared to be primarily driven by a morph-specific diel cycle in the rate of JH biosynthesis. In the present study, cycles of the JH titer and rate of JH biosynthesis in the LW(f) morph persisted in the laboratory under constant darkness with an approximate 24 h periodicity. The JH titer cycle also shifted in concert with a shift in the onset of the scotophase, was temperature compensated in constant darkness, and became arrhythmic under constant light. These results provide strong support for the circadian basis of the morph-specific diel rhythm of the JH titer and JH biosynthetic rate. Persistence of the JH titer cycle under constant darkness in multiple LW-selected and SW-selected stocks also provides support for the genetic basis of the morph-associated circadian rhythm. The morph-specific JH titer cycle was observed in these stocks raised in the field, in both males and females, in each of 3 years studied. The onset of the cycle in the LW(f) morph, a few hours before sunset, correlated well with the onset of the cycle, a few hours before lights-off, in the laboratory. The morph-specific JH titer cycle is a general feature of G. firmus, under a variety of environmental conditions, and is not an artifact of specific laboratory conditions or specific genetic stocks. It is a powerful experimental model to investigate the mechanisms underlying endocrine circadian rhythms, their evolution, and their impact on life history evolution. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gestation length varies among populations of common geckos on the South Island of New Zealand, from annual reproductive cycles at a relatively warm site at Alexandra to biennial cycles at a cool site at Macraes. We compared the effect of warm and cool thermal regimes on the length and success of gestation between geckos from Macraes and Alexandra. To assess the likelihood of geckos experiencing these temperatures in the wild, we compared the laboratory thermal regimes with data available for field microhabitat temperatures, body temperatures (Tb), and selected temperatures (Tsel) of pregnant females. Temperature had a profound effect on the length and success of pregnancy; geckos from both populations under the cool regime had longer pregnancies that were less successful in producing developed neonates than geckos under the warm regime. Though no viable young were produced under the cool regime, there were qualitative differences in outcome of pregnancies between populations; all geckos from Alexandra (warm site) aborted pregnancies early on, whereas several from Macraes (cool site) produced fully developed embryos after extremely long gestation periods (up to 440 days). Under the warm regime, populations appeared to differ in the rate of embryogenesis and in neonatal growth rate (both in g/day, with individuals from the Macraes population having the highest rates). Though temperatures of both thermal regimes overlapped with common microhabitat temperatures for both populations in most seasons of embryogenesis, maximum field Tb, and Tsel for pregnant females were generally higher than in the laboratory regimes, at least for certain times of day in warm weather. The prolonged embryogenesis exhibited by geckos under the warm regime and the poor success of pregnancy under the cool regime demonstrate the necessity of thermoregulation by pregnant females for successful reproduction, particularly at Macraes. Our study describes complex but significant plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of female reproduction in a viviparous gekkonid lizard.

VL  - 65

SP  - 389-400
AB  - Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus) have been shown to exhibit morphological differences across the marked salinity and temperature gradients in the region. Here we analyse genetic (nine microsatellite loci), morphometric (skull shape), and meristic (pectoral fin rays and number of vertebrae) variations across seven samples of spawning herring collected from four spawning locations in the Baltic Sea to examine whether morphological variation correlates with genetic and (or) environmental factors. Results suggest that herring is adapting to its environment through a combination of selection and plastic responses. Skull shape, including and excluding size variation, differed significantly among samples, both temporally and spatially. Genetic and morphometric distances were correlated, especially when size variation was excluded from the analysis. When size variation was included, skull shape variation was more closely correlated with environmental distances among spawning locations. Vertebrate number differed among samples and was correlated with environmental distances, whereas the number of fin rays was not. Genetic and geographic distances among samples were not correlated. © 2008 NRC.

VL  - 32

SP  - 421-437
AB  - Shared fire-survival and fire-persistence traits are found in taxonomically unrelated plant species that commonly grow in fire-prone ecosystems. Such traits include resprouting, after fire has killed the above-ground biomass, and postfire seed release after the death of individual plants. Classification of such traits has led to a change in focus from research on the impact of fire as a disturbance factor on individual species, towards research into plant functional types associated with fire. This has led to a better understanding of the timing and geographic evolution of such traits as either fire-adapted or as a selective response to other disturbance factors. The identification of fire-survival and fire-persistence traits in fire-prone ecosystems is the first focus of this paper. It is followed by a discussion of recent research which offers a critical reappraisal of patch mosaic burning as a means to increase landscape heterogeneity and biodiversity, including the role played by plant functional types in determining diversity. The fire-prone ecosystems of mediterranean-type shrublands and heathlands, savannas and grasslands, and boreal and other coniferous forests are the main geographic focus of the paper. © 2008 SAGE Publications.

VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 72-80
AB  - The southern-most nocturnal Gecko Homonota darwini from Patagonia, Argentina, exhibits a long cycle of gametogenesis, and females usually skip a year of reproduction. This annual to biennial cycle for females and a fixed clutch size of one egg results in a mean annual reproductive output of 0.75, which is one of the lowest values found in lizards. The life-history traits, summarized here for H. darwini, are closer to phylogenetically distant species from similar latitudes (Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand, and Tasmania) than with congenerics from lower latitudes in Argentina. We postulate that the affinities found among different reptile lineages living at similar latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere are the result of convergence. The short activity seasons and the low mean temperatures seem to select for prolonged reproductive cycles, low reproductive output, long lifespan, late maturity, and enhanced parental care of fewer offspring.

TI  - Countergradient variation in growth rate: compensation for length of the growing season among Atlantic silversides from different latitudes
VL  - 83
IS  - 3
SP  - 316-324
AB  - How do organisms adapt to the differences in temperature and length of the growing season that occur with latitude? Among Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) along the east coast of North America, the length of the first growing season declines by a factor of about 2.5 with increasing latitude. Yet body size at the end of the first growing season does not decline. High-latitude fish must, therefore, grow faster within the growing season than do low-latitude fish. This geographical pattern has a genetic basis. Laboratory experiments on fish from six different locations revealed a latitudinal gradient in the capacity for growth (i.e., maximum growth potential). In two subsequent experiments using fish from Nova Scotia (NS), New York (NY) and South Carolina (SC) that had been separately reared in a common environment for several generations, differences in growth rate among populations were highly significant. The rank order was NS>NY>SC, but the difference among populations depended on temperature. High-latitude fish outperformed those from low latitudes primarily at the high temperatures that low-latitude fish would be expected to experience most often in nature. These results suggest that instead of being adapted for growth at low temperatures, fish from high latitudes are adapted for rapid elevation of growth rate during the brief interval of the year when high temperatures occur. Selection on growth rate results from sizedependent winter mortality: the importance to winter survival of being large increases with latitude but the length of the growing season simultaneously decreases. The end result is countergradient variation in growth rate, a phenomenon that may be much more widespread than currently recognized. © 1990 Springer-Verlag.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 295-303
AB  - Abstract Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic) is a common pest infesting cowpea seeds (Vigna unguiculata Walp) in Africa. In the Sahelian zone, the adults are in reproductive diapause during the dry season. Diapause induction depends on the climatic conditions during embryonic and post‐embryonic development. A strain of B. atrolineatus originating from the Niamey (13oN) was reared in different thermoperiodic and photoperiodic conditions. In the thermoperiodic regime 40:25oC, in continuous darkness, induction of diapause was dependent on the duration of the thermophase. Photoperiod could also influence diapause induction but the response depended on the temperature. When the beetles were reared in conditions of LD 12:12 h, 40:25oC, for seven generations, the proportion of diapausing adults decreased and their sensitivity to photoperiod increased. In LD 14:10 h, 40:25CC, the proportion of diapausing adults remained high regardless of the photoperiod. In these conditions, the first emerging adults were sexually active and were used for selection of a strain with a low incidence of diapause. After twelve generations, the proportion of diapausing beetles was lower than 5%. The responses of this selected strain to photo‐ and thermoperiods were reduced. The sensitivity of B. atrolineatus to photoperiod and thermoperiod could be controlled by genetic systems as observed in other insect species. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

TI  - Reconstructing an adaptationist scenario: What selective forces favor the evolution of viviparity in montane reptiles?
VL  - 160
IS  - 5
SP  - 582-593
AB  - It is notoriously difficult to test hypotheses about the selective forces responsible for major phylogenetic transitions in life-history traits, but the evolution of viviparity (live bearing) in reptiles offers an ideal model system. Viviparity has arisen in many oviparous reptile lineages that have invaded colder climates. Thermal advantages (eggs retained within the mother's body will be warmer than those laid in the nest) are almost certainly important, but the actual selective pressures remain controversial. For example, the benefit to retention might involve faster development, protection against freezing, predation, or desiccation, or modification of hatchling phenotypes. I experimentally manipulated incubation regimes of a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) to test these ideas. Eggs maintained in cooler "nests" in the laboratory developed more slowly, were more likely to die before hatching, and produced inferior (small, slow) hatchlings. A 2-wk initial period of higher-temperature incubation (simulating uterine retention, an intermediate step toward viviparity) ameliorated these effects. In the field, I placed eggs in artificial nests at the upper elevational limit of natural nests and also extending a further 100 m higher on the mountain. The results mirrored those in the laboratory: retention at maternal body temperatures accelerated hatching, enhanced hatching success, and increased locomotor speeds of hatchlings. This selective advantage of uterine retention was greater at higher elevations and increased with longer retention. The causal process responsible was prolonged low-temperature incubation rather than freezing, desiccation, or predation, and both hatching success and hatchling viability were affected. Field experiments that directly re-create selective regimes may thus provide robust tests of adaptationist hypotheses.

SP  - 303-351
AB  - Despite the extensive scientific progress and technological developments achieved in recent years, food safety problems continue to exist and may actually increase in the future. It is estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year, most due to unknown causative agents (Mead et al., 1999). Among the known pathogens associated with foodborne illness, there is an increasing involvement of environmentally resistant and host-adapted species or strains, which may be difficult to inactivate or control with traditional food preservation methods (Alterkruse et al., 1997; Foster, 1997; Tauxe, 1997). Intensified research in recent years indicates continuous adaptation and development of resistance by pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics (Threlfall et al., 2000) and to various food-related stresses, such as low pH or acidity, heat, cold temperature, dry or low water activity environments, and chemical preservatives (Abee and Wouters, 1999; Bower and Daeschel, 1999; Brul and Coote, 1999; Sheridan and McDowell, 1998). Prolonged exposure of adapted pathogens to antibiotics and other stresses may lead to the rise of new genotypes, as a result of bacterial evolution resulting in adaptive mutations (Lederberg, 1997, 1998). These mutants are capable of surviving and potentially multiplying under adverse conditions, while they may also be of enhanced virulence (Archer, 1996). Indeed, in vivo studies with animals indicate that stressed bacterial pathogens may increase their virulence and, accordingly, decrease their oral infectious dose (Bearson et al., 1997; Foster, 1995; Gahan and Hill, 1999; O’Driscoll et al., 1996; Robertson and Roop, 1999; Wong et al., 1998). Examples are the multidrug-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 (Davis et al., 1999; Glynn et al., 1998) and the acid tolerant Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Armstrong et al., 1996; Park et al., 1999), both associated with recent foodborne illness outbreaks (Alterkruse et al., 1997; Mead et al., 1999). Therefore, it seems that, as a response to exposure of bacteria to sublethal stresses, the microbial ecology of our food supply is undergoing changes toward an increasing occurrence of resistant pathogens of enhanced virulence (Archer, 1996; Lederberg et al., 1992; Lederberg, 1997, 1998; Sheridan and McDowell, 1998; Sofos, 2001). The genetic and associated biochemical mechanisms that bacteria possess or develop, and then express or activate, to enhance survival in stressful environments and during food processing, are discussed in previous chapters. The scope of this chapter is to present a brief overview of existing knowledge on pathogen stress responses in correlation with known or potential consequences in foods, and to discuss potential strategies for control of stress-adapted pathogens with the objective of enhancing the safety of our food supply. © 2003 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - A spatially explicit model to predict walleye spawning in an Eastern Lake Ontario tributary
VL  - 29
IS  - 6
SP  - 1686-1697
AB  - Field egg collections coupled with physical habitat measurements were used to develop, apply, and validate a spatially explicit model to predict the spawning sites of walleyes Sander vitreus in an eastern Lake Ontario tributary. We collected 22,246 walleye eggs using passive traps and measured the attendant habitat variables, including substrate composition and heterogeneity, water depth and velocity, and cumulative spring water temperature. The squared term that we used for water depth in our regressions and selected over linear and polynomial fits better represented the relationship between spawning probability and depth. To predict walleye spawning likelihood, we developed 10 candidate models based on the available spawning data; following an information-theoretic approach, we compared the models by means of Akaike's information criterion. The best model had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.89 and a weight of evidence of 0.32, where the probability of spawning (egg presence) was associated with predominance of course substrate and shallow depth and timing was associated with the accumulated spring water temperature. The model was applied to the study stream and validated by additional egg collections. The model correctly classified egg presence/absence in 66.7% (10 of 15) of egg traps in the initial validation sample. After a highflow event, classification success decreased to only 20% (3 of 15 traps), probably because of the redistribution of eggs to less suitable habitats in depositional areas. Prediction of walleye spawning distribution allows for reach-scale assessment of critical habitat to help guide spawning habitat restoration efforts. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2009.

AB  - In biological systems, expression dynamics that can provide fitted phenotype patterns with respect to a specific function have evolved through mutations. This has been observed in the evolution of proteins for realizing folding dynamics through which a target structure is shaped. We study this evolutionary process by introducing a statistical-mechanical model of interacting spins, where a configuration of spins and their interactions J represent a phenotype and genotype, respectively. The phenotype dynamics are given by a stochastic process with temperature TS under a Hamiltonian with J. The evolution of J is also stochastic with temperature TJ and follows mutations introduced into J and selection based on a fitness defined for a configuration of a given set of target spins. Below a certain temperature TS c2, the interactions J that achieve the target pattern evolve, whereas another phase transition is observed at TS c1 < TS c2. At low temperatures TS < TS c1, the Hamiltonian exhibits a spin-glass-like phase, where the dynamics toward the target pattern require long time steps, and the fitness often decreases drastically as a result of a single mutation to J. In the intermediate- temperature region, the dynamics to shape the target pattern proceed rapidly and are robust to mutations of J. The interactions in this region have no frustration around the target pattern and results in funnel-type dynamics. We propose that the ubiquity of funnel-type dynamics, as observed in protein folding, is a consequence of evolution subjected to thermal noise beyond a certain level; this also leads to mutational robustness of the fitness. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

TI  - Sardine spawning off the European Atlantic coast: Characterization of and spatio-temporal variability in spawning habitat
VL  - 74
IS  - 2
SP  - 210-227
AB  - Data on the occurrence of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) eggs from 42 national ichthyoplankton surveys along the European Atlantic coast were collated in order to describe the spawning habitat and spawning distribution of sardine in recent decades (1985-2005). A modification of existing spawning habitat characterisation techniques and a newly developed method to compare the probability of egg presence across surveys carried out with different sampling gears were used. Results showed that sardine spawning off the Atlantic European coast is mainly restricted to the shelf area, with the main geographical range being between the Strait of Gibraltar (the southern limit of data available for this analysis) and the middle part of the Armorican shelf (latitude around 47.5 degrees North), and along a temperature range of 12-17 degrees C. Spawning grounds within these limits show a nearly continuous geographical distribution, covering a large proportion of the shelf of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent waters, except for: (1) a persistent gap at the north west corner of the Iberian peninsula, (2) a small secondary break at the Spanish-French border in the inner part of the Bay of Biscay and (3) at the south west corner of the peninsula where there is a narrowing of the shelf width. These discontinuities were used to separate spawning into four nuclei and to describe the changes in spawning distribution in the time series. The relative importance of each nucleus and the degree of separation between adjacent nuclei varies between years, with the exception of the permanent gap at the northwest corner of the Iberian peninsula, which is persistent throughout the time series. Year to year changes in the proportion of the potential spawning habitat in which spawning actually occurred, changing from around 60% before the mid 1990s to around 40% thereafter, and did not show any relationship with spawning stock biomass. Evolution of potential habitat occupation over the Armorican shelf shows larger variability than that observed in the Iberian peninsula, with percentages of occupation ranging from around 30% up to nearly 80% of the shelf in recent years (within the limitations of the relatively sparse data for this region).

AB  - The embryonic development of Ceratoserolis trilobitoides (Crustacea: Isopoda) is described. It is estimated that breeding lasts nearly 2 years. In comparison with non-polar isopods 3 causes for the retardation of embryonic development are discussed: genetically fixed adaptations to the polar environment, the physiological effect of temperature and the effect of egg size. The latter seems to be of minor importance. Intraspecific variations of fecundity are found in populations from the Weddell Sea, the largest eggs occur in the coldest region. The distribution of physiological races corresponds to the distribution of morphotypes. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Analysis of the East Asian subtropical westerly jet simulated by CCSR/NIES/FRCGC coupled climate system model
VL  - 86
IS  - 2
SP  - 257-278
AB  - The major features of the East Asian subtropical westerly jet (EASWJ) in the upper troposphere simulated by the two versions of CCSR/NIES/FRCGC climate system model (MIROC_Hires and MIROC_Medres) are examined by analyzing the differences between the coupled model 20th century simulations and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, focusing on the evaluation of the model performances in reproducing the mean EASWJ structures, the seasonal evolution, interannual variability, and the relationship among the EASWJ seasonal evolution, the meridional temperature gradient and the diabatic heating in the upper troposphere. The mean EASWJ vertical and horizontal structures, the seasonal evolution, and the correspondence of the EASWJ location to the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere are well simulated in the coupled models. The increase in model resolution can improve the simulation of the EASWJ structures, seasonal evolution and interannual variability. However, both coupled models overestimate the EASWJ intensity in winter, and underestimate the jet intensity in summer, relative to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The biases in model EASWJ intensity are found to be associated with biases in meridional temperature gradients in the troposphere, and furthermore with the surface sensible heat flux in summer and convective condensation heating in winter as well as the meridional heat transport gradient. The coupled models simulate well the seasonal evolution of the diabatic heating averaged between 30°N-45°N, and its association with the westerly jet. However, the simulated maximum diabatic heating in summer is located eastward compared with the reanalyzed position, with a relatively weak diabatic heating intensity, especially in MIROC_Hires, while the MIROC_Medres model reproduces relatively strong diabatic heating near 130°E in winter. This study suggests that the condensation latent heating over the western Pacific in winter, the surface sensible heating over the northern side of the Tibetan Plateau in summer and the meridional heat transport gradient determine the EASWJ intensity, location and structure as well as its seasonal evolution. Thus the reasonable reproductions of the meridional heat transport gradient and the surface diabatic heating are the key points for improving the EASWJ simulation by the MIROC model. © 2008, Meteorological Society of Japan.

TI  - Temporal response of the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) to 3,000 years of climatic variation
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Amphibians are sensitive indicators of environmental conditions and show measurable responses, such as changes in phenology, abundance and range limits to local changes in precipitation and temperature regimes. Amphibians offer unique opportunities to study the important ecological and evolutionary implications of responses in life history characteristics to climatic change. We analyzed a late-Holocene fossil record of the Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) for evidence of population-level changes in body size and paedomorphosis to climatic change over the last 3000 years. Results: We found a significant difference in body size index between paedomorphic and metamorphic individuals during the time interval dominated by the Medieval Warm Period. There is a consistent ratio of paedomorphic to metamorphic specimens through the entire 3000 years, demonstrating that not all life history characteristics of the population were significantly altered by changes in climate on this timescale. Conclusion: The fossil record of Ambystoma tigrinum we used spans an ecologically relevant timescale appropriate for understanding population and community response to projected climatic change. The population-level responses we documented are concordant with expectations based on modern environmental studies, and yield insight into population-level patterns across hundreds of generations, especially the independence of different life history characteristics. These conclusions lead us to offer general predictions about the future response of this species based on likely scenarios of climatic warming in the Rocky Mountain region. © 2005 Bruzgul et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Low temperatures (26.0-30.6°C) produce males and high temperatures (32.8-35.3°C) produce females. Pivotal temperature is c 31.8°C. Hatching success and survival is very good between 28.1 and 32.8°C in dry sand (-5000 kPa). Incubation at 35.3°C is lethal for 72% of the eggs and produces weak hatchlings that die within 45 days. Wet sand (-5 kPa) is lethal for desert tortoise eggs. Hatchling size was dependent upon egg size and incubation condition. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32.8 and 35.3°C were significantly smaller than hatchlings from eggs incubated at 28.1 and 30.6°C. Hatching mass had no effect on growth rate of hatchlings. Thus, large eggs produced large hatchlings that were larger than their siblings at 120 days of age. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 20.5°C grew significantly more than hatchlings incubated at 28.1 and 32.8°C. Hatchlings incubated at 35.3°C loss mass. Incubation condition did not affect temperature selected in a substrate thermal gradient when hatchlings were tested within one week (mean 29.2°C) or 40 days of hatching (mean 26.6°C). -from Authors

TI  - Flip chip solder interconnections: A reliability perspective
SP  - 359-366
AB  - The solder ball flip chip or so called C-4 connection was introduced by IBM nearly three decades ago as an alternative to manual wire bonding whose productivity and reliability were not acceptable at that time. A very large field data base indicates that flip-chip interconnections have been the most reliable die interconnection scheme in the industry since their inception. The technology is flexible, having been utilized with various types of chip carriers. Several unique technology features such as chip-level hermiticity and modifications made to enhance reliability as the technology evolved are discussed. The potential loss of integrity of flip-chip solder joints due to fatigue failure is an issue that has received considerable attention. Fatigue failure can result if thermally-induced strains within a joint generated by the mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between die and chip carrier become too great. Thus, the influence of design and material parameters to reduce strain and dissipate stress are discussed as well. The so-called Modified Coffin-Manson (C-M) relationship provides the capability of predicting field life times based on standard laboratory tests. The basis of the C-M relationship is described and also modifications made to address creep, a common occurrence in solder applications. Flip-chip solder joint technology is sufficiently extendible to satisfy anticipated future I/O requirements. To meet these requirements the reliability impact of chip underfill, a recent development, is also discussed.

TI  - Development of Fracture Splitting Method for Case Hardened Connecting Rods
VL  - 2004
AB  - The fracture splitting (FS) method for case hardened connecting rods has been developed to improve engine performance while decreasing production costs. The FS method is widely used for automotive connecting rods because it effectively improves their productivity. Normalized forging steels, microalloyed forging steels and powder metals have generally been used as the material in the FS method as they are easily split due to their brittleness. On the other hand, the materials to be used for high performance motorcycles are case hardened low carbon steels because they allow the connecting rods to be lightweight due to their high fatigue strengths. These materials, which have a hardened area of approx. 0.5mm in depth from the surface, have a ductile texture inside. This texture obstructs the crack propagation and makes the split force too high to split without deforming the bearing area. In order to solve these issues and make FS a successful method for making motorcycle connecting rods, the experimental evaluations have been completed. It was found that the temperature and the strain ratio affected the brittleness of the fracture surface, and the ductile-brittle transition line was selected. It was also found that modifying the bearing design is effective to avoid the harmful tiny fractions occurring at the junction of another crack propagation through a FEM method. This newly developed method has shown an improvement in the circularity of the bearing area while decreasing the production cost by 30%. The connecting rods manufactured using this new method have been applied for our mass-produced high performance motorcycles since 2003. © 2004 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.

TI  - Activity and thermoregulation of the snake Natrix maura. 2. A synoptic model of thermal biolgy and the physiological ecology of performance
VL  - 214
IS  - 2
SP  - 325-342
AB  - Biophysical, physiological and behavioral approaches to reptilian thermal biology have been combined in a synoptic model, using data derived from a study of the snake Natrix maura in a Spanish river and in the laboratory. The model investigates the relations between the costs and benefits of physiological performance, body temperature, the season of activity, and the thermal benefits of physiological performance, body temperature, the season of activity, and the thermal environment. The performance variale chosen was aerobic metabolism. The cost associated with high aerobic metabolism at low body temperatures is the energy requirement for maintenance; the benefit is an increased activity season. The cost of maintenance was more sensitive to differences in the level and temperature sensitivity of metabolism than was the benefit of the time for activity. The pattern of performance and body temperature obesrved in N. maura was close to that predicted for maximum efficiency, in terms of the activity season produced per unit of annual maintenance cost. It is noted, however, that animals will be selected for net benefit, and not for efficiency as such. A definition of fitness for the study of the physiological ecology of performance was developed, to take account of the level of performance available during activity, and of selection for net benefit. This definition is: the energy intake above maintenance costs x the probability of survival. It is related to general ecological fitness by considering lifetime strategies of survival and reproduction, and the energy equivalence of offspring. These strategies are the subject of the physiological ecology of allocation, which is thus complementary to that of performance. The following are also discussed: the role of performance in interactions with predators and prey; other possible evolutionary determinants of body temperature; the limitations of different approachs to thermal biology; suitable systems for further study.

AB  - The injection of rubber is a well-developed technique that now, because of its high productivity, replaces the use of compression in many areas. The injection system consists of an injection head and a mold that allows for the shaping and the vulcanization. The injection head has two functions: plasticizing, in which, in each injection cycle, a sufficient amount of the mix, at a uniform selected temperature, is prepared; and the preparation of the quantity of mix required, the loading into the head and the injection itself. With a well designed plasticizing machine and a regulatable back pressure, the range of temperatures available for a given output is very wide, whatever the mix. If the plasticizing machine is also fitted with an accurate thermometer, the unit can be more finely adjusted and the productivity thus optimized.

AB  - A mathematical model of a new reactor design has been proposed. In the new reactor the catalyst is deposited over the external surface of the tubes, where the coolant flows. The widespread industrial process of oxidation of o-xylene into phthalic anhydride was investigated. The results obtained show significant advantages of the new design in comparison with the conventional fixed bed reactor operating in the industry. They are: much higher productivity, easily controlled temperature regime, raised selectivity and decrease content of side products, as well as an opportunity for additional feed-in of the reagent along the reactor height. The technological regime of the oxidation process was optimized.

TI  - Evolution of hybrid dysgenesis potential following P element contamination in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 119
IS  - 4
SP  - 815-828
AB  - P elements were introduced into M strain genomes by chromosomal contamination (transposition) from P strain chromosomes under conditions of P-M hybrid dysgenesis. A number of independently maintained contaminated lines were subsequently monitored for their ability to induce gonadal (GD) sterility in the progeny of reference crosses, over a period of 60 generations, in two experiments. The efficiency of chromosomal contamination was high; all tested lines acquired P elements following the association of M and P chromosomes in the same genome for a single generation. All the contaminated lines also sustained an initial unstable phase, marked by high frequencies of transposition and sterility within lines, in the absence of P element regulation. Subsequently, each of the lines rapidly evolved to one of three relatively stable strain types whose phenotypic and molecular properties correspond rather closely to those of the P, Q and M' strains that have previously been characterized. The numbers and structures of P elements and the presence or absence of P element regulation during the early generations appeared to be critical factors determining the subsequent course of evolution. On the basis of GD sterility frequencies, both the mean level of P activity, and the average capacity for P element regulation, were reduced in lines raised at 25 degrees, relative to those raised at 20 degrees, during the early generations. This latter result is consistent with the expectation that natural selection will tend to modify the manifestation of dysgenic traits, such as high temperature sterility, which cause a reduction of fitness. However, overall, stochastic factors appeared to predominate in determining the course of evolution of individual lines.

TI  - Effect of long-term incubation of spermatozoa on their thermal resistance and thermal selection
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 268-275
AB  - A study was made of changes in the heat resistance of spermatozoa during their incubation in Ringer's solution, using two species of frogs (Rana temporaria and R. ridibunda) and of bivalve molluscs (Unio crassus and U. tumidus). The decrease in the heat resistance of spermatozoa is the more significant the longer energetic expenditures for their movements in the solution. Changes in the heat resistance are stochastic, and therefore the resistance levels at different terms of incubation are not correlated with the initial one. This is the reason for disappearance of correlation between the resistance of spermatozoa and that of somatic cells of a developing organism observed prior to incubation. Thus, selection of spermatozoa whose resistance determines that of somatic cells is substituted by a non-directed elimination of genotypes, i. e. thermal selection of spermatozoa becomes ineffective.

VL  - 39
IS  - 4
SP  - 620-638
AB  - The individual mating success of male tungara frogs is best predicted by the number of nights spent in chorus activity, yet individuals are often absent from the chorus for several nights without calling at another site. To test whether males leave the chorus to forage to pay the energy cost of calling, males were captured in groups of four and their calls were recorded over 3 or 5 nights, while half of them were starved and the others fed. Feeding had no effect on the number of males that stopped calling, or on the changes in call rate, call complexity (number of secondary notes) and chorus leading over time. When they were released, fed males did not return faster to the chorus, and were not more likely to return, than starved males. Playback of a tape of a large chorus increased the number of males present in the small natural chorus. Chorus size in three pools was positively correlated with the minimum temperature, and negatively correlated with the rainfall, over the previous 2 days. These results suggest that males are conservative in their chorusing activity because chorusing increases predation risk, not because they need to forage. Males use variation in chorus size, rainfall or temperature to select those nights that offer reduced predation risk and increased mating opportunities. Playback of a tape of a large chorus caused males in a small chorus to increase their call rate by 104%, their call complexity by 38%, and the net energy cost of calling by 70%. Male size and weight had no effect on the mean call rate, call complexity or the amount of chorus leading, but were positively correlated with the maximum call rate of male; this effect may contribute to the higher mating success of larger males observed previously. Size and weight had no effect on the maximum rate of production of secondary notes, or on the influence of playback on call rate. Weight was correlated with the relative increase in call complexity as a result of playback; larger males use relatively more secondary notes in larger choruses, whereas smaller males use relatively more in small choruses. © 1990.

VL  - 52
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-218
AB  - The degree of three behavioral responses (aggregation with other individuals, movement towards shaded locations and shell exiting) shown by the coexisting hermit crabs, Pagurus samuelis (Stimpson), P. hirsutiusculus venturensis (Coffin), P. granosimanus (Stimpson) and P. hemphilli (Benedict), when aerially exposed, corresponded with their pattern of intertidal vertical zonation. The highest occurring species, P. samuelis, exhibited significantly greater tendencies to aggregate with other individuals and to seek refuge in shaded locations and usually remained within their shells when exposed to the combined stresses of temperature and desiccation. P. hirsutiusculus and P. granosimanus, primarily mid- to low-intertidal species, displayed these responses only occasionally while P. hemphilli, a lowintertidal and shallow-subtidal species, showed significantly lower clustering, shade attraction, and shell abandonment responses. Comparison of larger and smaller P. samuelis revealed no significant behavioral differences. P. samuelis and P. granosimanus that occupied shells not allowing complete retraction were less resistant to the stresses of aerial exposure. Crabs inhabiting damaged shells with holes ( ≈ 5 mm diam.) in the whorls or spire did not experience decreased survival in comparison with that found in crabs occupying entire shells. These findings suggest an implication of shell optimality with environmental resistance that should be considered of potential importance in the evolution of complex communicative and aggressive behavior in intertidal hermit crabs. In addition, attraction to shaded areas and clustering are behavioral responses appropriate for avoiding or reducing the adverse effects of temperature and desiccation stresses. These responses may be important in facilitating the coexistence of these species although further investigation is needed to quantify the importance of such behavior to intertidal hermit crab populations. The significance of shell-exiting is not specifically known but survival of a shell-less crab is undoubtedly minimal. © 1981.

Heat resistance in sibses was determined at 31°C in January-February and in April-May. Both males and females responded to the damaging temperature in inverse proportion to the initial level of heat resistance during the period of wintering: the heat resistance decreased when the initial level was high and increased when it was low. This relationship was markedly more pronounced in males than in females. As a result, directed thermal selection is substituted for nonselective elimination during reproduction, thus contributing to preservation of the population genetic structure at the previous level. © 1998 MAK Haya/Interperiodica Publishing.

TI  - Genetic and nongenetic cellular resistance adaptation in marine invertebrates
VL  - 14

SP  - 482-502
AB  - 1. A general biological principle exists stating that every species is adapted in some degree to the special climate of its environment. By that means the life and respectively the survival are secured at the total scale of physico-chemical conditions which may normally occur in the particular distribution area. The thereby acting cellular adaptations are genetically determined and originated by natural variation and selection during the extension of life over the globe. They are also the basis for the development and the function of special organ physiological adaptions and for those adaptations which comprise the whole organism. 2. Species specific resistance adaptations can be measured by the survival rates or times of isolated cells or tissue pieces after altering one or several environmental factors, such as salinity, hydrostatic pressure, temperature, etc. This is exemplified in the review by many experimental observations on lower marine invertebrates. The physiological values obtained are, on the whole, as important for the characterization of the species and their distribution capacities as are their morphological pecularities. Furthermore, these experimental values represent a first step to an analytical marine zoogeography at the cellular level. 3. Euryoecous species (bivalves, starfishes, sea anemones, etc.) which survive at a larger scale of abiotic conditions show also various cellular environmentally induced resistance changes and nongenetic adaptations (acclimatizations) between the limits of their broader genetic reaction extent. Nongenetic and genetic cellular adaptations probably function by means of equal mechanisms. 4. One can differentiate between cellular nongenetic resistance adaptations which are specific and nonspecific. In specific thermal resistance adaptations, for example, the individual lower and upper temperature limits shift in the same direction, which means that warm adaptation produces an increasing heat resistance while the cold resistance of the tissues decreases at the same time. By means of nonspecific resistance adaptations, the total cellular resistance extent (against heat, cold, frost, pressure, etc.) may be enlarged or diminished in several directions. Shock effects (short time sublethal stresses) may cause an immediate broad nonspecific resistance increase by stabilization of the structure and functions of protoplasm (hardening). Euryoecous marine invertebrates show also nonspecific resistance reductions by relative destabilization of the protoplasmatic qualities (dehardening), for example, during prolonged starvation, during spawning periods and after adaptation to brackish waters. © 1966 Biologischen Anstalt Helgoland.

VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-29
AB  - Four classes of cell nuclei containing polytene chromosomes of different diameters were detected in the salivary glands of Drosophila at the stage of 0-hour prepupae. The diameter of chromosomes was shown to depend on the level of polyteny. In the selected highly inbred lines LA (low activity) and HA (high activity) and in their F1 hybrids LA x HA and HA x LA, the ratios of nuclei containing chromosomes with different levels of polyteny were analyzed. It was established that chromosomes of an inadaptive line LA have a decreased level of polyteny. The hybrids were superior to both parent lines in terms of the trait studied. Giant chromosomes of line and hybrid females had higher levels of polyteny than male chromosomes. It is shown that the level of polyteny of giant chromosomes in Drosophila lines and their hybrids is correlated with differences in traits with a high adaptive value, such as rate of development, fertility, heat resistance, competitiveness, etc.

SP  - 3557-3564
AB  - The term tolerance range is normally used in reference to an abiotic aspect of the environment (temperature, salinity, pH, oxygen levels, toxin concentrations, etc.) and indicates the critical maximum and minimum limits of that abiotic variable that the organism can withstand. Species may exhibit very wide or relatively narrow tolerance ranges, and may have very high or low tolerance limits, depending on their biology and the environments to which they are adapted. In general, tolerance limits are reached when organisms can no longer successfully regulate their internal state and when cellular components no longer function correctly as the result of environmental change. Behavioral activities, however, may help organisms effectively avoid some environmental extremes. Organisms may alter their tolerance range in two ways: through phenotypical plasticity or evolutionary change. Plasticity in this context is usually called acclimation, and can occur to varying degrees and through a number of physiological and cellular mechanisms. Evolutionary changes in tolerance range may be similarly variable in pattern, and obviously populations that fail to adapt adequately to changes in their abiotic environment will go extinct. Organisms that are exposed to stressful levels of multiple abiotic variables at once may experience reduced tolerance ranges for some or all of these variables. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Investigation on early divergence between populations of Drosophila melanogaster kept at different temperatures
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 81-87
AB  - An experiment was performed on Drosophila melanogaster populations kept at two temperatures (25°C and 28°C) with the aim of providing further evidence that: 1 phenotypic differentiation between the two populations is already detectable in earlier generations of selection; 2 the divergence is more related to a changed body shape than to body size; 3 this divergence is correlated with fitness and, therefore, natural selection may operate on these differences. The results obtained by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis imply that: (i) progress in the phenotypic divergence is observed from the first to the sixth generation as based on the discrimination by a linear function of nine metric traits of the wing, while, as expected, divergence is not detected on mean values and variance estimates; (ii) differential reproductive fitness is associated with these differences and not with single traits. It is suggested that the kind of variation observed is the outcome of a rearrangement of the developmental pattern of the wing in the population kept at different temperatures and that the reproductive fitness values are more dependent on the developmental pattern than on the genetic basis of a given character. The results are discussed in terms of population dynamics. © 1978 Dr. W. Junk b.v.

VL  - 4

SP  - 272-276
AB  - Although information about embryonic and larval development of garpike, Belone belone (Linnaeus, 1761), is present in the published literature, the bulk of research concerns garpike from the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The present work describes the embryonic and larval development of garpike, Belone belone, from the Adriatic Sea, and methods used for incubation of fertilized eggs in aquarium conditions. Because garpike is, as suggested by some authors, divided into subspecies, we conclude that some differences in embryonic development could also be expected. In the present study, eggs were fertilized using the dry fertilization method and were incubated in a tank equipped with aeration and constant sea water flow. Salinity and content of dissolved oxygen were constant, and the temperature varied between 19.4 and 22.3°C. Eggs were spherical, measuring 3071.9 ± 75.73 μm in diameter. Yolk sacs were homogeneous and did not contain oil globules. The first larvae hatched 329 h and 47 min after fertilization. Absorption of the yolk sac occurred 17 h - 48 h after hatching and the total length of newly hatched larvae was 9.78 mm. The peculiarities observed in the embryonic and early larval development are evidence of an exceptional plasticity and adaptive potential, which could be considered as helpful features in extending the natural range of occurrence of this species. © 2009 ISZS, Blackwell Publishing and IOZ/CAS.

TI  - M stars as targets for terrestrial exoplanet searches and biosignature detection
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-166
AB  - The changing view of planets orbiting low mass stars, M stars, as potentially hospitable worlds for life and its remote detection was motivated by several factors, including the demonstration of viable atmospheres and oceans on tidally locked planets, normal incidence of dust disks, including debris disks, detection of planets with masses in the 5-20 M⊕ range, and predictions of unusually strong spectral biosignatures. We present a critical discussion of M star properties that are relevant for the long- and short-term thermal, dynamical, geological, and environmental stability of conventional liquid water habitable zone (HZ) M star planets, and the advantages and disadvantages of M stars as targets in searches for terrestrial HZ planets using various detection techniques. Biological viability seems supported by unmatched very long-term stability conferred by tidal locking, small HZ size, an apparent short-fall of gas giant planet perturbers, immunity to large astrosphere compressions, and several other factors, assuming incidence and evolutionary rate of life benefit from lack of variability. Tectonic regulation of climate and dynamo generation of a protective magnetic field, especially for a planet in synchronous rotation, are important unresolved questions that must await improved geodynamic models, though they both probably impose constraints on the planet mass. M star HZ terrestrial planets must survive a number of early trials in order to enjoy their many Gyr of stability. Their formation may be jeopardized by an insufficient initial disk supply of solids, resulting in the formation of objects too small and/or dry for habitability The small empirical gas giant fraction for M stars reduces the risk of formation suppression or orbit disruption from either migrating or nonmigrating giant planets, but effects of perturbations from lower mass planets in these systems are uncertain. During the first ∼ Gyr, atmospheric retention is at peril because of intense and frequent stellar flares and sporadic energetic particle events, and impact erosion, both enhanced, the former dramatically, for M star HZ semimajor axes. Loss of atmosphere by interactions with energetic particles is likely unless the planetary magnetic moment is sufficiently large. For the smallest stellar masses a period of high planetary surface temperature, while the parent star approaches the main sequence, must be endured. The formation and retention of a thick atmosphere and a strong magnetic field as buffers for a sufficiently massive planet emerge as prerequisites for an M star planet to enter a long period of stability with its habitability intact. However, the star will then be subjected to short-term fluctuations with consequences including frequent unpredictable variation in atmospheric chemistry and surficial radiation field. After a review of evidence concerning disks and planets associated with M stars, we evaluate M stars as targets for future HZ planet search programs. Strong advantages of M stars for most approaches to HZ detection are offset by their faintness, leading to severe constraints due to accessible sample size, stellar crowding (transits), or angular size of the HZ (direct imaging). Gravitational lensing is unlikely to detect HZ M star planets because the HZ size decreases with mass faster than the Einstein ring size to which the method is sensitive. M star Earth-twin planets are predicted to exhibit surprisingly strong bands of nitrous oxide, methyl chloride, and methane, and work on signatures for other climate categories is Summarized. The rest of the paper is devoted to an examination of evidence and implications of the unusual radiation and particle environments for atmospheric chemistry and surface radiation doses, and is summarized in the Synopsis. We conclude that attempts at remote sensing of biosignatures and non-biological markers from M star planets are important, not as tests of any quantitative theories or rational arguments, but instead because they offer an inspection of the residues from a Gyr-long biochemistry experiment in the presence of extreme environmental fluctuations. A detection or repeated nondetections could provide a unique opportunity to partially answer a fundamental and recurrent question about the relation between stability and complexity, one that is not addressed by remote detection from a planet orbiting a solar-like star, and can only be studied on Earth using restricted microbial systems in serial evolution experiments or in artificial life simulations. This proposal requires a planet that has retained its atmosphere and a water supply. The discussion given here suggests that observations of M star exoplanets can decide this latter question with only slight modifications to plans already in place for direct imaging terrestrial exoplanet missions. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

VL  - 14
IS  - 7
SP  - 773-854
AB  - A 150 km length, 6-second deep, seismic line across the west central and north parts of the South Caspian Basin was used to construct quantitative dynamical, thermal and hydrocarbon evolution patterns. The depth of the west part of the 2-D section of the South Caspian Basin is almost 30 km. The computer program GEOPETII was used to provide quantitative evolution models. The procedure provided an opportunity to investigate the development dynamics of: excess fluid pressure, porosity retention, rock fracturing, compaction, heat transfer, maturity, generation pressure, kinetic hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation, together with solubility effects on hydrocarbon transport. The results suggest that: (i) Temperature is 350-400 degrees C in the deepest part of the section at a depth of 26-29 km; (ii) The highest values of excess pressure (nearly twice hydrostatic fluid pressure) are in Jurassic and Cretaceous formations in the west part of the section, which has now subsided to a depth of about 20-27 km; (iii) Major oil and gas generation began in the last 10-5 MYBP, the migration in free-phase and in water solution occurring dominantly in the last few million years; (iv) Trapping of hydrocarbons took place mainly, but not exclusively, in the 3-9 km depth interval in the sands of the Productive Series of the Pliocene, embedded in a shale sequence; (v) Oil and gas filling of the shallow reservoirs by oil and gas is on-going today, indicating an extremely high productivity for any reservoir found in the offshore area; (vi) There is overlap with depth of oil and gas reservoirs, and the total amount of hydrocarbons estimated to be trapped is considerable; (vii) The high overpressure expected makes for a drilling hazard, but one which it is worthwhile to overcome if the anticipated oil and gas accumulations are encountered.

VL  - 33

SP  - 281-287
AB  - Seven single-plant selections of wild emmer, with temperature-sensitive minor-effect genes for stripe rust resistance, were intercrossed in eight combinations. The resulting progenies were studied for a possible additive gene action. The transgressive segregation towards resistance in F2 observed in all the combinations indicates that additive gene action for resistance indeed occurs in wild emmer. The common occurrence of this phenomenon in random combinations suggests further that several minor-effect genes are involved. Following selection of the most resistant plants in F2, a marked shift towards resistance was noted in F3, which demonstrates a positive response to selection. In some instances, additive resistance selected for (in F2) at the high temperature-profile was expressed (in F3) also at the low temperature-profile. This kind of resistance, when utilized in breeding programmes, promises therefore to be effective over a range of temperatures. © 1984 Veenman B.V., Wageningen.

TI  - Virulence of lizard malaria: the evolutionary ecology of an ancient parasite-host association
VL  - 100
SP  - S35-S52
AB  - The negative consequences of parasitic infection (virulence) were examined for two lizard malaria parasite-host associations: Plasmodium agamae and P. giganteum, parasites of the rainbow lizard, Agama agama, in Sierra Leone, West Africa; and P. mexicanum in the western fence lizard, Sceloporus, occidentalis in northern California. These malaria species vary greatly in their reproductive characteristics: P. agamae produces only 8 merozoites per schizont, P. giganteum yields over 100, and P. mexicanum an intermediate number. All three parasites appear to have had an ancient association with their host. In fence lizards, infection with malaria is associated with increased numbers of immature erythrocytes, decreased haemoglobin levels, decreased maximal oxygen consumption, and decreased running stamina. Not affected were numbers of erythrocytes, resting metabolic rate, and sprint running speed which is supported by anaerobic means in lizards. Infected male fence lizards had smaller testes, stored less fat in preparation for winter dormancy, were more often socially submissive and, unexpectedly, were more extravagantly coloured on the ventral surface (a sexually dimorphic trait) than non-infected males. Females also stored less fat and produced smaller clutches of eggs, a directly observed reduction in fitness. Infected fence lizards do not develop behavioural fevers. P. mexicanum appears to have broad thermal buffering abilities and thermal tolerance; the parasite's population growth was unaffected by experimental alterations in the lizard's body temperature. The data are less complete for A. agama, but infected lizards suffered similar haematological and physiological effects. Infected animals may be socially submissive because they appear to gather less insect prey, possibly a result of being forced into inferior territories. Infection does not reduce clutch size in rainbow lizards, but may lengthen the time between clutches. These results are compared with predictions emerging from several models of the evolution of parasite virulence. The lack of behavioural fevers in fence lizards may represent a physiological constraint by the lizards in evolving a thermal tolerance large enough to allow elimination of the parasite via fever. Such constraints may be important in determining the outcome of parasite-host coevolution. Some theory predicts low virulence in old parasite-host systems and higher virulence in parasites with greater reproductive output. However, in conflict with this argument, all three malarial species exhibited similar high costs to their hosts. © 1990, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

VL  - 37

SP  - 1099-1104
AB  - We test for fitness costs of resistance in a natural host-parasite system, involving Drosophila nigrospiracula and ectoparasitic mites, Macrocheles subbadius. We contrasted rates of mortality at embryonic and pupal stages of host ontogeny between replicate-resistant and -susceptible (control) lines at different temperatures (24, 28, and 34°C). Evidence for a cost of resistance was shown as a 17% overall reduction in egg hatch rate in replicate-resistant lines, although this effect was heterogeneous across replicate selection experiments. This cost of resistance was not magnified under thermal stress. Pupa survivorship was statistically invariant between resistant and control lines, at either temperature. Embryo and pupa mortalities were significantly elevated at the high temperature, confirming that the thermal treatment was physiologically stressful. The results suggest differential sensitivity of life history traits to the pleiotropic effects of genetic resistance against ectoparasitic mites. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Cold resistance in plants: A mystery unresolved
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - Herbaceous temperate plants are capable of developing freezing tolerance when they are exposed to low nonfreezing temperatures. Acquired freezing tolerance involves extensive reprogramming of gene expression and metabolism. Recent full-genome transcript profiling studies, in combination with mutational and transgenic plant analyses, have provided a snapshot of the complex transcriptional network that operates under cold stress. The changes in expression of hundreds of genes in response to cold temperatures are followed by increases in the levels of hundreds of metabolites, some of which are known to have protective effects against the damaging effects of cold stress. Genetic analysis has revealed important roles for cellular metabolic signals, and for RNA splicing, export and secondary structure unwinding, in regulating cold-responsive gene expression and chilling and freezing tolerance. These results along with many of the others summarized here further our understanding of the basic mechanisms that plants have evolved to survive freezing temperatures. In addition, the findings have potential practical applications, as freezing temperatures are a major factor limiting the geographical locations suitable for growing crop and horticultural plants and periodically account for significant losses in plant productivity. Although, great progress has been made in the field but lacunae still remain since it appears that the cold resistance is more complex than perceived and involves more than one pathway. © 2009 by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso.

VL  - 336
SP  - 235-247
AB  - We evaluated the temporal dynamics of the aggregate groundfish community, further decomposed into functional groups, individual species abundances, and health indicators, from adjacent management units on the Scotian Shelf. On the colder, eastern half of the shelf, several species collapsed in the early 1990s, while, on the western half, no such collapses were evident despite similar exploitation regimes. The decline in the eastern aggregate biomass was influenced by a decline in average body size, which was interpreted as a past integrator of temperature and size-selective fishing. Biomass of 3 out of 4 functional groups declined in the east; 3 out of 4 groups increased in the west. Some species from the east appear to be slowly compensating, but not enough to counter the decline in aggregate biomass. Species inhabiting the warmer western region show strong evidence of compensation. In effect, warmer waters allow potential compensating species to increase at a faster rate. Quantitative measures of functional group temporal stability revealed no differences between areas; therefore, neither area can be considered stable. Physiological condition declined in many species in both regions. Species that increased in the west, or had slower rates of decline, had higher levels of condition than eastern populations. With the exception of cod in the western region, species growth rates declined in both areas. Although the west appears more stable, it is following a similar, but protracted trajectory, to that found in the east. The protracted response in the west may be due to higher demographic rates in warmer waters. To foster resilience in the western area, we should address the rapid pace of new fisheries, effects of size-selective mortality, and the diminishing number of natural refugia. © Inter-Research 2007.

TI  - Rapid morphological change in stream beetle museum specimens correlates with climate change
VL  - 33
IS  - 5
SP  - 646-651
AB  - 1. Climate change has been occurring at unprecedented rates and its impacts on biological populations is beginning to be well documented in the literature. For many species, however, long-term records are not available, and trends have not been documented. 2. Using museum specimens from southern USA, we show that the stream-dwelling beetle Gyretes sinuatus has shown an 8% increase in body size and change in body shape (fineness ratio) from 1928 to 1988. Any directional morphological change observed over time could be an indicator of a microevolutionary response. 3. During these 60 years, there have also been changes in temperature, precipitation, and location of collection sites. Unlike the global trend, mean annual temperature in the region has decreased, and furthermore, total annual precipitation has increased. By investigating how these various ecological and geographical variables may affect body size and shape, we can examine which pressures may promote larger and/or thinner beetles. 4. Results indicate that mean annual temperature was the most predictive variable for the change in size and shape. We suggest there is an adaptive role for temperature on body size and shape of stream dwelling organisms. 5. We found that museum specimens can be invaluable resources of information when collection date and location information is available. We promote the use of such specimens for future studies of the morphological response to climate change. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - The main constraint of using Ogura male-sterile cytoplasm in Brassica is the induction of leaf yellowing at low temperature and the low seed set. But whether or not the cytoplasm can disturb the general commerical performance of the plants is not well-known. Therefore, this work was carried out with the purpose of evaluating Ogura cytoplasmic male-sterile cabbage hybrids and compare them to genomic similar male-fertile ones and to the most popular cabbage hybrid cultivated in Brazil. Harvest data showed an effect of the cytoplasm on reducing plant and head weight, core length and head length and width, although not altering heading index, shape and core indexes, nor head compactness. On the other hand, it was observed also that a careful selection of the parental lineages can produce male-sterile hybrids as good as their male-fertile analogues. All the evaluated hybrids were similar or better than the check for the characteristics under study. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

TI  - Natural attenuation of oil by biodegradation in contaminated soils
IS  - 154
SP  - 50-53
AB  - Point sources like underground storage tanks have often caused an oil contamination of soil and groundwater. In many cases active remediation actions are required. However, this is not always achieved due to the technical or financial limitations. Whether the active remediation is carried out or not, it is necessary to know how the natural processes in soil affect the fate and degradation of the contaminant. In Finnish Environment Institute, the significance of natural attenuation of oil by biodegradation in the in situ remediation of soil and groundwater is studied. In situ bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons have been used successful in, for example, North America (Downey and Hinchee, 1999). In cold environments and in heterogeneous geologic conditions the efficiency of in situ bioremediation techniques need to be further evaluated. Petroleum hydrocarbons are used as carbon and energy source by a variety of micro-organisms (Atlas, 1981). Some petroleum hydrocarbons can be degraded relatively fast while others are more recalcitrant. Most important factors affecting the degradation of oil are probably the availability of oxygen, nutrients and possibly temperature. In soil, organic contamination activates certain micro-organisms and the degradation of the contaminant begins. Microbial degradation of organic contaminants rapidly consumes the oxygen in the soil and oxygen availability is a crucial factor determining the efficiency of in situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated soil. The initial steps in the aerobic hydrocarbon degradation involve oxygen. Anaerobic biodegradation hasbeen considered to be very limited when compared to aerobic biodegradation (Atlas, 1981). However, recently it has been shown that petroleum hydrocarbons can be degraded also in anaerobic conditions by certain sulphate and iron reducing micro-organisms (Coates and Anderson, 2000). Low temperatures may not necessarily prevent the microbiological degradation of oil and the use of in situ bioremediation techniques in cold climate. Bacteria with low optimum temperatures have evolved in cold environments (Whyte et al., 1998). Subsurface soil provides a constantly cool environment for such adaptation. Microbial communities in these environments have been found to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons as efficiently as in warmer climate (Bradley and Chapelle, 1995; Margesin and Schinner, 1997), which allows the use of in situ techniques also in higher latitudes. However, low degradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons have been often reported (Atlas, 1981). The viscosity of oil increases at low temperatures which affect the transportation of oil in soil and its availability to micro-organisms. In addition, at the low temperatures the volatilization of short-chain alkanes decreases and at high concentrations they may become toxic to microorganisms (Atlas, 1981). Hydrocarbons lack nitrogen and phosphorus and if these nutrients are not available in the environment for bacterial growth, the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons can be restricted. Nutrient additions have often been found to enhance the biodegradation (Aislabie et al., 1998; Braddock et al., 1997; Bragg et al., 1994; Margesin and Schinner, 1997; Westlake et al., 1978). On the other hand, in some cases, high nutrient concentrations may inhibit the degradation activity (Braddock et al., 1997). The inhibition may be due to dryness of the soil which results in relatively high salt concentrations in the pore water when fertilizers are added (Braddock et al., 1997). In the Finnish Environment Institute, in the research on natural attenuation of oil by biodegradation, two sites in southern Finland have been investigated. One of these sites is an old industrial land fill site where no remediation actions have been carried out. At the other site, where a heating oil spill occurred under a building, soil have been remediated by excavation, vacuum extraction and injection of nutrient amended water. At the site with active remediation actions, it was difficult to introduce water deep enough. The introduction of oxygen seemed to be efficient. Thus it was the lack of humidity or nutrients that prevented the degradation of oil rather than the availability of oxygen. Similar cases can be probably found where the oil spill is located under a building. At this site, the maximum oil concentrations were 20 000 mg/kg. When active remediation actions were carried out, the clean up of the soil was estimated to take approximately four years. When the injection of nutrient amended water was stopped, the microbial activity decreased indicating a clean up time of approximately 18 years. During the active remediation period, the microbial activity seemed to slow down. Decreasing microbial activity may be caused by the depletion of more easily degraded compounds. At the site, where no remediation actions were carried out, a maximum of 16 000 mg/kg oil was found. Microbial activity was very high in aerobic conditions, which has resulted in the depletion of oxygen at the study site. For example methane concentrations in soil gas were up to 20%. When the oil concentration in soil was >1000 mg/kg, oil degradation in aerobic conditions was 900-14 000 mg/kg*year. In anaerobic conditions the degradation rate ranged between 550 and 5000 mg/kg*year. Consequently, the intrinsic bioremediation of the site would take 2-22 years or 4-36 years in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. The clean up of the site would take actually more than couple of years as the oil is not evenly distributed in soil and may not be readily available for micro-organisms. In addition, the heavy metals that have been found in certain parts of the site seems to inhibit the microbial activity. The bioremediation of contaminated soils aims to reach certain acceptable contaminant concentration in soil and groundwater, and the development of the remediation process needs to be monitored. The chemical analyses of the contaminant are needed, but especially in heterogeneous soils, extensive sampling over a long period of time may be required in order to detect any significant changes. More reliable and faster methods are often needed to evaluate the efficiency of the remediation at a contaminated site. The most common methods to estimate the microbial activity and the degradation potential in contaminated soils are respiration measurements and mineralization experiments with the contaminants (Atlas and Bartha, 1992). The abundance and activity of genes involved in contaminant degradation can be estimated using the novel molecular techniques (Schneegurt and Kulpa, 1998). One single method may not give enough information about the degradation activity, but when combined, the bioremediation process can be monitored and adjusted when needed.

TI  - Is increased maternal basking an adaptation or a pre-adaptation to viviparity in lizards?
VL  - 305
IS  - 6
SP  - 524-535
AB  - Pregnant females modify their thermoregulatory behaviour in many species of viviparous (live-bearing) reptiles, typically maintaining higher and more stable body temperatures at this time. Such modifications often have been interpreted as adaptations to viviparity, functioning to accelerate embryonic development and/or modify phenotypic traits of hatchlings. An alternative possibility is that similar maternal thermophily may be widespread also in oviparous species and if so, would be a pre-adaptation (rather than an adaptation) to viviparity. Because eggs are retained in utero for a significant proportion of development even in oviparous reptiles, maternal thermophily might confer similar advantages in oviparous as in viviparous taxa. Experimental trials on montane oviparous scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) support the pre-adaptation hypothesis. First, captive females (both reproductive and non-reproductive) selected higher temperatures than males. Second, experimentally imposing thermal regimes on pregnant females significantly affected their oviposition dates and the phenotypic traits (body shape, running speed) of their hatchlings. Thus, as for many other behavioural correlates of pregnancy in viviparous reptiles, maternal thermophily likely may have already been present in the ancestral oviparous taxa that gave rise to present-day viviparous forms. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - As a test of the hypothesis that adult temperature stress is an important component of natural selection maintaining the α-gpdh polymorphism, we have looked for differential survival among genotypes subjected to (i) heat shock and (ii) cold shock. Factorial ANOVAR, taking account of genotype, sex and temperature-stress indicated that genotype did not contribute to the variance of survival proportion per vial. We have not therefore found evidence to support our hypothesis. Incidental to the above was a significant sex-temperature interaction. Thus, adult females showed higher survival than males under heat stress, while under cold stress, there was no indication of a survival difference between the sexes. © 1979 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The feasibility of In-Mold-Graining (IMG) has been proven through initial applications. Despite this, there is still a lack of detailed knowledge about the correlations that ensure the uniform reproduction of structured mould surfaces in thermoforming. The processing of multilayer laminates for soft-touch applications constitutes an additional challenge. In this paper, a heating concept for trilaminate materials (grainable layer/foam layer/compact layer) is presented to ensure an optimum forming result through a selective temperature distribution over the thickness of the material. The local pressure conditions between the trilaminate and the mold surface are investigated as a dominating influencing factor with respect to product quality.

TI  - Sexual selection fails to promote adaptation to a new environment
VL  - 56
IS  - 4
SP  - 721-730
AB  - Selection can be divided into sexual and nonsexual components. Some work finds that a component of sexual selection, adaptive female selection for good genes, can promote nonsexual fitness. Less studied is the benefit from sexual selection in toto, that is, when intra- and intersexual selection are both present and able to affect females directly and indirectly. Here an upper bound for the net benefit of sexual selection is estimated for Drosophila melanogaster. Replicate populations were allowed to adapt to low-grade thermal stress, with or with out the operation of sexual selection. Because proteins and lipids are highly sensitive to temperature, low-grade thermal stress will select broadly across the genome for alternative alleles. Such broad, directional selection for thermal tolerance should increase the measurable benefits of sexual selection far beyond that available under stabilizing selection. Sexual selection was removed by enforced monogamy without mate choice and retained by enforced polyandry (four males per female). After 36 generations of thermal stress exposure, there was substantial adaptation to the new environment (the net reproductive rate increased six standard deviations relative to thermal controls). However, sexual selection did not affect the rate of adaptation. Therefore, adaptive female selection for thermal tolerance either was insignificant or negated by other aspects of sexual selection, for example, male-induced female harm, which has been shown to diminish under monogamy. This experiment employed two parameters that reduced the opportunity for divergence in such harm: a truncated intersexual interaction period and strong directional selection for thermal tolerance. No divergence in male-induced harm was observed.

AB  - A comparative study of the parthienogenetic and amphigonic egg development of Aphids, has shown and clear resemblance between some aspects of the two maturative processes. In the amphigonie egg bivalents become indistinet soon after the stage of highest contraction. In the parthenogenetie egg however the bivalents the stae of highest contraction. In the parthenogenetie egg however the bivalents separate and the diploid number of chromosomes is restored within the nuelear membrane. The second maturative division originates, in the partheogenetic egg a single diploid polar body. In the amphigoni egg the emission of two aploid polar bodies occurs in the normal way. In both ovogenetic processes the bivalents reach threfore the highest contraction stage before the «resting» stage. A delay in the beginning of the resting stage of the nucleus is shown therefore in the egg maturation of Aphids, which is not shown in most other Inscets orders. Such peeculiar behaiour of the chromosomes of the amphigonic egg of Aphids has probably permitted the establishment of endomeiosis in the parthenogenetie infividuals and consequently has brought about the genetie variability found in single parthenogenetic lines of Aphids. 30 parthenogenetic femals have been bred in two thermostats: 15 of them at a temperature of 18°C and 15 at 28°C, Light intensity. moisture and food supplies were kept constantly identieal in both thermostats. The eytological study of the embryos demostrated that endomeiosis occurs in the female individuals kept at 18°C and at 28°C normally ameiotie parthenogenesis occurs. Temperature influences therefore endomeiosis. This is the reason why meiotic stages in the maturation of Aphid’s parthenogenetic eggs have been only irregularly observed by previous Authors. The presence of endomeiosis in a few embryos in individuals bred at 28°C shows on the other hand the existence of genotypes with favour endomeiosis in spite of the high temperature. Sclection for winged individuals and for apterous individuals respectively in lines originated from a single female, was obtaind in environmental constant conditions. Moreover selection for parthenogenetic individuals has been obtained in environment conditions which are favourable for the appearance of the sexual forms. The different results of selection demonstrte the existence of lines which are less able than others to produce sexual individuals. It is possible to select in the former lines for the appearance of parthenogenetic individuals even in environmental conditions which are not favourable for their development. Selection experiments in controlled environment have thus demonstrated the functionality of endomeiosis as a source of genetie varibility and the existence of multifactorial mechanisms for the determination of some characters. The importance of environmental factors influence populations having different multiple genotypes sven within single parthenogenetic lines. Therefore the individuals of such lines react differently in accordance with their different genotypes. © 1962 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The relationship between thermal and reproductive biology is complex and poorly understood. We measured selected body temperatures (T(sel)) for the viviparous gecko Hoplodactylus maculatus. T(sel) was compared among pregnant females, nonpregnant females, and males from two sites: a cool site with bi enniallyreproducing geckos and a warm site with annually reproducing geckos. T(sel) was measured at five times of day during three seasons and compared with microhabitat temperature (T(top)) and field body temperature (T(b)). T(sel) varied with time of day in all comparisons, and the effect of reproductive condition on T(sel) differed between sites and seasons. At both sites, when T(sel) differed between reproductive conditions, pregnant females had higher T(sel) than nonpregnant females and males. Stage of pregnancy affected the degree of elevation of T(sel). Measurements of microhabitat temperature and field T(b) showed that, even in the warmest season, geckos rarely had the opportunity to achieve T(sel) at the cool site but were able to do so at the warm site. The elevation of T(sel) with pregnancy is extreme in this species (up to 8°C), which suggests that an increase in T(b) is critical to successful reproduction. Interactions between the effects of time of day, season, and reproductive condition on T(sel) must be considered in the assessment of thermoregulation in reptiles.

SP  - 55-64
AB  - The serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans Haswell, 1883 is an early colonist of new substrata in Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii. When metamorphically competent, larvae of H. elegans will settle rapidly upon an acceptably biofilmed surface, but not on a clean surface. In this study we found the ability of larvae to respond selectively to inductive surfaces to be retained for at least 3 wk. Of a series of bacterial strains isolated from Hawaiian marine biofilms, 13 induced larval settlement, 11 gave moderate or mixed results, and 10 others did not stimulate the settlement of H. elegans. The amount of settlement induced by monospecific strains was rarely as great as with natural, multispecies films. Most of the isolated bacteria were motile Gram-negative rods, but Gram-positive strains were also present, and diverse metabolic types were represented in the study. Biofilms killed by treatment with heat, ultraviolet radiation or chemical fixatives were no longer inductive. Soluble, dialyzable, heat-stable bacterial products induced settlement and metamorphosis more slowly. The range of bacteria producing an inductive signal suggests either that there are multiple cues, or that the cue is common to many bacteria. Chemical signals characteristic of early microbial biofilms may indicate freshly available substrata with optimal potential for the growth and survival of H. elegans.

AB  - Natural selection for increased pupal weight and fecunidty occurs in a wide range of field conditions but the genetic variation is expressed less strongly than in the laboratory. There is a limit, beyond which no further response to selection for increased fecundity occurs. Genotypes close to the limit experience sharply reduced fecundity irrespective of phenotypic size. So 2 butterflies, of the same weight, lay very different numbers of eggs, according to their genotypes. These mechanisms stabilize average size and fecundity at levels which are roughly optimal for the population in field conditions. The data contradict the current dogma that individual competitive advantages take precedence over the welfare of the population as a whole. The amount of genetic variation in pupal weight is limited by the ecological effects of high and low field temperatures on larval survival. -Author Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research, C.S.I.R.O., P.O.Box 84, Lyneham, A.C.T. 2602, Australia.

TI  - Temperature-assisted high hydrostatic pressure inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus in a ham model system: Evaluation in selective and nonselective medium
VL  - 104
IS  - 6
SP  - 1764-1773
AB  - Aism: The purpose of this study was to investigate the inactivation kinetics of Staphylococcus aureus in a ham model system by high hydrostatic pressure at ambient (25 degrees C) and selected temperatures (45, 55 degrees C). Selective [Baird Parker (BP) agar] and nonselective [brain heart infusion (BHI) agar] growth media were used for enumeration in order to count viable and sublethally injured cells. Methods and Resutls: The micro-organism was exposed to a range of pressures (450, 500, 550, 600 MPa) at ambient temperature (25 degrees C) for up to 45 min. Additionally, the behaviour of the micro-organism was evaluated at mild temperatures in combination with high pressure treatment, namely: (i) 350, 400 and 450 MPa at 45 degrees C; and (ii) 350 and 400 MPa at 55 degrees C, for up to 12 min. Inactivation kinetics were calculated in terms of D-p and z(p) values. Survival curves of S. aureus at ambient temperature were mostly linear, whereas when temperature was applied, tailing was observed in most survival curves. The estimated D-p values and therefore the number of surviving cells, were substantially higher on the selective BP agar in the whole range of pressures applied, indicating that S. aureus showed greater recovery in the selective BP agar than the nonselective BHI agar. Samples pressurized at ambient temperature needed higher pressures (over 500 MPa) to achieve a reduction of the population of the pathogen more than 5 log CFU ml(-1). The same level of inactivation was achieved at lower pressure levels when mild heating was simultaneously applied. Indeed, more than 6 log CFU ml(-1) reductions were obtained at 400 MPa and 55 degrees C within the first 7 min of the process in BHI medium. Conclusion: Elevated temperatures allowed lower pressure levels and shorter processing times of pathogen inactivation than at room temperature. Greater recovery of the pathogen was observed in the selective (BP agar) medium, regardless of pressure and temperature applied. Significance and Impact of the Study: The obtained kinetics could be employed by the industry in selecting optimum pressure/temperature processing conditions. Attention must be given to the selection of the enumeration medium, as the use of an inappropriate medium would lead to underestimation of the surviving cells, thus imposing a risk in the microbiological safety of the product.

TI  - Evolution of total net fitness in thermal lines: Drosophila subobscura likes it 'warm'
VL  - 20
IS  - 6
SP  - 2361-2370
AB  - Fisher's fundamental theorem states that heritable variation for net fitness sets a limit to the rate of response to natural selection. How will temperate (i.e. cold-tolerant) species cope with contemporary rapid global warming? Using three-fold replicated lines of Drosophila subobscura that had been allowed to evolve for 4 years (between 32 and 59 generations) at 13 °C (cold), 18 °C (the supposed optimum temperature), and 22 °C (warm) I assess here how net fitness changes according to thermal environments. Net fitness was estimated following the classical approach in population genetics of competing over a number of generation in outbred experimental populations multiple wild-type O chromosomes (homologous to arm 3R in D. melanogaster) independently derived from each base thermal stock in an otherwise homogeneous genetic background against a balancer chromosome. Warm-adapted populations ('warm-adapted O chromosomes') performed comparatively well at all tested temperatures. However, net fitness was severely reduced in cold-adapted populations when transferred to warmer conditions. It seems, therefore, that thermal fitness breath for D. subobscura flies is positively associated to temperature. These findings are discussed in relation to the fast world-wide clinal shifts in the frequency of genetic markers correlated with current climate change. © 2007 The Author.

VL  - 17

SP  - 95-106
AB  - We have used transposon Tn5 mutagenesis to insert a promoter-less luxAB gene-cassette into multiple locations in the chromosome of a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, thereby bringing the lux reporter genes under the control of resident promoters. To identify reporter bacteria responsive to nutritional stresses we isolated and characterized a collection of 23 gene fusions consistently displaying bioluminescence under nitrogen starvation and 12 phosphorus starvation inducible fusions. Bioluminescence of one group of mutants was induced after 4 to 6 h of starvation and was continuously expressed at a high level, whereas a second group was induced earlier and the bioluminescence subsequently declined. Finally, a third group was induced later after 24 h of starvation. Four strains were selected for further study, namely, two Tn5-lux containing strains which were induced by nitrogen starvation and two strains induced by phosphorus starvation. Another two strains, carrying constitutively expressed lux fusions, were included as controls. An analysis of biochemical characters, as well as LPS and protein composition, did not reveal any discernible differences between the mutants and the wild-type strain. Survival experiments with the selected Tn5-lux containing strains showed that they all performed comparably to the wild-type under carbon and nitrogen starvation, whereas some of the strains were less resistant to phosphorus starvation. Expression of bioluminescence by the mutants during carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus starvation was detectable even after 18 days and was not affected by high osmolarity or low temperature. © 1995.

TI  - Physique index for Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata): Age change and regional variation
VL  - 104
IS  - 4
SP  - 305-323
AB  - A Physique index was devised for evaluation of fatness in Japanese macaques. Parameters for a function of the physique index were statistically obtained from body weight and trunk length of immature monkeys of Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. Index-male is expressed as 1.01 * [Body weight (Kg)]* [Anterior trunk length](-2,3) * 10(7), and Index-female is 1.05 * [Body weight]* [Anterior trunk length](-2,3) * 10(7). The indices show an age change pattern common to the both sexes; an infants index which starts at 100 decreases with age during juvenile period till four years of age, and then rapidly increases to 120 in males and to 110 in females. The index of males keeps gradual increase, but that of females neither increases nor decreases. Application of physique index to various Japanese monkey groups living in different environments, shows that monkeys in the northern and heavy-snow falling area have a larger index (130-140), and those in the warmer area have a smaller index (ca. 90-100). The larger index means that they show adaptability for winter by means of preservation of energy. Influence of food control is so strong as to change the physique index widely.

VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SP  - 69-90
AB  - The dark decay of the surface potential on a corona-charged insulator on a grounded metal is examined theoretically by considering a xerographic depletion discharge process which involves thermal bulk generation of mobile charge carriers of the same sign as the surface charge, and their subsequent sweep-out, leaving behind a depleted volume of oppositely charged ionic centers in the bulk. Expressions are derived for the time evolution of the surface voltage discharge rate in the case when emission of charge carriers occurs from an arbitrary and an exponential distribution of density of localized states deep in the mobility gap, the latter of the form N = N0 exp... - (-χ0/ W.... It is shown that for the case of an exponential density of states the demarcation energy concept, which has been widely used in depletion discharge analysis, remains valid and predicts the correct time dependence of the surface voltage. Conditions are also derived under which the demarcation energy concept can be applied to an arbitrary distribution of density of states. The case of field-enhanced xerographic depletion discharge is considered in detail and an expression is derived for the space and time dependence of the electric field, E(x,t), in the sample. It is shown that due to a Poolo-Frenkel type of field-assisted bulk thermal generation, the field no longer falls linearly across the specimen. The time evolution of surface potential and its rate of change are numerically evaluated from the electric field function E(x,t). The dependence of the depletion time on the charging voltage is investigated for density of states distributions with different widths and for different Poole-Frenkel coefficients. Although at the highest charging voltages the depletion time saturates, the half-life time (the time for the surface voltage to decay to half its initial value) actually decreases with the charging voltage after going through a maximum. The behavior of both the depletion time and half-time with the changing voltage is in agreement with recent xerographic dark decay experiments reported on α-Se:Te alloy electrophotographic photoreceptors. © 1989.

AB  - A series of halogen-substituted 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl ligands and their iron and cobalt complexes [{2,6-(2,6-X1X2C6H3 N=CCH3)2C5H3N}MCl2] (X1 = X2 = Br, M = Fe (1), Co (2); X1 = X2 = Cl, M = Fe (3), Co (4); X1 = Cl, X2 = H, M = Fe (5), Co (6); X1 = Br, X2 = H, M = Fe (7), Co (8); X1 = I, X2 = H, M = Fe (9), Co (10)) and [M{2,6-(2,6-X1X2C6H3N= CCH3)2C5H3 N}2]2+-[MCl4]2- (X1 = F, X2 = H, M = Fe (11)) have been synthesized. The molecular structures of complexes 1, 8, 9, 10, and 11 were determined by X-ray diffraction. Crystallographic analyses indicate that 1, 8, 9, and 10 are five-coordinate complexes, while 11 is an ion-pair complex with one six-coordinate iron center and one four-coordinate iron center. These metal coordinative complexes, activated by modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), lead to highly active ethylene polymerization and/or oligomerization catalysts. The catalyst productivity and product properties crucially depended on the metal center and the halogen substituents on the aryl rings. The catalyst productivities are in the range of (0-73.0) × 106 g/mol of cat·h. The species 11, having ion-pair structure, is inactive. In particular, the product molar masses were changed from high molar mass (Mw of 377 000) to low molar mass oligomers by varying the halogen substituents. NMR and thermal analyses reveal the polymer is highly linear. The oligomer products follow a Schulz-Flory distribution with high selectivity for linear α-olefins. The effects of reaction condition on the polymerization and oligomerization have also been studied.

AB  - The transient behavior of the longitudinal magnetization of the mobile protons in aqueous heterogeneous materials is investigated both theoretically and experimentally when selective saturation is applied by off resonance, RF irradiation to the homogeneously broadened, immobile protons which are coupled to the mobile protons through cross relaxation. Analytical solution of this problem is obtained by a generalization of H. C. Torrey's solution to the Bloch equations. Progressive (but indirect) saturation of the magnetization of the mobile protons under this RF irradiation is dynamically monitored using very-small-tip-angle sampling pulses. The apparent relaxation rate of heat-denatured egg albumin was measured as a function of frequency offset of the saturating RF with different amplitudes using a new dispersion method modified from a broadband technique recently invented for the rapid acquisition of a cross-relaxation z spectrum. © 1992.

SP  - 151-156
AB  - The rattle phenomenon that occurs when starting a vehicle in very cold weather is explained using a nonlinear lumped torsional model to simulate a gearbox in neutral rollover conditions. It is assumed that environmental temperature affects the lubricant viscosity and consequently the internal drag torques. It should be noted that the drag torques influence both mean steady-state and vibratory responses of the powertrain. Simulated results are given for selected temperatures and comments on the resulting sound quality are made by assuming that the radiated rattle noise is related to angular accelerations. A sample design study is also conducted to show the importance of the clutch-flywheel subsystem.

TI  - An investigation of building physical properties selection to combat global warming
SP  - 623-633
AB  - Global warming can have a significant impact on building energy performance and indoor thermal environment, as well as the health and productivity of people living and working inside them. Through the building simulation technique, this paper investigates the adaptation potential of different selections of building physical properties to increased outdoor temperature in Australia. It is found that overall, an office building with lower insulation level, smaller window to wall ratio and/or a glass type with lower shading coefficient, and lower internal load density will have the effect of lowering building cooling load and total energy use, and therefore have a better potential to adapt to the warming external climate. Compared with clear glass, it is shown that the use of reflective glass for the sample building with WWR being 0.5 reduces the building cooling load by more than 12%. A lower internal load can also have a significant impact on the reduction of building cooling load, as well as the building energy use. Through the comparison of results between current and future weather scenarios, it is found that the patterns found in the current weather scenario also exist in the future weather scenarios, but to a smaller extent.

TI  - Effects of beaver on the thermal biology of an amphibian
VL  - 3

SP  - 483-486
AB  - It is often assumed that ecological interactions happen at rapid rates relative to evolutionary change. In this study we examined the development and physiology of an amphibian (Rana sylvatica) from populations found in forested wetlands, and from wetlands that had been cleared by reinvading beaver (Castor canadensis). Embryos from beaver wetlands hatched at lower rates when raised in a shaded, common garden setting compared with embryos from forested wetlands. Larvae from beaver wetlands had higher critical thermal maxima compared with conspecifics from forested wetlands. These patterns suggest that R. sylvatica populations may have diverged rapidly (in less than 36 years) in response to changes in their environment induced by another species. Other agents of thermal change, such as anthropogenic landscape conversion or alteration of global Climate, could have analogous impacts on wetland dependent species such as amphibians.

TI  - Cytocompatibility of thermally oxidized Ti-Ag alloys
SP  - 511-514
AB  - This study examined the cytocompatibility of implants materials Ti-Ag alloys, of which mechanical and electrochemical superiority to cp-Ti or Ti6Al4V were verified.[1] The MTT test for L-929, the fibroblast connective tissues, and proliferation test for MC3TC-E1, the osteoprogenitor cells were performed on cp-Ti, Ti6Al4V, and Ti-Ag alloys thermally oxidized at selected temperatures for different durations. The MTT test showed 100% of cell viability in Ti-Ag alloys, which explained the slightest adverse effect of ions released concerned. In the proliferation test, the cell population was roughly increased as cultivation proceeded. The temperature, not duration, affected considerably thermal oxidation behavior and its effect on biocompatibility of specimens. Ti-Ag alloys treated at 600 °C showed better cytocompatibility and surface morphology than Ti or Ti6Al4V for short-term biocompatibility tests.

TI  - Effects of fluctuating and constant temperatures on early development and survival of colorado squawfish
VL  - 123
IS  - 4
SP  - 574-579
AB  - A laboratory study was conducted to determine the effects of four constant temperatures (18, 22, 26, and 30-degrees-C) and three fluctuating temperatures (diel fluctuations of +/- 2.5-degrees-C around 18, 22, and 26-degrees-C) on early development and survival of Colorado squawfish Ptychocheilus lucius, which is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Department of the interior. Average hatch in constant and fluctuating temperatures was 72% at 18-degrees-C, 67% at 22-degrees-C, 62% at 26-degrees-C, and 38% (constant temperature only) at 30-degrees-C. There was no significant difference in hatch between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Average survival of larvae to 7 d posthatch in constant and fluctuating temperatures was 68% at 18-degrees-C, 64% at 22-degrees-C, 83% at 26-degrees-C, and 13% (constant temperature only) at 30-degrees-C. Survival of larvae at 30-degrees-C may have been confounded by a relatively low hatch of embryos and poor condition of larvae. Survival of larvae was 10-31% higher in fluctuating than in constant temperatures. Incidence of abnormalities was 2-22% at 18-26-degrees-C and 100% al 30-degrees-C. Differences in abnormality rates were not detectable between constant and fluctuating temperatures. Times to start of hatch, swim bladder inflation, and exogenous feeding were shorter at higher temperatures. First feeding occurred about 31 h earlier in fluctuating temperatures than in constant temperatures. Differences in lengths of larvae at hatching and on day 7 posthatch at the various test temperatures were small and not considered ecologically significant. Tolerance of a relatively wide range of high water temperatures by Colorado squawfish embryos and larvae may reflect the historically variable Colorado River environments in which the species evolved. Low summer water temperatures caused by mainstream dams have eliminated Colorado squawfish from portions of its historic range in the Colorado River basin. Water temperatures that more closely reflect historic regimes are necessary to restore self-sustaining populations of Colorado squawfish in those areas.

TI  - Latitudinal and population specific differences in timing of daily and seasonal functions in redpolls (Acanthis flammea)
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 211-227
AB  - 1. The daily (circadian) rhythm of activity and rest of common redpolls (Acanthis f. flammea L.) from 65°N lat. was measured for about one year in individuals outdoors at two latitudes (48° and 65°N). During winter at both latitudes, activity-time (α) of common redpolls approximated the duration of daylight (including civil twilights); onset of activity, however, occurred at lower light intensities than end of activity. During mid-summer, a rest-time (p) of ca. 5 h was maintained at both latitudes. During the times of spring and fall migration (extending into summer or winter, respectively), common redpolls showed nightly unrest or shifted their onset of daily activity into the pre-dawn hours. 2. Redpolls of two subspecies (A. f. flammea and A. f. cabaret Müller) resident at different latitudes (ca. 65° and 49°N) were maintained and measured under the same light conditions at 48°N lat. The two populations showed significant differences in their responses to the same annual changes in day length which included: (i) differences in the timing of the circadian activity rhythm with respect to the daily solar cycle; (ii) differences in the amount and range of seasonal changes in nightly unrest; (iii) differences in the mean level and range of seasonal changes of body weight; and (iv) differences in the timing of postnuptial molt. 3. In all experimental groups of redpolls, the highest "precision" (i.e. lowest mean day-to-day variation) in onset and end of activity was observed when both phases occurred during the twilights. The different effects of annually changing light conditions on onset and end of activity with respect to solar time indicated that timing of these two phases of the activity rhythm is independently controlled. It is further indicated that an annually changing sensitivity to light controls the termination of activity in common redpolls, although ambient temperature can modify this response. 4. Besides the direct influence of latitude on timing and the amount of changes of various circadian and annual functions throughout the year, the important role of long-term (genetic?) adaptation to the light and temperature conditions prevailing in the respective habitats of redpoll populations is emphasized by the results of this study. © 1976 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Hotter is better and broader: Thermal sensitivity of fitness in a population of bacteriophages
VL  - 173
IS  - 4
SP  - 419-430
AB  - Hotter is better is a hypothesis of thermal adaptation that posits that the rate-depressing effects of low temperature on biochemical reactions cannot be overcome by physiological plasticity or genetic adaptation. If so, then genotypes or populations adapted to warmer temperatures will have higher maximum growth rates than those adapted to low temperatures. Here we test hotter is better by measuring thermal reaction norms for intrinsic rate of population growth among an intraspecific collection of bacteriophages recently isolated from nature. Consistent with hotter is better, we find that phage genotypes with higher optimal temperatures have higher maximum growth rates. Unexpectedly, we also found that hotter is broader, meaning that the phages with the highest optimal temperatures also have the greatest temperature ranges. We found that the temperature sensitivity of fitness for phages is similar to that for insects. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Thermal adaptation of Arctic charr: Experimental studies of growth in eleven charr populations from Sweden, Norway and Britain
VL  - 50
IS  - 2
SP  - 353-368
AB  - 1. Experimental growth data for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.), all fed on excess rations, from 11 European watercourses between 54 and 70degreesN were analysed and fitted to a new general growth model for fish. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with the growth rate of charr in the wild. 2. Growth performance varied among populations, mainly because of variation in the maximum growth potential, whereas the thermal response curves were similar. The estimated lower and upper temperatures for growth varied between -1.7 to 5.3 and 20.8-23.2degreesC, respectively, while maximum growth occurred between 14.4 and 17.2degreesC. 3. There was no geographical or climatic trend in growth performance among populations and therefore no indication of thermal adaptation. The growth potential of charr from different populations correlated positively with fish body length at maturity and maximum weight in the wild. Charr from populations including large piscivorous fish had higher growth rates under standardised conditions than those from populations feeding on zoobenthos or zooplankton. Therefore, the adaptive variation in growth potential was related to life-history characteristics and diet, rather than to thermal conditions.

AB  - Environmental conditions likely to exert selective pressures on the isoporan corals Acropora palifera and A. cuneata were examined in 5 habitats on the Heron Island reef, using clonal fragments that simulated juveniles 1-2yr old. By 2 criteria, growth and survival, the corals ranked the habitats in the same order of decreasing favorability (outer flat, crest, lagoon, inner flat, slope). Environmental favorability and stability were not correlated; the worst habitat (slope) was the most stable, the 2nd worst (inner flat) was the most unstable. The habitats differed qualitatively in the physical (eg cold, storms, sedimentation) and biological factors (eg predation, territorial fish) causing stress to corals, and the factors differed quantitatively in the frequency, predictability, duration and intensity of their action. Most deaths occurred in short discrete events superimposed on low 'background' probabilities of death.-from Author

AB  - Brückner Textile Technologies, Germany, has developed a tailor-made multi-functional stenter configuration, based on the Power-Line Stenter Technology that offers shortest possible fabric path to the stenter for coated and tension-sensitive knitted and woven fabrics. The multifunctional technology ensures the auto-introduction of coated fabric and provides automatic depinning protection clamps to ensure smooth fabric transport. The thermal process zones of the stenter are provided with the typical split-flow air circulation, allowing separately adjustable intensity of hot air impingement to the upper and lower side of the fabric in each section. This technology involving hot air generated by a direct gas heating system guarantees exactly controlled process temperatures that can be selected in the range of 80 to 230 °Celsius. The stenter configuration provides higher efficiency and productivity and is flexible with multi-functional production requirements.

SP  - 117-124
AB  - Developing eggs of the winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus (Walbaum) were exposed to 9 combinations of cadmium and salinity at 5° and 10°C. Overall mean times to 50% hatch ranged from 7.7 days at 10°C to 17.9 days at 5°C. Mean percentages of total hatches ranged from 50 to 100% for all treatment combinations. Response-surface analyses indicate percentages of viable hatches were generally lowest at 10% S and highest in the 25 to 30% S range. Regression analyses of viable hatch data show that at both temperatures cadmium significantly influenced viable hatch in all experiments. Viable hatch was also significantly influenced by the linear and quadratic effect of salinity in both tests at 5°C and in 2 of 3 tests at 10°C. The interaction between cadmium and salinity also significantly affected viable hatch at 10°C. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Fine-scale variation in the timing of reproduction in titmice and chickadees
AB  - This chapter discusses the fine-scale regulation of the timing of clutch initiation and fertility in Parids. This topic, which is the subject of long-term research studies on Eurasian tits and, recently, North American chickadees, considers the interaction between annual variation in weather patterns and food availability in regulating seasonal and individual variation in nest timing. Evidence from a variety of populations of tits reveals that clutch initiation is determined by a hierarchy of cues. Photoperiod regulates timing at the coarsest level, while temperature and food availability fine tune the onset of egg-laying within the year. There is ample evidence that females face costs in a number of fitness components if their reproduction is not optimally timed. In spite of all this evidence, some questions remain concerning the inter-relationships of timing, temperature, and female quality. It is also not clear why selection has not weeded out females that breed late. The current emphasis on the relationship of female timing to climate change may reveal the ability of populations to respond to selection for earlier laying and their changing sensitivity to the relevant cues. © Oxford University Press, 2007.

AB  - The demographic performance of a laboratory strain of Phthorimaea operculella (Zell.) was characterised by measurements of seven parameters under standard breeding conditions at six constant temperatures. The parameters were fertility, larval survival, sex ratio, weight of females, fecundity, development time and adult life-span. This information provides reference values which would be useful in experiments designed to determine the demographic effects of treatments, to identify strains and genetic populations of the species, and eventually to detect evolutionary changes in the specific properties of forms under study. The results of this investigation could be used in constructing simulation models of the species’ life system. © 1980, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Physiological responses of the common clownfish, Amphiprion ocellaris (Cuvier), to factors related to packaging and long-distance transport by air
VL  - 127
IS  - 4
SP  - 347-361
AB  - The physiological response of the common clownfish, A. ocellaris, to factors pertinent to air transportation conditions was studied in three stages: (i) determination of temperature effect and exposure process on oxygen consumption rates; (ii) elucidation of excretion trends of selected metabolites in simulated packaging experiments, and (iii) preliminary tolerance studies of some packaging parameters. Temperature significantly affected the metabolic rates of the clownfish. Q(10) values were relatively constant in fish exposed to sudden changes in temperature (from 25 degrees C to either 15, 20, 30 or 35 degrees C). Those treated with gradual changes in temperature showed much greater increases in oxygen consumption at temperatures above 25 degrees C. The temperature selected for subsequent experiments was 25 degrees C. Dissolved oxygen levels of packaging water remained high throughout the 48-h period. Water [H+] and total dissolved and unionized CO2 concentrations changed most significantly during the initial 24 h and then levelled off by 48 h. Similarities in changes of concentrations between these imply close interaction between the measured variables. The total dissolved NH3 continued to increase with no signs of levelling off. The concentrations of unionized NH3 increased four-fold to 1.4 mu M The excretion of CO2 decreased linearly at a rate of 150 nmol/g per h while the excretion of NH3 increased at a rate of 97 nmol/g per h. A temperature range between 24 and 32 degrees C was found to be necessary for survival of the fish with an optimal temperature of 27 degrees C. Clownfish started to die when the pH of the seawater fell to 6.34 or total dissolved NH3 rose above 0.97 mM ([unionized NH3] = 38.35 mu M). At 15 degrees C, the fish started to die at 20 mm Hg which was twice the oxygen level at 20 degrees C or above.

TI  - Enhancement of combined heat and power economic dispatch using self adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm
VL  - 86
IS  - 6
SP  - 915-921
AB  - In this paper, a self adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm (SARGA) is implemented to solve the combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem. The self adaptation is achieved by means of tournament selection along with simulated binary crossover (SBX). The selection process has a powerful exploration capability by creating tournaments between two solutions. The better solution is chosen and placed in the mating pool leading to better convergence and reduced computational burden. The SARGA integrates penalty parameterless constraint handling strategy and simultaneously handles equality and inequality constraints. The population diversity is introduced by making use of distribution index in SBX operator to create a better offspring. This leads to a high diversity in population which can increase the probability towards the global optimum and prevent premature convergence. The SARGA is applied to solve CHPED problem with bounded feasible operating region which has large number of local minima. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can find a solution towards the global optimum and compares favourably with other recent methods in terms of solution quality, handling constraints and computation time.

TI  - Magnetization for lower temperature, selective diamond and carbon nanotube formation: A milestone in carbon physicochemical condensation
VL  - 95

SP  - 2702-2712
AB  - Diamonds and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have extraordinary properties with the potential for vast technological and scientific advancements. However, the syntheses of these super materials have required extreme conditions. Recent synthetic developments surrounding catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) have contributed to more suitable, practical and economical preparations, but more progress is needed for better selectivity, purity, and mass production of CNTs and diamonds. Such synthetic advancements require a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of formation on the atomic scale. A recent comprehensive mechanism of Little suggests the importance of high-spin electronic states and the rehybridization mechanics of carbon atoms and metal atoms (for catalytic synthesis) during the nucleation and growth of CNTs and diamonds. The significance of these predictions is demonstrated in this work by using an intense, static magnetic field of several teslas to influence carbon fixation events during carbon CCVD. Single crystalline diamonds are discovered to nucleate and grow under the influence of the static magnetic field (19.3 T) under catalytic CVD conditions that normally result in carbon nanotubes. Furthermore, this technique results in a bottom-up approach for creating diamond nucleation sites on the basis of a so-called chemical preabrasion of the silicon substrate with the potential advantage of the control of seeding nucleation-site density and nonrandom patterning for larger single crystal diamond syntheses. This technique also provides a basis for diamond-CNT composite super materials. Moreover, the observed influence of high magnetic field on diamond formation provides implications concerning natural diamond genesis in the earth's mantle and core in comparison to celestial diamond formation. Furthermore, these findings suggest uses of polarized and nonpolarized neutron irradiation for static and dynamic magnetic interactions, leading to diamond and CNT productivity, respectively.

AB  - Postlarval and juvenile spots were acclimated to selected constant temperatures and to diel temperature cycles. Following acclimation they were exposed to temperature shocks from 0 C (control) to 20 C above acclimation temperatures. Twenty-four-hour median lethal shock temperatures (LS50 values) were calculated by probit analysis. The temperature cycles used had no apparent effect on the thermal shock resistance of either postlarval or juvenile spots relative to constant-temperature acclimation. When acclimated at the same temperatures, postlarvae had lower thermal shock resistances than juveniles. Most mortality occurred within 10 minutes of shock onset. © 1979 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Major episodic increases of continental crustal growth determined from zircon ages of river sands; implications for mantle overturns in the Early Precambrian
VL  - 146
IS  - 1
SP  - 369-394
AB  - In order to better understand continental growth history, we have determined the U-Pb age of about 1500 detrital zircons from river sands in three major rivers in North America and South America, and have estimated the rate of continental growth in order to discuss the linkage between continental growth and the thermal evolution of the mantle. The method for estimating continental growth from the age population of a significant number of detrital zircons in river sands has three advantages; (1) the almost even collection of zircons from sedimentary rocks and granitic basements in the hinterlands of the major rivers, (2) determination of the age of juvenile crust due to the high closure temperature of the U-Pb systematics of zircons, and the removal of the influence of recycling of crustal materials within the continental crust, and (3) direct determination of the age of continental formation. The age population of zircons in the river sands of the Mississippi River shows four peaks at 2.6-2.8, 1.7-1.8, 1.1-1.5 and 0.2-0.5 Ga, the peaks corresponding to periods of major crustal formation of the Ouachita orogenic belt, the Grenville orogenic belt, the Yavapai-Mazatzal orogenic belt and Wyoming province in North America. The areal distribution of each orogenic belt is 11, 20, 3 3, and 14%, respectively, and this agrees with the age population of the zircons. This fact confirms the validity of the calculation of continental formation from the age population of zircons in river sands. In contrast, the age population of zircons in river sands of the Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers displays major peaks at 2.4-2.7, 1.0-1.9 and 0.2 Ga, and at 2.4-2.7, 1.9-2.2 and 1.0-1.5 Ga, respectively. However, the age distribution of the surface rocks in the drainage basins of the Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers also comprises widely-distributed young orogenic belts. This discrepancy suggests that the young orogenic belts were formed through recycling of older materials, and that essentially no juvenile continental crusts grew at those times. Our new continental growth curve estimated from the age populations of zircons in the river sands of the Mississippi, Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers indicates continuous growth of continental crust since the Archean and major abrupt increases in the Late Archean and early Proterozoic. The continental growth curve reflects episodic increase of the volume of continental crust at 1.9-2.3 and 2.5-2.8 Ga. The mantle overturn model provides the best explanation for the episodic growth of the continents. Accordingly, our data suggest that mantle overturn occurred at 1.9-2.3 and 2.5-2.8 Ga. If the mantle temperature were high enough in the Archean, indicated by geologic records to be ca. 150 K higher than that of modem MORB-source mantle (e.g., [Lithos 37 (1996) 199; Phys. Earth Planet. Int., in this issue]), a consequent higher Rayleigh number than at present would have favored double-layered mantle convection. If this were the case, the upper mantle would have behaved as a stagnant lid. On the other hand, it was also responsible for the production of large quantities of MORB that were later subducted beneath island arcs. The subducted material accumulated on the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, and consequently caused catastrophic downwelling into the lower mantle. The catastrophic sinking of the material induced a new influx of recycled material from the lower mantle, resulting in mantle overturn. As a consequence, superplumes and plumes ascended from the core-mantle boundary and the deep mantle, to give rise to large igneous provinces, flood basalts and oceanic plateaus. Episodic continental growth resulted from the mantle overturn because the influx of hotter and fertile materials from the lower mantle revitalized the upper mantle to produce large quantities of MORB and subsequent sialic continental crust through slab-melting.

AB  - For ectothermic reptiles, habitat selection is mechanistically linked to fitness through the temperature-dependence of performance. Many reptiles occupy thermally heterogeneous environments and regulate their body temperature through selective use of habitats within their environments, making reptiles ideal subjects to understand the fitness consequences of habitat use. Our goal here was to investigate the link between habitat selection, thermoregulation, and fitness by comparing the expected distribution of performance for real ratsnakes that thermoregulate through selective use of habitat with the performance of hypothetical snakes that are assumed to use habitats randomly. Thermal data for real snakes were obtained using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters implanted in free-living snakes, whereas thermal data for hypothetical snakes were obtained by sampling environmental temperatures that a randomly moving snake would encounter. Thermal data were then transformed into performance using an experimentally derived equation relating performance (swimming speed) to temperature. Habitat selection allowed snakes to avoid lethal temperatures and resulted in an average improvement of 18% in locomotor performance. A more exact measure of the fitness improvement accrued through habitat selection will have to await data relating body temperature to ultimate measures of fitness and a deeper understanding of the contribution of different performances to fitness.

AB  - Geographic distribution and population success of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are affected by temperature regimes. Concepts are presented for evaluating alternative temperature regimes for brown trout based on published temperature information and professional judgement. Temperature information from the literature is included for spawning runs, spawning, egg and larval development, growth, and other subjects. The objective is to aid biologists in evaluating alternative temperature regimes so as to select those that will protect and enhance environmental quality for brown trout. -from Author

TI  - Potential impacts of global climate change on freshwater fisheries
VL  - 17
IS  - 4
SP  - 581-613
AB  - Despite uncertainty in all levels of analysis, recent and long-term changes in our climate point to the distinct possibility that greenhouse gas emissions have altered mean annual temperatures, precipitation and weather patterns. Modeling efforts that use doubled atmospheric CO2 scenarios predict a 1-7°C mean global temperature increase, regional changes in precipitation patterns and storm tracks, and the possibility of "surprises" or sudden irreversible regime shifts. The general effects of climate change on freshwater systems will likely be increased water temperatures, decreased dissolved oxygen levels, and the increased toxicity of pollutants. In lotic systems, altered hydrologic regimes and increased groundwater temperatures could affect the quality of fish habitat. In lentic systems, eutrophication may be exacerbated or offset, and stratification will likely become more pronounced and stronger. This could alter food webs and change habitat availability and quality. Fish physiology is inextricably linked to temperature, and fish have evolved to cope with specific hydrologic regimes and habitat niches. Therefore, their physiology and life histories will be affected by alterations induced by climate change. Fish communities may change as range shifts will likely occur on a species level, not a community level; this will add novel biotic pressures to aquatic communities. Genetic change is also possible and is the only biological option for fish that are unable to migrate or acclimate. Endemic species, species in fragmented habitats, or those in east-west oriented systems will be less able to follow changing thermal isolines over time. Artisanal, commercial, and recreational fisheries worldwide depend upon freshwater fishes. Impacted fisheries may make it difficult for developing countries to meet their food demand, and developed countries may experience economic losses. As it strengthens over time, global climate change will become a more powerful stressor for fish living in natural or artificial systems. Furthermore, human response to climate change (e.g., increased water diversion) will exacerbate its already-detrimental effects. Model predictions indicate that global climate change will continue even if greenhouse gas emissions decrease or cease. Therefore, proactive management strategies such as removing other stressors from natural systems will be necessary to sustain our freshwater fisheries. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.

AB  - Maps of interpolated climate normals have recently become essential tools for many types of forestry research, such as studying genetic adaptation of trees to local environments, modeling species ranges shifts, or forest productivity under climate change scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate two widely used climate models for British Columbia with respect to their general precision and regional bias. We discuss limitations due to the resolution of the current "state of the art" PRISM climate model and provide new methodology for "intelligent" up-sampling of the PRISM model for studies that require spatially explicit climate data. In order to stress the importance of choosing an adequate climate model and understanding its limitations, we provide two examples where baseline climate models caused misleading predictions of how the climate envelope of ecosystems shifts as a consequence of increased temperature, and how tree growth may respond to climate change.

VL  - 150

SP  - 183-195
AB  - The sizes at which female and male western rock lobster Panulirus cygnus become mature were examined over 32 years from records at six localities along the coast of Western Australia. The size of males at maturity was estimated from a subset of these data by a morphometric and a physiological method, with both producing statistically similar results. Males were larger at first maturity than females at the same sites. For both sexes, the sizes at first maturity at each location correlated (P&lt;0.05) with the mean annual water temperature at that location, decreasing from south to north along the mainland coast and being smallest at the offshore Abrolhos Islands. Smaller sizes at maturity were recorded for both sexes than have been published previously. One certain explanation for these differences is that management measures protecting females with ovigerous setae have distorted size compositions and the ratio of immature to mature females, thereby increasing the likelihood of capturing small mature females. However, these fishing effects cannot fully account for the progressive decline in CL50 observed over the past 20 years. Other possible hypotheses considered include increases in water temperature over this period, as well as whether this change could be consistent with a genotypic response caused by the selective removal of large lobsters combined with high exploitation rates. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Life history traits can vary among populations of the same fish species in response to selective pressures exerted by the local environment. Here we used inter-population comparisons to investigate the effects of parasitism and variability in water temperature on life history traits in a New Zealand freshwater fish, the upland bully. Although age and size at maturity varied among populations, they were not significantly related to either temperature regime or average parasite load. Trade-offs between egg size and clutch size were only apparent in one of the seven populations when populations were analyzed separately but became clear when all data were pooled. However, neither average population clutch size or egg size was related to the population's mean parasite load or the local temperature regime. Although the latter two parameters may influence other life history variables, such as the number of clutches produced per season and the partitioning of eggs among clutches, there was no evidence that they influenced life history strategies of the upland bully populations investigated here.

AB  - The environmental and genetic control of reproductive growth was studied in S. 170 a variety of Festuca arundinacea Schreb. The variety had induction requirements for short days and low temperatures before inflorescence production could occur, but some genotypes became induced with only short-day treatments. Low temperatures and short days in controlled environment rooms were less effective in bringing about induction than winter conditions in an unheated glasshouse. Only non-additive genetic effects could be shown to be significant in the control of induction requirements. Field studies showed that all inflorescence characters were subject to genetic and genetic x environmental control, and they also indicated that seed weight per inflorescence and seed fertility were most likely to show a response to selection. Diallel analysis under glasshouse conditions showed that the seed fertility and 1000 seed weight of the parental crosses were subject to maternal control, but these effects were not detectable in the next generation. Genetic control of seed fertility and 1000 seed weight in the diallel progeny was mainly additive. © 1969, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on ecological variables (eg food habits, sexual size dimorphism, reproductive mode, fecundity) are used to interpret Australian elapid phylogeny. Cases where 2 genera are very similar support the hypothesis of phylogenetic affinity of these taxa. Cases where congeneric species differ ecologically suggest that the genus may be polyphyletic or that the genus incorporates more than one clearly defined lineage. Information on ecological variables also may illuminate the selective pressures responsible for observed morphological changes, and help to distinguish homologous from analogous similarities between taxa. Broad trends in the Australian elapid radiation may be interpreted with the aid of these ecological data. Most viviparous taxa are identified as a monophyletic lineage. The oviparous Australian proteroglyphs result primarily from an extensive adaptive radiation throughout Australia during a period of relatively high and stable temperatures 15 to 5 MYBP. A sudden temperature decline c5 MYBP favoured the evolution of viviparity in 2 elapid lineages. The rapid speciation and diversification of one of these lineages over the last two million years may be due to isolation in montane refugia during repeated glacial-interglacial cycles. -from Author

SP  - 129-134
AB  - Genetic variation in susceptibility of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., to furunculosis, bacterial kidney disease (BKD) and cold water vibriosis was studied by challenge testing one‐year‐old fingerlings. Fish from 81 full‐sib families within 32 sire progeny groups were infected with Aeromonas salmonicida, Renibacterium salmoninarum and Vibrio salmonicida. Estimated heritabilities were relatively low, being highest for BKD (h2= 0.23) and lowest for cold water vibriosis (h2= 0.13). Genetic correlations between the ability to survive the diseases were all positive, but the magnitude of the genetic correlation between furunculosis and BKD may be biased upwards because some of the dead BKD fish were also infected with furunculosis. The application of selection to develop resistant populations of Atlantic salmon is advocated. Challenge testing seems to be a feasible method, with relatively low costs and easy management. The future response to selection will depend on the relationships between results from a challenge test and mortalities under farming conditions and between disease resistance and other traits in the breeding goal.

TI  - Egg-laying reptiles in cold climates: Determinants and consequences of nest temperatures in montane lizards
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
SP  - 918-926
AB  - Studies on reptilian life-history evolution have emphasized the role of cold climates as a selective force for the evolution of viviparity, but have tended to neglect the many cold-climate reptiles that retain oviparity. Many of these species avoid low incubation temperatures by selecting warm nest-sites, and the evolution of viviparity (by uterine retention and maternal thermoregulation) is an extension of this strategy. However, an alternative pathway exists: reptiles may adapt to low-temperature incubation rather than avoid it. The scincid lizard Nannoscincus maccoyi from high-elevation areas of south-eastern Australia follows this alternative strategy. Field studies show that Nannoscincus selects cooler oviposition sites than does the sympatric heliothermic skink Bassiana duperreyi, owing to differences in the type of cover object (log vs. rock), the size of cover object and the depth to which eggs are buried. These interspecific differences in natural incubation regimes are reflected in the responses of laboratory-incubated eggs to incubation temperature. Bassiana eggs tolerate higher temperatures than do Nannoscincus eggs, but do not develop as rapidly at low temperatures. Incubation at lower temperatures produces a larger, faster hatchling in Nannoscincus, whereas the reverse is true in Bassiana. Thus, Nannoscincus and Bassiana follow different pathways to overcome the difficulties of reproducing in cold climates. Only the Bassiana pathway is likely to be compatible with the evolution of viviparity.

VL  - 97

SP  - 12637-12642
AB  - Ecological differentiation of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and another drosophilid, Zaprionus tuberculatus, in "Evolution Canyon," Mount Carmel, Israel, is well established. The fitness complex of D. melanogaster includes oviposition temperature preferences, tolerance to high temperature, drought stress and starvation, and different longevity patterns. This remarkable differentiation has evolved despite small interslope distances (only 100-400 m). within easy dispersal distance. The differences between populations are those expected from genetic adaptation to local microclimates. How such differentiation could evolve and be maintained despite the likelihood of genetic exchange between populations is a challenging question. We hypothesized that interslope microclimatic differences caused strong differential selection for stress tolerance, accompanied by behavioral differentiation (habitat choice and reduced migration rate), reinforced by sexual isolation. Here we report highly significant mate choice by flies from different slopes of the canyon, with preference for sexual partners originating from the same slope. No preferences were found when the sexual partners belonged to different isofemale lines from the same slope.

VL  - 96

SP  - 702-711
AB  - Arthrospira platensis was cultivated photoautotrophically at 6.0 klux light intensity in 5.0-L open tanks, using a mineral medium containing urea as nitrogen source. Fed-batch experiments were performed at constant flowrate. A central composite factorial design combined to response surface methodology (RSM) was utilized to determine the relationship between the selected response variables (cell concentration after 10 days, Xm, cell productivity, PX, and nitrogen-to-cell conversion factor, YX/N) and codified values of the independent variables (pH, temperature, T, and urea flowrate, K). By applying the quadratic regression analysis, the equations describing the behaviors of these responses as simultaneous functions of the selected independent variables were determined, and the conditions for X m and PX optimization were estimated (pH 9.5, T = 29°C, and K = 0.551 mM/day). The experimental data obtained under these conditions (Xm = 749 mg/L; PX = 69.9 mg/L·day) were very close to the estimated ones (Xm = 721 mg/L; PX = 67.1 mg/L·day). Additional cultivations were carried out under the above best conditions of pH control and urea flowrate at variable temperature. Consistently with the results of RSM, the best growth temperature was 29°C. The maximum specific growth rates at different temperatures were used to estimate the thermodynamic parameters of growth (ΔH* = 59.3 kJ/mol; ΔS* = -0.147 kJ/mol·K; ΔG* = 103 kJ/mol) and its thermal inactivation (ΔH°D = 72.0 kJ/mol; ΔS°D = 0.144 kJ/mol·K; ΔG°D = 29.1 kJ/mol). © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - INTERACTIVE SALT AND SEDIMENT EVOLUTION - SELF-CONSISTENT QUANTITATIVE MODELS
VL  - 228
IS  - 3
SP  - 211-238
AB  - Assessment of the combined evolution of salt and surrounding sediments is one of the major problems in salt-dominated basins. A quantitative approach, guided by observations from seismic and/or well data, is presented. The modeled present-day shape of a salt structure is constrained by an inverse non-linear procedure which determines the parameters controlling the salt shape. The non-linear procedure guarantees the shape to be in close correspondence with the observed present-day salt shape. By introducing time dependence of each of the parameters controlling the salt shape, the procedure permits an assessment of an evolving salt shape with time. By letting sedimentary beds move around the developing salt structure, the influence of the uprising salt on the evolving bed geometries above and around the salt is depicted. As the predicted present-day bed geometries must also be in accord with the observed rim syncline bed geometries, additional constraints are put on the parameters controlling the dynamic evolution of the salt structure. The inverse procedure automatically determines, in a self-consistent way, resolution and sensitivity of all parameters in the quantitative model, and also of the dynamic evolution of both the salt and the surrounding sedimentary formations. The procedure handles symmetric and asymmetric two-dimensional structures as well as symmetric three-dimensional structures. Applications are given to two salt structures in the North Louisiana salt basin. The first structure is a tall diapir with clearly defined rim synclines. By varying the parameters in the non-linear inverse procedure, a consistent reproduction of the observed data is obtained on both sides of the asymmetric diapir. In addition, in the regions where absence of data is greatest, the consistent model provides a measure of the degree, extent and location of allowed salt overhang in order that the observed and predicted salt shapes are in accord. Therefore, the procedure produces a quantified measure of the salt stock stem width to overhang width and the locations of both. The second structure consists of two salt pillows. Here the quantitative model provides a consistent picture of the dynamic shaping of each mound in relation to their common rim syncline. A synthetic case exemplifies the capability of modeling the combined salt-sediment evolution with the constraint that the depositional surfaces through time are horizontal. The modeled self-consistent dynamical evolution then permits a better understanding of evolving stress-strain, thermal focusing and hydrocarbon entrapment to be realized. © 1993.

AB  - Egg diapause in the Nara (temperate, 34' 40'N) strain of Dianemobius nigrofasciatus of the D. fascipes species-complex is programmed by the parental photoperiod and expressed as delayed hatching at a high temperature (25⋅C). However, very few delayed eggs occur at this or higher temperatures in the Bali (tropical, 8⋅ 30'S) and Ishigaki (subtropical, 24⋅ 20'N) strains of D. fascipes, though the subtropical strain shows a clearer incidence of diapause at 20⋅C. The results of crossing between the Nara and Bali or Ishigaki strains indicate no simple dominant-recessive relations among alleles determining the incidence and intensity of diapause. Multiple regression analysis of FI, F2 and backcross eggs on mother and father for the incidence and intensity of diapause indicates additive effects of parental genes. A partial maternal effect was observed on the incidence, but not the intensity, of diapause. By artificial selection through several generations, lines with different diapause levels have been established from the subtropical strain, some of which are comparable to the temperate species in the intensity of egg diapause. A tropical strain of D. fascipes (Chiang Mai, 18⋅ 30'N) showed an increased incidence and degree of hatching delay at a low temperature, suggesting the incipient form of a temperature-dependent diapause. This might be the origin of egg diapause. Hatching delay was observed also in other tropical populations, and assumed to be preserved because of a bet-hedging benefit in the unpredictably fluctuating tropical environment. © 1992, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Feasibility of afforesting the waste piles was analyzed based on the systematic and detailed investigatation of physical and chemical properties of wastes. A rational design, plantation and management was made. In the experiment, a practical afforestation technique for bad conditions such as high temperature was presented, especially on the selection of plant species, recondition method, planting and management techniques, and the growth characteristics of trees planted on the site. Now, 47 types of survival plants have been found in the pile. The survival rate is more than 80% and the coverage is 55.6%. -from English summary

VL  - 48

SP  - 1872-1880
AB  - Fall-planted safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) offers potentially higher yield than spring-sown types. Yet winter survival in relation to fall growth and physiological aspects of acclimation has not been determined. Our objectives were (i) to determine the relationship between fall growth and winter survival in safflower, (ii) to assess if selection improved winter survival, and (iii) to determine if water relations and membrane leakage distinguished safflower varying in winter survival. Fall growth, leaf water relations, and leaf membrane leakage were measured in fall 2004 and 2005 at Pullman and Central Ferry, WA, and winter survival was determined. Average minimum winter temperatures were 1.0°C at Central Ferry and -3.9°C at Pullman, with extremes of -7.2°C at Central Ferry and -19.5°C at Pullman. For the 21 accessions evaluated, low fall plant habit was required for survival, but survival also varied substantially among low-habit types. Two cycles of recurrent mass selection on five low-habit types improved winter survival from 21 to 59% at Central Ferry and from 8 to 18% at Pullman. The highest survival was for BJ-27 after two selection cycles, averaging 90% at Central Ferry and 38% at Pullman. Accession BJ-27 maintained higher leaf pressure potential during fall acclimation in 2004-2005 and in 2005-2006 had higher pressure potential and membrane stability on the 8 January sampling than less-hardy types. The results show that both low habit and physiological acclimation capacity are needed for high winter survival in safflower. © Crop Science Society of America.

AB  - Egg size and fecundity vary greatly between species, and are correlated with maternal size in both interspecific and intraspecific comparisons. Species of large body size produce slightly larger young, and many more young, than do smaller taxa. Oviposition sites of most Australian reptiles are holes dug in moist sand or soil, but many species deposit eggs under logs or rocks. Specialized nest-sites include those of geckoes with calcareous-shelled eggs (enabling oviposition in drier micro-environments) and the elaborate mounds of saltwater crocodiles. Mating systems are poorly known: male combat has been recorded in many taxa, and seems to be correlated with sexual dimorphism in body size. The seasonal timing of reproduction is very consistent in southern Australia, with breeding restricted to the warmer months. However, tropical taxa display a variety of breeding seasonalities, ranging from continuous, to wet-season, to dry-season breeders. Parental care is recorded only from pythons and crocodilians, and takes very different forms in the 2 groups. Viviparity, sometimes involving placental transfer of nutrients, has evolved independently in at least 22 lineages of Australian squamates, primarily as an evolutionary response to cold climates. The proportion of viviparous lizards and snakes at any given site in Australia is highly correlated with environmental temperatures. -from Author

AB  - The biological and physicochemical properties of cultures of two isogenic recombinant variants of Y. pseudotuberculosis were studied. The cell genomes of the studied cultures differed only with respect to the presence or absence of the fra operon responsible for capsule formation in Y. pestis. The expression of the above-mentioned trait is amplified by an increase in the cultivation temperature of microbial biomass and stimulates a decrease in the viability and adaptation potential of bacteria in vitro. In a warm-blooded host organism, the capsule-forming recombinant variant is characterized by greater residual pathogenicity and immunogenicity to the experimental plague strains of laboratory animals as compared to the reference variant cells. These differences can be attributed to the more increased colonizing ability of the capsule-forming microbes caused by the resistance of the host cells to phagocytosis. © 2008 Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the impact of selected parameters (water temperature, light intensity, feed ration and granulation size, daily feeding period, stocking density, tank shape, sorting, covering the rearing tanks) on the rearing indices of northern pike, Esox lucius L. The impact of these factors on the intensity of cannibalism was determined, as was their role at various stages of early northern pike development. The study results presented indicate that the factors that most influence the results of rearing include water temperature, the type of tank used, fish sorting, and the size of the daily feed ration. The optimal water temperature for growing juvenile specimens of northern pike is 28°C, but effective rearing can be achieved within a temperature range of 20 to 28°C. At the lower temperature, the length of the feeding period and the application of tank covers had less of an impact on the final rearing results. Lighting and feed grain had the least influence on the rearing results, which indicates that northern pike are highly flexible with regard to these parameters. The greatest problem in rearing northern pike juveniles was cannibalism, which accounted for as much as 93% of overall fish losses. During early ontogenic growth, substantial changes in behavior were noted which meant that the northern pike were increasingly sensitive to external stimuli. Behavioral changes noted during the growth of juvenile northern pike could have impacted reactions to various parameters. For example, the optimal feeding period is continuous over 24 hours in the initial rearing stage and then 12-hour feeding periods for older fish (with body weights exceeding 5 g).

TI  - The origin of extreme horizontal branch stars
VL  - 466
IS  - 1
SP  - 359-371
AB  - Strong mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) can result in the formation of extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars. The EHB stars spend most of their He core and shell-burning phase at high temperatures and produce copious ultraviolet flux. They have very small hydrogen envelopes and occupy a small range in mass. It has been suggested that the "ultraviolet excess phenomenon," seen in elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges, is largely due to the ultraviolet flux from EHB stars and their progeny. The main motivation behind this work is to understand how EHB stars can be produced over a wide range of metallicities without fine-tuning the mass-loss process. We have computed evolutionary RGB models with mass loss for stars with main-sequence ages between 12.5 and 14.5 Gyr, initial masses less than 1.1 M⊙, and metallicities of [Fe/H] = -2.26, -1.48, -0.78, 0.0, and 0.37. We used the Reimers formula to characterize mass loss, but investigated a larger range of the mass-loss efficiency parameter, ηR) than is common. We adopted values of ηR from 0 to 1.2 for the compositions considered. Sufficiently rapid RGB mass loss causes stars to "peel-off" the giant branch, evolve to high temperatures, and settle on the white dwarf cooling curve. Some such stars have adequate helium core mass to undergo the helium flash, but only later at high temperatures: we call these "hot He-flashers." After helium ignition, the hot-flashers lie at the very blue end of the horizontal branch, forming a "blue hook." The blue-hook stars are a part of the EHB population and evolve into AGB-manqué stars. The rest of the peel-off stars form helium white dwarfs, which we call "flash-manque" stars. To understand how the number of EHB stars varies with metallicity in a stellar population we considered how the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) is populated. We assumed the distribution of ZAHB stars to be driven by a distribution in the mass-loss efficiency (parameterized by ηR) rather than by a distribution in mass. Our results show that at low metallicity, EHB stars are produced if ηR is 2-3 times larger than the value producing normal "mid-HB stars." However, the range in ηR producing EHB stars is comparable to that producing mid-HB stars. Somewhat surprisingly, neither the range nor magnitude of ηR producing EHB stars varies much with metallicity. In contrast, the range of ηR producing mid-HB stars decreases with increasing metallicity.

VL  - 11

SP  - 255-263
AB  - Object. The study aims to analyze nerve fiber types in the sacral nerve roots as a prerequisite for stimulation. Methods. One-micrometer cross-sections of human ventral and dorsal S1-5 roots were stained with osmium and toluidine blue. The total fiber diameter and myelin sheath were measured in 282,420 nerve fibers. Results. The analysis revealed the following 3 main nerve fiber types: Aα fibers (diameter 6-14 μm), Aγ fibers (diameter 2-4 μm), and B fibers (diameter < 2 μm). The B fibers were absent in S-1, present in some S-2 fascicles, and abundant from S-3 to S-5. The Aα fibers dominated the S-1 roots and most fascicles of S-2 roots. In the S3-5 roots, only a few Aα fibers were present. The relative occurrence of Aγ fibers increased from S-1 to S-5. In dorsal roots, Aγ fibers represented ∼ 70% of all nerve fibers in every root and fascicle. Conclusions. The B fibers represented efferent parasympathetic fibers. These fibers were concentrated in certain areas of the nerve roots, not randomly distributed. The Aα fibers innervate lower-extremity muscles and sphincters. The inverse correlation of Aα and Aγ fibers in the ventral roots from S-1 to S-5 is surprising. In dorsal roots, Aγ fibers may conduct pain, touch, and temperature signals. Highly selective fiber stimulation specific for type, location, and direction may improve sacral nerve stimulation for a spastic bladder in paraplegic individuals.

AB  - In previous studies in vitro-selection of proline overaccumulating lines of winter wheat (Triticum sativum L. cv. Jo 3063) with increased frost tolerance was reported. These traits were found to be genetically stable. In the present study the improvement of frost tolerance (winter hardiness) under field conditions is confirmed for F7 progenies of the mutants. Moreover, the mutants accumulated higher levels of glucose and fructose, soluble protein and abscisic acid (ABA) in addition to proline than the wild type under cold hardening conditions in a growth chamber as well as under cold hardening field conditions. ABA and proline levels peaked when the temperature decreased, whereas carbohydrate levels increased more slowly at decreasing temperature. Soluble protein levels also increased during cold hardening, but in addition showed sharp declines during frost periods. Increased carbohydrate levels of the mutants were associated with lower osmotic potential values. The differences in carbohydrate, protein and ABA levels between the mutants and the wild type are probably due to pleiotropic effects of the mutation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 128

SP  - 287-301
AB  - We present a detailed mineralogical, petrological and melt inclusion study of unusually fresh, primitive olivine + clinopyroxene phyric Lower Pillow Lavas (LPL) found near Analiondas village in the northeastern part of the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus). Olivine phenocrysts in these primitive LPL show a wide compositional range (Fo(82-92)) and have higher CaO contents than those from the Upper Pillow Lavas (UPL). Cr-spinel inclusions in olivine are significantly less Cr-rich (Cr/Cr + Al = 28-67 mol%) compared to those from the UPL (Cr# = 70-80). These features reflect differences in melt compositions between primitive LPL and the UPL, namely higher CaO and Al2O3 and lower FeO* compared to the UPL at a given MgO. LPL parental melts (in equilibrium with Fo(92)) had similar to 10.5 wt% MgO and crystallization temperatures similar to 1210 degrees C, which are significantly lower than those previously published for the UPL (14-15 wt% MgO and similar to 1300 degrees C for Fo(92)). The fractionation path of LPL parental melts is also different from that of the UPL. It is characterized initially by olivine + clinopyroxene cotectic crystallization joined by plagioclase at similar to 9 wt% MgO, whereas UPL parental melts experienced a substantial interval of olivine-only crystallization. Primitive LPL melts were formed from a mantle source which was more fertile than that of tholeiites from well-developed intra-oceanicarcs, but broadly similar in its fertility to that of Mid-Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) and Back Are Basin Basalts (BABE). The higher degrees of melting during formation of the LPL primary melts compared to average MORE were caused by the presence of subduction-related components (H2O). Our new data on the LPL coupled with existing data for the UPL support the existing idea that the LPL and UPL primary melts originated from distinct mantle sources, which cannot be related by progressive source depletion. Temperature differences between these sources (similar to 150 degrees C), their position in the mantle (similar to 10 kbar for the colder LPL source vs 15-18 kbar for the UPL source), and temporal succession of Troodos volcanism, all cannot be reconciled in the framework of existing models of mantle wedge processes, thermal structure and evolution, if a single mantle source is invoked. Possible tectonic settings for the origin of the Troodos ophiolite (forearc regions of intra-oceanic island are, propagation of backarc spreading into are lithosphere) are discussed.

Malus baccata and Q. macrocarpa showed a similar potential for acclimation, although their potential for growth differed between sites: M. baccata could be produced advantageously in any area, while the production potential of Q. macrocarpa was enhanced by the summer heat of the warmest region. The species with the greatest number of plants suffering winter damage was A. saccharinum, which could not be grown without risk anywhere in the area studied. A. platanoides was severely damaged in the coldest of the three biogeographic areas and should not be cultivated there. -from English summary

VL  - 126

SP  - 5064-5065
AB  - In this communication, solid-phase reactions for the synthesis of Lys-monofunctionalized gold nanoparticles are described. A controlled and selective fabrication of linear nanoparticle arrays can be achieved through peptide linkage systems, and therefore it is essential to prepare Fmoc amino acid nanoparticle building blocks susceptible to Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. Gold nanoparticles containing carboxylic acids (2) in the organic shell were covalently ligated to Lys on solid supports through amide bond coupling reactions. We employed Fmoc-Lys-substituted polymer resins such as Fmoc-Lys-Wang or Fmoc-Lys-HMPA-PEGA. The low density of Lys on the matrix enabled 2 nm-sized gold nanoparticles to react with Lys in a 1:1 ratio. Subsequent cleavage reactions using 60% TFA reagent resulted in Lys transfer from the solid matrix to gold nanoparticles, and the Fmoc-Lys-monofunctionalized gold nanoparticles (5) were obtained with 3-15% yield. Synthesis using HMPA-PEGA resin increased productivity due to the superior swelling properties of PEGA resin in DMF. Monofunctionalization of nanoparticles was microscopically characterized using TEM for the ethylenediamine-bridged nanoparticle dimers (6). By counting the number of 6, we found that at least 60% of cleaved nanoparticles were monofunctionalized by Lys. This method is highly selective and efficient for the preparation of monofunctionalized nanoparticles. Copyright © 2003 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Temperature effects on the timing of striped bass egg production, larval viability, and recruitment potential in the Patuxent River (Chesapeake Bay)
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 527-544
AB  - The relationships between egg production (spawning behavior), larval growth and survival, and environmental conditions that larvae encounter were investigated in the Patuxent River tributary of Chesapeake Bay in 1991. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis) eggs and larvae occurred predominantly above the salt front where conductivity was less than or equal to 800 mu mhos cm(-1). There were three prominent peaks in egg production, each coinciding with increasing temperatures. Estimated growth rates of 6-d, otolith-aged cohorts, which ranged from 0.15 mm d(-1) to 0.22 mm d(-1) (mean = 0.17 mm d(-1)), were not demonstrated to differ significantly from each other. Observed zooplankton densities and temperature did not significantly affect growth rates. Stage-specific cumulative mortalities of combined cohorts were calculated for eggs (Z(stage) = 0.20 = 18.1%), yolk-sac larvae (Z(stage) = 5.80 = 99.7%), and first-feeding larvae (Z(stage) = 2.95 = 94.8%). The very high mortality of yolk-sac larvae suggests that dynamics during this stage may have had a major impact on subsequent recruitment. Cohort-specific mortality rates of larvae were variable, ranging from Z = 0.045 d(-1) to 0.719 d(-1), and were strongly temperature-dependent. Cohorts that experienced average temperatures <15 degrees C or >20 degrees C during the first 25 d after hatching had significantly higher mortality rates than those which experienced intermediate temperatures. Estimated hatch-date frequencies of larvae greater than or equal to 8 mm SL indicated good, very good, and very low potential recruitments for cohorts spawned during early-season (April 2-11), mid-season (April 12-24) and late-season (April 25-May 5), respectively. Because seasonal temperature trends and fluctuations are unpredictable, striped bass females cannot select a spawning time that guarantees their offspring will be exposed to optimum temperatures. Consequently, selection may have occurred for spawning over a broad range of temperatures and dates, a behavior insuring that some larval cohorts will encounter favorable temperatures.

AB  - Tomato pinworm, Keiferia lycopersicella (Walsingham), growth and survival were studied at selected temperatures from 11-41°C. Eggs did not hatch at 11 or 41°C. Development time from egg to adult ranged from 118.4 days at 14°C to 18.6 days at 35°C. Mortality was greater at extreme temperatures (11, 14, 35, 38, and 41°C) than at moderate temperatures (17, 20, 26, and 32°C). Lower thermal thresholds were determined by extrapolation as 11.4, 10.9, and 11.0°Cfor eggs, blotch leafmining stage (L1 + L2), and tentiform leafmining stage (L3 + L4), respectively. Pupa development was not linear and no lower threshold was estimated. Second and third instars had significantly greater survival than first instars on nearly all stages of foliage and fruit maturity examined. Within each instar, there were no significant differences in rate of development regardless of stage of host maturity. However, development time for each instar was generally longer and mortality was significantly greater on senescing foliage. © 1985 Entomological Society of America.

The heat resistance of the organism has been studied only in larvae kept at 21°C. 2. 2.|An inverse linear relation has been found between the level of the average heat resistance of muscles for offspring, of the same family, under optimal conditions and its increase caused by a change in environmental temperature.

AB  - A procedure for the isolation of temperature sensitive mutants of BHK cells is described. Mutagenized cells were synchronized in G1 by serum starvation at 33°, and, following release, shifted to 37.5° in the presence of FUdR, to kill cells entering the DNA synthetic phase. Eight independently mutagenized series of cells were carried through four cycles of this selection, and surviving cells were tested for ability to grow at 33° and 39.5° after each cycle. The results suggest that such procedure is effective in enriching for non-leaky ts mutants and favors the isolation of mutants which at 39.5° are inhibited in the processes necessary for DNA synthesis and lose viability rapidly. The effectiveness of repeated selection cycles and the general characteristics of the ts mutants isolated by this method were also evaluated. © 1978 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

VL  - 7

AB  - Ectotherms use behaviour to buffer effects of temperature on growth, development and survival. While behavioural thermoregulation is widely reported, localized adaptation of thermal preference is poorly documented. Larval amphibians live in wetlands ranging from entirely open to heavily shaded by vegetation. We hypothesized that populations undergo localized selection leading to countergradient patterns of thermal preference behaviour. Specifically, we predicted that wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae from closed canopy ponds would be more strongly temperature selective and would prefer higher temperatures than conspecifics from populations found in open canopy ponds. In a study of six breeding ponds in north-eastern Connecticut, USA, these predictions were upheld. The countergradient, microgeographical variation in thermal preference documented here implies that wood frog populations may have diverged rapidly in the face of contrasting selection pressures. Rapid, behaviourally mediated responses to changing thermal environments have important implications for understanding population responses to climate change.

VL  - 13

SP  - 1161-1165
AB  - The thermal tolerance, body temperature, and influence of temperature on locomotor performance of hatchling soft-shelled turtles (Trionyx sinensis) were studied under dry and wet conditions, and the selected body temperature of hatchlings was 28.0 and 30.3 °C, respectively. Under wet condition, the critical thermal maximum and minimum averaged 40.9 and 7.8 °C, respectively. In the environments without thermal gradients, the diel variation of body temperature was highly consistent with the variation of both air and water temperatures, and the body temperature was more directly affected by water temperature than by air temperature, which implied that the physiological thermoregulation of hatchling T. sinensis was very weak. In the environments with thermal gradients, hatchling turtles could maintain relatively high and constant body temperatures, primarily through behavioral thermoregulation. The locomotor performance of hatchling turtles was highly dependent on their body temperature. Within a certain range, the locomotor performance increased with increasing body temperature. In our study, the optimal body temperature for locomotor performance was 31.5 °C, under which, the maximum continuous running distance, running distance per minute, and number of stops per minute averaged 1.87 m, 4.92 m·min-1, and 6.2 times·min-1, respectively. The correspondent values at 33.0 °C averaged 1.30 m, 4.28 m·min-1, and 7.7 times·min-1, respectively, which indicated that the locomotor performance of hatchling turtles was impaired at 33.0 °C. Therefore, extremely high body temperatures might have an adverse effect on locomotor performance of hatchling turtles.

AB  - Acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics was accompanied by the rise of the mantle plume/hotspot concept which has come to dominate geodynamics from its use both as an explanation for the origin of intraplate volcanism and as a reference frame for plate motions. However, even with a large degree of flexibility permitted in plume composition, temperature, size, and depth of origin, adoption of any limited number of hotspots means the plume model cannot account for all occurrences of the type of volcanism it was devised to explain. While scientific protocol would normally demand that an alternative explanation be sought, there have been few challenges to "plume theory" on account of a series of intricate controls set up by the plume model which makes plumes seem to be an essential feature of the Earth. The hotspot frame acts not only as a reference but also controls plate tectonics. Accommodating plumes relegates mantle convection to a weak, sluggish effect such that basal drag appears as a minor, resisting force, with plates having to move themselves by boundary forces and continents having to be rifted by plumes. Correspondingly, the geochemical evolution of the mantle is controlled by the requirement to isolate subducted crust into plume sources which limits potential buffers on the composition of the MORE-source to plume- or lower mantle material. Crustal growth and Precambrian tectonics are controlled by interpretations of greenstone belts as oceanic plateaus generated by plumes. Challenges to any aspect of the plume model are thus liable to be dismissed unless a counter explanation is offered across the geodynamic spectrum influenced by "plume theory". Nonetheless, an alternative synthesis can be made based on longstanding petrological evidence for derivation of intraplate volcanism from volatile-bearing sources (wetspots) in conjunction with concepts dismissed for being incompatible or superfluous to "plume theory". In the alternative Earth, the sources for intraplate volcanism evolve from the source residues of are volcanism located along sutures in the continental mantle. Continental rifting and the lateral distribution of intraplate sources in the asthenosphere are controlled by Earth rotation. Shear induced on the base of the asthenosphere from the mesosphere as the Earth rotates is transmitted to the lithosphere as basal drag. Attenuation of the drag due to the low viscosity of the asthenosphere, in conjunction with plate motions from boundary forces, results in a rotation differential of up to 5 cm yr(-1) between the lithosphere and mesosphere manifest as westward plate lag/eastward mantle flow. Continental rifting results from basal drag supplemented by local convection induced by lithospheric architecture. Large continental igneous provinces are generated by convective melting, with passive margin volcanic sequences following the axis of rifting and flood basalts overlying the intersection of sutures in the continental mantle. As rifting progresses, the convection cells expand, cycling continental mantle from sutures perpendicular to the rift axis to generate intraplate tracks in the ocean basin. Continental mantle not melted on rifting, or delaminated on continental collision, becomes displaced to the east of the continent by differential rotation, which also sets up a means for tapping the material to give fixed melting anomalies. When plates move counter to the Earth's rotation, as in the example of the Pacific plate, asthenospheric flow is characterised by a counterflow regime with a zero velocity layer at depths within the stability field for volatile-bearing minerals. Intraplate volcanism results when melts are tapped from this stationary layer along lithospheric stress trajectories induced by stressing of the plate from variations in the subduction geometry around the margins of the plate. Plate boundary forces acting in the same direction as Earth rotation, as for the Nazca plate, produce fast plate velocities but not counterflow, though convergent margin geometry may still induce propagating fractures which set up melting anomalies. Lateral migration of asthenospheric domains allows the sources of Pacific intraplate volcanism to be traced back to continental mantle eroded during the breakup of Gondwana and the amalgamation of Asia in the Paleozoic. Intraplate volcanism in the South Pacific therefore has a common Gondwanan origin to intraplate volcanism in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, hence the DUPAL anomaly is entirely of shallow origin. Such domains constitute a second order geochemical heterogeneity superimposed on a streaky/marble-cake structure arising from remixing of subducted crust with the convecting mantle. During the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic, remixing of slabs has buffered the evolution of the depleted mantle to a rate of 2.2 epsilon Nd units Ga-1 with fractionation of Lu from I-if in the sediment component imparting the large range in Hf-176/Hf-177 relative to Nd-143/Nd-144 observed in MORE. Only the high epsilon Nd values of some Archean komatiites are compatible with derivation from unbuffered mantle. The existence of a very depleted reservoir is attributed to stabilisation of a large early continental crust through either obduction tectonics or slab melting regimes which reduced the efficiency of crustal recycling back into the mantle. Generation of komatiite is therefore a consequence of mantle composition, and is permitted in ocean ridge environments and/or under hydrous melting conditions. Correspondingly, as intraplate volcanism depends on survival of volatile-bearing sources, its appearance in the Middle Proterozoic corresponds to the time in the Earth's thermal evolution at which minerals such as phlogopite and amphibole could survive in off-ridge environments in the shallow asthenosphere. The geodynamic evolution of the Earth was thus determined at convergent margins, not by plumes and hotspots, with the decline in thermal regime causing both a reduction in size of crust and continental mantle roots, the latter becoming a source for intraplate volcanism while the crust was incorporated into the convecting mantle.

TI  - Thermal acclimation and regulation of metabolism in a reptile (Crocodylus porosus): The importance of transcriptional mechanisms and membrane composition
VL  - 82

SP  - 766-775
AB  - Energy metabolism is fundamental for animal fitness because it fuels locomotion, growth, and reproduction. Mitochondrial capacities often acclimate to compensate for negative thermodynamic effects. Our aim was to determine the importance of transcriptional regulation and membrane fatty acid composition in modulating oxidative capacities at body temperatures selected in a cold and a warm environment by a reptile (Crocodylus porosus). In the cool environment (mean selected Tb = 21°C), mRNA concentrations of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and its coactivator PPARγ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), as well as of the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunits COX1 and COX5, were significantly higher in the liver but not in skeletal muscle compared with animals in the warm environment (mean selected Tb = 29°C). FOF1-ATPase subunit α mRNA concentrations were significantly higher in both muscle and the liver in the cool animals. A positive relationship between PGC-1α and PPARγ mRNA concentrations, with an indicator of mitochondrial density (16S rRNA) in muscle and COX and FOF1-ATPase subunit α mRNA concentrations in liver, suggest that these proteins regulate quantity increases of mitochondria during acclimation. The percent saturated fatty acids in liver membranes of cool animals was significantly lower, and the n3 fatty acid content was significantly higher, compared with in warm animals. The n3 fatty acid content was positively related to COX enzyme activity in the liver, and there was a negative relationship between n7 fatty acid content and COX activity in muscle. Hence, metabolic acclimation is mediated by both transcriptional regulation and membrane fatty acid composition. The importance of PGC-1α and PPARγ in a reptile indicate that the mechanisms that regulate metabolism are conserved among vertebrates. © 2009 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.

TI  - A revised version of PnET-II to simulate the hydrologic cycle in southeastern forested areas
VL  - 38
IS  - 1
SP  - 79-89
AB  - The PnET-II model uses hydroclimatic data on maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation, together with vegetation and soil parameters, to produce estimates of net primary productivity, evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff on a monthly time step for forested areas. In this study, the PnET-II model was employed to simulate the hydrologic cycle for 17 Southeastern eight-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds dominated by evergreen or deciduous tree species. Based on these control experiments, model biases were quantified and tentative revision schemes were introduced. Revisions included: (1) replacing the original single soil layer with three soil layers in the water balance routine; (2) introducing calibrating factors to rectify the phenomenon of overestimation of ET in spring and early summer months; (3) parameterizing proper values of growing degree days for trees located in different climate zones; and (4) adjusting the parameter of fast-flow (overland flow) fraction based on antecedent moisture condition and precipitation intensity. The revised PnET-II model, called PnET-II3SL in this work, substantially improved runoff simulations for the 17 selected experimental sites, and therefore may offer a more powerful tool to address issues in water resources management.

VL  - 80

SP  - 259-275
AB  - The brine shrimp inhabits geographically isolated biotopes with specific biotic and abiotic conditions. This has resulted in various geographical strains between which marked genetical, biological and chemical differentiation exists. The response of 13 different Artemia strains to the combined effect of temperature and salinity has been studied. Experimental temperatures tested ranged from 18 to 34°C and salinities from 5 to 120%.. Except for Chaplin Lake (itCanada) Artemia, all strains showed high survival over a wide range of salinities (35-110%.). For all strains the common temperature optimum was between 20 and 25°C. Interaction 7between temperature and salinity was negligible or very limited. Substantial differences in tolerance were recorded in particular at the lower end of the range of experimental salinities and at the upper end of the range of temperatures. Resistance to high temperature seems to be related to the genetic classification of the Artemia strains in different sibling species. Differences, however, also exist among strains from the same sibling species. Genetic adaptation to high temperature seems to take place in Artemia. The data obtained provide a first guideline for strain selection for specific aquacultural purposes. © 1984.

VL  - 14

SP  - 319-332
AB  - An apparatus was built to investigate the behavior of Aedes taeniorhynchus larvae and pupae under uniform illumination in a temperature gradient. Larvae were reared at 30.0° C and tested with and without access to food prior to and during the periods of observation. Preferred ranges for starved larvae were greater and spread over slightly lower temperatures than those selected by fed individuals. Fed larvae in all instars preferred the same approximate range, from 30° to 38°, but calculated average preferred temperatures disclosed a progressive increase with age, from 31.8° in the first instar to 34.6° in the early fourth instar. Late fourth‐instar larvae (approaching pupation) chose slightly cooler temperatures (average of 33.0°). Animals from a laboratory colony cultured for several years at 27.0° gave, in the early fourth instar, a response almost identical to that shown by progeny of wild‐caught females. When larvae were reared for one generation at 24.0°, instead of 30.0°, the average preferred temperature for early fourth‐instar larvae was slightly lower (33.5° compared with 34.6°). Observations by means of flash photography showed that the range of temperature selected by fed early fourth‐instar larvae in total darkness was the same as under uniform illumination. COMPORTEMENT DES LARVES ET NYMPHES DE AEDES TAENIORHYNCHUS DANS UN GRADIENT DE TEMPÉRATURE Un appareil a été construit en vue d'étudier le comportement des larves et nymphes d'Aedes taeniorhynchus soumises à un gradient de température, sous des conditions d'éclairement uniforme. Les larves étaient élevées à une température de 30° et soumises au test avec ou sans possibilité de se nourrir avant ou pendant les périodes d'observation. Les larves nonalimentées manifestaient un preferendum pour des limites de température plus larges et légèrement plus basses que celles observées avec des larves nourries. Ces dernières, à tous les stades larvaires, montrent un preferendum de 30° à 38°, mais le calcul de la température moyenne préférée révèle un accroissement progressif avec l'âge, passant de 31°8 au ler stade larvaire à 34°6 au début du 4ème stade larvaire. Les larves du 4ème stade, peu avant la nymphose, préfèrent une température légèrement plus basse (moyenne de 33°). Dans un élevage, maintenu pendant plusieurs années au laboratoire à une température de 27°, les larves du début du 4ème stade montrent une réponse presque identique à celles provenant de femelles capturées dans la nature. Quand les larves sont élevées pendant une génération à 24° en lieu de 30° la moyenne du preferendum thermique pour les jeunes larves du 4ème stade est légèrement plus faible (33°5 au lieu de 34°6). Des observations au moyen de photographies par flash électronique montrent que le preferendum thermique est le même à la lumière ou à l'obsurité. 1971 The Netherlands Entomological Society

TI  - Autotrophic nitrification and its role in nitrogen removal in Elodea nuttalli-based aquatic treatment systems
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
SP  - 119-124
AB  - Total nitrogen (TN) and nitrogen removal mechanisms were investigated in a pilot-scale aquatic treatment system (ATS) designed to provide advanced secondary treatment of domestic wastewater under temperate climate conditions. Particular attention was paid to the role of autotrophic nitrifiers and nitrification in the TN removal processes. The acquatic macrophyte Elodea nuttallii (Hydrocharitaceae) was grown in the ATS. The pilot scale reactors were operated for two years in a heated greenhouse. Autotrophic nitrifiers were enumerated using a most probable number (MPN) microtechnique. The distributions of epiphytic, sediment, and water column ammonium- and nitrite-oxidizing populations were determined over the course of a year. Epiphytic biofilms were also examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Autoanalysis and a TN persulfate digestion technique were used to monitor NH4+-N, NO2- + NO3- -N, and TN in the influent and effluent from the reactors. Particular attention was directed at relating net ammonia removal to net nitrite and nitrate production in the reactor. Mass balances on N were conducted during both summer and winter operation. TN removal mechanisms were partitioned between plant uptake of NH4+ and NO3-, detrital settling, and an unaccounted loss term containing NH3+ volatilization, N2 and N2O evolution from denitrification, and experimental error. Nitrifiers were very abundant in the reactors. High concentrations of ammonium-oxidizers (107 to 108 MPN/g dry wt) and nitrite-oxidizers (106 to 107 MPN/g dry wt) were found as epiphytic biofilms and as sediment populations in the systems. The populations were relatively constant over the course of a year. SEM revealed a diverse epiphytic biofilm on the leaves and stems of E. nuttallii. Approximately 63 to 99% of influent TN entering the reactors was NH4+-N. A plot of NH4+-N removal versus net NO2- + NO3- -N production revealed that when macrophyte productivity was low, the apparent conversion of NH4+ to NO3- was high and net production of NO2- and NO3- -N was high. Conversely, when macrophyte productivity was high, the apparent conversion of NH4+ to NO3- was low and net production of NO2- and NO3- was low. This low net production of NO3- was attributed to decreased NH4+ availability and increased NO3- removal. Mass balances on TN confirmed that this low net NO2- + NO3- -N production during summer and fall operation was due to increased plant NH4+ and NO3- removal and higher losses via denitrification. Thus apparent nitrifier activity appears to be relatively constant in the ATS reactors, but macrophyte productivity and denitrifier activity affect whether N (as NO3) is removed by plant uptake or denitrification. Higher TN removal (principally as NH4+ -N) occured when macrophytes were productive and denitrifier activity was high.

VL  - 152

AB  - Selective mortality within a population, based on the phenotype of individuals, is the foundation of the theory of natural selection. We examined temperature-induced shifts in the relationships among early life history traits and survivorship over the embryonic and larval stages of a tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. Our experiments show that temperature determines the intensity of selective mortality, and that this changes with ontogeny. The size of energy stores determined survival through to hatching, after which egg size became a good indicator of fitness as predicted by theoretical models. Yet, the benefits associated with egg size were not uniform among test temperatures. Initial egg size positively influenced larval survival at control temperature (29 °C). However, this embryonic trait had no effect on post-hatching longevity of individuals reared at the higher (31 °C) and lower (25 °C) end of the temperature range. Overall, our findings indicate that the outcome of selective mortality is strongly dependent on the interaction between environment conditions and intrinsic developmental schedules. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Influence of starvation at low temperatures on utilization of energy reserves, appetite recovery and growth character in sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax
VL  - 99
IS  - 1
SP  - 167-178
AB  - The effect of starvation at selected low temperatures was studied in sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. The work focused on proximate chemical constituents and blood glucose. Appetite and growth of starved, refed specimens were also examined. Two experimental sets were designed. In one set the fish were exposed to 3-degrees-C, 7-degrees-C and 11-degrees-C and in the other to 3-degrees-C, 8-degrees-C and 13-degrees-C. Survival of the fish in the experimental conditions was 99.7%. Appreciable loss in body weight occurred. The reduction wss more marked in the first week. No significant difference in chemical composition occurred in the first two weeks of starvation. Prolongation of food deprivation resulted in decline of lipid content with a corresponding increase in water content. This trend was the more marked at high temperature. Liver glycogen was the most readily utilizable source of energy. Lipid yielded energy after which proteins were mobilized to save further loss of lipid. Lipid exerted a sparing role for glycogen. The preference for different energy sources depended on exposure temperature and duration of starvation. Lipid chiefly supplied the energy needs of the 3-degrees-C test groups, whereas liver glycogen provided the calorific requirements of fish at 7-degrees-C, 8-degrees-C, 11-degrees-C and 13-degrees-C. In the 3-degrees-C test groups gluconeogenesis occurred after 2 weeks. The products of lipid breakdown may have served as substrates for glycogen biosynthesis. High tolerance of sea bass to low temperature was attributed to high fat content and hyperglycemia. The study also pointed to the involvement of some organs other than liver in generating glucose from their glycogen stores following exhaustion of hepatic glycogen. Starvation stress at the lowest temperatures adversely affected the return of the fish's appetite and growth characters. Compensatory growth occurred in sea bass refed after starvation. The findings have implications for aquaculture management procedures.

AB  - Abeele and Gabarros4, two inbred lines originating from natural populations, and among which the size was stable at least up to generation 12 and generation 22 respectively, while the viability was decreasing, have been studied in generation 63 and 73 respectively. Different environments including temperature and egg-density conditions were used. The viability and size were diminished to a different extent in the two lines. Hybrids obtained by crossing the 87th and 82nd generation, respectively, of these two lines show a definite heterosis for size and a viability percentage smaller than the one of the parental inbred lines. No reciprocal differences, except in high density conditions, were observed. A second generation, obtained from the F1 reciprocals raised in different density environments show a breakdown of heterosis for size and a large increase in viability. Carry-over effects due to the different environments in which the reciprocal hybrids were grown were also observed in the second generation. The interference of cytoplasm for "transmission" of acquired characters seems almost certain. Questions are raised concerning the selection opportunity in inbred lines, the influence of parental inbreeding on the character of the hybrids, the opportuneness of the generalization of the homeostasis idea, and the "transmission of acquired characters". © 1965 Martinus Nijhoff.

AB  - In the Ivory Coast, grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) have been integrated in the tilapia-based polyculture in order to increase pond productivity. In the tropical conditions prevailing there, female cycles seemed disrupted. We describe oogenesis in these conditions using histological observations, monitoring of individual cycles with intraovarian biopsies, endocrinal monitoring (development of a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for vitellogenin (Vg), measurement of plasma oestradiol-17beta (E2) and testosterone (T)) and comparison with grass carp raised in Poland. We noted that oogenesis was blocked in all females at the migrating germinal vesicle stage, precluding ovulation or spawning without artificial induction. High rates of atypical post-vitellogenic oocytes (translucent, not filled with yolk granules) were observed in many females. Female individual cycles also displayed atypical features: cycles were sometimes (10% of females) blocked at the beginning of vitellogenesis (BV), for females displaying abnormally low E2 (0.5 ng/ml) and Vg (30 mug/ml) levels compared to "normal" females (1.4 ng/ml and 223 mug/ml, respectively). The duration of the cycles was highly variable among females (a few days to several weeks). Sexual cycles were unsynchronised (all the ovarian stages could be found for all seasons) and the number of females at the end of vitellogenesis (EV) was low (<40% most of the year). These characteristics raise problems for artificial induction of spawning in small-scale hatcheries: a large stock of broodfish is required as is regular checking of female broodstock with intraovarian biopsies to select responsive females.

TI  - ITQ-12: A zeolite having temperature dependent adsorption selectivity and potential for propene separation
VL  - 108
IS  - 30
SP  - 11044-11048
AB  - A study of the adsorption properties of the new, 8-ring, pure silica zeolite ITQ-12 at several temperatures reveals that it has unique, temperature dependent adsorption selectivity and high potential for the separation of propene from propene/propane mixtures. At 30 degreesC, propene is adsorbed more than 100 times faster than propane, forming the basis for a kinetic based separation. Unexpectedly, at 80 degreesC, little or no propane adsorption is observed whereas there is no evidence for any unusual decrease in propene adsorption, a property adding to the potential of this zeolite for propene separation. A small, temperature induced decrease in the minimum dimension of the ITQ-12's "slit shaped" cages is proposed as the reason for the loss of sorption capacity for the slightly larger propane molecules. ITQ-12's unique, temperature-dependent property gives rise to a sorption selectivity that is thermodynamically driven rather than the result of diffusion barriers. Preliminary PSA simulations indicate 99.5% purity propene can be achieved with productivity significantly larger than that reported for the aluminophosphate based zeolite, AlPO-14.

AB  - A three layers back propagation (BP) Neural Network model was built to simulate the biomass gasification process in an inner circulating fluidized bed. Two input variables, i.e. feeding rates, air flow rate, and four output variables, i.e. gas heating value, gas productivity, carbon conversion rate, and gasification efficiency were selected. 57 experimental data were taken as training and checking samples, the effects of nodes of hidden layer and training echoes on simulation results were investigated. The results showed that correlation coefficient of the four output variables between simulation results and experimental data exceeded 0.95, when the nodes of hidden layer were 20 and training echoes was 50. Model-predicted results were in agreement with the experimental data, showing good generalization capacity. This model will be the basis of automatic control of biomass gasification process in fluidized bed.

AB  - Cuticular permeability is thought to be related to the biophysical properties of cuticular waxes and, in turn, to the chemical composition of this boundary layer. However, thus far evidence for this relationship has been elusive. We investigated possible correlations between habitat and inter- and intraspecific variations in two parameters likeley to affect crystallinity and transition melting temperatures of waxes. Three species from the family Cupressaceae (Austrocedrus chilensis, Fitzroya cupressoides, Pilgerodendron uviferm) were selected as a model system because they are closely related and form a continuum over 20 degrees of latitude in South America that includes important climatic differences. We found major divergence among the three species and more fine-scale population differentiation for A. chilensis and P. uviferum in weighted mean carbon number (N) and dispersion about this mean (d). Broad-sense heritabilities, estimated from ramet-ortet regressions and from analysis of variance among ortets of F. cupressoides were 0.92 for N and from 0.64-0.76 for d. Even in areas of close sympatry, species maintained their unique biochemical characteristics, thus supporting the genetic basis of cuticular hydrocarbons. Both species and population patterns suggest that natural selection has favored cuticular hydrocarbon mixes that provide differential fitness in the face of habitat differences in water stress and temperature.

VL  - 50

SP  - 1435-1440
AB  - High-temperature short-time (HTST) treatments have been used to destroy the bioburden of paprika. With this in mind, we have designed a device to treat samples of paprika with a gas whose temperature, pressure, and composition can be selected. Temperatures and treatment times ranged from 130 to 170 degreesC and 4 to 6 s, respectively. The survival of the most commonly found microorganisms in paprika and any alteration in extractable and superficial color were examined. Data showed that the optimum HTST conditions were 145 degreesC, 1.5 kg/cm(2) of overpressure, 6 s operation time, and a thermal fluid of saturated steam. No microbial growth was detected during storage after thermal treatment. To minimize the color losses, treated (HTST) paprika samples should be kept under refrigeration.

VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-45
AB  - Increased sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with climate change/global warming have caused bleaching in scleractinian corals (the loss of obligate symbiotic zooxanthellae) on a global basis, resulting in mass mortality of corals and decimation of reefs. This symbiotic relationship makes these corals an excellent bioindicator of climate change. It has been hypothesized that bleaching is a mechanism by which corals can adapt to changing environmental conditions via the shuffling of symbiont clades and acquisition of better-adapted symbionts. Experimental research has confirmed that zooxanthellae are sensitive to increases in seawater temperatures, exhibiting apoptosis (a form of programmed cell death) at temperatures of 30C while in situ. The coral hosts, however, tolerate experimental temperatures up to 34C, not showing signs of apoptosis and necrosis until 36C. Thus, zooxanthellae currently appear to be poorly adapted to temperature increases, while the corals are resistant to higher temperatures, indicating that they are either already adapted or exapted (previously termed preadapted) to such. Coral hosts are experiencing no mortality from increased temperatures but a great deal of mortality from the death of their zooxanthellar symbionts. Symbiodinium sp. has a short generation time of one to several days, vs. that of its host coralone to several years, affording the symbionts a distinct advantage for adaptation. Mutation rates are low in micro-organisms and higher in larger organisms. Smaller organisms have a disproportionately higher mutation rate than larger organisms, however, when compared on a per-generation basis. Thus, zooxanthellae are positioned better to adapt more rapidly than their coral hosts. Zooxanthellae have numerous clades, some of which are suspected to be better-adapted to higher seawater temperatures than others. The discovery of new Symbiodinium clades may be due to our ability to detect them via better technology or due to mutation, adaptation, and directional selection. Changes in the frequency of occurrence of different clades better-adapted to higher temperatures may be due to the emergence of newly mutated strains (i.e., sub-clades or sub-types) or re-distribution of existing clades. Predictions for the future of coral reefs include the following: a) Some tropical corals may be lost to local or global extinction, based on species-specific susceptibility to temperature increases; b) it is unlikely that other symbionts such as cyanobacteria will be able to replace Symbiodinium in the host-symbiont relationship; c) the tropics and sub-tropics will expand poleward and the other climatic zones will shift poleward, at the expense of the polar and sub-polar zones; d) a new hyper-tropical zone may appear near the equator, within which corals may be less species diverse, ill represented, or absent; and e) the depth distribution of corals may be extended, but probably only nominally so.

VL  - 98

SP  - 525-530
AB  - Elucidating the genetic basis of adaptation on a genomewide scale has evaded biologists, but complete genome sequences and DNA high-density array technology make genomewide surveys more tractable. Six lines of Escherichia coli adapted for 2,000 generations to a stressful high temperature of 41.5 degreesC were examined on a genomewide scale for duplication/deletion events by using DNA high-density arrays. A total of five duplication and deletion events were detected. These five events occurred in three of the six lines, whereas the remaining three lines contained no detectable events. Three of the duplications were at 2.85 Mb of the E. coli chromosome, providing evidence for the replicability of the adaptation to high temperature. Four candidate genes previously shown to play roles in stress and starvation survival were identified in the region of common duplication. Expression of the two candidate genes examined is elevated over expression levels in the ancestral lines or the lines without the duplication. In the two cases where the duplication at 2.85 Mb has been further characterized, the timing of the genome reorganization is coincident with significant increases in relative fitness. In both of these cases, the model for the origin of the duplication is a complex recombination event involving insertion sequences and repeat sequences. These results provide additional evidence for the idea that gene duplication plays an integral role in adaptation, specifically as a means for gene amplification.

TI  - The effect of concentrated urea solutions on poliovirus strains adapted to different growth temperatures
VL  - 21
IS  - 3
SP  - 322-331
AB  - This paper compares the effect of concentrated urea solutions on several poliovirus strains adapted to grow at widely different temperatures. The curves relating survival of infectivity to time spent in urea all have the shape characteristic of a multistep reaction. Strains increasingly tolerant to high growth temperatures are increasingly stable in urea, yielding curves with longer "shoulders" and generally less steep subsequent slopes. Hence these strains show an association between sensitivity to urea and sensitivity to high growth temperatures. However, when urea-resistant variants are selected from a urea (and temperature) sensitive stock by treatment with 7.2 M urea, it is found in this case that urea resistance is accompanied by only a very small increase in the ability to grow at higher temperatures. It is concluded that the adaptation of poliovirus to a new optimal growth temperature selects for at least two independent genetic characters. One character has a very large effect on the thermal growth requirement, whereas the other predominantly controls the strength of certain labile bonds in the virion itself, probably hydrogen bonds in the capsid. © 1963.

AB  - A study was made of the group (family) thermal selection of zygotes for heat resistance of the organism and muscles of the grass frog Rana temporaria L. at the initial and final stages of development. The average duration of thermal effect (37 degrees C), followed by a 50% lethality of affected zygotes (LD50), served a criterion of heat resistance of zygotes in each particular single clutch. The average time of survival at 34 degrees C served as criterion of heat resistance in tadpoles. The time of the loss of muscle contraction in response to electrical stimulus at 37 degrees C served as index of heat resistance of muscle tissue. The data presented show that the thermal elimination of 90% of zygotes failed to result in any directed shift in thermoresistances of the organism and muscles in animals grown from the most heat resistant clutches.

TI  - Modeling of Hydrogenation of Maleic Acid in a Bubble-Column Slurry Reactor
VL  - 49
IS  - 12
SP  - 3199-3212
AB  - A bubble-column slurry-reactor model has been developed for the hydrogenation of aqueous maleic acid (MAC) to tetrahydrofuran (THF). This particular reaction system has recent commercial relevance and represents a case where complex multistep catalytic hydrogenation reactions are conducted at high pressure (>15 MPa) and high temperature (>240degreesC). It also has additional complexities associated with the reaction chemistry, since the THF reaction product is volatile and the reaction is highly exothermic. The proposed model is derived using the mixing cell approach and incorporates the contributions of gas-liquid and liquid-solid mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion effects, product volatility, heat effects, and complex multistep reaction kinetics. The effect of gas and liquid velocities, catalyst loading, inlet maleic acid concentration, and temperature on the conversion, selectivity, temperature rise, and productivity of the desired products (THF and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)) is also discussed. Since the reaction step involving the hydrogenation of GBL to THF is relatively slow, severe operating conditions are necessary to achieve high THF selectivity. The distribution pattern of THF in the gas and liquid phases is also discussed. The model proposed could be useful for simulation of existing pilot- or industrial-scale reactors, as well as the design and scale-up of new reactors for this particular reaction or one that has similar characteristics.

TI  - Effects of gmaw procedure on the heat-affected zone (HAZ) toughness of X80 (GRADE 550) linepipe
VL  - 3
SP  - 553-569
AB  - In view of the opportunities for new pipelines and a shortage of skilled labour, pipeline construction companies are exploring the use of new, more efficient, high-productivity welding procedures. However, in welding high strength steels, it is essential that the high strength and toughness be maintained in both the girth weld metal and the associated heat affected zone (HAZ) regions, particularly in strain-based designs in which significant longitudinal strains are anticipated. The measured toughness of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is affected by base metal chemistry, welding procedure and the accuracy of locating the pre-test machined notch at the targeted zone, among other factors. In this study, the welding of X80 (Grade 550) linepipe by single torch, dual torch and tandem gas metal arc welding (GMAW) techniques has been examined. Both Charpy and CTOD testing have been employed to assess the toughness of the HAZ. It will also be demonstrated, that the measured CTOD value is dependent on the percentage sampled of the near-fusion line HAZ. Proper selection of the welding procedure to maintain a relatively fine grain size can significantly enhance the measured CTOD values. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.

TI  - Latitudinal compensation in female reproductive rate of a geographically widespread reef fish
VL  - 71

AB  - Latitudinal variation in fitness-related traits has often been attributed to local adaptation to climates. In poikilotherms including fishes, lower temperatures and shorter reproductive seasons at high latitudes would be expected to cause a reduction in annual reproductive output of an individual. Theories of latitudinal compensation predict that organisms at high latitudes should evolve compensatory responses for these climatic effects. Therefore, latitudinal compensation in female reproductive rate (egg production rate), that individuals from high latitudes produce eggs at higher rates than those from lower latitudes, is likely to occur. I tested this hypothesis with a latitudinally widespread reef fish Pomacentrus coelestis that is a multiple batch spawner, from three different localities, from temperate to subtropical waters, within Japan. I used common-environment experiments at three different temperatures to compare reproductive capacity among local populations. In the experiments, average inter-spawning intervals were the shortest and average size-specific clutch weight was the heaviest in fish from the most northern locality across all temperatures, showing clear latitudinal clines. Thus, the northern fish can achieve higher reproductive output per unit time both by shortening inter-spawning intervals and increasing size-specific clutch weight. Additionally, faster egg production rate of the northern fish did not result from increased food consumption. This finding suggests that gross egg production efficiency was higher in the northern fish and that northern fish had a superior capacity for reproduction within a season. These results support the prediction that latitudinal compensation occurs in the female reproductive rate of P. coelestis. As the reproductive season of this species decreases drastically with increasing latitude, the observed cline in the reproductive rate must be an adaptive response to the local selective regime, i.e., length of the reproductive season. Such latitudinal compensation in female reproductive rates may be a common pattern in latitudinally widespread fishes.

AB  - Due to its small body size, which in the case of prematurity is associated with increased skin permeability and incomplete brown fat development, the human neonate is highly prone to heat loss. Hence, thermal protection is mandatory to prevent neonatal hypothermia with its adverse metabolic and hemodynamic effects. This is usually attempted by the selection of "thermoneutral" ambient temperatures to maintain core temperature constant without regulatory metabolic increase. Since, however, core temperature decreases only after metabolic increase has failed to counteract heat loss, and metabolic increase in its turn is preceded by peripheral vasoconstriction, recording of thermal gradients between core and peripheral temperatures has now proven superior in early detection of thermal stress and maintenance of thermal comfort in the neonate. The longlasting thermal lability of preterm babies partly results from the fact that an elevated basal metabolic rate, which in term neonates compensates for the small body size, is only achieved with delay. As this is correlated to the growth retardation typical of prematurity, the postnatal metabolic increase is usually considered to be a precondition for growth. However, a comparative calorimetric investigation has revealed thar in a marsupial species normally born in a very immature state, a rapid weight increase occurs at a low metabolic rate. Obviously, these animals retain a growth efficiency which in humans is confined to intrauterine life and interrupted by preterm birth. Moreover, their low O-2 consumption rate is adaptive to restricted respiratory surface area and incomplete tissue vascularization and contributes to hypoxia tolerance. Therefore, although postnatal metabolic increase promotes thermal stability and weight increase in term and slightly preterm human neonates, metabolic reduction may be the more appropriate strategy in cases where O-2 and substrate supply are limited by extreme immaturity. As long as the factors mediating natural metabolic suppression are unknown, careful thermal protection seems to be one of the most promising ways to prevent uneconomic metabolic activation in highly preterm human neonates.

VL  - 106

SP  - 15379-15383
AB  - Many species expanded their geographic ranges from core "refugium'' populations when the global climate warmed after the Pleistocene. The bottlenecks that occur during such range expansions diminish genetic variation in marginal populations, rendering them less responsive to selection. Here, we show that range expansion also strongly depletes inbreeding depression. We compared inbreeding depression among 20 populations across the expanded range of a common European plant, and found that marginal populations had greatly reduced inbreeding depression. Similar patterns were also revealed by multilocus computer simulations. Low inbreeding depression is predicted to ease conditions for the evolution of self-fertilization, and selfing is known to be particularly frequent in marginal populations. Therefore, our findings expose a remarkable aspect of evolution at range margins, where a history of expansion can reverse the direction of selection on the mating system, providing a parsimonious explanation for the high incidence of selfing in marginal populations.

AB  - Non-breeding cluster populations of Danaus plexippus (Danaidae) were monitored at five sites in the Sydney area of New South Wales for 5 years. Meteorological records showed that cluster formation was always preceded by periods of cool overcast weather, during which maximum temperatures remained below 18°C for at least 2 days. Field experiments were carried out to test the hypothesis that low post-eclosion temperatures cause reproductive dormancy in Australian D. plexippus. Butterflies were reared in the laboratory and on eclosion exposed to selected temperatures and photophases for 2-4 days before being tagged and released. Recapture data showed that high post-eclosion temperatures (19 or 28°C) inhibited long-distance flight and resulted in ovarian development, but low temperatures (15:6°C, 7:17 h) inhibited ovarian development and permitted long-distance flight. Intermediate temperatures (e.g. 15°C or 12±3°C continuously) gave mixed results. Photoperiod during or before the period of exposure to low temperature did not affect reproduction. The induction, maintenance and termination of reproductive dormancy in Australian D. plexippus are discussed. © Australian Journal of Zoology.

AB  - Cornops aquaticum (Bruner) is host specific on Eichhornia spp. and Pontederia spp. (Pontederiacae). Its present distribution ranges from Mexico to Argentina. The number of juvenile instars (5-7) apparently mirrors the photoperiod and temperature pulses of different climatical conditions in the respective geographical regions. Based on life-history data, three working hypotheses are proposed for forthcoming studies. These will test whether the varying number of juvenile instars represents a phenotypic plasticity of a single genotype or an adaptation that is genetically fixed, due to an evolutionary relationship of the host with its host-plant.

AB  - A field experiment with Cepaea nemoralis is described. Twenty cages, designed to exclude vertebrate predators, divided equally between five sites at different altitudes in a single valley, were populated by adult snails taken from a 180 m population sampled in adjacent 10 m “donors The population showed a steep cline in morph frequencies. Each morph from each donor was apportioned equally between the cages. Between May and October 1974 more than half the snails died. There were position-dependent differences in mortality, and survival was greater where the morph frequencies in the original population were clinal. Repeated differences in survival between the morphs occurred at four sites, and these were opposite in direction between two of them. Brown-shelled snails survived best at an apparently cool site and worst at an exposed one. Overall, yellow five-banded snails survived better than the other morphs.It is suggested that overcrowding is a primary source of stress for all the morphs, and that temperature is important in determining the selective outcome between them. Alternative interpretations are given. It is concluded that the population cage provides a useful tool for the study of natural selection in Cepaea. © 1980 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

TI  - Cushion plants as microclimatic shelters for two ladybird beetles species in alpine zone of central Chile
VL  - 38
IS  - 2
SP  - 224-227
AB  - High mountain environments are highly stressful for insect survival. It has been suggested that small microtopographic variations generating less stressful microclimatic conditions than the surrounding environment would provide more suitable sites for insect development. Cushion plants represent one of the life forms best adapted to the extreme alpine habitats. Cushion plants can modify microclimatic conditions within and under their canopy, generating less severe microsites than the surrounding environment. In this study, we characterized the microclimatic modifications made by the cushion plants Azorella monantha and Laretia acaulis and examine their role as microclimatic shelters for two species of high Andean coleopterans (Coccinelidae): Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia variegata at 3200 m a.s.l. in the Andes of central Chile. Results showed that the cushion species create microhabitats with higher availability of water and less oscillating temperatures. However, the intensity of modifications was higher in A. monantha compared to L. acaulis. The abundance of the two ladybird beetle species was higher within cushions than outside, although E. connexa showed higher abundances compared to H. variegata. However, a habitat selection experiment in a greenhouse showed that under milder temperature conditions ladybird beetles species do not prefer cushions. This suggests that in the harsh alpine climate, cushion plants may act as microclimatic shelters since they reduce stressful environmental conditions, allowing greater abundances of coleopterans than in the surrounding environment. © 2006 Regents of the University of Colorado.

AB  - In the present work, factorial design and response surface techniques were used in combination with modeling and simulation to design and optimize an industrial bioprocess. Alcoholic fermentation process with multiple stages was considered. The fermentation system is composed of four ideal continuous-stirred tank reactors (ICSTR), linked in series,with cell recycling. Operational conditions for maximal yield and productivity were determined with ten parameters under consideration: temperature (four stages), residence time for each stage, cell recycling concentration, and the fraction of fresh medium fed into the second fermentation stage. Initially, screening design methodology was used to evaluate the process variables which were relevant in relation to yield and productivity. Five statistically significant parameters for each response were selected and utilized in factorial design in order to optimize the process. With the models obtained from the factorial design, response surfaces were generated, and the productivity improved to 12 g/l.h (an increase of 52% in relation to the control version of the bioprocess), while maintaining the high yield of 86.28% (99.1% conversion).

AB  - The effect of kernel composition (100, 50, 25, 10, 4 and 0 mol% UC in UO2) on the failure distribution of SiC coatings in TRISO-coated particles at selected temperatures of 1800 to 2500° C was determined by radiographie and metallographic methods. Scatter observed in the particle failure times are associated with observed variations in the coating dimensions and material properties of the pyrocarbon and/or SiC. The SiC survival time in particles with UC2 kernels was found to be 1 10 and that with UO2 + UC2 kernels about 1 2 that with pure UO2 kernels at 2200 to 2400° C. The longer survival time in particles containing greater amounts of UO2 results from less U-SiC interaction due to lower UC2 contents and lower diffusion rates of U as UO2 than as UC2 through pyrocarbon. Partial melting of the UC2 kernels at temperatures below the UC2 -graphite eutectic temperature of 2430° C appears to be due to Si alloying. © 1981.

Two wild strains, the Anticarsia gemmatalis MNPV (AgMNPV) and the Trichoplusia ni MNPV (TnMNPV), and two selected strains, AgMNPV‐D10 and TnMNPV‐D11 were inoculated in 11‐day‐old D. saccharalis larvae and kept in temperatures of 17, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37 and 39°C. The results showed that larval mortality increased with temperature, and the increase of temperature caused also the reduction of lethal time 50% (LT50) values. The maximal polyhedral production was obtained at 28°C for the 4 viral strains and a drastic reduction in the number of polyhedra was observed even for a difference of 2°C above or below this ideal temperature. The selected strains showed a 10‐fold increase in polyhedra yield when compared to the wild type strains. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

VL  - 23
IS  - 3
SP  - 528-538
AB  - Climate change will alter the distribution and abundance of many species, including those of concern to human health. Accurate predictions of these impacts must be based on an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and organisms, and a consideration of evolutionary responses. Here we use biophysical models of energy and mass transfer to predict climatic impacts on the potential range of the dengue fever vector, Aedes aegypti, in Australia. We develop a first-principles approach to calculate water depth and daily temperature cycles in containers differing in size, catchment and degree of shading to assess habitat suitability for the aquatic life cycle phase. We also develop a method to predict potential climatic impacts on the evolutionary response of traits limiting distribution. Our predictions show strong correspondence with the current and historical distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti in Australia, suggesting that inland and northern limits are set by water availability and egg desiccation resistance, and southern limits by adult and larval cold tolerance. While we predict that climate change will directly increase habitat suitability throughout much of Australia, the potential indirect impact of changed water storage practices by humans in response to drought may have a greater effect. In northern Australia, we show that evolutionary changes in egg desiccation resistance could potentially increase the chances of establishment in a major centre (Darwin) under climate change. Our study demonstrates how biophysical models of climate-animal interactions can be applied to make decisions about managing biotic responses to climate change. Mechanistic models of the kind we apply here can provide more robust and general predictions than correlative analyses. They can also explicitly incorporate evolutionary responses, the outcomes of which may significantly alter management decisions. © 2009 British Ecological Society.

SP  - 665-670
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the response of maize (Zea mays) male and female mature reproductive tissues to temperature stress. We have tested the fertilization abilities of the stressed spikelets and pollen using in vitro pollination-fertilization to determine their respective tolerance to stress. The synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) was also analyzed in male and female tissues using electrophoresis of 35S-labeled proteins and fluorography, to establish a relationship between the physiological and molecular responses. Pollen, spikelets, and pollinated spikelets were exposed to selected temperatures (4, 28, 32, 36, or 40°C) and tested using an in vitro fertilization system. The fertilization rate is highly reduced when pollinated spikelets are exposed to temperatures over 36°C. When pollen and spikelets are exposed separately to temperature stress, the female tissues appear resistant to 4 hours of cold stress (4°C) or heat stress (40°C). Under heat shock conditions, the synthesis of a typical set of HSPs is induced in the female tissues. In contrast, the mature pollen is sensitive to heat stress and is responsible for the failure of fertilization at high temperatures. At the molecular level, no heat shock response is detected in the mature pollen.

AB  - Principal components analysis and multiple linear regression analysis have been applied to evaluate trends and tendencies in the catalytic behaviour of a multipromoted rhodium catalyst (Rh-Ir-Fe-Ti/SiO2) in carbon monoxide hydrogenation with special emphasis laid on the oxygenated products. By varying temperature (488-623 K), pressure (0.1-6 MPa), space velocity (1000-8000 h-1) and hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio (0.5-3.0), the influence of these parameters on the consumption rate and conversion of carbon monoxide, and on selectivities to the products, as well as productivity of ethanol has been evaluated. Chemometrics has been shown to be a useful method for rationalization and effective presentation of observations. A high spacetime yield of ethanol [STY (C2-ol)] is obtained with increasing pressure and temperatures up to ca. 590 K. At higher temperatures the increase of selectivity towards methane at the expense of the oxygenates results in a drastic decrease of STY (C2-ol). © 1990.

AB  - The goal of these experiments was to determine if the increased longevity characteristic of our genetically selected long lived line of Drosophil a could be attributed to metabolic differences. The data shows an inverse relationship between life span and temperature for both the long lived (L) and normal (R) strains; however, the higher longevity of the L strain relative to the R strain is not affected by these treatments. Therefore, the genetic factors unique to the L strain do not affect the same processes affected by the temperature treatments. A second set of experiments detected a linear relationship between the MDMR (mean daily metabolic rate) and the ambient adult temperature. However, at each temperature, the MDMR of either strain was statistically equivalent; a finding which demonstrates that an increased life span depends on something other than conservation of calories. A third set of experiments looked at the metabolic efficiency of the two strains and were not able to detect any statistically significant differences. The two strains appear to expend approximately equivalent numbers of calories per day in an approximately equivalent manner. These data are interpreted in the context both of a previously postulated genetic switch mechanism believed responsible for initiating the onset of senescence, and of contemporary reinterpretations of the "rate of living" theory which implicates the essential role of various anti-oxidant defense systems. © 1988.

TI  - Evolution of viviparity in warm-climate lizards: An experimental test of the maternal manipulation hypothesis
VL  - 20
IS  - 3
SP  - 1037-1045
AB  - The maternal manipulation hypothesis for the evolution of reptilian viviparity has been claimed to apply to any situation where gravid females are able to maintain body temperatures different from those available in external nests, but empirical data that support this hypothesis are very limited. Here, we tested this hypothesis using gravid females of a warm-climate lizard, Mabuya multifasciata, by subjecting them to five thermal regimes for the whole gestation period. We found gravid females selected lower body temperatures and thermoregulated more precisely than did nongravid females. Offspring produced in different treatments differed in head size, limb length and sprint speed, but not in overall body size or mass. Variation in morphological traits of offspring was induced primarily by extreme temperatures. Sprint speed of offspring was more likely affected by the mean but not by the variance of gestation temperatures. Gravid females maintained more stable body temperatures than did nongravid females not because these temperatures resulted in the optimization of offspring phenotypes but because the range of temperatures optimal for embryonic development was relatively narrow. Our data conform to the main predictions from the maternal manipulation hypothesis that females should adjust thermoregulation during pregnancy to provide optimal thermal conditions for developing embryos and that phenotypic traits forged by maternal thermoregulation should enhance offspring fitness. © 2007 The Authors.

VL  - 3

AB  - Some lakes with an historical record of fish populations have undergone acidification and fish no longer exist in these systems. Toxicity data suggest that the inability of fish to survive in these acidic environments is due to increased concentrations of hydrogen ion (H+) and aluminum (Al+++) in the water column. To reestablish fish populations in lakes of this kind it is necessary to (1) determine that fish are no longer present, (2) demonstrate that fish either cannot or have limited potential to survive in the systems, and (3) change the water quality, and demonstrate increased survival of fish under differing chemical conditions. We examined two acidic lakes (Woods Lake, pH 5.0 and Cranberry Pond, pH 4.8) for the first two conditions by conducting fisheries surveys and in situ bioassays using fingerling (age 0) brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Woods Lake was also stocked with brook trout in the fall of 1984 and overwinter survival of two age classes determined. Emigration from the lake accounted for a relatively small percentage of the approximately 90 percent mortality in these stocked fish over winter. Neither acclimation procedures or experimental selection of brook trout for acid tolerance improved survival. Prior to, during, and after calcium carbonate addition to the lakes in the early summer of 1985 an extensive series of in situ bioassays was conducted that showed significantly improved survival of both age 0 and 1 brook trout after liming. Interactive effects of temperature, pH, and aluminum levels were evident during these experiments. No detrimental effects of liming on fish survival were observed. © 1987 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Geographical and altitudinal population genetic structure of two dung fly species with contrasting mobility and temperature preference
VL  - 89
IS  - 2
SP  - 99-106
AB  - Local adaptation of populations requires some degree of spatio-temporal isolation. Previous studies of the two dung fly species Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea have revealed low levels of geographic and altitudinal genetic differentiation in quantitative life history and morphological traits, but instead high degrees of phenotypic plasticity. These patterns suggest that gene flow is extensive despite considerable geographic barriers and large spatio-temporal variation in selection on body size and related traits. In this study we addressed this hypothesis by investigating genetic differentiation of dung fly populations throughout Switzerland based on the same 10 electrophoretic loci in each species. Overall, we found no significant geographic differentiation of populations for either species. This is inconsistent with the higher rates of gene flow expected due to better flying capacity of the larger S. stercoraria. However, heterozygote deficiencies within populations indicated structuring on a finer scale, seen for several loci in S. cynipsea, and for the locus PGM (Phosphoglucomutase) in S. stercoraria. Additionally, S. cynipsea showed a tendency towards a greater gene diversity at higher altitudes, mediated primarily by the locus MDH (malate dehydrogenase), at which a second allele was only present in populations above 1000 m. This may be caused by increased environmental stress at higher altitudes in this warm-adapted species. MDH might thus be a candidate locus subject to thermal selection in this species, but this remains to be corroborated by direct evidence. In S. stercoraria, no altitudinal variation was found.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 69-77
AB  - Growth, molting, and survival of juvenile crayfish, Procambarus a. acutus, were recorded under constant and variable temperature regimes. Crayfish were exposed to four rhythmic regimes: Constant temperatures of 10, 17.5, and 25°C, and a daily square-wave cyclic regime of 10 to 25°C (X = 17.5°C); and to one arrhythmic temperature regime: A daily square-wave acyclic regime varying within 10 to 25°C limits (X=17.8°C). The direction and magnitude of temperature changes in the acyclic variable temperature chamber were selected randomly to make temperature changes unpredictable within the specified range. Rhythmic and arrhythmic temperature regimes had different effects on growth, molting, and survival of crayfish. Growth under both variable regimes was similar to growth at a constant temperature (17.5°C) equal to the mean of the variable regimes. Molt frequency was directly related to temperature. Growth rates approximately paralleled changes in the adjusted molt rate for each regime. Mortality under variable regimes approximated mortality at a constant temperature (25°C) equal to the upper extreme of the variable regimes. The cyclic regime tended to be less optimal for growth and survival than the acyclic regime, possibly because of differences in average daily temperature fluctuations and relative time spent at temperature extremes. © 1981 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.

AB  - The metabolism of juvenile hormone by JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase, and octopamine by tyrosine decarboxylase were studied under normal and stress conditions in flies of two related lines of D. melanogaster. One was selected for high (HA line) and another for low (LA line) male sexual activity for more than 700 generations. It was demonstrated that prolonged selection for low male sexual activity results in considerable changes in both systems. Tyrosine decarboxylase activity in males and females of the LA line was sharply reduced as compared with those of the HA and controle Canton-S lines; JH-esterase and JH-epoxide hydrolase activities were decreased in females, and not in males, of the LA line. It was demonstrated that the response of both metabolic systems to heat stress is impaired in individuals of the LA line: the system of juvenile hormone metabolism does not respond to stress, and that of octopamine metabolism is decelerated. The role of juvenile hormone metabolism in male reproductive function is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 23

SP  - 777-790
AB  - We used a cold-climate viviparous lacertid lizard (Eremias prezwalskii) as a model system to test the maternal manipulation hypothesis. Twenty-four gravid females collected from a population in Inner Mongolia (northern China) were maintained in the laboratory for the whole gestation length, with 12 allowed to bask for 14-h daily and the other 12 for 10-h daily. Females selected lower body temperatures but did not thermoregulate more precisely when gravid. The mean gestation length was shorter in females provided with longer basking opportunity. Neonates in the two treatments differed in tail length and the number of ventral scales but not in other examined morphological traits, with offspring born in the 14-h treatment having longer tails but fewer ventral scales. Offspring were sexually dimorphic at birth, with females being smaller in tail length, head length and fore-limb length but having more ventral scales than males of the same size. Offspring born in the 14-h treatment were not only faster runners but also grew faster than did offspring born in the 10-h treatment. Our data validate the main predictions of the maternal manipulation hypothesis that females should shift selected body temperatures during gestation to provide optimal thermal conditions for developing embryos and that phenotypic traits determined by maternal thermoregulation should enhance offspring fitness. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the maternal manipulation hypothesis applies to cold-climate viviparous reptiles. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

VL  - 66

AB  - The incorporation of additives into polymers like bisphenol A polysulfone (PSF) can provide an attractive alternative for modifying their permselective properties for gas separation, provided the additive is appropriately selected. In this work, three series of additives based on naphthalene, bisphenol A, and fluorene structures were incorporated into PSF and their effect on gas transport properties was measured. The results show that these additives increase selectivity and reduce permeability of PSF when incorporated at low concentrations. The largest increases in selectivity for the gas pairs He/CH4, H-2/CH4, and O-2/N-2 are caused by those additives that cause the largest reductions in the glass transition temperature and fractional free volume, and typically, they are made up of planar molecules containing polar or small asymmetric protuberances. The productivity-selectivity balance response of the modified PSF membranes reveals that the naphthalene-based additives containing asymmetric groups of atoms lead to membranes with higher selectivity and with only small losses in permeability relative to the unmodified PSF membranes. The addition of 20 wt % of the glassy additive Kenflex A into PSF causes a fourfold increase in the selectivity of PSF to He/CH, at the expense of a 37% reduction in the permeability of helium.

VL  - 74

AB  - 1. Evidence suggests that changes of temperature-related performance curves can trigger a selective response in life-history traits. Hence, it should be expected that insects adapted to different temperature regimes should exhibit optimal performance at the temperature to which they are adapted. 2. To test this idea we investigated how fecundity and longevity are influenced by ambient temperatures in a set of satyrine butterflies adapted to live in dry open landscapes or in closed forest landscapes, respectively, by keeping egg-laying adult females at five different constant temperatures ranging between 20 and 40degreesC. 3. We studied four species, two of which are confined to dry and hot open habitats, namely the grayling (Hipparchia semele) and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), and two of which are shade dwelling, namely the ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus) and the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria). 4. As predicted, the results showed that lifetime fecundity exhibited bell-shaped curves in relation to temperature with the open landscape group peaking at a higher temperature, 30degreesC, compared with the shade-dwelling group that peaked at 25degreesC. Longevity decreased with increasing temperatures among all species, but the open landscape living species survived better at higher temperatures. Moreover, although the magnitude of reproductive effort measured as lifetime egg mass did not differ between the two ecological groups, lifetime fecundity did with open landscape species laying more and smaller eggs than the shade-dwelling species. 5. This difference in life-history character traits suggests either that dry and relatively warm open habitats open life-history opportunities in terms of higher fecundity and longevity that remain closed to butterflies adapted to cooler temperatures, or that life in dry open habitats actively selects for higher fecundity and survival as a result of increased offspring mortality.

TI  - The adaptive significance of colour pattern polymorphism in the Australian scincid lizard Lampropholis delicata
VL  - 55
IS  - 4
SP  - 273-291
AB  - Females of Lampropholis delicata are dimorphic for colour pattern, the difference between morphs being the presence or absence of a distinct white mid-lateral stripe. A less distinct striped morph occurs also in males. We evaluated alternative hypotheses for the maintenance of this polymorphism by examining temporal and spatial variation in morph frequency, testing for differential selection among morphs using data on body size and reproductive traits from preserved specimens, and experimentally manipulating colour pattern in free-ranging lizards of both sexes, to assess the influence of the lateral stripe on survival rates. We found that the relative frequency of striped individuals varied among populations and decreased from north to south in both sexes, coincident with an increasing incidence of regenerated tails. Morph frequencies did not change through time within a population. Striped gravid females appeared to survive better and produced larger clutches than did non-striped females. In our experimental study, the relationship between survival and colour morph differed between the two sexes; males painted with a white lateral stripe had lower survival than control (brown stripe) males, but survival did not differ between striped and control females. The different response in the two sexes may be due partly to differences in temperature and microhabitat selection. We propose that the white lateral stripe decreases susceptibility to predators in gravid females but increases risk of predation in males, especially in combination with low temperatures. The polymorphism might be maintained by: (1) opposing fitness consequences of the stripe in males and females; (2) sex-specific habitat selection; and (3) gene flow in combination with spatial variation in relative fitness of the two morphs.

VL  - 23

SP  - 183-189
AB  - Select temperatures, above normal, are shown to reduce success of fertilization and normal early cleavage in the laboratory for the echinoderms Acanthaster planci (L.), Culcita novaeguineae Muller and Troschel, Linckia laevigata (L.), Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville), and Diadema savignyi Michelin. The data indicate that cleavage is more sensitive to increased temperature than is fertilization. Upper tolerance limits for early cleavage in most of the species examined is near 34.0°C. The early developmental stages of A. planci were the most sensitive to elevated temperature, and those of E. mathaei, the least sensitive. Further experiments with E. mathaei showed that unfertilized ova were still viable, dividing normally when fertilized after 2 h exposure at 36.0°C. The ova were significantly less viable after 3 h. Early cleavage stages of E. mathaei were resistant to 36.0°C for exposure times of up to 40 min, but were inhibited beyond this period. It is suggested that the ability of E. mathaei to develop normally at 34.0°C (6C° above ambient temperature) and to withstand limited exposure to 36.0°C may account for the wide distribution of this species in habitats which are often subjected to broad temperature fluctuations, such as reef flats. © 1973 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Previously, we reported that subterranean Liriomyza trifolii pupae can be killed with solar radiation by covering the ground with transparent polyvinylchloride film after cropping of a leafy vegetable, Chrysanthemum coronarium? var. spatiosum. In order to quantify the conditions necessary to achieve effective control oft. trifolii in Osaka Prefecture, we investigated the mortality of pupae at selected temperature and duration combinations, as well as the soil temperatures attained under transparent polyvinylchloride film in a closed greenhouse at specific times of the year L. trifolii pupae were killed by exposure to either 44 degreesC for 24 h, 46 degreesC for 3 h or 48-54 degreesC for 30 min. Maximum temperatures of 48 degreesC or higher were attained from early April to mid October at a depth of 1-2 cm beneath the soil surface under transparent polyvinylchloride film in a closed greenhouse. Many L, trifolii pupate at 1-2 cm beneath the soil surface. Therefore, this control method for L, trifolii pupae is effective during the period from early April to mid October.

VL  - 220
IS  - 1
SP  - 655-666
AB  - The influence of water temperature (17 and 25 degreesC) and a period of fasting on the self-selection of macronutrients were examined in common carp held on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Eight replicate groups of juvenile carp (ca. 15 g body weight at 17 degreesC and 25 g at 25 degreesC) were fed with three test diets [high-protein (HP), high-fat (HF) and high-carbohydrate (HC) diets] by individual self-feeders for 3 weeks, followed by a 2-week period of fasting and then 3 weeks of refeeding. At 17 degreesC, the carp initially selected the HP and HF diets [HP/HF/HC (%) = 3 8:40:22], whereas at 25 degreesC, the carp selected the HP diet over the others (55:21:24). After fasting, the carp tended to increase their demand for the HF diet at 17 degreesC and for the HC diet at 25 degreesC, but the overall self-selection of the test diets did not differ markedly from that prior to fasting. Carp held at 17 degreesC had higher relative whole body fat content and plasma triglyceride concentration; the latter decreased markedly during fasting. These results suggest that water temperature influences the macronutrient selection by carp: a relatively high demand for both protein and fat at 17 degreesC and for protein at 25 degreesC. Two weeks of fasting, however, did not markedly alter their macronutrient selection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genesis of the Giant, Bonanza San Rafael Lode Tin Deposit, Peru: Origin and significance of pervasive alteration
VL  - 97

SP  - 1741-1777
AB  - The San Rafael Sn-Cu deposit, located at lat 14degrees13'58" S, long 70degrees19'18".W, on the upper slopes of the Cordillera de Carabaya, nor-them Puno Department, southeastern Peru, yielded 38,182 t of fine tin in 2001 and, with reserves of 14.460 Mt at 5.14 percent Sri, the main San Rafael Lode constitutes, both at present and historically, the largest-known bonanza-grade cassiterite repository. Sri and subordinate Cu mineralization were confined to laterally and vertically extensive brittle shear zones generated by regional tectonism that transect a small 24.65 +/- 0.20 Ma, epizonal stock of strongly peraluminous, Lachlan S-type cordierite-biotite monzogranite and granodiorite. Early, barren, stage I quartz-tourmaline veins and breccias were emplaced at 24.10 +/- 0.15 Ma by high-temperature (less than or equal to580degreesC), boiling, saline fluids that plausibly directly exsolved from the granitic melt, whereas both cassiterite (stage II) and, at higher elevations, chalcopyrite (stage III) ores were precipitated from largely nonboiling, cooler (T-h = 215degrees-420degreesC), and less saline (0-20 wt % NaCl equiv) fluids at 21.9 to 22.7 +/- circa 0.5 Ma. Only narrow (less than or equal to2 m) envelopes of chlorite and weaker sericite and silica are associated with stages II and III veins, but more than 80 percent of the upper 750 m of the San Rafael stock experienced quasipervasive hydrothermal alteration. Early K metasomatism is recorded by widespread replacement of magmatic plagioclase and perthitic alkali feldspar by Na-free orthoclase, while broadly coeval alteration to albite more erratically affected groundmass plagioclase and the rims of alkali feldspar phenocrysts. Despite the intensity of the alkali metasomatism, only minor redistribution of dispersed, magmatic Sn occurred, largely during alteration to orthoclase. Other petrographically similar granitic bodies in the region experienced more intense Na metasomatism, and they host argentian base metal rather than Sn-dominated veins. Superimposed hydrolytic alteration, most intense within 20 to 30 m of the San Rafael Lodes, converted biotite to Fe-rich chlorite and converted alkali feldspar and plagioclase to fine-grained muscovite, but there is no significant dispersed cassiterite or chalcopyrite. Secondary fluid inclusions trapped in quartz phenocrysts of the granitic rocks range in salinity from 0 to 65 wt percent NaCl equiv and in T-h from 200degrees to 530degreesC; fluid boiling is evident in the higher-temperature populations. First-melting temperatures and decrepitate analyses reveal, in addition to NaCl, widely variable concentrations of KCl, CaCl2 (attaining 40 wt % of the solute) and, apparently most abundant in proximity to the lodes, FeCl2. Entrapment pressures are estimated to have fluctuated in the range 150 to 615 bars for much of the hydrothermal history, but fluid overpressuring to at least 2 kbar occurred, probably cyclically, during the evolution of the hydrothermal system. The salinity vs. homogenization temperature range for the phenocryst-hosted inclusions closely matches that of primary inclusions in quartz and cassiterite in the lodes and, remarkably, small clusters of the former record the entire thermal and compositional trajectory of the mineralizing fluids. Early magmatic brines are inferred to have permeated much of the stock whereas, circa 2 my. later, Sn- and Cu-rich, lower-temperature, lower-pH fluids were largely channeled along the evolving shear zones where they mixed with cool, nonsaline, tectonically driven ground water. In conjunction with fluid neutralization through hydrolytic alteration, this channeling resulted in catastrophic precipitation of botryoidal and coarsely crystalline cassiterite and, subsequently, chalcopyrite. The hiatus between initial retrograde boiling and ore deposition, a feature documented in several world-class, high-grade lithophile-element deposits, may record protracted storage of metal-rich brines at depth, perhaps in association with small volumes of highly fractionated melt, such as is represented by small bodies of tourmaline leucogranite exposed on the upper margin of the San Rafael stock. However, the parallel evolution in temperature and salinity exhibited by the early nonmineralizing and later fertile hydrothermal fluids may also indicate that Sn and Cu were largely introduced into the subjacent magma chamber at a late stage.

SP  - 387-398
AB  - The study investigated the ecophysiological differences between populations of the Common frog(Rana temporaria L.) from different altitudes in northern England. Frog embryos in upland northern ponds experience very low temperatures during the period of embryonic development. These embryos were found to have a lower lethal limit for 50% normal development of2–8 °C, compared with3–8 °C for lowland embryos. These values are below most of the lower limiting temperature estimates previously obtained for R. temporaria. Embryos from upland ponds developed faster at low temperatures than embryos from lowland ponds. This may be an adaptation to the shorter growing season and lower temperatures at higher altitudes. Upland female frogs were found to be shorter and produced fewer eggs than lowland females. The differences found between lowland and upland frogs are discussed in terms of their potential adaptive significance. Copyright © 1987, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 33

SP  - 20-28
AB  - Kin recognition has been demonstrated to play an important role in the social structure of a wide range of animals. Most studies to date have examined parent-offspring recognition only in species that provide offspring with direct parental care, however, there are several advantages to parent-offspring recognition even in the absence of direct parental care. In this study we investigated reciprocal mother-offspring recognition in the Australian scincid lizard Eulamprus heatwolei, a species that does not show direct parental care. We examined whether neonates could discriminate between their mothers and unrelated females, and whether females could discriminate between their offspring and unrelated neonates, via chemical cues, using retreat site selection experiments. We conducted trials when neonates were 1 and 4 weeks old to investigate whether responses are maintained as neonates age. We found that both neonates and mothers could discriminate between related and unrelated individuals when neonates were 1 week old. Mothers were more likely to take refuge under tiles treated with the odours of their own offspring, while neonates spent less time in areas treated with the odours of unrelated females. At 4 weeks of age, mothers no longer exhibited discriminatory behaviour between their offspring and unrelated neonates, while neonates were more likely to associate with the odour of any female over the odourless control. We hypothesize that reciprocal mother-offspring recognition in E. heatwolei reduces interference competition between mothers and their offspring and also may be important in habitat selection and territory establishment. © 2008 The Authors.

TI  - Flue temperature fuzzy control for coke oven heating process based on multi-operative modes analysis
VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 155-161
AB  - An optimization control method was presented for the flue temperature in multi-operative modes in the coordinating layer and the optimizing control layer for coke oven heating process. At the coordinating layer, the real-time operative mode of the heating process which was identified by the raw gas temperature, was acquired through the information fusion method of second decision. Proper optimization control model was chosen according to different operative model. At the optimizing layer, a multi-objective optimization method for optimizing parameters based on adaptive genetic algorithms was proposed to deal with the difficulties in tuning parameters of the fuzzy control model. By using elitist strategy and roulette wheel algorithm in selection adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities, the global searching ability and the convergence speed of the genetic algorithms were significantly improved. Through properly weighting the terms including control errors, energy consumption and tuning time to construct the fitness function, the fuzzy control model can be optimized to satisfaction. Obvious effect of this method was obtained in the application and a new approach for the optimization control of coke oven was provided.

VL  - 46
IS  - 2
SP  - 99-107
AB  - On a common view of evolution, natural selection is the major force that produces evolutionary change. Selection is thought to operate on different types (genotypes or phenotypes) in populations so as to generate differential reproductive survival of these types. This should engender changes in population composition. The conception of selection as a "force" should be considered as a convenient shorthand that easily misleads us. Selection is not a factor over and above items such as temperature regimes, predators, and so forth. These items do causal work in evolutionary processes. The term "selection" is merely an abstract placeholder for them. Differential reproductive survival thus appears to depend on particular environmental items that influence different types in different ways. Such items are properly regarded as the selective agents. On the face of it, selection processes must always be due to the operation of such agents. I argue that this is a mistaken assumption. Processes of selection may well occur in the absence of selective agents. That is because environmental factors may contribute to differential reproductive survival even if they do not affect different genotypes or phenotypes in different ways. Considering the role of the environment in selection, we should distinguish between selective agents and contributive agents.

TI  - Testing the pluralist approach to sex: The influence of environment on synergistic interactions between mutation load and parasitism in Daphnia magna
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SP  - 1603-1611
AB  - Both deleterious mutations and parasites have been acknowledged as potential selective forces responsible for the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction. The pluralist approach to sex proposes that these two factors may have to interact synergistically in order to stabilize sex, and one of the simplest ways this could occur is if parasites are capable of causing synergistic epistasis between mutations in their hosts. However, the effects of both deleterious mutations and parasitism are known to be influenced by a range of environmental factors, so the nature of the interaction may depend upon the organisms' environment. Using chemically mutated Daphnia magna lines, we examined the effects of mutation and parasitism under a range of temperature and food regimes. We found that although parasites were capable of causing synergistic epistasis between mutations in their hosts, these effects were dependent upon an interaction between parasite genotype and temperature. © 2006 The Authors.

VL  - 75

SP  - 367-392
AB  - The status of foraminiferal knowledge is reviewed in the light of some common misconceptions, as erroneous results have come from some misapplied facts. The quantity of foraminiferal publications has been exaggerated by a high degree of bibliographic documentation, although less than half of the publications cited concern foraminifera themselves, their morphology, taxonomy or occurrence, and less than 17 per cent are dominantly taxonomic; the remainder concern their stratigraphic application. Classification and taxonomic subdivision in foraminifera is compared to that in other invertebrates and other groups of Protozoa. In a graphic representation of the rate of proposal of foraminiferal genera, the cumulative totals for the past 200 years follow a straight line on a semilog graph, with no indication of the discontinuity to be expected from a supposed taxonomic surge coincident with and resulting from foraminiferal economic application. The taxonomic expansion of the fresh- water uneconomic "thecamoebians" has followed a similar pattern. Proposal of new foraminiferal genera has resulted from new methods of study, additional morphologic criteria, study of micro-structures, emphasis on the living animal and life cycles, and work in previously neglected strata and regions. Certain concepts and ideas require an understanding of foraminiferal biology for correct application. The apparent geographic subspecies, differentiated by size, result from temperature-controlled delay or acceleration of the reproductive cycle, larger shells occurring in less favorable environments (colder water, decreased salinity, etc.). Robust foraminiferal specimens associated with depauperate invertebrate faunas are not an anomalous occurrence, but an indication of adverse conditions. Migration time required for planktonic species is regarded as negligible. Their current-borne rate of dispersal is discussed on the basis of data from modern current studies. The present emergent continents are seen to be a more formidable though not complete barrier to planktonic migrations than was present during the Cretaceous and Tertiary time of broad epicontinental seas. The rate of evolutionary change in Protozoa is compared to that of higher invertebrates and vertebrates, and shown to be theoretically rapid, because of short life span, rapid production of new generations, and great abundance of progeny. Causes of mutations and extinctions of pelagic organisms are discussed. The importance of the aragonite shell in foraminiferal taxonomy is regarded as unaffected by geologic age, the aragonite test being preserved as such or completely removed by solution. No specimen referrable to the superfamily Robertinacea has been found to have the test converted to calcite. Suggested lines of future study include stratigraphic and taxonomic studies in additional strata and regions, correlation of benthonic facies with planktonic zones, detailed morphologic studies of the test (gross morphology, wall microstructure and lamellar character, ultrastructures, apertural features, internal partitions and toothplates, test mineralogy, etc.,), and life cycles, morphology, physiology, genetics, and ecology of the living animal. © 1964, The Geological Society of America, Inc.

AB  - A study of single-phase convection and flow condensation heat transfer in horizontal copper tubes (8.81 mm inside diameter) was conducted using three refrigerants (HCFC-22, HFC-134a and HFC-410A). A smooth tube and three micro-fin tubes (axial, helical and crosshatch enhancement) were examined. Local-mean flow condensation data were experimentally obtained. Experimental conditions were selected to reflect typical operating conditions encountered in refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. All micro-fin tubes illustrated significant enhancement in single-phase convection and flow condensation. The cross-hatch enhancement performed particularly better in both single-phase convection and flow condensation. For the three refrigerants investigated, the refrigerant type seemed to have little influence on the enhancement mechanism of the micro-fin tubes examined. The experimental results are presented in Part I. Development of design equations is presented in Part II.

AB  - Crop management practices impact soil productivity by altering the soil environment, which in turn affects microbial growth and decomposition processes that transform plant-produced C to soil organic matter (SOM) or CO2. Reduced tillage increases SOM in the long term, but there is limited information on the in situ seasonal changes in soil physical and biological properties that affect SOM dynamics. Our objectives were to: (i) determine the effect of tillage (conventionally disked (CT) and no tillage (NT)) in a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) 2-year rotation sequence and a wheat/soybean double-cropping sequence on the seasonal dynamics and soil depth distribution of gravimetric soil water content (SWC), soil temperature, bulk density (BD) and water-filled pore space (WFPS); and (ii) relate soil CO2 evolution to changes in these physical properties. Treatments had been in place for 9 years at the beginning of sampling. The soil was a Weswood silty clay loam (fine, mixed, thermic Fluventic Ustochrept) located in southcentral Texas. Soil CO2 evolution, using the static chamber method with alkali absorption, and physical properties were measured 57 times during a 2-year period. Soil water content with NT was greater than with CT at the 0-50 mm depth during the fallow period of sorghum-wheat/soybean. In contrast to the surface, SWC at the 50-125 mm depth with CT was greater than or equal to that with NT in all crop sequences. Tillage reduced soil BD, especially at the 50-125 mm depth in all crop sequences, but exhibited large seasonal dynamics at the 0-50 mm depth. Greater temporal variation in SWC and BD occurred due to tillage effects. Soil temperature at 50 mm depth at sunrise averaged 1.2°C greater with NT than with CT during May, September and November, perhaps due to reduced heat loss with residue cover. The mean rate of soil CO2 evolution with CT was 1.55, 1.95 and 2.45 g CO2-C m-2 d-1 in sorghum-wheat/soybean, sorghum-wheat/soybean and wheat/soybean, respectively. The corresponding soil CO2 evolution with NT was 9% greater, 12% greater, and not different compared with CT, respectively. Large seasonal differences in soil CO2 evolution occurred with respect to tillage regime. Soil CO2 evolution was highly related to soil temperature, moisture and temperature-moisture interactions. Regression models of soil CO2 evolution on soil temperature, moisture and day of the season explained from 65 to 98% of the temporal variation, depending upon crop sequence, tillage regime and season. Day of the season was related to non-linear residue decomposition and a polynomial function that expressed crop root respiration and microbial respiration due to rhizodeposition. There were significant tillage and crop sequence interactions with soil temperature and moisture, suggesting that C budgets of agroecosystems derived from climatic data alone could be misleading. Conversion from CT to NT increased C sequestration in soil, but soil under NT released the same or more C as CO2, depending upon crop sequence, suggesting that the dynamics of C sequestration/mineralization had changed during the 10-year period. © 1995.

AB  - Mechanisms leading to gene variations are responsible for the diversity of species and are important components of the theory of evolution. One constraint on gene evolution is that of protein foldability; the three-dimensional shapes of proteins must be thermodynamically stable. We explore the impact of this constraint and calculate properties of foldable sequences using 3660 structures from the Protein Data Bank. We seek a selection function that receives sequences as input, and outputs survival probability based on sequence fitness to structure. We compute the number of sequences that match a particular protein structure with energy lower than the native sequence, the density of the number of sequences, the entropy, and the "selection" temperature. The mechanism of structure selection for sequences longer than 200 amino acids is approximately universal. For shorter sequences, it is not. We speculate on concrete evolutionary mechanisms that show this behavior.

AB  - The thermal and pH resistance of five representative salmonid fish pathogens were tested to examine the efficacy of procedures currently used for processing fish viscera to be incorporated into fish diets. Aeromonas salmonicida, Mycobacterium chelonei, Renibacterium salmoninarum, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) were suspended in buffered medium at pH 7.0 or 4.0, or in fish silage at pH 4.0 and their survival at selected temperatures was determined. When suspended in medium at pH 7.0, A. salmonicida, M. chelonei and IHNV were sensitive to temperatures in a range of 40-60°C. Renibacterium salmoninarum and IPNV were both more resistant to that temperature range in the neutral pH medium; however, each was inactivated by conditions simulating pasteurization. The combination of heat and low pH currently used for the processing and pasteurization of fish viscera should ensure that the resulting fish food is safe against spreading infectious diseases. © 1994.

SP  - 369-377
AB  - The use of surface temperature measurements to determine convective heating rates in hypersonic wind tunnels having running times of several seconds raises the problem of the variation of model material thermal properties with temperature and of the possible violation of the assumed semi-infinite response of the model wall. This problem has been recently examined in the particular cases of surface thermocouples (coax-gages) and thin-film gages deposited onto MACOR glass ceramic substrates. The technique used for calibrating model thermal diffusivity and conductivity is presented together with selected wind tunnel experiments demonstrating the improvement in data accuracy and productivity obtained by applying a data reduction procedure that takes into account both finite thickness effects and variations of thermal properties.

VL  - 1513

SP  - 122-130
AB  - The interaction of avidin - a basic protein from hen egg-white - with dimyristoyl-phosphatidylglycerol membranes was investigated by spin-label electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Phosphatidylcholines, bearing the nitroxide spin label at different positions along the sn-2 acyl chain of the lipid were used to investigate the effect of protein binding on the lipid chain-melting phase transition and acyl chain dynamics. Binding of the protein at saturating levels results in abolition of the chain-melting phase transition of the lipid and accompanying perturbation of the lipid acyl chain mobility. In the fluid phase region, the outer hyperfine splitting increases for all phosphatidylcholine spin-label positional isomers, indicating that the chain mobility is decreased by binding avidin. However, there was no evidence for direct interaction of the protein with the lipid acyl chains, clearly indicating that the protein does not penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. Selectivity experiments with different spin-labelled lipid probes indicate that avidin exhibits a preference for negatively charged lipid species, although all spin-labelled lipid species indirectly sense the protein binding. The interaction with negatively charged lipids is relevant to the use of avidin in applications such as the ultrastructural localization of biotinylated lipids in histochemical studies. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The mane of the African lion (Pantheraleo) is a highly variable trait that reflects male condition and ambient temperature. We examined the consequences of this variation in a long-term study of lions in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Mane darkness indicates nutrition and testosterone and influences both female choice and male-male competition. Mane length signals fighting success and only appears to influence male-male assessment. Dark-maned males enjoy longer reproductive life-spans and higher offspring survival, but they suffer higher surface temperatures, abnormal sperm, and lower food intake during hot months of the year. Maned males are hotter than females, and males have lighter and/or shorter manes in hotter seasons, years, and habitats. This phenotypic plasticity suggests that the mane will respond to forecasted increases in ambient temperature.

AB  - Seasonal reproduction in Crustacea is synchronized by environmental cues (e.g., temperature and photoperiod). Two types of responses occur: (1) in reptant decapods, short photoperiods and low temperatures are necessary to induce vitellogenesis; (2) in natant decapods and in most peracarids, both high temperatures and long photoperiods promote the onset of reproduction. In this context studies on the biological clocks involved in photoperiodic time measurement were performed on two crustaceans: the ditch shrimp Palaemonetes varians and the woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare, which is distributed worldwide outside polar and intertropical areas. The most important feature of the photoperiodic response curves was the same mean lag time in response to photophase length ≤ 12 h: short photophases delayed breeding but did not prevent it (i.e., “short-day effect”). On the contrary, long photophases promoted the onset of reproduction (i.e., “long-day effect”) differently in P. varians and A. vulgare. In A. vulgare strains the shape of the photoperiodic response curve depended on latitudinal origin. Results of “resonance” experiments provided evidence of involvement of an endogenous circadian component in the photoperiodic clocks of the two species according to the internal coincidence model developed for insects. Seeing that relations between reproduction and moulting were different in the two species, we proposed the hypothesis of an evolutionary change in the transition from the sea to the continental environment. © 1992 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

VL  - 144

SP  - 85-94
AB  - Current climate change patterns may cause more extreme and variable climates in the future, threatening agricultural productivity in many areas of the world. Because many smallholder, rural farmers depend on subsistence, rainfed agriculture, priorities should be focused on coping mechanisms that protect these farmers from future vulnerabilities. This paper examines one possible adaptive strategy for coffee agriculture. A high (60-80%), medium (35-65%), and low (10-30%) shade coffee site were chosen in the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico. Microclimate and soil moisture data were collected to examine the ability of shade tree cover in an agroforestry system to protect crop plants against extremes in microclimate and soil moisture fluctuation. Site and site by time effects were analyzed using linear mixed models to compare mean differences of microclimate measurements (temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation) by site as well as by time of the day. Although there were not large differences in seasonal means for these factors, site by time effects show that temperature, humidity, and solar radiation fluctuations increase significantly as shade cover decreases. Soil data showed significantly larger fluctuations in soil moisture gain and loss in the low shade site respective of patterns of precipitation. Overall, the amount of shade cover was directly related to the mitigation of variability in microclimate and soil moisture for the crop of interest. The use of agroforestry systems is an economically feasible way to protect crop plants from extremes in microclimate and soil moisture and should be considered a potential adaptive strategy for farmers in areas that will suffer from extremes in climate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We analyzed the foraging activity and the dietary spectrum of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr) and select native ants on cork oaks from Mediterranean open cork oak (Quercus suber) secondary forests. The study areas included invaded and noninvaded zones in close proximity. The Argentine ant's daily foraging activity was correlated to the abiotic factors studied, whereas the seasonal foraging activity was related not only to the variations in the average air temperature, but also to the trophic needs of the colony. Argentine ant workers focused their attention on protein foods during the queens' oviposition periods and during the larvae development phase, and on carbohydrate foods, such as honeydew, when males and workers were hatching. There were no significant differences over the entire year in the quantity of liquid food collected by the Argentine ant workers in comparison with the native ants studied. The solid diet of the Argentine ant on cork oaks is composed of insects, most of which are aphids. Our results have clear applications for control methods based on toxic baits in the invaded natural ecosystems of the Iberian Peninsula. © 2007 Entomological Society of America.

SP  - 461-468
AB  - The effects of weather conditions and two parasitoid quality attributes, realized fecundity and host acceptance, were assessed on the field efficacy of mass-released Trichogramma minutum. Temperature was the most important single variable, explaining up to 75% of the variation in field parasitism. There were significant positive relationships between both the sum of the maximum temperatures and the number of degree-hours above a 15 degrees C threshold, accumulated in the three days following the release, and parasitism in the field. There was a significant negative relationship between the mean relative humidity and the odds of parasitism in the field. Quality parameters based on parasitoid biology were not effective for predicting field efficacy if poor weather conditions persisted after a release. If weather conditions were 'good' (i.e. accumulated maximum temperatures above 62 degrees C, in the 3 days following the release), then parameters such as release rate and fecundity in the lab were useful predictors of field performance. There was no relationship between host acceptance measured in the lab and field parasitism Given the importance of field temperatures for field performance, selection for cold tolerance of T. minutum would be desirable.

VL  - 89

AB  - An evaluation of the link between climate and population dynamics requires understanding of climate effects both within and across generations. In ectothermic vertebrates, demographic responses to climate changes should crucially depend on balancing needs for heat and water. Here, we studied how temperature and rainfall regimes experienced before and during adulthood influenced reproductive performances (litter size, offspring size, and survival) in a natural population of the live-bearing common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, monitored continuously from 1989 to 2004. Rainfall regime, but not temperature, had both immediate and delayed effects on these reproductive performances. Rainfall during the first month of life was positively correlated with juvenile survival. Females experiencing more rainfall during gestation produced smaller neonates that showed greater survival when controlling for the positive effect of body size on survival. Furthermore, females that experienced heavier rainfall when in utero produced fewer but longer neonates during adulthood. These demographic effects of rainfall on adult reproductive traits may come from maternal effects of climate conditions and/or from delayed effects of rainfall on the environment experienced early in life. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, however, this study provides evidence of intergenerational climate effects in natural populations of an ectothermic vertebrate. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.

VL  - 10

SP  - 1173-1185
AB  - Hypothesis: Divergence in thermal preference, in combination with temperature-related metabolic adaptations, promotes ecological specialization and co-existence of a sympatric species pair of coregonid fish. Background: The coregonids show substantially lower divergence in diet composition than other sympatric fish pairs in temperate freshwater lakes, but segregate vertically within the pelagic area and differ in physiology with respect to metabolism. Organism: Sympatric European vendace (Coregonus albula) and endemic dwarf-sized Fontane cisco (C. fontanae) from Lake Stechlin, Germany. Methods: We determined the final thermal preferendum (FTP) of both species previously hatched and raised under identical laboratory conditions by using a shuttle-box system that allowed the fish to control body temperature through behavioural thermoselection. Results: The species showed clearly different temperature selection behaviours. Vendace had a significantly higher FTP (9.0°C) than Fontane cisco (4.2°C). The FTPs comply with temperatures of minimum net swimming costs, suggesting that performance is optimized at the respective thermal preference of both species. Conclusions: The correspondence of thermal preference, thermal performance functions, and thermal ecology shows that the species are adapted to different temperature regimes. © 2008 Jan Ohlberger.

VL  - 30

AB  - Outputs from multiple global circulation models (GCMs) predict that due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations the prairies may experience the greatest increases in temperature in southern Canada, resulting in widespread impacts and the need to develop appropriate adaptation responses by society. This study focuses on the potential effects of climate change and consequences for land use management in sand hills areas in the Canadian Prairies. Particular attention is given to these areas due to their sensitivity to climate change. In this study, the current climate and ecology in the sand hills areas are reviewed and potential future climates, as simulated by five GCMs, are investigated. Potential influences of climate change on vegetation zonation, grassland productivity, and dune activity are investigated using analogue approaches and analytical models. The study concludes with an assessment, by sector, of the potential adaptive responses that may be required in order to develop sustainable land management plans that consider the potential impacts of climate change on sand hills.

SP  - 861-877
AB  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of N and P fertilization on the yield and forage quality of six cold tolerant bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) selections from the Appalachian region. Midland bermudagrass and limpograss (Hermarthria altissima) were included for comparison purposes. Each grass was treated with a factorial combination of three N rates (112, 224, and 448 kg N•ha -1 ) and four P rates (0, 25, 75, and 225 kg P.ha S. Two bermudagrass selections from the Appalachian region demonstrated greater dry matter production than Midland bermudagrass. Yields of Quicksand common exceeded those of Midland by 60% to 236% over the range of treatments. High yielding selections were not inferior to low yielding selections when mineral concentrations, neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber and acid detergent lignin levels were considered. The results of this investigation suggest that Quicksand common and Selection 13 merit further study to determine their potential for summer forage production in the Appalachian region.

AB  - A phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) variant, of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.), expressed in adipose fin tissue, was incorporated into experimental batches through selective crossing of brood-stock having the PGI-3 (110) marker gene. PGI-3 (110) homozygous females were crossed with PGI-3 (100) homozygous males to yield all PGI-3 ( 110 100) progeny. These were subject to heat shock for 10 min at 28°C, commencing 10 min after insemination. Electrophoretic examination of fry indicated that diploids and triploids were separable on the basis of PGI-3 banding patterns, having staining ratios of 1:2:1 and 4:4:1, respectively. This confirmed the retention of an extra maternal PGI-3 (110) gene in triploid individuals. Potential applications of this marker in triploid studies in brown trout are discussed. © 1989.

VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 469-478
AB  - We investigated the diversity and thermal response of a fitness related trait, juvenile growth rate, in seasonal population samples of Daphnia magna from two temperate ponds. Both populations were intermittent, i.e. they disappeared from the water body and recolonized seasonally by hatching from resting eggs in the sediment. Temporally isolated clones of Daphniamagna showed the typical asymmetric response for growth rate with temperature and a sharp decline after the maximum response at 26degreesC (TMR). There was no evidence for genetically adapted seasonal groups. Despite significant genetic variation among clones and for phenotypic plasticity (GxE interactions without genetic correlations), seasonal groups of clones showed no shift in TMR and mean temperature reaction norms were similar among groups and both populations. Heritabilities remained similar among temperatures despite a large increase in genetic variance at stressfully high temperatures of 29degreesC and 32degreesC, due to simultaneous increase in environmental variance. Further, heritabilities remained high among sample periods and were not eroded during several months of asexual reproduction. Regular diapause, an intrinsic feature of intermittent Daphnia populations, may replace the need for physiological temperature adaptation and promote maintenance of diversity through phenotypic similarity by reducing the time over which competitive interactions occur. Such populations are unlikely to be directly affected by elevated temperatures. They have a large potential for phenotypic plasticity as their TMR is higher than the temperature normally encountered.

TI  - Artificial selection: A powerful tool for ecologists
VL  - 84
IS  - 7
SP  - 1650-1660
AB  - Artificial selection has been practiced by humans since the dawn of agriculture, but only recently have evolutionary ecologists turned to this tool to understand nature. To perform artificial selection, the phenotypic trait of interest is measured on a population, and the individuals with the most extreme phenotypic values are bred to produce the next generation. The change in the mean of the selected trait across each generation is the response to selection, and other traits can also evolve due to genetic correlations with the selected trait. Artificial selection can directly answer the question of how quickly a trait will evolve under a given strength of selection. This kind of result can help ecologists determine whether range or niche boundaries are determined by a lack of variation for a key phenotypic trait or trade-offs due to genetic correlations with other fitness-related traits. In a related approach, controlled natural selection, the organisms are not selected according to their values for a given trait, but rather are allowed to evolve for one to several generations under experimentally imposed environmental treatments such as temperature, light, nutrients, presence or absence of predators or competitors, etc. The results of this kind of study can tell us how quickly a population can adapt to a given environmental change, either natural or anthropogenic. Finally, artificial selection can create more variation for measurements of natural selection or can be coupled with QTL mapping; both these combinations provide new insights into adaptation. I discuss advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other kinds of studies and highlight case studies showing how these tools can answer a wide range of basic and applied questions in ecology, ranging from niche and range boundaries and character displacement to climate change and invasive species.

TI  - Shivering in the cold: From mechanisms of fuel selection to survival
VL  - 100
IS  - 5
SP  - 1702-1708
AB  - In cold-exposed adult humans, significant or lethal decreases in body temperature are delayed by reducing heat loss via peripheral vasoconstriction and by increasing rates of heat production via shivering thermogenesis. This brief review focuses on the mechanisms of fuel selection responsible for sustaining long-term shivering thermogenesis. It provides evidence to explain large discrepancies in fuel selection measurements among shivering studies, and it proposes links between choices in fuel selection mechanism and human survival in the cold. Over the last decades, a number of studies have quantified the contributions of carbohydrate (CHO) and lipid to total heat generation. However, the exact contributions of these fuels still remain unclear because of large differences in fuel selection measurements even at the same metabolic rate. Recent advances on the mechanisms of fuel selection during shivering provide some plausible explanations for these discrepancies between shivering studies. This new evidence indicates that muscles can sustain shivering over several hours using a variety of fuel mixtures achieved by modifying diet (changing the size of CHO reserves) or by changing muscle fiber recruitment (increasing or decreasing the recruitment of type II fibers). From a practical perspective, how does the choice of fuel selection mechanism affect human survival in the cold? Based on a glycogen-depletion model, estimates of shivering endurance show that, whereas the oxidation of widely different fuel mixtures does not improve survival time, the selective recruitment of fuel-specific muscle fibers provides a substantial advantage for cold survival. By combining fundamental research on fuel metabolism and applied strategies to improve shivering endurance, future research in this area promises to yield important new information on what limits human survival in the cold.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the shadow and food supplementation on the physiologic behavior and performance of Santa Inês lambs under rangeland conditions in the semi-arid region of Paraíba. Twenty-seven male lambs were used, with an average body weight of 21.5 kg and 120 days of age. They were randomly distributed in three environments [without shade (WS), natural shade (NS) and artificial shade (AS)] and fed growing three levels of concentrate supplement (0, 1.0 and 1.5% of live body weight). The analysis of variance revealed significant effect of period (morning x afternoon) on rectal temperature. However, no significant effect was observed for the environment and diet factors. Breathing frequency was higher in the afternoon than in the morning in the WS (35.28 and 61.64 mov/minute) and AS (30.28 and 51.76 mov/minute) environments. The diet influenced DM ingestion in SS environment. Skin temperature was higher in afternoon than in the morning, independent of the studied factors. The animals supplemented with concentrate mixtures had a performance better than the control ones. It was concluded that shading improved the indexes of thermal comfort and animal physiology and production parameters. Santa Inês breed showed high adaptability to the adverse conditions of the semi- arid region of Paraíba. The performance of Santa Inês lambs under a buffel enriched native rangeland, can be improved by supplementation with concentrate.

VL  - 142

SP  - 171-189
AB  - Secondary productivity was estimated for one sexual species of the brine shrimp Artemia (Artemia tunisiana) and for two inland and two coastal parthenogenetic diploid and polyploid strains (Artemia parthenogenectica), reared in semi-intensive cultures under different natural temperature conditions, Standing biomass and productivity were affected by temperature conditions, mode of reproduction, ploidy level and habitat temperature characteristics. At high temperatures (24-30 degrees C), diploid and polyploid parthenogenetic Artemia strains attained the highest biomass values and productivity of the coastal parthenogenetic diploid strain was 13 times higher than that of polyploids, Differences between the inland and coastal parthenogenetic diploid strains studied may be due to genetic adaptation to habitat temperature conditions, At low temperatures (under 15 degrees C) only the sexual species survived, and its production values were ten times lower than those of polyploid strains during spring and summer, Productivity was directly related to standing biomass and inversely related to individual biomass, On the basis of these results, an empirical model to predict Artemia productivity from biomass and individual dry weight data is proposed. This study provides useful information for the selection of the most suitable non Artemia franciscana strains to introduce in salterns from the Old World with a given temperature regime and it also supplies practical guidelines for the easy determination of Artemia productivity.

VL  - 64
IS  - 10
SP  - 4922-4929
AB  - Poliovirus type 1 neurovirulence is difficult to analyze because of the 56 mutations which differentiate the neurovirulent Mahoney strain from the attenuated Sabin strain. We have isolated four neurovirulent mutants which differ from the temperature-sensitive parental Sabin 1 strain by only a few mutations, using selection for temperature resistance: mutant S137C1 was isolated at 37.5°C, S138C5 was isolated at 38.5°C, and S139C6 and S139C10 were isolated at 39.5°C. All four mutants had a positive reproductive capacity at supraoptimal temperature (Rct+ phenotype). Mutant S137C1 induced paralysis in two of four cynomolgus monkeys, and the three other mutants induced paralysis in four of four monkeys. The lesion score increased from the S137C1 mutant to the S139 mutants. To map the mutations associated with thermoresistance and neurovirulence, we sequenced all regions in which the Sabin 1 genome differs from the Mahoney genome. The S139C1 mutant had one mutation in the 5' noncoding region and another in the 3' noncoding region. Mutant S138C5 had these mutations plus another mutation in the 3D polymerase gene. The S139 mutants had three additional mutations in the capsid protein region. The mutations were located at positions at which the Sabin 1 and Mahoney genomes differ, except for the mutation in the 5' noncoding region. The noncoding-region mutations apparently confer a low degree of neurovirulence. The 3D polymerase mutation, which distinguishes S138C5 and S139 mutants from S137C1, is probably responsible for the high neurovirulence of S138C5 and S139 mutants. The capsid region mutations may contribute to the neurovirulence of the S139 mutants, which was the highest among the mutants.

AB  - The general inorganic nature of traditional selection theory (based on differential growth between any two systems) is pointed out, wherefrom it follows that this theory cannot provide explanations for the characteristics of organic evolution. Specific biophysical aspects enter with the complexity of macro-molecules: vital physical conditions for the perpetuation of the system, irrevocable extinction (= death) and random change leading to novelty, are the result of 'complexity per se'. Further biophysical properties are a direct function of the pathway along which random mutation in nucleic acids is converted into continuous protein - (specifically enzyme) - function, from there into organismic phenotype with fitness components which may, or may not, correspond to identifiable structural units in DNA. The general machine-like properties of enzymes, in that there is no additive relationship between structural (amino acid) composition and functional output, is discussed in more detail. The continuous growth functions of molecular concentrations, directed by enzyme turnover, determine simple laws of growth and morphogenesis in the organic hierarchy and thus of phenotype. Thus, the combined effect of DNA-structure and of environmental parameters (temperature, pressure, pH, etc.) on protein function determines ultimately the actual phenotype and hence, quality and intensity of genotypic selection. © 1979 Leiden University Press.

AB  - The egg size of a landlocked goby, Rhinogobius sp. (the orange form), in the Lake Biwa water system was compared between the fluvial-lacustrine and lacustrine types. The former spawned larger eggs than the latter in the laboratory under the same environmental conditions of water temperature and current. This difference in egg size was also found in the field among six local populations from tributary rivers and lake shore. These results suggested that egg size is largely associated with the life history type that has experienced a different selection regimen, such as the risk of larval starvation, associated with their respective life cycles.

TI  - Classification of environmentally induced genetic male sterile lines of rice based on their fertility responses to photoperiod and temperature
VL  - 127

SP  - 161-167
AB  - The use of environmentally induced genetic male sterile (EGMS) rice could alter the development of hybrid rice from a three-line system to a two-line system. It is critical for the utilization of EGMS rice to determine which are the main environmental factors influencing fertility changes. Fertility responses to photoperiod (P) and temperature (T) were studied in 101 EGMS rice lines under nine controlled regimes combining three photoperiods (15.0, 14.0 and 12.5 h) x three temperatures (30.1, 24.1 and 23.1 degrees C). According to the variance analysis of seed-setting data, 96 % of the total EGMS lines studied could be divided into three types as follows: (1) photoperiod-sensitive genetic male sterility (PGMS) characterized statistically by significant (P < 0.05) P and P x T interaction effects but by a non-significant T effect on fertility, (2) thermosensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS) by a significant T effect, a non-significant P effect and by either a significant or a non-significant P x T interaction effect on fertility, and (3) photo-thermosensitive genetic male sterility (P-TGMS) by only a significant P x T interaction effect on fertility. Among the japonica EGMS lines studied, PGMS, TGMS and P-TGMS accounted for 32.3, 9.7 and 51.6%, respectively. However, among the indica EGMS lines, no PGMS lines were detected and most of them were TGMS or P-TGMS (61.4 and 35.7 %, respectively). The results indicate that the selection of indica PGMS lines of rice might be very difficult. The availability of different types of EGMS rice in two-line system hybrid rice is evaluated and the selection of an ideal model of response to photoperiod and temperature for indica EGMS is discussed.

VL  - 233
IS  - 1
SP  - 198-209
AB  - The effect of zirconia phase on the activity and selectivity of Cu/ZrO2, for the hydrogenation of CO was investigated. Relatively pure t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 were prepared with high Surface areas (similar to 145 m(2)/g). Copper was then deposited on the surface of these materials by either incipient-wetness impregnation or deposition-precipitation. For a fixed Cu surface area, Cu/m-ZrO2 was ten time, more active for methanol synthesis than Cu-ZrO2 from a feed of 3:1 H2/CO at 3.0 MPa and temperatures between 473 and 523 K. Cu/m-ZrO2 also exhibited it higher selectivity for methanol. Increasing the Cu surface area on m-ZrO2 resulted in further improvement in activity with minimal change in selectivity. Methanol productivity increased linearly for both Cu/t-ZrO2, and Cu/m-ZrO2, with increasing Cu surface area, The difference in inherent activity of each phase paralleled the stronger and larger CO adsorption capacity of the Cu/m-ZrO2 as quantified by CO-TPD. The higher CO adsorption capacity of Cu/m-ZrO2 is attributed to the presence of a high concentration of anionic vacancies on the surface of m-ZrO2. Such vacancies expose cus-Zr4+ cations, which act as Lewis acid centers and enhance the Bronsted acidity of adjacent Zr-OH groups. The presence of cus-Zr4+ sites and adjacent Bronsted acidic Zr-OH groups contributes to the adsorption of CO as IICOO-Zr groups, which are the initial precursors to methanol. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - 1. Environmental variation experienced in the parental and grandparental generation can affect progeny phenotype, performance and response to selection. Here the effects of parental and grandparental exposure to a non-lethal cold shock are considered in Drosophila serrata Malloch. Development time, viability and early age productivity were measured in flies originating from border and central locations in the distribution of this species that had been held under two separate laboratory maintenance schedules. 2. Cross-generation effects were detected for several traits. Development time usually decreased following maternal and/or grandmaternal cold exposure. Parental cold exposure negatively influenced viability while grandparental effects on viability were negligible. Early female productivity showed opposing responses depending on generation; maternal cold exposure increased progeny productivity while grandmaternal exposure decreased it. Male parental and grandparental exposure to cold shock decreased male productivity, although this pattern may have been partly confounded by size effects. 3. Population effects, reflecting geographical origin, were limited to development time, while selective background effects were demonstrated for most traits. The influence these factors had on the expression of cross-generation effects was negligible, given interactions with treatment were not evident. These responses suggest that environmental variation experienced in preceding generations can influence progeny phenotype in a manner that is complex and difficult to predict.

TI  - VIRUS PERSISTENCE IN GROUND WATER
VL  - 49

SP  - 778-781
AB  - Ground water has traditionally been considered safe for human consumption without treatment. However, it is an increasingly significant cause of human disease. Although ground water accounts for only approximately 20% of the nation's water supply, over 50% of the waterborne disease outbreaks in the United States are due to the consumption of contaminated ground water. It has been estimated that 65% of the cases of illness in these outbreaks are caused by enteric viruses. Little, however, is known about the persistence of viruses in ground water. The purpose of this study was to try to determine the chemical, physical, and biological factors influencing virus survival in ground water. This information will be helpful in developing criteria for determining safe distances between drinking water wells and sources of potential contamination such as septic tanks and waste application sites. Ground water samples were obtained from eleven sites throughout the United States. In addition, twenty samples were collected from the Tucson basin. The water temperature was measured at the time of collection. Several physical and chemical characteristics (including pH, nitrates, turbidity, and hardness) were determined for each sample. Separate polypropylene tubes containing 50 ml of water were inoculated with each of three viruses: poliovirus-1, echovirus-1 and MS-2 coliphage. Duplicate tubes containing water which had been filtered to remove the indigenous bacteria were also inoculated with viruses. The tubes were incubated at the in situ ground water temperature; selected samples were incubated at two additional temperatures. One-ml subsamples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals over a 30-day period and assayed to determine the number of microorganisms remaining. Multiple regression analysis revealed that temperature was the only water characteristic significantly correlated with the decay rates of all three viruses. Bacteria did not have a consistent effect on the decay rate of the viruses. In addition, no significant differences were found among the decay rates of the three viruses, suggesting that MS-2 coliphage may be able to be used as a model of animal virus behavior in the environment.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 152-154
AB  - Presented in this paper is a biosensor constructed for the determination of neurotransmitters. It is an eggplant-banana-tissue-based carbon paste microelectrode. As oxidative enzymes in banana tissue can bio-catalytically oxidize dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), L-dopa, etc., the biosensor's sensitivity is improved. Because of the ability of eggplant tissue to eliminate the oxidation of ascorbic acid (AA), the signal of AA is a steady-state response, and thereby the selectivity of the biosensor is enhanced. The effect of experimental conditions such as pH, temperature, ratio of two plant tissues, response time, and linear range were evaluated in order to optimize the analytical performance. The detection limit for DA is 3. 2 × 10-7 mol/L. Our results showed that the idea of multienzyme system is applicable to the plant tissue-based carbon paste microelectrodes. © 1996 Tongji Medical University.

TI  - Comparative analysis of oxygen consumption rates between cupped oyster spat of Crassostrea gigas of French, Japanese, Spanish and Taiwanese origins
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SP  - 271-277
AB  - Respiration rates of various geographical strains of Crassostrea gigas were compared to assess the respiratory expenditure as a physiological indicator of catabolism (cost of maintenance). Parental oysters, sampled in France (Marennes-Oleron), Japan (Hiroshima), Taiwan (Tunkang) and Spain (Cadix), were differentiated by both their geographic origin and by mitochondrial DNA markers, allowing the distinction between the two closely related taxa Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea angulata. After reproduction of these parental oysters, respiration rates of spat of each strain, reared under common controlled conditions, were individually estimated at 20 degrees C by using a volumetric microrespirometer. Our results demonstrated that physiological variability existed among the Crassostrea gigas strains and is likely to be related to physiological differences between geographical regions and/or genetic adaptations. The French strain showed the highest rates (0.71 mu L.h(-1)), while the Japanese, Taiwanese and the hybrid between Spanish and French strains consumed less, 0.53, 0.43 and 0.40 mu L.h(-1) respectively. Our results confirmed the discrepancies previously suggested between Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea angulata. Comprehensive physiological assessments should be carried out over a wide temperature range to confirm our results and to further evaluate growth potential. Appropriate decision making based on these studies will help future shellfish management in shellfish rearing areas such as the overstocked Marennes-Oleron Bay.

AB  - Chronic administration of glorgyline, a type-A monoamine oxidase inhibitor, leads to a decrease inperitoneal (i.e., core) temperature of golden hamsters. To better understand the mechanisms of clorgyline's thermoregulatory effects, autonomic and behavioral thermoregulatory effectors were measured in Syrian hamsters following chronic infusion of clorgyline via a minipump (2 mg/kg/day). Metabolic rate, evaporative water loss, motor activity, and core temperature were measured after 60 min of exposure to ambient temperatures (Ta) of 5, 20, 30, and 35°C. Behavioral thermoregulatory responses were assessed by measuring selected Ta and motor activity of the same animals in a temperature gradient over the course of 23 h. Metabolic rate and motor activity were significantly elevated in clorgyline-treated hamsters exposed to a Ta of 5°C. There were no effects of clorgyline on evaporative water loss. In the temperature gradient the mean selected Ta of clorgyline-treated hamsters was nearly equal to that of the saline-treated hamsters, 30.7 and 31.2°C, respectively. On the other hand, the mode of selected Ta in the clorgyline group was 2.8°C higher than that of the saline group. Motor activity in the gradient was significantly elevated and food consumption was depressed by clorgyline treatment. Overall, these findings indicated the chronic clorgyline treatment in the golden hamsters results in novel autonomic and behavioral modification; it stimulates metabolic thermogenesis during cold exposure, but appears to increase the behavioral zone of thermoneutrality. This latter effect may mean an improvement in heat tolerance, suggesting that this drug might assist in the adaptation to warm temperatures. © 1994.

VL  - 97

AB  - Seasonal variation of egg size and number was examined in a Daphnia pulex population inhabiting a vernal pond. In this population, size at maturity declines at midseason, probably as an adaptive response to size-selective predation by larvae of the salamander Ambystoma. The larger early season individuals produce more and larger eggs than the smaller late season individuals. Age at maturity does not vary between seasons. Laboratory experiments indicate that temperature may affect egg size, egg number and size at maturity. However, field data suggest that temperature accounts for only a small fraction of the total variation in egg size and number. Indirect measures of nutrition indicate that food limitation does not cause the seasonal decline in egg size and number. The seasonal change in reproductive traits is well correlated with changes in invertebrate and vertebrate predation. Examination of predator feeding preferences and their impact on Daphnia mortality indicate that variation of reproductive traits is most likely a complex adaptation to changing predation regimes. © 1982 Dr W.

This strategy is used to create a set of oligonucleotides of size s with length l that possess at least n base mismatches with the complements of all the other members in the set. These "DNA word" sets are denoted as nbml-mers or l:n sets. To regularize the thermodynamic stability of the perfectly matched hybridized DNA duplexes, the l-mers chosen for all the sets are required to have an approximately 50% G/C content. To achieve good discrimination between each DNA word in each set generated using the template-map strategy, it is required that n should be approximately equal to l/2 or higher. The template-map strategy can be used in a straightforward manner to create DNA word sets for cases when l = 4k and n = 2k, where k is an integer. Specific examples of 4k:2k sets are designed: an 8:4 set (s = 224), a 12:6 set (s = 528), a 16:8 set (s = 960), and a 20:10 set (s = 1520). These sets are further optimized to achieve the narrowest possible distribution of melting temperatures by selecting the best set after permutation of the templates and maps over all possible configurations. To demonstrate the viability of this methodology, a non-interacting set of four specific 6bm 12mers have been chosen, synthesized, and used in an SPR imaging measurement of the hybridization adsorption onto a DNA array, The template-map strategy is also applied to generate DNA word sets for cases where l not equal 4k. In these cases, the creation of the maps and templates is more complicated, but possible. The templates and maps for three additional types of sets are created: (4k - 1):(2k - 1), (4k + 1):2k, and (4k - 2):(2k - 1). Specific examples are given for l = 7, 9, and 10: DNA word sets of 7:3 (s = 224), 9:4 (s = 360), and 10:5 (s = 132).

VL  - 10

AB  - 1. There is increasing acceptance of the ideas that tests of adaptationist hypotheses should consider the importance of phenotypic plasticity for the traits involved, and explicitly incorporate the phylogeny of the organisms in question. 2. However, it is difficult to combine these two concepts. For many cases of major life-history shifts, transitional forms displaying intermediate character states no longer exist, and thus their reaction norms cannot be measured directly. None the less, indirect tests may be done by using extant taxa on either side of the relevant transition. 3. This paper provides an example of such a test on a reproductively bimodal lizard species (Lerista bougainvillii, Gray 1839) to infer phenotypic responses to incubation temperature in the putative intermediate form between oviparity and viviparity. 4. By virtue of this tight taxonomic focus and parallel experimental manipulations of extant taxa, predictions of alternative adaptationist hypotheses on the selective forces responsible for this evolutionary transition, from incubation in the nest to incubation in utero, are tested. 5. By examining the responses of offspring phenotypes to experimental manipulation of incubation conditions in the extant oviparous and viviparous forms, it was possible to 'reconstruct' those of the now extinct transitional form. 6. The data on phenotypically plastic responses obtained here suggest that the phylogenetic shift from oviparity to viviparity would have induced changes in hatching times, as well as in hatchling morphology and behaviour, in the transitional form.

AB  - Selection in egg-to-adult viability was investigated at the Esterase-6 locus of Drosophila melanogaster. A factorial experiment was carried out with three variables, temperature, density and genetical composition; there were four temperatures (15°, 20°, 25° and 30°), three densities (115 ml, 10 ml and 2.5 ml of food). Strong frequency dependent selection was observed in many environments. The strength of the selection was very much modified by an interaction between temperature and density. The results are discussed in relation to evidence for a chemical mechanism which mediates frequency dependent selection, by conditioning, in the larval environment. © 1977 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

TI  - The effects of reproductive mode and climate on reproductive success in the Australian lizard, Lerista bougainvillii
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 60-65
AB  - The most widely accepted hypothesis invokes cold climates as the selective force responsible for the evolution of viviparity in reptiles. The ''cold climate'' hypothesis proposes that viviparity is adaptive in cold climates because developing embryos experience warmer temperatures in utero (through maternal thermoregulation) than they would in a nest. Most authors have assumed that these warmer incubation temperatures provide an advantage by protecting embryos from lethally low temperatures or by allowing them to hatch before the onset of winter. Thus, the ''cold climate'' hypothesis (at least in its traditional form) purports that viviparity evolves in cold climates because females that retain their developing offspring in utero will have greater reproductive success than females that lay their eggs in a nest. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment using the reproductively bimodal Australian lizard, Lerista bougainvillii. Gravid oviparous and viviparous females were transplanted into field enclosures in both a ''hot'' and a ''cold'' climate, to monitor the effects of climate on their reproductive success. The live-bearers had higher reproductive success than the egg-layers in both climates, but reproductive success did not differ between the hot and cold climates within either reproductive mode. The viviparous lizards were more successful at producing offspring, regardless of climatic conditions. Thus, viviparity provided an advantage (in terms of embryo and/or neonate survival) under the conditions of the experiment, but this advantage was not restricted to cold environments.

VL  - 72

AB  - Polymer membranes have been explored for the analysis of ions that do not require plasticizers and with photo-curable properties, This work was focused on investigating the viability of the methacrylic-acrylic copolymers as new self-plasticizing membrane matrixes for ion-selective electrodes or other ion-sensor applications, Copolymers with glass transition temperatures ranging from -20 to -44 degrees C could be prepared without added plasticizer and were found to be functional as ion-selective membranes, Both free-radical solution polymerization and photopolymerization could be used, and "self-plasticizing" behavior of copolymers was observed with a high alkylacrylate (R = C-4) content. This was found to be compatible with most commercially available ionophores, and sensors for potassium, sodium, calcium and pH were fabricated entirely by photocure procedures; single-step procedures for the immobilization of benzo-15-crown-5 ionophore on these self-plasticizing copolymer matrixes were also developed. Even though the ionophore was immobilized, potentiometric studies revealed that the ionophore remained functional, and thus, these copolymers have the advantage of suffering neither leaching of ionophore nor plasticizers. All these sensors exhibited a Nernstian or near Nernstian response with selectivity comparable to plasticized PVG membranes or other plasticized and photocurable polymer membranes. The long-term response of the potassium sensor with immobilized ionophore and the sodium sensor showed little deterioration for as long as one month and three months, respectively, under continuous use.

AB  - A central assumption of baboon socio-ecological models is that all populations have the same capacity to react to different environments. The burden of our argument is that this assumption needs to be reconsidered. Data suggest not only that hamadryas, but chacma as well, differ in interesting ways from the stock baboon model that has been derived, in the main, from earlier work on anubis and cynocephalus. Although environmental factors are behind these differences, much of their influence is a consequence of their effect on restricted ancestral populations, where selection for appropriate responses to the social challenges set by local conditions now constrains the nature of individual responses to contemporary environments. Available genetic evidence suggests a southern African origin for Papio at a time when climatic conditions were certainly no better than they are now and when temperatures, if nothing else, were probably lower. In light of this, a reconstruction of how climate has structured the sexual conflict between males and female charcma, which itself hinges on infanticide, can help explain not only the East African pattern, but also how the apparently anomalous hamadryas pattern has been derived.

VL  - 217
SP  - 121-134
AB  - Larval and age-0 sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria reside in neustonic waters of the North Pacific during spring and summer. We estimated the potential impacts of elevated surface temperatures on ecological processes of growth, conversion efficiency, and behavior in early juvenile sablefish. Growth experiments tested a wide range of temperatures from 6 to 24(degrees)C, with fish receiving ad libitum or low (3 % body weight d(-1)) rations. With unlimited food, growth increased rapidly as temperature increased to 14(degrees)C, then displayed a more gradual rise to 22 degreesC. Growth rates at the warmer temperatures were among the highest recorded for teleosts, attaining a maximum of 3.3 nun d(-1) in length and a specific growth in weight of 11.8 %. A similar response to temperature was observed at low rations, although at lower overall growth rates. At 24 degreesC, there was a severe decline in growth for both ration levels, and few fish survived the 3 wk experiments. Gross growth efficiency, measured at temperatures of 6 to 22 degreesC, displayed an interactive effect of temperature with ration level consistent with bioenergetic relationship, Conversion peaked at 16 to 20 degreesC for fish receiving ad libitum rations, and at 10 degreesC for fish on restricted rations. Conversion rates of sablefish were comparable to those calculated for a diverse array of fish species, suggesting that the rapid growth rates are driven by high consumption rather than unusually efficient energy transfer. Experiments analyzing sablefish behavior in thermally stratified water columns demonstrated increasing movement into colder water as ration level decreased, in agreement with an energy conserving strategy. Average monthly temperatures within the major nursery areas of neustonic juveniles (north of 40 degreesN) did not exceed 19 degreesC during the last 19 yr. These results suggest that juvenile sablefish are capable of tolerating and thriving at increased temperatures, with the critical caveat that sufficient food resources must be available. Thus, impacts on early life stages exerted by El Nino conditions, oceanographic regime shifts, or climate changes induced by current global warming scenarios are likely to be a consequence of indirect effects on circulation and productivity patterns rather than direct effects of warmer temperatures. However, because the upper thermal limit for growth nearly coincides with the upper limit for survival, exhibiting a sharp demarcation between favorable growth conditions and intolerable temperatures, juvenile sablefish at the southern Limit of their distribution may suffer the direct effects of elevated temperature; recruitment of juveniles to southern populations may become more sporadic if the frequency of warming events increases with climate change.

AB  - The pathogenicity of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) was examined by infection trials in the first known host species, the mandarinfish, Siniperca chuatsi, and in 20 other teleosts cultured in China. Mandarinfish and large-mouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, were highly susceptible to infection after intraperitoneal infection of ISKNV in spleen and kidney materials from infected fish. ISKNV did not induce mortality in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), but histopathological studies revealed that they might be infected by both bathing and intraperitoneal infection. No deaths, clinical or histopathological signs were found in the IS other species exposed by immersion or injection. Experimental infection studies showed that ISKNV infection in mandarinfish could be transmitted from infected to healthy fish through contaminated water. ISKN only occurred in mandarinfish cultured at temperature above 20degreesC. The resistance of the virus to treatment with disinfectants, high and low pH and UV irradiation, as well as storage at selected temperatures was assessed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Solar radiation is a major source of heat for open-cup passerine nestlings, and a key variable influencing parental nest site selection. Although temperature, like food, is critical for nestling growth and survival, the use of thermal and insolation gradients when describing passerine nestling orientation and movement within the open-cup nest has not been explored. Our study used the Common Grackle (Quiscalus quiscula) as a model system to directly test the hypothesis that passerine nestlings mitigate thermal extremes behaviourally. Pairs of nestlings were tested in shaded (homogeneous) and exposed (heterogeneous) nests. movements within nests were tracked and nest temperatures recorded. Our results show that nestlings are able to detect and respond to nanoclimate heterogeneity, and can mitigate short-term radiant heat loads through shade-seeking. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Glacier National Park served as a test site for ecosystem analyses than involved a suite of integrated models embedded within a geographic information system. The goal of the exercise was to provide managers with maps that could illustrate probable shifts in vegetation, net primary production (NPP), and hydrologic responses associated with two selected climatic scenarios. The climatic scenarios were (a) a recent 12-yr record of weather data, and (b) a reconstituted set that sequentially introduced in repeated 3-yr intervals wetter-cooler, drier-warmer, and typical conditions. To extrapolate the implications of changes in ecosystem processes and resulting growth and distribution of vegetation and snowpack, the model incorporated geographic data. With underlying digital elevation maps, soil depth and texture, extrapolated climate, and current information on vegetation types and satellite-derived estimates of a leaf area indices, simulations were extended to envision how the park might look after 120 yr. The predictions of change included underlying processes affecting the availability of water and nitrogen. Considerable field data were acquired to compare with model predictions under current climatic conditions. In general, the integrated landscape models of ecosystem processes had good agreement with measured NPP, snowpack, and streamflow, but the exercise revealed the difficulty and necessity of averaging point measurements across landscapes to achieve comparable results with modeled values. Under the extremely variable climate scenario significant changes in vegetation composition and growth as well as hydrologic responses were predicted across the park. In particular, a general rise in both the upper and lower limits of treeline was predicted. These shifts would probably occur along with a variety of disturbances (fire, insect, and disease outbreaks) as predictions of physiological stress (water, nutrients, light) altered competitive relations and hydrologic responses. The use of integrated landscape models applied in this exercise should provide managers with insights into the underlying processes important in maintaining community structure, and at the same time, locate where changes on the landscape are most likely to occur.

TI  - Inducing the sexual forms and hatching the eggs of pea aphids
VL  - 65
IS  - 2
SP  - 119-127
AB  - In temperate climates, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) produce a single sexual generation each year in response to declining photoperiod and temperature. Mating occurs in the fall and the eggs have an obligatory winter diapause. Genetic recombination during the sexual phase is thought to be an important source of genetic variability within cyclically parthenogenetic aphid populations. Methods for reliably producing sexual forms and hatching the eggs of aphids are therefore central not only to the study of evolutionary change in aphid populations, but also for a general understanding of the origin of agriculturally important variation in destructiveness within pest species. Here, sexual forms of six pea aphid clones were induced in the laboratory and eggs were successfully hatched by creating conditions that closely mimicked those found in field situations. A declining photoperiod was produced by controlling artificial lighting using a timer with variable cycle length. Using these conditions, sexual forms were successfully produced for all six clones tested, which were then mated in all combinations. Eggs were exposed to a daily cycle of freezing and thawing in an incubator under a short‐day photoperiod. Egg hatch averaged 60%, but was as high as 89% for some crosses. These methods will permit testing of evolutionary hypotheses and execution of detailed genetic studies of sources of variability within pea aphid populations. They are thus important tools for both evolutionary and agricultural studies. 1992 The Netherlands Entomological Society

SP  - 245-254
AB  - Life history variations among 27 populations of the grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus from around the British Isles were examined under laboratory conditions over three generations. Multiple-regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between grasshopper life histories and the climates of their ancestral sites. Grasshoppers from cooler sites were heavier at hatching. Grasshoppers from northern sites grew faster and developed through fewer instars, attaining adulthood earlier, at the expense of adult size. Depending on the measure of adult size used, adults were larger in warmer, sunnier or more southerly locations. Ecotypic differentiation is probably widespread among animals as it is among plants, though it is more rarely demonstrated by zoological studies, especially over the wide geographical scale covered here. Evidence from regression analysis supports the hypothesis that ecotypic differentiation in C. brunneus is an evolutionary response to climatic variation. The existence of intraspecific genetic diversity for climatic adaptations has implications for biodiversity conservation and the understanding of biotic responses to climatic change. It deserves wider recognition.

AB  - Genotype frequencies at the alcohol dehydrogenase-1 (Adh-1) locus of D. buzzatii were analysed for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibria in the progeny of laboratory populations established at five initial Adh-lb allele frequencies and kept at either 18°C, 25°C or 30°C. At 25°C, no observed genotype frequencies were significantly different from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Observed frequencies of heterozygotes were generally less than expected for populations at 18°C and 30°C. Fitness differences among genotypes were greater in males than in females, with Adh-lb homozygotes having highest fitness at 18°C and Adh-1c homozygotes having highest fitness at 30°C. The results are discussed in relation to previous field and laboratory studies on D. buzzatii and to the Adh polymorphism of D. melanogaster. © 1986 The Genetical Society of Great Britain.

VL  - 8

SP  - 215-225
AB  - If climate limits the geographical distribution of a species, local variation in microclimate may affect the species' local distribution at the edge of its range. We hypothesized that warm urban microclimates may explain the distribution of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) in central Massachusetts. We recorded winter temperatures with data-logging sensors in urban, coniferous, deciduous, and open habitats in the human-dominated landscape of the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. Overall, temperatures decreased with elevation. Daily maximum temperatures, a variable used in models of opossum biophysical constraints, were lowest at forested sites, intermediate at urban sites, and highest at open sites; however these were a poor indicator of evening temperatures, which are important to the nocturnal opossum. Open sites had the highest daily temperature fluctuations, and were the coldest at night. Urban and coniferous sites had the least pronounced daily fluctuations in temperature, and urban sites had the warmest nights. Habitat-specific winter temperatures in the Connecticut River Valley indicated that urban sites were most conducive to opossum persistence, but even they were unlikely to sustain populations. Other factors likely help mitigate the influence of harsh climatic conditions on persistence of opossum populations in western Massachusetts. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Mortality responses of 2 species of fruit fly, Bactrocera melanotus (Coquillett) and B. xanthodes (Broun), to heat treatments were investigated using hot water immersion. The eggs (young or mature), 1st, 2nd, and 3 ages (early-, mid-, and late-aged) of 3rd instars were immersed in hot water at selected temperatures in the range 43-48 degrees C. B. melanotus mature eggs were more heat-tolerant than all other life stages of either fruit fly species except B. xanthodes early-aged 3rd instars at 48 degrees C, where the difference was not significant. At temperatures less than or equal to 45 degrees C, 1st instars of both fruit fly species were more heat tolerant than 3rd instars (all ages), whereas at 48 degrees C the estimated times for 99% mortality for 1st and 3rd instars were similar. B. xanthodes young eggs were significantly less tolerant to heat than all other life stages of the same species, whereas for B. melanotus young eggs were less tolerant to heat than late-aged 3rd instars, 1st instars, or mature eggs. B. melanotus eggs were more heat tolerant than B. xanthodes eggs, whereas the reverse was true for larval stages.

AB  - A procedure for testing membranes regarding specific productivity and selectivity with respect to 0.1 N KCl for membrane distillation is suggested. A number of commercially produced microfiltration hydrophobic membranes have been tested on a laboratory unit for membrane distillation with gas clearance. The dependence of the specific productivity and selectivity on the temperature difference was examined. The selectivity coefficient of the membranes tested practically does not depend on the temperature (in the range studied) and is rather high (0.998).

TI  - Treatment of Xenopus laevis coelomic eggs with trypsin mimics pars recta oviductal transit by selectively hydrolyzing envelope glycoprotein gp43, increasing sperm binding to the envelope, and rendering eggs fertilizable
VL  - 281
IS  - 2
SP  - 132-138
AB  - Xenopus laevis coelomic (body cavity) eggs are not fertilizable until they pass through the pars recta oviduct. A secreted pars recta oviductal protease with trypsin-like activity, oviductin, selectively hydrolyzes egg envelope glycoprotein gp43 to gp41; this limited proteolysis is believed to render the egg fertilizable. The effects of trypsin as a substitute for oviductin in modifying envelope structure and function were examined. Trypsinolysis (5 mIU for 30 min at room temperature) selectively converted gp43 to gp41 without hydrolysis of other envelope glycoproteins, and rendered coelomic eggs fertilizable in the presence of a jelly water preparation. Chymotrypsin had no effect on the acquisition of fertilizability, indicating that the reaction was dependent on trypsin-like specificity. This was confirmed by the use of p-aminobenzamindine and leupeptin to inhibit the ability of trypsin preparations to induce fertilizability. A sperm binding assay revealed that trypsin treatment dramatically increased sperm binding to egg envelopes derived from both coelomic eggs and ovarian eggs. Jelly water was not required for sperm binding. Therefore, trypsin can mimic the biological action of oviductin, selectively cleaving egg envelope gp43 to generate or expose sperm binding sites, rendering the envelope penetrable by sperm and permitting fertilization.

VL  - 5695
SP  - 340-347
AB  - In selective retina treatment (SRT) spatial confined tissue damage in the absorbing retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is obtained by applying microsecond laser pulses. The damage in the RPE is caused by transient microbubbles forming around laser heated melanin granules inside the cells. For treatment of RPE related diseases, SRT is thought to share the therapeutic benefits of conventional photocoagulation but without affecting the photoreceptors. A drawback for effective clinical SRT is that the laser-induced lesions are ophthalmoscopically invisible. Therefore, a real-time feedback system for dosimetry is demanded in order to avoid undertreatment or unwanted collateral damage to the adjacent tissue, which is observed at about twofold threshold radiant exposure for RPE damage. We demonstrate that interferometry is capable of detecting microbubbles at threshold irradiation for RPE damage. A porcine ex-vivo RPE model, which was irradiated by a Nd:YLF laser (350ns/1700ns@527nm), was employed. The irradiated area was simultaneously probed by a Michelson interferometer. Cell viability assays were performed after irradiation. Cell damage was compared to the interferometric data. At threshold for cell damage a change in the interferometric transients was observed due to microbubble formation. Thus, interferometry could serve as a non-contact real-time dosimetry control during selective targeting of the RPE in vivo. From the time resolved motion of the bubble interface, which is determined by interferometry, the maximum bubble size is obtained. This gives an estimation for the damage range in the tissue. Knowledge of the damage range as a function of the irradiation parameters is helpful in optimizing SRT.

TI  - Cold-adapted rhizobia for nitrogen fixation in temperate regions
VL  - 81
IS  - 12
SP  - 1153-1161
AB  - Rhizobia from Canadian soils were selected for cold adaptation with the aim of improving productivity of legumes that are subjected to cool temperatures during the growing season. One approach was to use rhizobia associated with legume species indigenous to arctic and subarctic regions: (i) Mesorhizobium sp. isolated from Astragalus and Oxytropis spp. and (H) Rhizobium leguminosarum from Lathryrus spp. The majority of these rhizobia are considered psychrotrophs because they can grow at 0 degreesC. The advantages of cold adaptation of arctic Mesorhizobium to improve legume symbiosis were demonstrated with the temperate forage legume sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia). In laboratory and field studies, arctic rhizobia were more efficient than temperate (commercial) rhizobia in improving growth of sainfoin and were more competitive in forming nodules. Biochemical studies on cold adaptation showed higher synthesis of cold shock proteins in cold-adapted than in nonadapted arctic rhizobia. Since arctic Mesorhizobium cannot nodulate agronomically important legumes, the nodulation genes and the bacterial signals (Nod factors) were characterized as a first step to modifying the host specificity of nodulation. Another valuable approach was to screen for cold adaptation, that is, rhizobia naturally associated with agronomic legumes cultivated in temperate areas. A superior strain of Sinorhizobium meliloti adapted for nodulation of alfalfa at low temperatures was selected and was the most efficient for improving growth of alfalfa in laboratory and field studies. This strain also performed well in improving regrowth of alfalfa after overwintering under cold and anaerobic (ice encasement) stresses, indicating a possible cross-adaptation of selected rhizobia for various abiotic stresses inherent to temperate climates.

AB  - Development and survival of reptilian embryos are affected by the temperature and moisture within the nest. Moreover, thermal and hydric conditions during incubation also affect phenotypes of hatchlings. Thus, females should select nest sites that enhance hatching success and produce hatchlings with phenotypes fit for the local environment. The objective of this study was to determine the substrate temperature and moisture conditions selected by eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) for nesting. In the laboratory, gravid females were housed in a large enclosure that provided suitable nesting substrate. Gradients of temperature and moisture within the substrate were established to provide a wide range of conditions from which females could choose. Fifteen (65%) females selected nest conditions within the moisture and temperature range that results in successful embryonic development. Two females (9%) nested in extremely dry conditions, and six females (26%) oviposited on the substrate surface. Females that nested in the field selected nest sites with similar conditions as females that nested in the laboratory. In general, we provide support for the idea that females choose nest sites with thermal and hydric conditions that are associated with positive hatching success.

TI  - Temperature and site selection by Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) during hibernation near the species' northern range limit
VL  - 87
IS  - 9
SP  - 825-834
AB  - Many animals that live in northern climates enter a state of prolonged dormancy during winter. These animals possess a suite of physiological and behavioural adaptations that minimize threats to survival while overwintering. There are three major threats to overwintering survival: metabolic and respiratory acidosis, freezing, and predation. Selection of hibernation sites should minimize these threats. We monitored dissolved oxygen, water depth, and temperature at overwintering locations of Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii (Holbrook, 1838)) and at stations located haphazardly in six different habitat types over two winters in Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Water depth and dissolved oxygen in overwintering sites used by turtles were similar to those measured at haphazard stations. In contrast, estimated turtle body temperatures (similar to 0 degrees C) were significantly lower and less variable than water temperatures measured at haphazard stations. These data and those reported elsewhere suggest that there are two alternatives for selection of suitable hibernacula by anoxia tolerant turtles. In areas where there is periodic access to aerial oxygen, turtles select sites where ice cover may not be present for the entire winter, but in areas where ice cover restricts access to air, turtles select sites where water temperatures are close to 0 degrees C.

TI  - Simulated sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide at a deep-sea site: Effects on nematode abundance and biovolume
VL  - 53
IS  - 7
SP  - 1135-1147
AB  - One proposal for ameliorating global warming is to sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean, but the environmental consequences of sequestration for sediment-dwelling animals are poorly known. In a previous publication, we reported that similar to 80% of benthic copepods were killed in an experimental release of CO2 off northern California at 3262 m. The effects of this release on nematodes are reported here. We examined samples of nematodes taken inside two 'corrals' into which CO2 was directly injected (providing an extreme endpoint for CO2 exposure) and taken near to and far from this CO2 source. After 30 days, pore-water pH was unchanged (similar to 7.8) at the sediment-water interface far (similar to 40 m) from corrals, but pH profiles were reduced by similar to 0.75 near (similar to 2m) corrals. Corral pH was highly acidic (5.4 in a measurement from a subsequent experiment). Fifty randomly selected nematodes from each of four vertical layers from the 14 cores were photographed. They were assigned to a tail group (based on morphology), and individual biovolume was estimated from measurements of body length and width. Although nematode abundance (expressed as total nematodes and by tail group) was not affected, length, width, and individual biovolume significantly differed between near and far samples. Median nematode biovolume examined across tail group and core layer increased by similar to 48% inside and near corrals. Differences between near and corral samples were always less than differences between near and far samples. However, nematode length:width ratio did not differ between near and far, and the shapes of length, width, and biovolume frequency distributions were similar in all samples. We postulate that the nematode community throughout the upper 3 cm suffered a high rate of mortality after exposure to CO2, and that nematodes were larger because postmortem expansions in body length and width occurred. Decomposition rates were probably low and corpses did not disintegrate in 30 days. The observable effects of a reduction in pH to about 7.0 after 30 days were as great as an extreme pH reduction (5.4), suggesting that 'moderate' CO2 exposure, compared to the range of exposures possible following CO2 release, causes high mortality rates in the two most abundant sediment-dwelling metazoans (nematodes and copepods).

VL  - 14
IS  - 6
SP  - 718-730
AB  - 1. 'Alba' is a genetic polymorphism in butterflies of the genus Colias (the sulphurs) which confers on its female carriers white (A-) rather than yellow (aa) wings. Previous studies of 'alba's' resource-based effects in Colias alexandra and Colias scudderi suggested the rare morph should be eliminated in each species. Here the selective regime acting on 'alba's' wing colour effect is examined to determine if it can maintain polymorphism. 2. Field experiments and observations reveal species-specific differences in morph fecundity resulting from selection on wing colour. 'Alba' female and male Colias lose flight time, an index of Colias fitness, to unproductive courtship with pierines (white butterflies in the subtamily Pieridae), a form of interference competition. Flight time losses are greater in (7. alexandra, which co-occur more extensively with pierines than C. scudderi. 'Alba' females also spent less time being harassed by courting male Colias than yellow females; this form of sexual selection on morph wing colour is particularly strong in C. alexandra. 3. Loss of male and 'alba' female Colias flight time and the degree of male Colias preference for the yellow morph correlate with the extent each Colias species co-occurs with pierines, suggesting interference competition influences Colias courtship decisions and 'alba' frequency. 4. Both interference competition and sexual selection are density dependent in their effects; these effects were modelled Using Holling's equation. Modelling results show temporal variation in Colias and pierine densities over the past 20 years caused morph fitness to Vary such that in at least one year each morph in each species had greater relative fitness with respect to colour-based selective pressures. Although this selective regime does not maintain polymorphism under temporal models of fitness variation, trade-offs between these colour-based effects and 'alba's' temperature and resource-based effects in a spatially heterogeneous environment could maintain polymorphism.

AB  - Heat shock/stress proteins (HSPs) are crucial for maintenance of cellular homeostasis during normal cell growth and for survival during and after various cellular stresses. The HSP70 family functions as molecular chaperones and reduces stress-induced denaturation and aggregation of intracellular proteins. In addition to the chaperoning activities, HSP70 has been suggested to exert its protective action by protecting mitochondria and by interfering with the stress-induced apoptotic program. The biochemical and functional properties of HSPs observed in cultured cells may be relevant to organs and tissues in whole animals. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nerve system elicits the stress response in selected peripheral tissues; the HSP70 expression in the vasculature and stomach increases resistance against hemodynamic stress and stress-induced mucosal damage, respectively. Gastric mucosa pretreated with mild irritants acquires a tolerance against subsequent mucosal-damaging insults. This phenomenon is known as "adaptive cytoprotection". Transient ischemia also induces ischemic tolerance in the brain and heart, which is called "ischemic preconditioning". The heat shock response is believed to contribute to the acquisition of the tolerance. The therapeutic applications of chaperone inducers that induce HSPs without any toxic effect are also introduced.

AB  - The biological and physico-chemical properties of cultures of two isogenous recombinant variants of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were studied. The cell genomes of the cultures are distinguished from one another only by the presence or by the absence of the fra-operon, which is a determined attribute of the plague microbe capsule-forming process. The expression of the attribute is amplified by rising the microbial biomass cultivation temperature and stimulates the decrease in the viability of the bacteria and adaptation potential in vitro. In the warm-blooded owner organism the microbes of the capsule-forming recombinant variant are characterized by the greater residual pathogenicity and immunogenic ability to the experimental plague of the laboratory animals as compared to the reference-variant cells. These specific features could be explained by more expressed colonizing ability of the capsule-forming microbes provided by owner cells' stability to the phagocyte process.

AB  - The distribution of the brown rnorph of the landsnail Cepaea nemoralis in part of the Brendon Hills, Somerset is described. The morph is at a high frequency on north‐facing slopes, valley bottoms, and in a broad partly‐enclosed basin. It is argued that low temperature is the selective agent. Alternative explanations are considered. In two population cages adult brown‐shelled snails survived less well than pink five‐banded ones during the summer months, this trend being reversed in the autumn. It is concluded that the experimental results support the ‘climatic’ interpretation of distributional data. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - The development of Plodia interpunctella, Ephestia cautella, E. kuehniella and E. elutella was followed carefully at selected temperatures. Infertility prevented successful breeding of the latter two species at 30°C. The first two species bred successfully at 30°C, failed to complete development at 15°C, and, at 20-30°C, completed development more quickly than the other two. All species took longer to develop and survived less well at 25% r.h. than at 70% r.h., and their pupal stages lasted about twice as long as the egg stages at temperatures allowing development of both. At 25°C, the pupal stage lasted about 9 days in P. interpunctella and E. cautella, 11-12 days in E. kuehniella and about 13 days in E. elutella. In all species other than E. elutella, eggs held at 25°C became more tolerant of cold when aged over 1 day. Younger eggs of P. interpunctella were less tolerant of cold than any eggs of the other species, and were killed outright by holding for 19 days at 15°C. Stocks of all four species recently collected from the field generally tolerated low r.h. and low temperature a little better than laboratory stocks, but at higher temperatures developed from egg to adult a little more slowly. © 1975.

AB  - Paraffin deposition problems in oil production, transportation, and storage were presented. An experimental methodology was designed for deposits characterization and paraffin deposition control, oriented toward the identification of "tailor made" preventive or remedial treatments, and adequate for the particular crude oil composition and physicochemical properties. This technique has direct application to paraffinic crude oils productivity enhancement in terms of costs reduction, and oil production improvement. Seven paraffinic crude oils from Venezuelan reservoir and 11 commercial paraffin inhibitors were used. Crudes with low concentration of heavy paraffins and bimodal/wide molecular weight distributions afforded important pour point depression by the action of paraffin inhibitors. Specific paraffin inhibitors efficiency was strongly related to the crude oil composition. When wax deposits are already formed in the production or transportation tubing, dissolution treatments using aromatic solvents at high temperature could be selected for remotion (cleaning procedures).

AB  - Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) is an animal multifunctional DNA/RNA-binding protein that is involved in reproduction, storing, and expression of genetic information. YB-1 accompanies mRNA throughout its life, from synthesis to degradation, and has a high specific and nonspecific affinity for RNA. In the nucleus YB-1 regulates mRNA processing. In the cytoplasm YB-1 is responsible for global and selective regulation of protein synthesis, as well as the mRNA life. This review focuses on the role of YB-1 in regulating translation. The possible mechanisms of the positive and negative effects of YB-1 on this process are considered. The recent original data are described, supporting the role of YB-1 as a major structural component of mRNP. Data about specific interactions of YB-1 with RNA are summarized for the first time. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2006.

AB  - Variation in apples has been investigated at the Massachusetts agricultural experiment station, the entire crops borne by certain Baldwin and Ben Davis trees being measured for six successive years. As expected, a great difference was found in the productivity of different trees, and a slight difference in the amount of variability. It is possible that the larger the apples a tree bears, the more variable they are. The apples from the upper south parts of the trees, which were largest, were also the most flattened, and there is found to be a pretty constant relationship between the form of the apple and the temperature for a period of several weeks following the bloom; the cooler this period, the more elongated the apple. The station now has Mendelian experiments under way with peas, beans and squashes, and has made much progress in breeding rust-proof asparagus, in cooperation with the federal department of agriculture. The garden pea study has shown that the ordinary commercial varieties are composed of many different strains or pure lines; work is now being carried on to determine whether selection within the pure line can increase or decrease vine length, and to determine the degree of correlation between weight of seed and length of vine. The study of the squash has also shown the common varieties to be of heterogeneous composition and the particular point now under investigation is to determine whether homozygous races may be isolated. The study of the inheritance of pigmentation and other characters in garden beans during the last six years has embraced more than 100 crosses of sixteen varieties, and included more than 50,000 plants, all of which have been carefully studied and tabulated. © 1915 Oxford University Press.

AB  - To discover whether the beneficial effects observed when Drosophila C virus (DCVC) infects Drosophila larvae should be considered as a specific case or, as a general rule, the DCVC‐Drosophila association was studied in different environments (3 host‐populations, 2 temperatures, 2 viral dose). We measured pre‐adult mortality, developmental time and number of ovarioles per fly. In all experiments, and, in all contaminated populations, DCVC could be considered, either a parasite since it increased pre‐adult mortality, or a symbiont since it decreased developmental time and increased mean number of ovarioles. The viral dose necessary for the appearance of beneficial effects varied with population, temperature and life‐cycle parameters. A sufficient number of viral particles appears necessary at a specific point in the host life‐cycle for a beneficial DCVC effect on the host. DCVC does not affect the variance of any of these parameters. The observed changes in DCVC‐contaminated populations were thus not a response to the selection pressure of DCVC. Two arguments support the association as an example of the “cohabitation‐without‐struggle model” and will be discussed. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

VL  - 70

AB  - We used more than 326 000 observations of temperature collected by radio telemetry from 38 individuals over three years to investigate thermoregulation and thermal relations of northern water snakes (Nerodia sipedon) near the northern limit of their distribution in Ontario, Canada. We tested hypotheses concerning the effects of feeding, season, sex, and reproductive condition on thermoregulation of individuals. The mean preferred body temperature (PBT) for captive snakes from the study population was 27.1 degrees C, similar to that reported for other populations, and PET range (defined as the 25th-75th percentiles of selected temperatures) was 25-30 degrees C. When environmental conditions allowed, the mean and range of body temperature (T-b) of free-living snakes were nearly identical to those observed in captivity. The typical daily pattern in snake T-b was an increase in late morning to a plateau temperature in the preferred range, followed by a decrease in the evening with a nightime plateau at approximately the temperature of the water. We calculated indices of thermoregulation to relate T-b data to available ambient temperatures. Despite the northern latitude of the study population, ambient conditions were favorable over much of the activity season and offered the potential for the snakes to maintain T-b within the PET range almost 24 h per day for much of the season. However, the thermoregulation indices indicated that N. sipedon are only moderate thermoregulators, and often do not exploit opportunities to achieve PET, particularly during the day. Variation in annual ambient temperatures affected growth rates of the snakes, and was sufficient to affect the age of maturity of females. Feeding did not elicit a thermophilic response under laboratory conditions or when snakes were fed experimentally in the field, suggesting that the benefits of increasing T-b after eating did not outweigh the costs. Reproductive females thermoregulated more carefully than nonreproductive females during the July-August gestation period. Pregnant females may increase thermoregulatory behavior to enhance the rate and efficiency of embryogenesis. Males thermoregulated less than both reproductive and nonreproductive females, particularly later in the activity season when thermoregulation by females increased. We hypothesized that males pursue a survival strategy following the spring mating season and thus remain cool and secretive during the later part of the activity season. This strategy by males clearly contributes to their slowed growth and smaller size relative to females.

TI  - A multi-environment comparison of senescence between sister species of Daphnia
VL  - 135
IS  - 4
SP  - 555-563
AB  - Senescence is a general decline of physiological state that accompanies advancing age. It affects nearly all organisms, but patterns of senescence vary markedly, even among closely related taxa. Understanding the evolution of this diversity requires information about environmental effects on the expression of variation among taxa. I examined genetically-based variation of senescence within and between two species complexes of Daphnia in four environments. The environments were defined by large differences in food and temperature, two factors known to influence senescence. The species studied were chosen to represent sister species that likely experience divergent (D. pulex and D. pulicaria) or similar (D. mendotate and D. dentifera) selection pressures on senescence. Overall, D. pulex expressed the greatest demographic senescence, D. mendotae and D. dentifera were intermediate, and D. pulicaria expressed the least. In environments representative of typical natural conditions, D. pulex had greater senescence than D. pulicaria, regardless of how late-life performance was assessed. This shows that genetic-environment interactions do not confound the interpretation of senescence differences between these species as the result of selective differences between their habitats. Comparison of D. mendotae and D. dentifera primarily revealed similar life histories, although differences in reproductive declines occurred in some environments. The joint observation of similar mortality patterns but dissimilar fecundity declines suggests that the trade-off between survival and reproduction changes with age. This calls into question the utility of only studying mortality for understanding evolutionary change of senescence in nature.

AB  - The response of selected rotifers and cladocerans to Microcystis aeruginosa, offered as colonies and single cells, was compared to that on a diet of Chlorella vulgaris using the life table demography approach. The test zooplankton species were Simocephalus vetulus, Daphnia carinata, Moina macrocopa, Scapholeberis kingi, Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Brachionus calyciflorus and Hexarthra mira. To detect the development of resistance to toxins from Microcystis in zooplankton, in addition to the laboratory cultured strain of Ceriodaphnia cornuta, another strain of the same species was also used (designated as C. cornuta 2, this was collected from a pond containing Microcystis and cultured in the laboratory on Chlorella for a few weeks prior to experimentation). Experiments were conducted at 20 °C and 30 °C. Survivorship was high on Chlorella in most species but low on diets of Microcystis. Except for C. cornuta 2, S. kingi and S. vetulus, all other test species were adversely affected by Microcystis. The ability to utilise Microcystis improved at 30 °C in M. macrocopa, D. carinata and H. mira. The longest mean lifespan was recorded for C. cornuta 2 (25.3 ± 4.86 d) and the lowest for B. calyciflorus (0.58 ± 0.05 d). The highest net reproductive rate was observed for C. cornuta I (44.9 ± 4.88) and the longest generation time of 26.6 ± 2.13 d for S. vetulus. Among the cladocerans that showed positive values of population growth rate (r), M. macrocopa had the highest of 0.96 ± 0.04 per day.

AB  - This work describes a technique for the rapid and sensitive electrochemical flow injection monitoring and analysis of mixtures of hydrazine compounds using stabilized systems of filter-supported bilayer lipid membranes (BLMs) composed of egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC) with incorporated DNA. Injections of hydrazines were made into flowing streams of a carrier electrolyte solution, and a transient current signal with a duration of seconds reproducibly appeared in less than one min after exposure of the DNA-modified lipid membranes to the hydrazines. The magnitude of this signal was linearly related to the concentration of hydrazines, which could be determined at sub-micromolar levels. Repetitive cycles of injection of hydrazines have shown no signal degradation during each cycle (30 sequential injections). The time of appearance of the transient response was different for each hydrazine and increased in the order of hydrazine, methylhydrazine or dimethylhydrazine, and phenylhydrazine. The difference in time of response has allowed selective detection and analysis of these hydrazines in mixtures.

VL  - 27

SP  - 106-110
AB  - A mathematical model for topology optimization of the tree-type water-injection pipe network was established by taking the minimum investment as the objective function and taking the restrictions to the unique relations between wells and stations, and numbers of connected water-injection wells as the constraint conditions. The optimization problem was divided into two layers of distribution and geometry. The genetic algorithm and nonlinear optimization were used to solve the problems respectively. The operational process of genetic algorithm was improved, and the fitness function was adjusted. Combined with the simulation annealing algorithm, it adopted the random parent-number fitness-weighted cross and many mutation methods and gave the method of determining initial temperature. The selection operation was also improved. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm was given. This algorithm can improve the speed of convergence and avoid premature convergence. Example shows the efficiency of the algorithm.

TI  - Rapid and efficient selection of human hematopoietic cells expressing murine heat-stable antigen as an indicator of retroviral-mediated gene transfer
VL  - 87
IS  - 2
SP  - 456-464
AB  - Recombinant retroviruses offer many advantages for the genetic modification of human hematepoietic cells, although their use in clinical protocols has thus far given disappointing results. There is therefore an important need to develop new strategies that will allow effectively transduced primitive hematopoietic target populations to be both rapidly characterized and isolated free of residual nontransduced but biologically equivalent cells. To address this need, we constructed a murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral vector containing the 228-bp coding sequence of the murine heat-stable antigen (HSA) and generated helper virus-free amphotropic MSCV-HSA producer cells by transfection of GP-env AM12 packaging cells. Light density and, in some cases, lineage marker-negative (lin(-)) normal human marrow or mobilized peripheral blood cells preactivated by exposure to interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and Steel factor in vitro for 48 hours were then infected by cocultivation with these MSCV-HSA producer cells for a further 48 hours in the presence of the same cytokines. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of the cells 24 hours later showed 21% to 41% (mean, 27%) of those that were still CD34(+) to have acquired the ability to express HSA, The extent of gene transfer to erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors (burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage), as assessed by the ability of these cells to form colonies of mature progeny in the presence of normally toxic concentrations of G418, averaged 11% and 12%, respectively, in 6 experiments. These values could be increased to 100% and 77%, respectively, by prior isolation of the CD34(+)HSA(+) cell fraction and were correspondingly decreased to an average of 2% and 5%, respectively, in the CD34(+)HSA(-) cells. In addition, the extent of gene transfer to long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) was assessed by G418 resistance. The average gene transfer to LTC-IC-derived colony-forming cells in the unsorted population was less than or equal to 7% in 4 experiments. FACS selection of the initially CD34(+)HSA(+) cells increased this value to 86% and decreased it to 3% for the LTC-IC plated from the CD34(+)HSA(-) cells. Transfer of HSA gene expression to a phenotypically defined more primitive subpopulation of CD34(+) cells, ie, those expressing little or no CD38, could also be shown by FACS analysis of infected populations 24 hours after infection. These findings underscore the potential use of retroviral vectors encoding HSA for the specific identification and nontoxic selection immediately after infection of retrovirally transduced populations of primitive human hematopoietic cells. In addition, such vectors should facilitate the subsequent tracking of their marked progeny using multiparameter flow cytometry. (C) 1996 by The American Society of Hematology.

TI  - Design and evaluation of modified atmosphere packaging for guava (Psidium guajava L.)
VL  - 13
AB  - Guava is one of the most important commercial fruit crop of India. It excels most other fruits in terms of productivity, palatability and vitamin C content. But at the same time it has very short shelf life and can not be exported. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) is intended to create an appropriate gaseous atmosphere around a commodity packaged in film to enhance shelf life and conserve the quality of packaged produce (Rai et al 2002). Hence, the study on design and evaluation for guava was undertaken to select suitable films for extending the shelf life of guava, based on respiration rate of Guava and permeability of commercially available films at different temperatures. The film selected was Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) with 100 and 150 (0.25% perforations) gauge thickness. The guava fruits of Allahabad Safeda and Lucknow-49 varieties were packed and sealed in these films. The packed fruits were stored under room temperature (11-17°C) and refrigerated temperature (8°C). The quality parameters evaluated were Physiological Loss in Weight (PLW), color change and texture. PLW, color change, cohesiveness and resilience increased with storage time whereas hardness and chewiness followed the reverse trend. On the basis of results and statistical analysis, it was found that Allahabad Safeda and LDPE 100 was the best variety treatment combination for extending the shelf life and maintaining the quality of guava up to 42 days at low temperature and 27 days at room temperature as compared to 18 days for control fruits.

VL  - 9

SP  - 261-267
AB  - We describe the use of emulsion liquid membrane technology to perform chiral separations on low molecular weight species. We have reviewed liquid membrane technology in the context of existing process scale chiral separations. We illustrate the potential of this new technique by presenting our results on the selective extraction of phenylalanine enantiomers, using copper(II) N-decyl-(L) -hydroxyproline as a chiral selector in an emulsion liquid membrane configuration. This is compared with an analogous batch solvent extraction system. Initial batch enantiomeric excesses of greater than 40% were observed with the emulsion liquid membrane system compared with around 25% for the solvent extraction system. It was also noted that the system is not limited by the equilibrium capacity constraints of the solvent extraction system. We have shown that kinetic chiral liquid membrane technology offers high productivity and flexibility compared with analogous process scale chiral technologies. Recent transfer of highly specific chiral reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic chemistries have shown that ''one-stop'' enantiomeric excesses of commercial interest (>95%) are achievable using kinetic chiral liquid membrane systems. Solvent and temperature selection strategies also have been outlined as means of increasing the enantioselectivity of existing liquid membrane extraction chemistries. Chirality 9:261-267, 1997.

VL  - 38
IS  - 4
SP  - 268-275
AB  - During the past two to three decades, Drosophila ananassae, a warm adapted tropical species, has invaded low to mid altitude localities in the western Himalayas. Due to its cold sensitivity, this species had never been recorded from higher latitudes as well as altitudes in India to the 1960s. A latitudinal cline in this desiccation-sensitive species corresponds with southern humid tropical localities rather than northern drier subtropical localities. An extension of its cline into lowland to midland montane localities has resulted due to global climatic change as well as local thermal effects through anthropogenic impact. However, D. ananassae populations at species borders are characterized by lower genetic variability for body melanization as well as for desiccation resistance. There is a lack of thermal plastic effects for body melanization, and the observed extended cline might represent evolutionary (genetic) response due to selection pressure imposed by drier habitats. A comparison of fecundity, hatchability and viability at three growth temperatures (17, 20 and 25°C) showed significant reduction in trait values at 17°C in D. ananassae. Thus, its recent range expansion into northern montane localities might involve genetic effects on stress-related traits and plastic effects on life history traits. We suggest that D. ananassae could serve as an indicator species for analyzing range expansion under changing climatic conditions. © 2008 The Entomological Society of Korea and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

VL  - 99

AB  - Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) fry were reared under two temperature regimes. The lethal salinity for 50% of the individuals after 96 h of exposure to seawater and the ability to adjust extracellular muscle sodium levels were measured in various sizes of fry after transferring them from fresh- to seawater at three different temperature regimes. Our experiments show that large (360-500 mg) pink salmon fry are more sensitive to temperature during seawater adaptation than small (180-200 mg) fry. Our data suggest that pink salmon fry exhibit a high degree of seawater tolerance at optimal temperature regimes following prolonged rearing in freshwater such as experienced by juveniles migrating downstream in nature. © 1991.

AB  - The exchange properties of Tenerife phillipsite in the NH4Na system have been studied. Exchange isotherms at 20, 37 and 50°C show that phillipsite prefers NH4+ over Na+ at any given temperature. The selectivity coefficient (Ks) decreases with temperature. Thermodynamic data for the reaction (equilibrium constant, standard enthalpy and standard entropy) are also provided. The kinetics of NH4+ release from phillipsite previously saturated with (NH4)2SO4 includes two stages. The exchange and the release properties of Tenerife phillipsite with regard to the NH4+ ion are favourable for its use in wastewater treatment and for preparing slow-release fertilizers. © 1994.

TI  - Steel production with microwave assisted electric arc furnace technology
SP  - 225-234
AB  - Microwave assisted electric arc furnace technology is a new steelmaking technology under development at Michigan Technological University. This technology is a revolutionary change from the current technology. It is achieved through the combination of microwave, electric arc and exothermal heating. This technology can produce molten steel directly from a shippable agglomerate (green ball) consisting of iron oxide concentrate, coal, and fluxing agent without the intermediate steps of coking, sintering, Blast Furnace (BF) ironmaking, and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking. The unique aspect of this technology utilizes the advantages of rapid volumetric heating, high energy efficiency, and chemical reaction acceleration through the use of microwaves. The viability of the technology lies in the fact that iron ore and carbon are excellent microwave absorbers. This new, simplified process translates into less capital cost, higher productivity, less environmental pollution and treatment cost, higher energy efficiency, and lower production cost.
