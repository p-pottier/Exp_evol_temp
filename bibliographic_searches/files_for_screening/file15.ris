TI  - SPECIES' DISTRIBUTION AND EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY INFLUENCE THE RESPONSES OF MARINE COPEPODS TO CLIMATE CHANGE: A GLOBAL META-ANALYSIS
VL  - 59
SP  - 559-584
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) and ocean warming (OW) are predicted to drive changes to the distribution of species and the structure of biological communities globally. Differences in lifehistory, physical traits, and the phenotypic response of organisms will, however, mean that the effects of OA and OW will differ among species. Geographical differences in environmental characteristics across habitats will also influence the effects of OA and OW, thereby driving inter-population differences in phenotypic response as determined by local adaptations. While is it accepted that the response of species will vary globally, predicting the trends in response of species remains highly uncertain. We undertook a meta-analysis of key biological traits of 47 marine copepod species from 88 studies to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the effects of OA and OW on copepod population demographics. Data from OA and OW were analysed independently due to insufficient two-stressor studies. We found that the large disparity in the response of species to OA and OW is largely defined by their environmental history. Additionally, the response of copepod species to OW is related to their evolutionary history which has less influence on their response to OA. Therefore, our study identified that the response of copepods to OA is driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors in their habitats. Under OA alone, copepods from less variable environments may be more susceptible, but the effects of OA will only be strongly negative at extreme low pH (<7). On the other hand, the response to OW is deeply tied to their phylogeny, whereby closely related species share similar costs and trade-offs. However, the effects of near-future OW (+2 to 4 degrees C) seem mainly positive unless these temperatures exceed a species' thermal limit. Finally, our analysis revealed that OW has a greater influence on key copepod traits than OA. Overall, this study shows that attempting to draw global patterns in the response of species to climate change from a single species or habitat without consideration of environmental and evolutionary history could lead to inaccurate and misleading predictions with respect to the future of biological communities.

AB  - Beginning in the 19308, evolution became an experimental subject. New techniques, especially in Drosophila, made possible quantitative analysis Of natural populations. In addition to a large number of studies on many species, there were four major controversies that dominated much of the discussion and experimentation. Some of the arguments were quite heated. These controversies were: Wright vs Fisher Oil Wright's shifting-balance theory; dominance vs overdominance as an explanation of heterosis; the classical vs balance hypothesis for genetic variability; the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Curiously, most of these issues were not really resolved. Rather they were abandoned in favor of more tractable studies made possible by the new molecular methods.

SP  - 355-363
AB  - Data on mean survival times for starvation tolerance and desiccation tolerance revealed significant differences for three Indian geographical populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana. The lack of differences between two successive generations of various isofemale lines of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana populations suggested that these physiological traits were genetically controlled. The north Indian populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana revealed significant higher desiccation tolerance while the southern populations revealed significantly higher survival tolerance. It can be argued that the south Indian populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana which lived in hot and humid environment throughout the year were poorly protected against desiccation but displayed higher starvation tolerance due to higher metabolic rate at increased ambient temperature. Thus, Indian geographical populations of D. bipectinata and D. malerkotliana revealed adaptively maintained genetic divergence for starvation and desiccation tolerance.

TI  - Global warming decreases connectivity among coral populations
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-+
AB  - Global warming is killing corals; however, the effects of warming on population connectivity, a process fundamental to reef recovery, are largely unexplored. Using a high-resolution (as high as 200 m), empirically calibrated biophysical model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef, we show that the increased larval mortality and reduced competency duration under a 2 degrees C warming alter dispersal patterns, whereas projected changes in large-scale currents have limited effects. Overall, there was on average a 7% decrease in the distance larvae disperse (among-reef interquartile range (IQR), -10% to -4%), an 8% decrease in the number of connections into each reef (IQR, -11% to -3%) and a 20% increase in local retention (IQR, 0% to +49%). Collectively, these shifts imply that 2 degrees C of warming will reduce inter-reef connectivity, hampering recovery after disturbances and reducing the spread of warm-adapted genes. Such changes make protections more effective locally, but may require reducing spacing between protected areas. The authors develop a high-resolution model of coral larval dispersal for the southern Great Barrier Reef. They show that 2 degrees C of warming decreases larval dispersal distance and connectivity of reefs, hampering post-disturbance recovery and the potential spread of warm-adapted genes.

VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 55-63
AB  - We examined the effects of acclimation temperature and two doses (2.5 and 25 mg kg(-1)) of a pyrogen (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) on behavioral thermoregulation in juvenile green iguanas. Overall means of body temperatures for the three-day trial periods were compared among three groups of animals acclimated at 15, 25, and 34 degreesC. The responses of each group of animals to the two dosages of LPS and a control saline injection were examined. Within each treatment block, animals either chose high body temperatures characteristic of a fever response or chose low body temperatures characteristic of a hypothermic response. Thermoregulation was influenced by interaction effects between and among, and independent effects of, acclimation temperature, dose of LPS, and day. In some treatment blocks, individual lizard mass positively correlated with mean individual body temperature. Mean mass of lizards that chose higher body temperatures within a treatment block was higher than the mean mass of lizards that chose lower body temperatures. From these results, we concluded that LPS may induce two different behavioral thermoregulatory responses: fever or hypothermia. The actual amplitude and direction of body temperature change appears to be affected by acclimation temperature and possibly by mass or energy reserves of the animal. If the energy reserves an not sufficient to sustain the higher rate of metabolism associated with the higher body temperatures of a hyperthermic or feverish state, the animal may resort to hypothermia.

TI  - The effects of physical and psychological stress on the gastrointestinal tract: Lessons from animal models
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 299-312
AB  - Physical and psychological stresses are widely accepted as triggers and / or modifiers of the clinical course of diverse gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Growing experimental evidence from a variety of models such as immobilization, thermal injury or early maternal deprivation in laboratory animals uniformly supports the ability of stress to induce the development of gastric ulcers, altered gastrointestinal motility and ion secretion, and increased intestinal permeability leading to the passage of antigens to the lamina propria and bacterial translocation. Stress can also synergize with other pathogenic factors such as Helicobacter pylori, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or colitis-inducing chemicals to produce gastrointestinal disease. The brain-gut axis provides the anatomical basis through emotions and environmental influences modulate the gastrointestinal function through the regulation of gastrointestinal immune system and mucosal inflammation; in this sense, mucosal mast cells - at cellular level - and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) - at molecular level - seem to play a crucial role. On the other hand, an array of adaptive responses have been evolved in order to maintain the homeostasis and to ensure the survival of the individual. In the gut mucosa anti-inflammatory pathways counteract the deleterious effect of the stressful stimuli on the gastrointestinal homeostasis. In the present review we discuss the several experimental approaches used to mimic human stressful events or chronic stress in laboratory animals, the evidence of stress-induced gastrointestinal inflammation and dysfunction derived from them, and the involved cellular and molecular mechanisms that are being discovered during the last years.

TI  - The stability of the crust of the dwarf planet Ceres
VL  - 463
IS  - 1
SP  - 520-528
AB  - In this article, we study the possibility that Ceres has, or had in the past, a crust heavier than a pure or muddy ice mantle, in principle gravitationally unstable. Such a structure is not unusual in the Solar system: Callisto is an example. In this work, we test how the composition (i.e. the volumetric quantity of ice) and the size of the crust can affect its survival during thermo-physical evolution after differentiation. We have considered two different configurations: the first characterized by a dehydrated silicate core and a mantle made of pure ice, the second with a hydrated silicate core and a muddy mantle (ice with silicate impurities). In both cases, the crust is composed of a mixture of ice and silicates. These structures are constrained by a recent measurement of the mean density by Park et al. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which operates in such an unstable structure, could reverse all or part of the crust. The whole unstable crust (or part of it) can interact chemically with the underlying mantle and what is currently observed could be a partially/totally new crust. Our results suggest that, in the case of a pure ice mantle, the primordial crust has not survived until today, with a stability timespan always less than 3 Gyr. Conversely, in the case of a muddy mantle, with some 'favourable' conditions (low volumetric ice percentage in the crust and small crustal thickness), the primordial crust could be characterized by a stability timespan compatible with the lifetime of the Solar system.

TI  - Harvesting Carbon from Eastern US Forests: Opportunities and Impacts of an Expanding Bioenergy Industry

SP  - 370-397
AB  - Eastern forests of the US are valued both as a carbon sink and a wood resource. The amount of biomass that can be harvested sustainably from this biome for bioenergy without compromising the carbon sink is uncertain. Using past literature and previously validated models, we assessed four scenarios of biomass harvest in the eastern US: partial harvests of mixed hardwood forests, pine plantation management, short-rotation woody cropping systems, and forest residue removal. We also estimated the amount and location of abandoned agricultural lands in the eastern US that could be used for biomass production. Greater carbon storage was estimated to result from partial harvests and residue removals than from plantation management and short-rotation cropping. If woody feedstocks were cultivated with a combination of intensive management on abandoned lands and partial harvests of standing forest, we estimate that roughly 176 Tg biomass y(-1) (similar to 330,000 GWh or similar to 16 billion gallons of ethanol) could be produced sustainably from the temperate forest biome of the eastern US. This biomass could offset up to similar to 63 Tg C y(-1) that are emitted from fossil fuels used for heat and power generation while maintaining a terrestrial C sink of similar to 8 Tg C y(-1).

TI  - Economic analysis of CO2 capture from natural gas combined cycles using Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells
VL  - 130
SP  - 562-573
AB  - Driven by the search for high efficiency power generation with low CO2 emissions, several works in the last years investigated the integration of gas turbine cycles and high temperature fuel cells to arrange power plants with CO2 capture. One of the most promising configurations in a mid-term perspective relies on the use of Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) as "active CO2 concentrator" in natural gas combined cycles (NGCC). This work presents an assessment of the economic perspectives of the two most promising configurations, previously analyzed through detailed simulations carried out at Politecnico di Milano, discussing their potential for the long-term (2025+) technology portfolio of an electric utility. The fuel cell cathode side receives the gas turbine exhausts, in order to transfer CO2 from this stream to the anode side. While doing this, the MCFC requires about 20% of the total fuel input and contributes to the plant electric power output by a similar fraction. Downstream the MCFC is placed the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG); exhaust heat released to the cell effluents is recovered in the bottoming steam cycle. Two different approaches were considered for purification of the CO2-rich flow exiting the fuel cell anode: (i) a cryogenic process that separates CO2 from the residual combustible compounds, which are recycled back to the gas turbines, or (ii) an oxy-combustion of residual combustible species, followed by heat recovery, cooling and water separation by condensation. In all cases, purification yields a high purity CO2 stream, pumped to liquid form for storage. Both these plant configurations can capture up to 70-85% of CO2 with small or negligible efficiency penalties compared to a baseline NGCC while increasing remarkably the plant power output, thus yielding relevant advantages with respect to competitive CO2 capture technologies. Moreover, the relatively limited power output of the fuel cell section suggests a plausible mid-term feasibility of the proposed concept, by taking into account that largest existing MCFC plants built so far surpassed the 50 MWel size. After an introduction about MCFC technological status and economic outlook, this work analyzes the economic performances of the proposed plants in order to evaluate their economic viability, considering all plant components and adopting a detailed bottom-up approach to determine the component cost distribution and the total plant costs. The final effect on cost of electricity and CO2 capture cost are addressed, allowing to evidence whether and how this solution might be competitive in the future. It is shown that current MCFC costs do not allow an economic advantage with respect to 'traditional' carbon capture cycles (i.e., NGCC with ammines scrubbing); while the situation would change assuming more aggressive mid-term MCFC cost targets. The breakeven specific costs that MCFC should achieve to successfully compete on an economic basis results close to 1500 (sic)/kW(el) (in terms of Total Equipment Cost, TEC) for a cost of natural gas equal to 6.5 (sic)/GJ, increasing to 2000 (sic)e/kW(el) assuming NG cost of 9 (sic)/GJ.

VL  - 6
IS  - 2
AB  - The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika causing major problems for public health, which requires new strategies for its control, like the use of entomopathogenic microorganisms. In this study, bacteria from various Amazonian environments were isolated and tested for their pathogenicity to A. aegypti larvae. Following thermal shock to select sporulated Bacillus spp., 77 bacterial strains were isolated. Molecular identification per 16S RNA sequences revealed that the assembled strains contained several species of the genus Bacillus and one species each of Brevibacillus, Klebsiella, Serratia, Achromobacter and Brevundimonas. Among the isolated Bacillus sp. strains, 19 showed larvicidal activity against A. aegypti. Two strains of Brevibacillus halotolerans also displayed larvicidal activity. For the first time, larvicidal activity against A. aegypti was identified for a strain of Brevibacillus halotolerans. Supernatant and pellet fractions of bacterial cultures were tested separately for larvicidal activities. Eight strains contained isolated fractions resulting in at least 50% mortality when tested at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. Further studies are needed to characterize the active larvicidal metabolites produced by these microorganisms and define their mechanisms of action.

TI  - Increased genetic diversity loss and genetic differentiation in a model marine diatom adapted to ocean warming compared to high CO2
VL  - 16

SP  - 2587-2598
AB  - Although high CO2 and warming could act interactively on marine phytoplankton, little is known about the molecular basis for this interaction on an evolutionary scale. Here we explored the adaptation to high CO2 in combination with warming in a model marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Whole-genome re-sequencing identifies, in comparison to populations grown under control conditions, a larger genetic diversity loss and a higher genetic differentiation in the populations adapted for 2 years to warming than in those adapted to high CO2. However, this diversity loss was less under high CO2 combined with warming, suggesting that the evolution driven by warming was constrained by high CO2. By integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and physiological data, we found that the underlying molecular basis for this constraint is associated with the expression of genes involved in some key metabolic pathways or biological processes, such as the glyoxylate pathway, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism, and diel variability. Our results shed new light on the evolutionary responses of marine phytoplankton to multiple environmental changes in the context of global change and provide new insights into the molecular basis underpinning interactions among those multiple drivers.

VL  - 75
IS  - 1
SP  - 17-38
AB  - California grunion Leuresthes tenuis synchronize spawning with tidal cycles, so the embryos incubate in a terrestrial environment, delay hatching until cued by a specific environmental trigger, and may extend incubation for up to an additional four weeks. These adaptations, however, do not appear to alter the morphology or sequence of early developmental stages as compared to other Atherinomorph fishes in the Orders Beloniformes and Cyprinodontiformes. Embryonic development is described in a series of 30 stages based on morphology observed by light microscopy. Stages are placed in five periods: zygote and cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation and organogenesis, and hatching competence. Embryos from a southern population of L. tenuis in Los Angeles are compared with embryos found > 560 km north in San Francisco Bay. Northern L. tenuis embryos developed more slowly at several stages than southern embryos and reached hatching competence later, but both locations maintained synchrony with the tidal cycle for both spawning and hatching. The variation in rates of development and stage at hatching readiness are forms of developmental heterochrony that may be associated with evolutionary adaptation or morphological plasticity within this highly successful clade.

TI  - Heritability and Evolutionary Potential Drive Cold Hardiness in the Overwintering Ophraella communa Beetles
VL  - 9
AB  - Chill tolerance plays a crucial role that allows insect species to adapt to cold environments. Two Chinese geographical populations (Laibin and Yangzhou populations) were selected to understand the chill resistance and evolutionary potential in the Ophraella communa, a biological control agent of the invasive common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia. Super-cooling point assays, knockdown tests under static low-temperature conditions and determination of glycerol content were studied. ANOVAs indicated significant differences regarding chill coma recovery time, super-cooling point, and glycerol content across populations and sexes. The narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) estimates of cold resistance based on a parental half-sibling breeding design ranged from 0.39 to 0.53, and the h(2) value was significantly higher in the Yangzhou population than in the Laibin population. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for cold tolerance. The Yangzhou population of O. communa has a strong capability to quickly gain resistance to cold. We conclude that the O. communa beetle has a plasticity that can provide cold resistance in the changing climate conditions.

AB  - The distribution of soil invertebrates from different taxa and the adaptive potential of all three cold hardiness strategies in the cold climate of northeastern Asia are analyzed. The correlation between the resistance to low temperatures and the overwintering conditions in habitats of some species is studied. The mechanisms and degree of cold hardiness are shown generally to be unrelated to the taxonomic proximity. The effect of the resistance to low wintering temperatures on the habitat distribution and faunogenesis of soil invertebrates in permafrost regions is discussed.

AB  - In a study aiming to assess bacterial evolution in complex growth media, we evaluated the long-term adaptive response of Escherichia coli MC1000 in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Seven parallel populations were founded and followed over 150 days in sequential batch cultures under three different oxygen conditions (defined environments), and 19 evolved forms were isolated. The emergence of forms with enhanced fitness was evident in competition experiments of all evolved forms versus the ancestral strain. The evolved forms were then subjected to phenotypic and genomic analyses relative to the ancestor. Profound changes were found in their phenotypes as well as whole-genome sequences. Interestingly, considerable heterogeneity was found at the intrapopulational level. However, consistently occurring parallel adaptive responses were found across all populations. The evolved forms all contained a mutation in galR, a repressor of the galactose operon. Concomitantly, the new forms revealed enhanced growth on galactose as well as galactose-containing disaccharides. This response was likely driven by the LB medium.

TI  - Search for new strains of microalgae-producers of lipids from natural sources for biodiesel production
VL  - 44

SP  - 5844-5853
AB  - Biomass of high-yielding strains of phototrophic microorganisms actively accumulating lipids is a promising non-traditional raw material for bioenergy including the production of biodiesel. In this study, we present results of searching for new strains of microalgae-producers of lipids from hot springs. Within the framework of research, the primary screening of water for the presence of lipid - accumulative microalgae was carried out with the help of qualitative reaction with lipid-specific dyes, as well as 5 axenic isolates of microalgae with stable growth were identified in the laboratory and their productivity and fatty acid composition were studied. The isolated strains were identified as Chlorella vulgaris sp-1, Ankistrodesmus sp-21, Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21, Chlorella pyrenoidosa sp-13 and Chlamydomonas sp-22. The obtained data showed that the isolated strains determined by biomass in the range 1.3 g/l to 1.81 g/l. As a result of the research, it was established that the highest content of lipids was observed in the strains Chlorella vulgaris sp-1 and Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21, which is 28.7 and 29.8% of the cell dry weight, respectively. The analysis of the fatty acid composition of the cells showed that the largest mass fraction of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids was found in strain Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21 - 61.9%. In the result, Scenedesmus obliquus sp-21 strain isolated from thermal sources was selected as a promising candidate for biodiesel production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - FVS and Global Warming: A Prospectus for Future Development
VL  - 54
SP  - 7-16
AB  - Climate-change global warming and changes in precipitation-will cause changes in tree growth rates, mortality rates, the distribution of tree species, competition, and species interactions. An implicit assumption in FVS is that site quality will remain the same as it was during the time period observations used to calibrate the component models were made and that the site quality will not be affected by climate change. This paper presents evidence of the impacts of climate change on forests and argues that FVS needs to be revised to account for these changes. The changes include modification of the growth, mortality, and regeneration establishment models, all of which need to account for changes in site quality and genetic adaptation. Criteria for modifying the model recognize that the model's applications and uses will not diminish and need to be supported. The new process, climate change, needs to be recognized by the model because it influences all of the processes FVS currently represents. Plans are being made to address this major task.

TI  - Oceanographic Drivers of Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris) and Sowerby's (Mesoplodon bidens) Beaked Whales Acoustic Occurrence along the Irish Shelf Edge
VL  - 9
IS  - 10
AB  - Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales occur year-round in western Irish waters, yet remain some of the most poorly understood cetaceans in the area. Considering the importance of the area for anthropogenic activities and the sensitivity of beaked whales to noise, understanding their ecology is essential to minimise potential overlaps. To this end, fixed bottom-mounted autonomous acoustic recorders were deployed at 10 stations over four recording periods spanning from May 2015 to November 2016. Acoustic data were collected over 1934 cumulative days, for a total of 7942 h of recordings. To model the probability of presence of Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales in the area as a function of oceanographic predictors, we used Generalised Additive Models, fitted with Generalised Estimating Equations to deal with temporal autocorrelation. To reflect prey availability, oceanographic variables acting as proxies of primary productivity and prey aggregation processes such as upwelling events and thermal fronts were selected. Our results demonstrated that oceanographic variables significantly contributed to the occurrence of Cuvier's and Sowerby's beaked whales (p-values between < 0.001 and < 0.05). The species showed similar preferences, with the exception of sdSST. The inclusion of a parameter accounting for the recorders location confirmed the existence of a latitudinal partitioning for those species in the area. This study provides a point of comparison for future research and represents an important step towards a better understanding of those elusive species.</p>

TI  - Adaptive evolution in GroEL from distantly related endosymbiotic bacteria of insects
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 651-660
AB  - Many symbioses between bacteria and insects resulted from ancient infections followed by strict vertical transmission within host lineages. The strong bottlenecks under which this transmission occurs promote the neutral fixation of slightly deleterious mutations by genetic drift. As predicted by Muller's ratchet, this fixation will drive endosymbiotic bacteria through an irreversible dynamics of fitness loss. The chaperonin GroEL has been proposed as a compensatory mechanism whereby endosymbiotic bacteria of aphids persist. Here, we show that endosymbiotic bacteria of insects from two phylogenetically very distant bacterial phyla have fixed amino acid substitutions by positive selection in functionally important GroEL regions involved in either GroES/peptide binding or in the en bloc movement of the GroEL apical domain. These results, together with the high levels of constitutive expression of GroEL in these endosymbionts, provide valuable insights into the evolution of a molecular mechanism responsible for the maintenance of the symbiotic lifestyle.

SP  - 524-531
AB  - The illumination environment is extremely important to the visual-related operation/interface design, due to its great effect on visual operation. Therefore, the influence of illumination environment factors, such as illumination and color temperature, on visual operation needs to be investigated deeply. In this study, five illumination environment levels, combined by illumination and color temperature, were selected to carry out ergonomic experiments. The screen brightness of high, medium and low was set, and the internal experiment of two-factor subjects was conducted based on the visual search task. Behavioral performance data and subjective evaluation data of 16 subjects were collected and analyzed. The results show that, in terms of response time, correct rate, and subjective evaluation, the main effects of illumination and screen brightness are significant.

VL  - 8

AB  - Question: Sampling biases influence the estimation of sex ratio in species with environmental sex determination (ESD). Are these biases the sole reason for the apparent sex ratio in such species? Methods: Over a 6-year period, we studied maturing painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) through mark and recapture in a complex of ponds in northern Virginia. To avoid the biases associated with the measurement of primary and adult sex ratios, we monitored individuals over multiple years and measured sex-specific capture and survival rates. Results: We observed a significant female bias that cannot be attributed to climatic variance or differential survival, capture, or age at maturity. Conclusions: The observed female bias cannot be explained by existing evolutionary models and is consistent with a lag in evolutionary response to the loss of male-producing environments resulting from human influences on vegetation cover.

TI  - NITROGEN-DEFECT AGGREGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME AUSTRALASIAN DIAMONDS - TIME-TEMPERATURE CONSTRAINTS ON THE SOURCE REGIONS OF PIPE AND ALLUVIAL DIAMONDS
VL  - 75
IS  - 11
SP  - 1290-1310
AB  - The proportions of aggregated N substitutional defects, platelet intensities, and bulk N contents have been quantitatively determined in type Ia diamonds from the Argyle and Ellendale olivine lamproite pipes (Kimberley block of northwest Australia) and alluvial deposits in western and central Kalimantan (Indonesia) and Copeton (eastern Australia) using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy. The extent of conversion of A defects (a pair of substitutional N atoms) to the aggregated B form is a function of the temperature history, mantle residence time (t(MR)), and N concentration of diamond. We have used Argyle eclogitic diamonds, which have well-constrained equilibration temperatures (average almost-equal-to 1255-degrees-C) and short mantle residency (0.4 Ga), together with experimental data to refine the values of the activation energy (E(a)) and Arrhenius constant (A) for the A --> B reaction. We obtain E(a)/R = 8.16 +/- 0.13 x 10(4) K (E(a) = 7.03 eV) and ln(A/atomic ppm-1 s-1) = 13.51. Kinetic modeling shows that the reaction is sensitive to time-averaged temperatures (designated T(NA)) in the range 1050-1300-degrees-C and that such temperatures are not necessarily equivalent to those determined by silicate inclusion geothermometry. The results show that the Ellendale eclogitic diamonds were resident in cool lithosphere and have not experienced the higher temperatures typical of Argyle diamonds. Constraints from inclusion geothermometry indicate that Ellendale eclogitic diamonds must be younger than Argyle diamonds, and a Phanerozoic age is suggested. Copeton diamonds comprise a yellow high-N group (> 500 ppm N) and a colorless low-N group (< 400 ppm N). They are constrained to a series of moderate temperature isotherms (T(NA) almost-equal-to 1070-1145-degrees-C, for t(MR) = 1.6 Ga) and have an extent of N-defect conversion consistent with long-term mantle storage. Remarkably, some of the Kalimantan alluvial and Ellendale peridotitic diamonds lie on the tightly constrained highest temperature (1145-degrees-C) Copeton isotherm, suggesting these diamonds may have had a common origin in ancient Gondwanaland lithosphere that has been dispersed by more recent tectonic processes. A case is made for diamond survival in remnant subcontinental lithosphere underlying southeast Asian and eastern Australian microcontinental blocks that separated from the northeastern Gondwanaland margin during the Paleozoic. Inasmuch as the N-defect characteristics of diamond reflect a unique mantle thermal history, they may prove useful in provenance studies of alluvial diamonds, in paleotectonic reconstructions, and in deducing the thermal evolution of subcontinental lithosphere, when combined with data from inclusion and xenolith geothermometry.

AB  - Important findings from the second decade of the 21st century on the impact of environmental change on biological processes in the Antarctic were synthesised by 26 international experts. Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of 'scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Analysis of the Windermere (England), Perca fluviatilis (1965-1997) and Esox lucius (1943-1997) fishery data indicates there have been substantial changes in sex ratios through time. In the case of perch, a 1976 perch disease outbreak substantially skewed the sex ratio in favor of females. It took over a decade for the fishery to recover to its pre-1976 state. In the case of pike, both catch and year-class data are female biased, but this bias has significantly weakened through time. This trend towards proportionately more males through time may reflect an effect of increasing spring temperatures or an evolutionary or phenotypic response to female-biased fishing pressure.

TI  - Adaptive significance of the prolonged diapause in the western Mediterranean lycaenid butterfly Tomares ballus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)
VL  - 114
SP  - 133-139
AB  - Diapause is a common dormancy strategy exhibited by many species of invertebrates and insects to temporarily avoid seasonally recurring unfavourable conditions for their development, most usually in winter. Less frequently, a prolonged diapause lasting two or more years is described in species living in unpredictable environments where it is adaptive, but with significant costs. In this paper we examine the occurrence of prolonged diapause in the lycaenid butterfly Tomares ballus. Pupae of this species undergo an obligate diapause from mid-May to late January the following year. However, during our rearing experiments (from 2009 to 2016) the emergence of adults occurred sequentially and a fraction of the pupae remained in diapause for up to seven years. The annual percentage emergence after the first year of diapause was 45.6%, and only barely exceeded 50.0% in 2015. Remarkably, 12 pupae (11.4% of the initial brood) remained in diapause in their eighth year. The negative exponential equation fitted to the emergence data suggests that further emergences may occur within the next five years. Therefore, the potential for successful prolonged diapause of T. ballus pupae may be more than 10 years. The adaptive value of this strategy is discussed in relation to the effects of adverse and unpredictable weather during the flight period of the butterfly, intra-guild competition, parasitoids and changes in habitat quality. We suggest that this strategy may also be exhibited by other species of Mediterranean lycaenids.

TI  - Plant adaptation to different climates shapes the strengths of chemically mediated tritrophic interactions
VL  - 33
IS  - 10
SP  - 1893-1903
AB  - How plant traits evolve along geographical and climatic gradients has recently received increased attention because of anticipated climate change and associated shifts in insect distribution, whether they are herbivores or predators. This issue is particularly relevant for traits related to growth and anti-herbivore defence of plants, because both sets of traits are closely tied to fitness, and because being sessile organisms, plants tend to experience strong local selection. Despite widespread recognition that the abiotic environment imposes selection on plant traits, how temperature and water availability independently select for allocation to growth and defence against herbivores is not well-resolved, and even more so, when considering under-ground herbivory and tritrophic interactions involving plant herbivores and their predators. To address heritable, climate-driven variation in root traits mediating tritrophic interactions, we performed a common garden experiment with four populations of common red fescue (Festuca rubra) encompassing the four corners of a precipitation by temperature gradient matrix. We found that plants originating from wetter and warmer conditions, in addition to producing more biomass, also produced a blend of volatile organic compounds more attractive for predatory nematodes of root insect herbivores. Moreover, across populations, variation in nematode attraction was mediated by balancing the emissions of attractive and repulsive volatile compounds. Our work builds towards better understanding how plant adaptation to climate interacts with adaptations to herbivores and their predators. A plain language summary is available for this article.

SP  - 337-346
AB  - Previous studies have shown that a range of different stresses can increase mean lifespan. Here we investigated the effect of injuries and bacterial inoculation on mean lifespan in lines selected for increased longevity and their controls. The three lines from each selection regime were subjected to one of five treatments ranging from control, over perforating the cuticle with a sterile needle, to inoculating with peptidoglycan or one of two strains of live bacteria. The flies were subjected to the infection stress at two ages and the experiment was conducted on both males and females of replicate lines of each selection regime. The individual lines and sexes differed in response to the treatment. However, overall the sterile injury of young males resulted in prolonged mean lifespan from both selection regimes, whereas inoculating had no additional effect to stabbing with a sterile needle. In middle-aged males only treatment with peptidoglycan had a significant hormetic effect and this was only in longevity-selected flies. In females only one of the tested contrasts was significant and here the effect of the treatment was to reduce average lifespan. As could be expected, the results showed a significant interaction between the effects of sex and infection on survival.

VL  - 45

SP  - 267-274
AB  - The corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) is one of the most important pests of maize with worldwide distribution. The use of relatively resistant corn hybrids may lessen the harmful effects by this aphid; we therefore compared population growth parameters of R. maidis reared on six commonly grown maize hybrids in Iran, namely K3640/3X MO17, Simon, SC704, EXP1, VRE26XK18 and VRE27XK18. The experiments were carried out under conditions of 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 60 +/- 10% RH, and a photoperiod of 16L8D. The development time and survival of aphid nymphs differed significantly among the maize hybrids tested. We also observed significant differences in aphid fecundity, resulting in large variations in population growth parameters, such as the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-0), finite rate of increase (lambda) and doubling time (DT). The r(m) values were highest for aphids reared on maize hybrids EXP1 and VRE27XK18, lowest for aphids reared on hybrid K3640/3XMO17, and intermediate for aphids reared on hybrids VRE26XK18, SC704 and Simon. Consequently, these results may offer useful information for planning a comprehensive program for IPM of the corn leaf aphid in Iran.

TI  - A semi-analytical model to predict the heat extraction from an enhanced geothermal system with multiple wells and areal flow
SP  - 309-317
AB  - In order to meet the rapidly increasing demand for energy supply, multiple wells have been used to improve the output productivity and performance of an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS). As the output performance of an EGS is affected by many factors, such as number and placement of wells, direction and magnitude of areal flow and flow rates, reservoir optimization is an important topic in EGS design. In this paper, a semi-analytical model is developed to study the heat extraction from a multiple-well (some for recharging and the others for production) geothermal reservoir, where fluid circulates in a single, planar hydraulic fracture with a constant hydraulic aperture. The effect of parallel areal flow across the well field is included in the analysis. The streamline function and velocity potential method used in the authors' previous work (Wu et al., 2013) is extended to the current problem. A comparison of the flow behaviour and temperature evolution in a given well layout with and without areal flow is carried out. The results show that the areal flow plays an important role in affecting the temperature distribution and thus the EGS output performance. Therefore, the well layout needs to be optimized when there exists areal flow.

TI  - The Effect of Immigration on the Adaptation of Microbial Communities to Warming
VL  - 187
IS  - 2
SP  - 236-248
AB  - Theory predicts that immigration can either enhance or impair the rate at which species and whole communities adapt to environmental change, depending on the traits of genotypes and species in the source pool relative to local conditions. These responses, in turn, will determine how well whole communities function in changing environments. We tested the effects of immigration and experimental warming on microbial communities during an 81-day field experiment. The effects of immigration depended on the warming treatment. In warmed communities, immigration was detrimental to community growth, whereas in ambient communities it was beneficial. This result is explained by colonists coming from a local species pool preadapted to ambient conditions. Loss of metabolic diversity, however, was buffered by immigration in both environments. Communities showed increasing local adaptation to temperature conditions during the experiment, and this was independent of whether they received immigration. Genotypes that comprised the communities were not locally adapted, however, indicating that community local adaptation can be independent of adaptation of component genotypes. Our results are consistent with a greater role for species interactions rather than adaptation of constituent species in determining local adaptation of whole communities and confirm that immigration can either enhance or impair community responses to environmental change depending on the environmental context.

VL  - 28

SP  - 85-100
AB  - Degradation of land and denudation of forest resources, instability in production, erosion of soil, and depletion of native fertility status necessitates a thorough understanding for sustainable agricultural development for conservation of natural resources for present and future generations. We studied the natural resource inventory of Luppi village, situated at eastern plateau of India using a Geographic Information System and satellite imagery (IRS IC LISS III satellite imagery) and Participatory Rural Appraisal Technique, a procedure for rapid acquisition of knowledge, development activity, and decision-making done with the involvement of rural people and household survey. A base map and resource map of the village were developed using GEOMATICA software. Toposequence based micro-level study revealed that there were four types of land situations: upper terraces locally called Tanr, Bahri (land close to homesteads), Baad (middle terraces), and Garha (lower terraces). Adverse bio-physical and socio-economic conditions and age-old, traditional, unscientific agricultural activities in the region act as deterrents for crop production and natural resource management. Based on the study, it can be concluded that priority should be given to long term strategies encompassing silviculture or silvi-pastoral system (cultivation of trees and pasture simultaneously) on upland, cultivation of short-duration, flash-flood tolerant, high-yielding rice variety for Aman (wet) season, and cold-tolerant rice variety for winter season in low land areas; social forestry in degraded land; agro-ecologically suited cropping systems with suitable variety choice for problem areas; and judicious nutrient management in homestead gardens that is ecologically suitable, socio-econornic ally acceptable, technologically sound, and environmentally sustainable.

TI  - Bridging the genotyping gap: using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to add high-density SNP markers and new value to traditional bi-parental mapping and breeding populations
VL  - 126
IS  - 11
SP  - 2699-2716
AB  - Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) is the latest application of next-generation sequencing protocols for the purposes of discovering and genotyping SNPs in a variety of crop species and populations. Unlike other high-density genotyping technologies which have mainly been applied to general interest "reference" genomes, the low cost of GBS makes it an attractive means of saturating mapping and breeding populations with a high density of SNP markers. One barrier to the widespread use of GBS has been the difficulty of the bioinformatics analysis as the approach is accompanied by a high number of erroneous SNP calls which are not easily diagnosed or corrected. In this study, we use a 384-plex GBS protocol to add 30,984 markers to an indica (IR64) x japonica (Azucena) mapping population consisting of 176 recombinant inbred lines of rice (Oryza sativa) and we release our imputation and error correction pipeline to address initial GBS data sparsity and error, and streamline the process of adding SNPs to RIL populations. Using the final imputed and corrected dataset of 30,984 markers, we were able to map recombination hot and cold spots and regions of segregation distortion across the genome with a high degree of accuracy, thus identifying regions of the genome containing putative sterility loci. We mapped QTL for leaf width and aluminum tolerance, and were able to identify additional QTL for both phenotypes when using the full set of 30,984 SNPs that were not identified using a subset of only 1,464 SNPs, including a previously unreported QTL for aluminum tolerance located directly within a recombination hotspot on chromosome 1. These results suggest that adding a high density of SNP markers to a mapping or breeding population through GBS has a great value for numerous applications in rice breeding and genetics research.

AB  - Wildfires are exorbitantly cataclysmic disasters that lead to the destruction of forest cover, wildlife, land resources, human assets, reduced soil fertility and global warming. Every year wildfires wreck havoc across the globe. Therefore, there is a need of an efficient and reliable system for real-time wildfire monitoring to dilute their disastrous effects. Internet of Things (IoT) has demonstrated remarkable evolution and has been successfully adopted in environmental monitoring domain. This paper proposes a collaborative IoT-Fog-Cloud framework based on soft computing techniques for real-time wildfire monitoring, prediction and forecasting. The framework includes proposals for classifying a forest terrain into its appropriate wildfire proneness class using fuzzy K-nearest-neighbor classifier by analyzing wildfire influent attributes and wildfire consequent attributes. Moreover, real-time emergency alert generation mechanism based on temporal mining has been proposed in event of adverse wildfire conditions. Estimation of future wildfire proneness levels of a forest terrain using Holt-Winter's forecasting model also forms an integral part of the proposed framework. Implementation results reveal that high values of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and precision averaging to 93.97%, 92.35%, 93.01% and 91.24% are attained for determination of wildfire proneness of a forest terrain. Low values of mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error (RMSE) averaging to 0.665, 2, 11.705 and 1.405, respectively, for real-time alert generation are registered, thereby increasing the utility of the proposed framework. Wildfire proneness forecasting also yields highly accurate results with low values of MAE, MSE and RMSE averaging to 0.166667, 0.25 and 0.492799, respectively.

AB  - I studied the egg-laying behavior of the frog Buergeria japonica in the coastal areas of Okinawa, Japan, to clarify whether females avoid high salinity areas to reduce egg mortality. I compared the distribution of oviposition sites to the salinity gradient and evaluated the physical cues used by females to select oviposition sites. Females selected oviposition sites above the high tide line at spring tide, where eggs would not be disturbed by incursion of seawater. Above this high tide line, females selected oviposition sites from which eggs would not be washed out or desiccate, by using cues such as water depth and substrate. Examination of conditions at two spatial scales helps to clarify the evolution of oviposition site selection.

TI  - Mineralogy and Composition of the Oceanic Mantle
VL  - 52
IS  - 2
SP  - 279-313
AB  - The mineralogy of the oceanic basalt source region is examined by testing whether a peridotite mineralogy can yield observed whole-rock and olivine compositions from (1) the Hawaiian Islands, our type example of a mantle plume, and (2) the Siqueiros Transform, which provides primitive samples of normal mid-ocean ridge basalt. New olivine compositional data from phase 2 of the Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP2) show that higher Ni-in-olivine at the Hawaiian Islands is due to higher temperatures (T) of melt generation and processing (by c. 300 degrees C) related to the Hawaiian mantle plume. Pm is low at high T, so parental Hawaiian basalts are enriched in NiO. When Hawaiian (picritic) parental magmas are transported to shallow depths, olivine precipitation occurs at lower temperatures, where D-Ni is high, leading to high Ni-in-olivine. Similarly, variations in Mn and Fe/Mn ratios in olivines are explained by contrasts in the temperatures of magma processing. Using the most mafic rocks to delimit Siqueiros and Hawaiian Co and Ni contents in parental magmas and mantle source compositions also shows that both suites can be derived from natural peridotites, but are inconsistent with partial melting of natural pyroxenites. Whole-rock compositions at Hawaii and Siqueiros are also matched by partial melting experiments conducted on peridotite bulk compositions. Hawaiian whole-rocks have elevated FeO contents compared with Siqueiros, which can be explained if Hawaiian parental magmas are generated from peridotite at 4-5 GPa, in contrast to pressures of slightly greater than 1 GPa for melt generation at Siqueiros; these pressures are consistent with olivine thermometry, as described in an earlier paper. SiO2-enriched Koolau compositions are reproduced if high-Fe Hawaiian parental magmas re-equilibrate at 1-1.5 GPa. Peridotite partial melts from experimental studies also reproduce the CaO and Al2O3 contents of Hawaiian (and Siqueiros) whole-rocks. Hawaiian magmas have TiO2 contents, however, that are enriched compared with melts from natural peridotites and magmas derived from the Siqueiros depleted mantle, and consequently may require an enriched source. TiO2 is not the only element that is enriched relative to melts of natural peridotites. Moderately incompatible elements, such as Ti, Zr, Hf, Gamma, and Eu, and compatible elements, such as Gamma b and Lu, are all enriched at the Hawaiian Islands. Such enrichments can be explained by adding 5-10% mid-ocean ridge basalt (crust) to depleted mantle; when the major element composition of such a mixture is recast into mineral components, the result is a fertile peridotite mineralogy.

TI  - Mineral equilibrium constraints on the feasibility of diffusive H2O-fluxed melting in the continental crust
VL  - 38
IS  - 7
SP  - 719-742
AB  - Generation of granitic melt is believed to occur predominantly by melting through the breakdown of hydrous minerals. However, melting due to the influx of H2O has been recognized in anatectic amphibolite facies tonalitic grey gneisses, metagreywackes and low-Pmetapelites, and has consequently been proposed as an alternative mechanism for the generation of granitic melt. Melting induced by H2O addition is recognized from voluminous melt production at relatively low temperature, where hydrous minerals are stable and anhydrous minerals are preferentially consumed during melting. Mineral equilibrium modelling to determine theP-Tconditions, melt volumes, melting reactions and viable H2O sources reveals that the process is not restricted to specific compositions orP-Tconditions, although lower pressure and lithologies with a low hydrous mineral content are more favourable. Melting reactions in all lithologies primarily consume quartz and feldspars to yield 5-6 mol.% melt for each mol.% of H2O added.aH(2)Oremains constant at similar to 0.70 to 0.77 during progressive melting as long as alkali feldspar is present. Once alkali feldspar is exhausted, plagioclase becomes the main reactant, producing more tonalitic melt compositions with gradually higheraH(2)O. Our results demonstrate that, at the site of melting, melting is driven by diffusion of H2O into the target rock along chemical potential gradients, rather than the advective flow of a mechanically distinct water-rich fluid phase. Melting will initiate and proceed as long as a mu H2Ogradient exists between the H2O source and target lithology. Our calculations show that an ordinary magma, such as an I-type magma with typical H2O content, has a mu H2Ohigh enough to be a viable H2O source, allowing diffusive H2O-fluxed melting to produce melt proportions and fertility comparable to that of dehydration melting. However, high degrees of partial melting require a considerable amount of H2O, which necessitates a continuously advecting H2O source such as a magma conduit or melt-bearing shear zone. A magmatic H2O source at emplacement level will undergo a similar amount of crystallization as the melt fraction produced in the target rock such that there will be no net melt production. Considering that shear-zone hosted magma conduits are localized features, diffusive H2O-fluxed melting is likely to only be viable in a small fraction of the anatectic orogenic crust. Although it may play an important role in locally raising melt volumes and modifying magma chemistry through mingling and hybridization, it does not appear to, of itself, be able to generate significant volumes of granitic melt.

AB  - Recent efforts to project vegetation responses to climatic warming have emphasized the tight linkages between climate and vegetation distribution. Here we provide several examples indicating that the direct effects of climatic warming on boreal vegetation can be qualitatively different than the indirect effects mediated by climatic responses of herbivores. These herbivore-mediated vegetation responses to climatic warming will likely vary regionally. In southern Fennoscandia, we project that the climatically induced changes in animal populations should enhance the density of spruce at the expense of pine and broadleafed trees. In northern Fennoscandia we project reduced herbivory on broadleafed trees and increased herbivory on pine, leading to an increase in broadleafed trees and spruce and a reduction in pine. Climatic warming in interior Alaska may reduce herbivory on broadleafed trees and increase herbivory on evergreen spruce, thus reinforcing the impact of increased fire frequency.

VL  - 7
IS  - 17
SP  - 6680-6690
AB  - Temperature-based degree-day models describe insect seasonality and to predict key phenological events. We expand on the use of a temperature-based process defining timing of reproduction through the incorporation of female reproductive physiology for the invasive pentatomid species Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug. A five-stage ranking system based on ovary development was able to distinguish between the reproductive statuses of field-collected females. Application of this ranking method described aspects of H.halys' seasonality, overwintering biology, and phenology across geographic locations. Female H.halys were collected in the US from NJ, WV, NC, OR, and two sites in PA in 2006-2008 (Allentown, PA only) and 2012-2014. Results identify that H.halys enters reproductive diapause in temperate locations in the fall and that a delay occurs in developmental maturity after diapause termination in the spring. Modification of the Snyder method to identify biofix determined 12.7-hr photoperiod as the best fit to define initiation of reproduction in the spring. Applying the biofix, we demonstrated significant differences between locations for the rate at which the overwintering generation transition into reproductive status and the factors contributing to this difference require further study. For example, after including abiotic variables influencing development such as temperature and photoperiod (critical diapause cue), reproduction occurred earlier in OR and for an extended period in NJ. This data describe a method to investigate insect seasonality by incorporating physiological development across multiple regions that can clarify phenology for insects with overlapping generations.

TI  - Using an inverse modelling approach with equifinality control to investigate the dominant controls on snowmelt nutrient export
VL  - 33
IS  - 23
SP  - 2958-2977
AB  - There is great interest in modelling the export of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields because of ongoing challenges of eutrophication. However, the use of existing hydrochemistry models can be problematic in cold regions because models frequently employ incomplete or conceptually incorrect representations of the dominant cold regions hydrological processes and are overparameterized, often with insufficient data for validation. Here, a process-based N model, WINTRA, which is coupled to a physically based cold regions hydrological model, was expanded to simulate P and account for overwinter soil nutrient biochemical cycling. An inverse modelling approach, using this model with consideration of parameter equifinality, was applied to an intensively monitored agricultural basin in Manitoba, Canada, to help identify the main climate, soil, and anthropogenic controls on nutrient export. Consistent with observations, the model results suggest that snow water equivalent, melt rate, snow cover depletion rate, and contributing area for run-off generation determine the opportunity time and surface area for run-off-soil interaction. These physical controls have not been addressed in existing models. Results also show that the time lag between the start of snowmelt and the arrival of peak nutrient concentration in run-off increased with decreasing antecedent soil moisture content, highlighting potential implications of frozen soils on run-off processes and hydrochemistry. The simulations showed TDP concentration peaks generally arriving earlier than NO3 but also decreasing faster afterwards, which suggests a significant contribution of plant residue Total dissolved Phosphorus (TDP) to early snowmelt run-off. Antecedent fall tillage and fertilizer application increased TDP concentrations in spring snowmelt run-off but did not consistently affect NO3 run-off. In this case, the antecedent soil moisture content seemed to have had a dominant effect on overwinter soil N biogeochemical processes such as mineralization, which are often ignored in models. This work demonstrates both the need for better representation of cold regions processes in hydrochemical models and the model improvements that are possible if these are included.

VL  - 23

SP  - 421-434
AB  - Aim There is mounting concern that climate change will lead to the collapse of cyclic population dynamics, yet the influence of climate variability on population cycling remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that variability in survival and fecundity, driven by climate variability at different points in the life cycle, scales up from local populations to drive regional characteristics of population cycling and spatial synchronization. Location Forest in the US Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. Methods We tested hypotheses linking variation in vital rates of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus), a declining species that displays decadal population cycles, to temperature and precipitation anomalies and land use intensity, using rate estimates from multiple locations in eastern North America. We used climatedemographic linkages to simulate spatially explicit population dynamics from 1982 to 2069, evaluated predictions against monitoring data and assessed predicted population dynamics under future climate projections. Results Nest success and winter survival were linked to temperature and precipitation anomalies, and demographic models explained important spatiotemporal characteristics of cycling and synchrony in monitoring data. The climate-driven vital rates were necessary for cycling and synchrony in models, even though the four included climate variables were not individually periodic. Cycling and synchrony were stronger at more northerly latitudes, but this transition occurred abruptly, reflecting regional variation in winter conditions. Forecasts suggested climate-driven cycling through mid-century, followed by desynchronization and dampening. Main conclusions Climate variability can drive spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates, and population cycling can result from these relationships. Pathways linking climate to broad-scale population dynamics involve responses of vital rates to several climate variables at different times of year and may be more complex than direct responses to known modes of climate variability. The wide-ranging impact of climate change on the demographics of northerly adapted species has the potential to degrade patterns of population synchrony and cycling.

SP  - 458-467
AB  - Development of thermostable phytases through biotechnology is a key issue in food and feed industry. Phytases ought to be stable at elevated temperatures since it has to withstand feed and food processing steps. Thermostable catalysts have been an area of extensive research since long and several studies have focused on understanding the critical structural features contributing to their stability curve. Recently, the explosion of high resolution structure and availability of sequence information of stable phytases have enforced the researchers to implement similar strategies successfully to bring together these desirable traits into a single enzyme. Nature has tailored unique stabilizing features in diverse classes of phytase, understanding these critical elements and using a single or combination of potential in vitro evolutionary strategies would help phytase to reach the fitness peak in near future. Here we review some recent studies on structural elements contributing to thermostability in phytases of different microbial sources and to summarize the beneficial effect of diverse criterion taken up to generate optimized phytase.

TI  - Assessment of NOAA National Weather Service Methods to Warn for Extreme Heat Events

AB  - Recent climate studies have predicted a future with longer, more intense, and more frequent heat events. Evolving challenges presented by this paradigm necessitate an assessment of current efforts to warn for extreme heat events. NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) issue Excessive Heat Watch, Excessive Heat Warning, and Heat Advisory products as conditions warrant. In the fall of 2013 the NWS conducted an internal assessment with its WFOs to 1) document variations in the usage of heat-based watch, warning, and advisory hazard messages (products) across the country; 2) learn about the degree to which locally developed criteria are applied to forecaster decision-making processes in issuing these products; and 3) gather ideas for enhancing communication of expected excessive heat events in general. Survey responses indicate that WFOs selectively use one or a combination of products, and that various methodologies are used to develop criteria for issuing heat products. Given that forecasters use meteorological and nonmeteorological factors when deciding to issue heat products, forecaster judgment is a crucial element of the warning process. Results also revealed partner confusion due to inconsistent heat product issuance criteria. Suggestions were made for eliminating or revising existing products and policies, or creating new products, policies, or issuance criteria. Results of the survey led the NWS to investigate approaches for achieving higher levels of consistency in heat product issuance criteria, and to engage health partners to examine how heat product issuance criteria could incorporate the known health impacts of heat exposure.

SP  - 87-105
AB  - Freezing and dehydration are two common food preservation processes, which, in part, function through the modification of the aqueous environment within the food. In both processes, the mobile aqueous phase becomes more concentrated either as freezing progresses, and more ice is formed, or as dehydration progresses, and more water is removed. The roles of concentration and temperature in the evolution of the various stresses experienced by frozen and dehydrated systems are compared, and the additional influence of the presence of ice in frozen systems is examined. The mechanisms of the stresses, the results of the stress, and means to minimize these effects are discussed. Factors considered include osmotic stress, ionic strength effects, volumetric stresses, the influence of phase changes, and the roles of non-ionic and polymeric solutes. These factors are discussed both in terms of model systems, and in terms of a variety of food systems preserved by freezing or by dehydration, and the maintenance of viability in biological systems subjected to freezing or dehydration stresses.

TI  - Low Temperature Plasma: A Novel Focal Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer?
VL  - 2014
AB  - Despite considerable advances in recent years for the focal treatment of localized prostate cancer, high recurrence rates and detrimental side effects are still a cause for concern. In this review, we compare current focal therapies to a potentially novel approach for the treatment of early onset prostate cancer: low temperature plasma. The rapidly evolving plasma technology has the potential to deliver a wide range of promising medical applications via the delivery of plasma-induced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Studies assessing the effect of low temperature plasma on cell lines and xenografts have demonstrated DNA damage leading to apoptosis and reduction in cell viability. However, there have been no studies on prostate cancer, which is an obvious candidate for this novel therapy. We present here the potential of low temperature plasma as a focal therapy for prostate cancer.

TI  - TIP CLEARANCE CONTROL CONCEPT IN GAS TURBINE HP COMPRESSORS
SP  - 433-441
AB  - To improve the thermodynamic efficiency of aircraft engine and other gas turbine engines, higher and higher pressure ratios are desired in conjunction with more refined engine cycles. In the high pressure compressor, higher pressure ratios result in lower aspect blades and enhanced sensitivity of the engine design to radial clearance effects. The tip clearance in the axial flow compressor of modern commercial civil aero-engines is of critical importance in terms of both mechanical integrity and performance. Typically as the clearance between the compressor blade tips and the casing increases, the aerodynamic efficiency will decrease and therefore the specific fuel consumption and operating costs will increase, and the clearance is therefore of critical importance to civil airline operators and their customers alike. A design exercise was performed and a series of conceptual solutions were developed using the theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) process and their potential viability in clearance control was investigated with thermal modelling. TRIZ was selected as an appropriate tool as the issue was long-standing having been the focus of previous projects, and robust design solutions were being sought. In order to validate the concepts, use was made of a test facility developed at the University of Sussex, incorporating a rotor and an inner shaft scaled down from a Rolls Royce Trent aero-engine to a ratio of 0.7:1. The mechanical design of the test facility allows the simulation of flow conditions in the HP compressor cavity equivalent to the Trent 1000 aero-engine, with a rotational speed of up to 10000 rpm. The idle and maximum take-off conditions in the square cycle correspond to in-cavity rotational Reynolds numbers of 3.1 x 10(6) <= Re-phi <= 1.0 x 10(7). The finite element thermomechanical model has been built to validate the engine measurements. This paper describes the use of TRIZ and the development of a selected concept and the detailed evaluation for reduction and control of tip clearance in HP compressors. This was achieved through the reduction in the compressor disc heat expansion time constant by improving drum heat transfer using bleed air from the compressor core flow. This paper explores the trade-offs between clearance and efficiency and develops and explores concepts to control the compressor tip clearance throughout the engine operating cycle. The project involved modelling of potential solutions and use of experimental facilities, a rotating compressor cavity rig, in order to explore the physical principles and demonstrate proof of concept for controlling tip clearance in HP compressors of gas turbine engines.

TI  - Novel Evidence Showing the Possible Effect of Environmental Variables on COVID-19 Spread
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remains a serious issue, and the role played by meteorological indicators in the process of virus spread has been a topic of academic discussion. Previous studies reached different conclusions due to inconsistent methods, disparate meteorological indicators, and specific time periods or regions. This manuscript is based on seven daily meteorological indicators in the NCEP reanalysis data set and COVID-19 data repository of Johns Hopkins University from 22 January 2020 to 1 June 2021. Results showed that worldwide average temperature and precipitable water (PW) had the strongest correlation (p > 0.9, p < 0.001) with the confirmed COVID-19 cases per day from 22 January to 31 August 2020. From 22 January to 31 August 2020, positive correlations were observed between the temperature/ PW and confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths in the northern hemisphere, whereas negative correlations were recorded in the southern hemisphere. From 1 September to 31 December 2020, the opposite results were observed. Correlations were weak throughout the near full year, and weak negative correlations were detected worldwide (vertical bar rho vertical bar < 0.4, p <= 0.05); the lag time had no obvious effect. As the latitude increased, the temperature and PW of the maximum confirmed COVID-19 cases/deaths per day generally showed a decreasing trend; the 2020-year fitting functions of the response latitude pattern were verified by the 2021 data. Meteorological indicators, although not a decisive factor, may influence the virus spread by affecting the virus survival rates and enthusiasm of human activities. The temperature or PW threshold suitable for the spread of COVID-19 may increase as the latitude decreases. Plain Language Summary Climate change has altered life's living environment; humans seem to be able to adapt to climate change within a certain range. This adaptability seems to be human talent, but how about a coronavirus? The impact of environmental variables on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread varies between regions. The two meteorological variables that are most likely to affect the distribution of COVID-19 have significant latitude patterns, which means that in areas with higher climate temperatures, the temperature range for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is higher, while in areas with lower climate temperatures, the temperature for the maximum spread of COVID-19 is lower. Perhaps it indicates that the virus also has the ability to adapt to climate change, even more so than humanity. The complete cessation of COVID-19 pandemic requires everyone's efforts.

TI  - Inducible variation in anaerobic energy metabolism reflects hypoxia tolerance across the intertidal and subtidal distribution of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)
VL  - 138
SP  - 135-143
AB  - Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) distribute a steep gradient of environmental stress between intertidal and subtidal habits and provide insight into population-scale patterns and underlying processes of variation in physiological tolerance. In this study, 1-year-old-F-1 oysters, collected from subtidal and intertidal habitats, were obtained after common garden experiment. Genetic differentiation and physiological responses under air exposure were examined to determine whether they had evolved into local adapted subpopulations. Mortality rate, anaerobic glycolysis metabolism, and energy status indicated that oyster had initiated metabolism depression and anaerobic glycolysis metabolism in both intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure. However, the subtidal oysters displayed the larger energy metabolism depressions and the earlier anaerobic glycolysis responses. This may indicate that subtidal oysters were more sensitives to hypoxia stress, which may lead the higher mortality rate under long term of air exposure. Based on a common garden experimental design, we propose that this diversification may have a genetic background. Overall, the clear differences between intertidal and subtidal oysters under air exposure have provided an important reference for their aquaculture and transportation used in commercial production.

TI  - The rise and fall of an alien: why the successful colonizer Littorina saxatilis failed to invade the Mediterranean Sea
VL  - 24
IS  - 10
SP  - 3169-3187
AB  - Understanding what determines range expansion or extinction is crucial to predict the success of biological invaders. We tackled this longstanding question from an unparalleled perspective using the failed expansions in Littorina saxatilis and investigated its present and past habitat suitability in Europe through Ecological Niche Modelling. This intertidal snail is a typically successful Atlantic colonizer and the earliest confirmed alien species in the Mediterranean Sea, where, however, it failed to thrive despite its high dispersal ability and adaptability. We explored the environmental constraints affecting its biogeography, identified potential glacial refugia in Europe that fuelled its post-glacial colonisations and tested whether the current gaps in its distribution are linked to local ecological features. Our results suggested that L. saxatilis is unlikely to be a glacial relict in the Mediterranean basin. Multiple Atlantic glacial refugia occurred in the Last Glacial Maximum, and abiotic environmental features such as salinity and water temperature have influenced the past and current distributions of this snail and limited its invasion of the Mediterranean Sea. The snail showed a significant overlap in geographic space and ecological niche with Carcinus maenas, the Atlantic predator, but distinct from Pachygrapsus marmoratus, the Mediterranean predator, further pointing to Atlantic-like habitat requirements for this species. Abiotic constrains during introduction rather than dispersal abilities have shaped the past and current range of L. saxatilis and help explaining why some invasions have not been successful. Our findings contribute to clarifying the processes constraining or facilitating shifts in species' distributions and biological invasions.

TI  - Homeostasis: An underestimated focal point of-ecology and evolution
VL  - 211
SP  - 92-101
AB  - Background: The concept of homeostasis is often ill-defined, in the scientific literature. The word "homeostasis", literally, indicates the absence of changes and an absolute maintenance of the status quo. The multiplicity of possible examples of homeostasis suggests that it is essentially impossible that all aspects of the composition of the organism and the rate of processes carried out by the organism are simultaneously held constant, when the environment changes are in the non-lethal range. Scope: In attempting to clarify the usage of the term homeostasis, I emphasize the probable contributions to evolutionary fitness of homeostasis main attributes: rate processes and compositions. I also attempted to identify the aspects of homeostasis that are most likely to be subject to natural selection. Conclusions: The tendency to retain the status quo derives from the interplay of functions (among which growth), metabolic pools and elemental stoichiometry. The set points around which oscillations occur in biological system and their control mechanisms are determined by evolutionary processes; consequently, also the tendency of a cell to be homeostatic with respect to a given set point is selectable. A homeostatic response to external perturbations may be selectively favored when the potential reproductive advantage offered by a reorganization of cell resources cannot be exploited. This is most likely to occur in the case of environmental perturbations of moderate intensity and short duration relative to the growth rate. Under these circumstances, homeostasis may be an energetically and competitively preferable option, because it requires no alteration of the expressed proteome and eliminates the requirement for reverse acclimation, upon cessation of the perturbation. This review also intends to be a stimulus to "ad hoc" experiments to assess the ecological and evolutionary relevance of homeostasis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of Scrotal Temperature in Different Testicular Shapes by Infrared Thermography in Braford Bulls
VL  - 47
AB  - Background: The mechanisms of testicular thermoregulation may influence the blood flow provided by the testicular artery, where the proper blood supply to the testicle is crucial for promotingspermatogenesis and reproductive function in bulls. The size and shape of the testicles are determined by genetic mechanisms and environmental effects. A better understanding of the relationships between the anatomical characteristics of the testicles and scrotum can support a better reproductive assessment. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the testicular temperature of different scrotal shapes using infrared thermography in bulls. Materials, Methods & Results: We evaluated 132 Braford bulls with an average age of 24 months. The evaluation of breeding bull semen was performed prior to the beginning of the experiment. Then, animals were selected on the basis of the size of their testes, which was determined by dividing the average width by the average length. The scrotal circumference was measured with a millimeter tape positioned around the largest circumference. Testicular and ocular temperature measurements and analysis were conducted using an infrared thermal camera, Flir T440 with emissivity of 0.98 and thermal sensitivity of 0.05 degrees C. Testicular scrotum temperature and testicular shape were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Minitab 16, and values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. We observed that 67.42% of testicle shapes were long-oval, and 32.58% were long-moderate. The testicular temperature was higher in bulls with the long-moderate shape compared to those with the long-oval shape (P < 0.05). The mean length was higher in long-moderate shaped testicles compared to those of the long-oval shape (P < 0.01). There was no significant differences in rectal and ocular temperatures or in scrotal circumference between bulls with long-moderate and long-oval shapes (P > 0.05). In addition, the mean width was lower in testicles of long-moderate shape compared to those of the long-oval scrotal format (P < 0.01). Discussion: The results obtained showed that Braford bulls with the long-moderate testicular shape have a higher testicular temperature to maintain proper thermoregulation. The present study demonstrated that IRT can be used to evaluate the testicular temperature in animals with different scrotal conformations. In this study, Braford bulls showed lower length and width values for animals having long-moderate (9.21 and 5.22, respectively) and long-oval formats (8.56 and 5.56, respectively). In contrast, previous reports examining Nellore bulls between the ages of 17-20 months found a predominance of the long oval shape followed by the long-moderate shape, which indicates a change in testicular shape as age progresses, resulting in a rounder testicular shape. Perhaps other factors, such as the external cremaster muscle and tunica dartos, cause the testicles to be retracted towards the body at lower temperatures while at high temperatures, relaxation occurs. The prevailing testicular shape in Braford animals with a mean age of 24 months was the long-moderate shape. Thus, testicles with a larger surface area will have lower temperatures because they can dissipate heat more easily than testicles with lower surface area. The results suggest that the long-moderate scrotum format may influence the testicular temperature in mature Braford bulls.

VL  - 76
IS  - 8
SP  - 1703-1711
AB  - Snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus) populations have declined throughout their range, in part because of habitat degradation and poor nest success, making information regarding regionally specific nest site selection and spatial patterns important when considering habitat conservation and management guidelines. We determined nest site selection characteristics (n?=?180) and examined spatial patterns (n?=?215) of snowy plover nests in saline lakes in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. At 104 nests, we examined the influence of substrate type on nest temperatures and heat mitigation. Snowy plover nests were more likely to be found near an object, on pebble substrate, and with fewer plants than random sites. High use areas were generally located in areas with pebble substrate and on human-made or natural islands, berms, and peninsulas. Overall, nests placed on pebble substrate had lower temperatures during the day than nests placed on sand substrates. Nest placement on pebble substrate may be valuable to nesting snowy plovers, providing thermal advantages to incubating adults and depressing potentially high nest predation rates. Management guidelines for this region should emphasize the importance of addressing key elements of snowy plover nesting habitat including the presence of pebble substrate and reducing vegetation encroachment.

VL  - 26

SP  - 1397-1406
AB  - Today, the agriculture industry has been developing intellectualization and automation proactively for reducing labor force and increase yields. In the past, farmers usually followed the rule of thumb to grow crops; however, due to the dramatic climate change, it becomes harder for farmers to cope with it by merely following the rule of thumb, which leads to crop damage. Therefore, it is vital to input scientific data development and technology for optimizing the environment parameters of crops and further enhance the yields. Additionally, many farms need to spread pesticides to avoid pests and diseases; yet, too much pesticide may cause soil alkalization. To enrich the growing-power of the lands, farmers will fertilize the lands; nevertheless, too much of it will also cause soil acidification, which will need to leave the land fallow to improve the soil quality. The study provides an intelligent agriculture system based on LSTM. The system develops an Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor the environmental conditions of soil, sunlight, and temperature; additionally, the research combines the information from the Central Weather Bureau for predicting the timing for watering and notifying farmers about the suggested amount of pesticides and fertilizers. The features of this article are as follows: 1. Build a clustering tree of crops according to the adaptability; 2. Calculate the critical values of each selected crop; 3. Develop an LSTM system that provides analyses according to the current soil conditions and weather forecast information; the system will reveal the conditions of the soil, and water the land to balance the condition and reach an optimal status if the soil pH is too high. The research is capable of enhancing crop yields and optimizing the land.

TI  - Th-U breeding performance in a Channel-type molten salt Fast reactor with different starting fuels
VL  - 122
SP  - 91-100
AB  - A Channel-type Molten Salt Fast Reactor (CMSFR) concept is studied to improve the Th-U breeding performance and to reduce the loss ratio of effective delayed neutron fraction (beta(eff)). In the CMSFR, fuel salt is filled in the active zone of the cylindrical core for fission heat generation, while fertile salt is contained in SiC tubes distributed regularly in the core for U-233 breeding and for transferring fission heat from the fuel salt to the secondary loop. To enhance the neutron capture reaction rate of Th-232, both radial and axial Th fertile blankets are adopted. Only a small part of fuel salt in the reprocessing system is adopted for fission products removing and refueling, which reduces significantly the required initial loading of fuel salt compared with a conventional Molten Salt Reactor (MSR). Based on an in-house developed analysis code for reprocessing system of MSR, the Th-U breeding capability of CMSFR with different molten salt reprocessing rates (from 101 per day to 50 1 per day) is simulated for a 50-year operation. The simulated results show that the doubling time of U-233 with U-233 as starting fuel shortens significantly to about 37 years compared with the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR). Furthermore, the Th-U breeding capability with Pu, TRU and Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) as starting fuels is also analyzed. The simulated results indicate that the doubling time of U-233 with Pu and TRU as starting fuels is shortened to 22 years and 17 years, respectively. It indicates that both Pu and TRU can be employed for a transition approach to Th-U fuel cycle. The largest molar proportion of Pu with TRU as starting fuel during operation is about 7.1 mol% which is under the Pu solubility limit. Although the Th-U-233 breeding with LEU as starting fuel can also be achieved at the end of life of operation, it needs external U-233 supply (about 0.6 tons) during the first 20 years operation. Both Temperature Reactivity feedback Coefficient (TRC) and beta(eff) for all the starting scenarios are also investigated. The TRC for all the starting scenarios is always negative enough during 50-year operation. The total loss ratio of beta(eff) with U-233, LEU and Pu/TRU as starting fuels is only 13.76%, 13.47% and 13.56%, respectively, which is much smaller than that of the MSFR. Considering the limitation of reactor period T > 15 s, the largest introduced reactivity for U-233, LEU or Pu/TRU as starting fuel shall not be greater than 110 pcm, 202 pcm and 103 pcm, respectively.

VL  - 63

SP  - 77-83
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that viruses play an influential role within the marine microbial food web. To understand this role, it is important to determine rates and mechanisms of virus removal and degradation, We used plaque assays to examine the decay of infectivity in lab-grown viruses seeded into natural seawater. The rates of loss of infectivity of native viruses from Santa Monica Bay and of nonnative viruses from the North Sea in the coastal seawater of Santa Monica Bay were determined. Viruses were seeded into fresh seawater that had been pretreated in various ways: filtration with a 0.2-mu m-pore-size filter to remove organisms, heat to denature enzymes, and dissolved organic matter enrichment to reconstitute enzyme activity, Seawater samples were then incubated in full sunlight, in the dark, or under glass to allow partitioning of causative agents of virus decay, Solar radiation always resulted in increased rates of loss of virus infectivity, Virus isolates which are native to Santa Monica Bay consistently degraded more slowly in full sunlight in untreated seawater (decay ranged from 4.1 to 7.2% h(-1)) than nonnative marine bacteriophages which were isolated from the North Sea (decay ranged from 6.6 to 11.1% h(-1)). All phages demonstrated susceptibility to degradation by heat-labile substances, as heat treatment reduced the decay rates to about 0.5 to 2.0% h(-1) in the dark, Filtration reduced decay rates by various amounts, averaging 20%. Heat-labile, high-molecular-weight dissolved material (>30 kDa, probably enzymes) appeared responsible for about 1/5 of the maximal decay, Solar radiation was responsible for about 1/3 to 2/3 of the maximal decay of nonnative viruses and about 1/4 to 1/3 of that of the native viruses, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to local light levels. Our results suggest that sunlight is an important contributing factor to virus decay but also point to the significance of particles and dissolved substances in seawater.

TI  - First insight into the heritable variation and potential response to selection of phototaxis and locomotion behavior associated to the light/dark stimuli in the abalone Haliotis discus hannai
VL  - 500
SP  - 645-650
AB  - Abalones are especially susceptible to environmental lighting conditions. This factor greatly affects crucial biological process such as feeding rates, energy balance, physiological stress status, and consequently, growth and survival of farmed abalone. Most of these effects have been studied in the economically valuable abalone Haliotis discus hannai. The use of specific photoperiods, and/or light qualifies and intensifies, have been proposed as managing strategies to increase its production; however, for extensive off-shore or in intensive land-based farming systems, lighting conditions are not likely to be easily managed. Despite the great importance of the biological responses to the light/dark stimuli for abalone farming production, to the best of our knowledge the genetic control upon the variation associated behavioral traits have not been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the heritable variation and potential responses to selection for the phototaxis [i.e., displacement towards (positive) or against (negative) the light source] and locomotion behaviors associated to the intensity of the response (i.e., crawling speed and displacement distance) to the light/dark stimuli in juvenile H. discus hannai. Genetic and phenotypic correlations between these traits were also estimated. Results showed moderate but significant heritable variations for phototaxis (h(2) = 0.15) and locomotion responses (h(2) = 0.18-0.37); and significant positive genetic correlations among them. Expected gain responses to selection per generation (with a selection intensity of 2.06, i.e., selecting 5% of the individuals from a population) were moderate for phototaxis variation (16%) and high for locomotion responses variation (33-67 or 36-73%, depending on the model used for the estimations). As a consequence, the potential for reducing (or incrementing, depending on the breeding goal) the reactivity or the sensibility to the light stimulus by selective breeding is good, and can be an attractive way of indirectly improving growth, survival and general welfare of farmed H. discus hannai.

TI  - Trace element partitioning between garnet lherzolite and carbonatite at 6.6 and 8.6 GPa with applications to the geochemistry of the mantle and of mantle-derived melts
VL  - 262
IS  - 1
SP  - 57-77
AB  - We present experimental determinations of trace element partitioning between natural fertile lherzolite and near-solidus carbonatitic liquid (cbL) at pressures of 6.6 and 8.6 GPa and temperatures between 1265 and 1470 degrees C, conditions relevant for initial generation Of CO2-rich melt beneath oceanic ridges and for carbonate melt percolation in the deep source regions of ocean island basalts. Compared to previous experiments at lower pressures, which produced more aluminous cpx, our experimental cpx-melt pairs show lower partition coefficients for trivalent cations entering the M2 site (D-Lu(cpx/cbL) = 0.17, D-La(cpx/cbL) = 0.006). D-U(cpx/cbL) (0.002) and D-Th(cpx/cbL) (0.001) also are distinctly lower than previous estimates. The garnet-carbonate melt partition coefficients for REE vary from highly incompatible La to moderately compatible Lu and are slightly lower than those from lower pressure experiments. From 6.6 to 8.6 GPa, HFSEs including Zr, Hf, and Ti range from moderately incompatible to slightly compatible, with D-Hf(gamet/cbL) > D-Ti(gamet/cbL) > D-Zr(gamet/cbL). U and Th remain highly incompatible in garnet at both pressures with D-U(gamet/cbL)/D-Th(gamet/cbL) of 1.2-1.25 at 6.6 GPa and 1.35 at 8.6 GPa. Estimates of D-gtlherzolite/cbL, based on our newly measured partition coefficients, suggest that 30-60% of some of the highly incompatible elements can be removed by efficient extraction of 0.1% carbonatitic melt from the Earth's deep upper mantle, and that 0.1% C-rich melt extraction can create a residue that has Rb/Sr, U/Pb and Th/U ratios, respectively, 29, 12, and 6% lower and Sm/Nd ratio similar to 11% higher than the unmelted source. Our data also suggest that ancient carbonate melt extraction and metasomatism can decouple the Hf and Nd isotope systems. Garnet lherzolite derived carbonatitic melt has lower normalized HREEs and smaller Nb/Ta ratios than erupted natural carbonatites. Therefore, the trace element abundances of erupted carbonatites require either reaction with a shallower mantle peridotite with low modal garnet or derivation from an enriched source. The trace element abundances of deep carbonate-rich melts must become diluted by greater volumes of silicate melt produced in the shallower portions of sub-ridge basalt source regions. But, the observed Th-230 and Pa-231 excesses and variations Of CO2/Nb in erupted MORBs are a likely consequence of variable contributions of carbonate-rich melt. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Potential ecological impacts of climate intervention by reflecting sunlight to cool Earth
VL  - 118
IS  - 15
AB  - As the effects of anthropogenic climate change become more severe, several approaches for deliberate climate intervention to reduce or stabilize Earth's surface temperature have been proposed. Solar radiation modification (SRM) is one potential approach to partially counteract anthropogenic warming by reflecting a small proportion of the incoming solar radiation to increase Earth's albedo. While climate science research has focused on the predicted climate effects of SRM, almost no studies have investigated the impacts that SRM would have on ecological systems. The impacts and risks posed by SRM would vary by implementation scenario, anthropogenic climate effects, geographic region, and by ecosystem, community, population, and organism. Complex interactions among Earth's climate system and living systems would further affect SRM impacts and risks. We focus here on stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI), a well-studied and relatively feasible SRM scheme that is likely to have a large impact on Earth's surface temperature. We outline current gaps in knowledge about both helpful and harmful predicted effects of SAI on ecological systems. Desired ecological outcomes might also inform development of future SAI implementation scenarios. In addition to filling these knowledge gaps, increased collaboration between ecologists and climate scientists would identify a common set of SAI research goals and improve the communication about potential SAI impacts and risks with the public. Without this collaboration, forecasts of SAI impacts will overlook potential effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services for humanity.

TI  - Host Range Expansion of Shigella Phage Sf6 Evolves through Point Mutations in the Tailspike
VL  - 96
IS  - 16
AB  - The first critical step in a virus's infection cycle is attachment to its host. This interaction is precise enough to ensure the virus will be able to productively infect the cell, but some flexibility can be beneficial to enable coevolution and host range switching or expansion. Bacteriophage Sf6 utilizes a two-step process to recognize and attach to its host Shigella flexneri. Sf6 first recognizes the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of S. flexneri and then binds outer membrane protein (Omp) A or OmpC. This phage infects serotype Y strains but can also form small, turbid plaques on serotype 2a(2); turbid plaques appear translucent rather than transparent, indicating greater survival of bacteria. Reduced plating efficiency further suggested inefficient infection. To examine the interactions between Sf6 and this alternate host, phages were experimentally evolved using mixed populations of S. flexneri serotypes Y and 2a(2). The recovered mutants could infect serotype 2a(2) with greater efficiency than the ancestral Sf6, forming clear plaques on both serotypes. All mutations mapped to two distinct regions of the receptor-binding tailspike protein: (i) adjacent to the LPS binding site near the N terminus; and (ii) at the distal, C-terminal tip of the protein. Although we anticipated interactions between the Sf6 tailspike and 2a(2) O-antigen to be weak, LPS of this serotype appears to inhibit infection through strong binding of particles, effectively removing them from the environment. The mutations of the evolved strains reduce the inhibitory effect by either reducing electrostatic interactions with the O-antigen or increasing reliance on the Omp secondary receptors. IMPORTANCE Viruses depend on host cells to propagate themselves. In mixed populations and communities of host cells, finding these susceptible host cells may have to be balanced with avoiding nonhost cells. Alternatively, being able to infect new cell types can increase the fitness of the virus. Many bacterial viruses use a two-step process to identify their hosts, binding first to an LPS receptor and then to a host protein. For Shigella virus Sf6, the tailspike protein was previously known to bind the LPS receptor. Genetic data from this work imply the tailspike also binds to the protein receptor. By experimentally evolving Sf6, we also show that point mutations in this protein can dramatically affect the binding of one or both receptors. This may provide Sf6 flexibility in identifying host cells and the ability to rapidly alter its host range under selective pressure. Viruses depend on host cells to propagate themselves. In mixed populations and communities of host cells, finding these susceptible host cells may have to be balanced with avoiding nonhost cells.

VL  - 29

SP  - 76-84
AB  - This article provides a review of the possibility of using different types of reactors to power ships. The analyses were carried out for three different large vessels: a container ship, a liquid gas carrier and a bulk carrier. A novelty of this work is the analysis of the proposal to adapt marine power plants to ecological requirements in shipping by replacing the conventional propulsion system based on internal combustion engines with nuclear propulsion. The subjects of comparison are primarily the dimensions of the most important devices of the nuclear power plant and the preliminary fitness analysis. It was assumed for this purpose that the nuclear power plant fits in the engine room compartment and uses the space left after the removal of the combustion engines. At the same time, this propulsion provides at all times sufficient energy for port, technological and shipping operations at an economically justifiable speed. For deep-sea vessels, which are supposed to reach null emissions of CO, CO2, NOx, SOx and H2O, this is one of the most reasonable solutions. Finally the paper proves that all the above-mentioned marine functions could be effectively applied in power plants equipped with 4th generation nuclear reactors.

VL  - 1819
IS  - 2
SP  - 176-185
AB  - Plants have developed intricate mechanisms involving gene regulatory systems to adjust to stresses. Phenotypic variation in plants under stress is classically attributed to DNA sequence variants. More recently, it was found that epigenetic modifications - DNA methylation-, chromatin- and small RNA-based mechanisms can contribute separately or together to phenotypes by regulating gene expression in response to the stress effect. These epigenetic modifications constitute an additional layer of complexity to heritable phenotypic variation and the evolutionary potential of natural plant populations because they can affect fitness. Natural populations can show differences in performance when they are exposed to changes in environmental conditions, partly because of their genetic variation but also because of their epigenetic variation. The line between these two components is blurred because little is known about the contribution of genotypes and epigenotypes to stress tolerance in natural populations. Recent insights in this field have just begun to shed light on the behavior of genetic and epigenetic variation in natural plant populations under biotic and abiotic stresses.

TI  - Transmembrane Prolines Mediate Signal Sensing and Decoding in Bacillus subtilis DesK Histidine Kinase
VL  - 10
IS  - 6
AB  - Environmental awareness is an essential attribute of all organisms. The homeoviscous adaptation system of Bacillus subtilis provides a powerful experimental model for the investigation of stimulus detection and signaling mechanisms at the molecular level. These bacteria sense the order of membrane lipids with the transmembrane (TM) protein DesK, which has an N-terminal sensor domain and an intracellular catalytic effector domain. DesK exhibits autokinase activity as well as phosphotransferase and phosphatase activities toward a cognate response regulator, DesR, that controls the expression of an enzyme that remodels membrane fluidity when the temperature drops below similar to 30 degrees C. Membrane fluidity signals are transmitted from the DesK sensor domain to the effector domain via rotational movements of a connecting 2-helix coiled coil (2-HCC). Previous molecular dynamic simulations suggested important roles for TM prolines in transducing the initial signals of membrane fluidity status to the 2-HCC. Here, we report that individual replacement of prolines in DesKs TM1 and TM5 helices by alanine (DesKPA) locked DesK in a phosphatase-ON state, abrogating membrane fluidity responses. An unbiased mutagenic screen identified the L174P replacement in the internal side of the repeated heptad of the 2-HCC structure that alleviated the signaling defects of every transmembrane DesKPA substitution. Moreover, substitutions by proline in other internal positions of the 2-HCC reestablished the kinase-ON state of the DesKPA mutants. These results imply that TM prolines are essential for finely tuned signal generation by the N-terminal sensor helices, facilitating a conformational control by the metastable 2-HCC domain of the DesK signaling state.

TI  - Study of the phase transition in lysozyme crystals by Raman spectroscopy
VL  - 1860
IS  - 2
SP  - 412-423
AB  - Background: Recently, it has been revealed that tetragonal lysozyme crystals show a phase transition at 307 K upon heating. The underlying mechanisms of the phase transition are still not fully understood. Here we focus on the study of highfrequency vibrational modes arising from the protein and their temperature evolution in the vicinity of T-ph as well as on the detailed study of crystalline water dynamics near T-ph. Methods: Raman experiments have been performed at temperatures 295-323 K including T-ph. The lowfrequency modes and the modes of fingerprint region, CH-and OHstretching regions have been analyzed. Results and conclusions: In spite of the absence of noticeable rearrangements in protein structure, the high frequency vibrational modes of lysozyme located in the fingerprint region have been found to exhibit the features of critical dynamics near T-ph. Pronounced changes in the dynamics of ethelixes and Tyr residues exposed on the protein surface point to the important role of Hbond rearrangements at the phase transition. Additionally the study of temperature evolution of OHstretching modes has shown an increase in distortions of tertahedral Hbond network of crystalline water above T-ph. These changes in water dynamics could play a crucial role in the mechanisms of the phase transition. General significance: The present results shed light on the mechanisms of the phase transition in lysozyme crystals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fracture initiation during volume increasing reactions in rocks and applications for CO2 sequestration
VL  - 389
SP  - 132-142
AB  - Volume increasing processes in rocks can induce various types of fractures, such as hierarchical domain division of the unreacted material and spalling of the reacted material. The mechanism responsible for the selection of a particular fracture type is generally not known. We study such deformations and fracture mechanisms in a simplified system with a range of numerical techniques, and find that sharpness of reaction fronts and magnitude of volume increase are the main parameters controlling which fracture type forms. Spalling dominates when there is sharp reaction fronts and large magnitude of volume change, otherwise, we get mainly domain dividing fractures. Increasing reaction front sharpness and magnitude of volume change also increases the fracture density, and we argue that the change in fracture density can be important for the viability of in situ CO2 sequestration in ultramafic rock.

TI  - Improving bioenergy sustainability evaluations by using soil nitrogen balance coupled with life cycle assessment: A case study for electricity generated from rye biomass
VL  - 179
SP  - 847-863
AB  - The use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as an environmental tool to evaluate the sustainability of different bioenergy pathways has become a common practice since the European Renewable Energy Directive was published in 2009. In the evaluation of bioenergy produced out from dedicated energy crops, nitrogen fertilizer production and use are commonly identified as the most important contributors to fossil energy consumption and to several environmental impacts categories including Global Warming Potential. In considering the impacts produced by the nitrogen fertilization of energy crops and in addition to the effects of fertilization schemes on the biomass yield, more attention should be paid to the changes in soil nitrogen to know if fertilization doses and application schemes are sufficient enough to maintain soil nitrogen stocks and ensure that soil quality is preserved for future years. To this aim, in this work soil nitrogen balance is used as an indicator to estimate the evolution of soil nitrogen stocks and complement LCA calculations. In this paper, the effects of three nitrogen top fertilization doses (null, 30 and 80 kg NI (hay)) used for rye cultivation are compared when ry is grown as a dedicated energy crop for electricity generation under the Spanish province of Soria conditions. A LCA was carried out using experimental crop testing results and a centralised (25 MWe) straw power plant data in combination with soil nitrogen balance obtained in each of the experimental crop trials. After that, the LCA results were compared with those obtained when electricity is generated from natural gas in Spanish power plants. According to the average calculations, each additional kg N/(ha y) applied in top fertilization produces a reduction of 0.18% on GHG savings with respect to natural gas electricity, as well as a worsening in the energy balance of 0.00084 TJ fossil energy per TJ of electricity generated but reduces soil nitrogen deficit in 0.43 kg N/(ha y). For top fertilization doses of 80 kg N/(ha y) the average GHG savings with respect to natural gas were 63.7% and the average non-renewable energy consumption was 6, 4 times less for the bioenergy system than for natural gas. Fossil energy accounted for more than 95% of total nonrenewable energy in this calculation. This work evidences that determinate biomass growing conditions associated to high GHG savings and improved energy balances may cause detrimental effects for soil fertility due to considerable associated negative soil nitrogen balances. This finding suggests the convenience to include the soil nitrogen balance as a complementary indicator for bioenergy LCA calculations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wood ash use in forestry - a review of the environmental impacts
VL  - 79
IS  - 5
SP  - 563-588
AB  - The use of wood fuel for energy production in the UK is set to increase in the near future as part of a government commitment to increase renewable sources to 10 per cent by 2010. The ash generated as a by-product of combustion, whether for heat or power generation, has potential use as a fertilizer in forest systems. This review assesses the available information on factors affecting the quality of the ash and environmental implications arising from its application. The key determinants of wood ash chemistry are the tree species combusted, the nature of the burn process and the conditions at the application site. Wood ash from hardwood species produces higher levels of macronutrients in their ash than conifers, and the silica content is frequently lower. A furnace temperature between 500 and 900 degrees C is critical to the retention of nutrients, particularly potassium, and determines the concentrations of potentially toxic metals including aluminium in the ash. Fly ash, the lightest component that accumulates in the flue system, can contain high concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, lead and arsenic and this ash should not be used as fertilizer. The form of the ash at application is important, with loose ash releasing Ca, K and Na more rapidly than granulated ash. Heavy metal, radionuclide and dioxin contamination of wood ash-based fertilizers is minimal and unlikely to affect ecosystem function. The effects of wood ash are primarily governed by application rate and soil type. The benefits are maximized at low dose rates, with possible toxicity from applications in excess of 10 t ha(-1). For most forest sites, a single wood ash application per rotation could replace all the nutrients lost after whole-tree harvesting (excepting N). Long-lasting positive effects on tree growth have been observed on shallow peats, in which the humus is slowly mineralized in response to elevated pH and increased nutrient availability. In contrast, wood ash application to podzols is only effective in enhancing tree growth when nitrogen availability is non-limiting. To date, published research of wood ash effects on trees growing in clays and loams is minimal. A lag time for positive tree responses to wood ash application is often observed, and may be the result of phosphorous limitation at higher soil pH. The greatest reported adverse ecological effects are to acidophilic ecosystems, particularly the constituent bryophyte, soil bacteria and ectomycorrhizal communities.

TI  - Review: Potential of water buffalo in world agriculture: Challenges and opportunities
VL  - 35
IS  - 2
SP  - 255-268
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this review was to provide a summary of the current agriculture determinants of economically important traits, and solutions for challenges in water buffalo production to maximize benefits for both producers and consumers. Sources: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the current state of knowledge of water buffalo published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. The search revealed important progress in generation of knowledge about uses, economically important traits, challenges, and science-based solutions of water buffalo. Molecular determinants of key economically important traits such as longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat stress, and fertility are deciphered. Synthesis: Water buffalo are important sources of food and fiber for the ever-increasing global human population. Drought-adapted water buffalo provide meat, and highly nutritious milk used to make cream, butter, yogurt, and cheese. Despite valuable contributions to agriculture and human well-being, there are current and emerging challenges and opportunities. High resolution sequencing of breeds and comprehensive annotation of the genomes are not yet available. In addition, there is a lack of fundamental knowledge about economically important traits including longevity, disease resistance, milk production and quality, meat production and quality, growth and development, heat tolerance, and fertility. With the advances in both basic science and technology, the gaps in the knowledge in these areas can be tackled with innovative research and systems biology approaches. In addition, the power of comparative animal and functional genomics can be harnessed to fill in the gaps. The core elements of sustainable solutions include education, innovative, transformative and translational research, and technology transfer. Conclusions and Applications: Knowledge about the fundamental biology of water buffalo gives the power to improve sustainable, efficient, and profitable production. Although a considerable amount of information is available, providing new knowledge about the economically important traits will enable precision farming in water buffalo agriculture. New data and knowledge generated through the genome to phenome will uncover essential molecular, cellular, and physiological markers for marker-assisted selection and breeding to enhance the efficiency of reproduction and production as well as product quality. Future studies using systems physiology approaches will advance the science and technology for water buffalo. These new frontiers are important for empowering the next generation of animal scientists and the public as well as for food security on the global scale.

TI  - Climatic and environmental changes across the early Eocene climatic optimum at mid-Waipara River, Canterbury Basin, New Zealand
VL  - 200
AB  - The Cretaceous Paleogene marine sedimentary succession exposed in the banks of the middle reaches of the Waipara River (referred to as mid-Waipara), north Canterbury, New Zealand, has been the subject of several high-profile studies of Paleogene paleoclimate over the past decade. It is one of relatively few sections globally where a multi-proxy approach is possible due to the good preservation of microfossils and organic biomarkers. The Eocene section is also well dated by magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy based on planktic foraminifera, calcareous nannofossils and dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts). Here, we build on this previous work and undertake a comprehensive analysis of paleontological and geochemical indicators of climatic and environmental changes through the early middle Eocene part of the section, with particular focus on the early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO; 53.26-49.14 Ma). We correlate a 33.5 m-thick interval with the EECO, based on biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, TEX86-paleothermometry and bulk carbonate delta C-13. Our new sea-surface temperature (SST) record based on TEX86 agrees with a previous lower resolution record based on TEX86 and planktic foraminiferal delta O-18 and Mg/Ca ratios. The EECO interval in this section extends from the upper part of the New Zealand Waipawan Stage to the Mangaorapan/Heretaungan Stage boundary at 49.27 Ma. The EECO onset is not exposed, but the termination is well constrained by a fall in SST and shift to more positive delta C-13 values. Six negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) are recognised within the EECO and are tentatively correlated with CIEs J/K, M, O, Q, T and C22nH4 in the global delta C-13 compilation. The CIEs are associated with warmer SSTs, indicating that they represent hyperthermals. The BAYSPAR TEX86 calibration indicates SST increased by as much as 12 degrees C from the early Eocene (similar to 55 Ma) to the EECO, where SST peaked at 35 degrees C. SST gradually declined from mid EECO (similar to 51 Ma) into the middle Eocene. The marked warming in the early EECO is associated with the highest abundance of warm-water taxa in calcareous nannofossil and dinocyst assemblages, the highest proportion of planktic foraminifera, and a coeval long-term shift to abundant angiosperm vegetation, primarily driven by a rise in Casuarinaceae. There is good agreement between TEX86 and marine microfossilbased proxies for temperature, providing confidence that both approaches are useful guides to past water temperature. Warm-water marine taxa are most abundant in the EECO but are not dominant. Comparison of the abundance of nannofossil warm-water taxa between mid-Waipara and a low-latitude site on Shatsky Rise suggests the latitudinal temperature gradient between mid- and low-latitudes in the EECO was greater than the TEX86 proxy implies. There is no clear evidence for enhanced sedimentation rates associated with the EECO, in contrast to evidence from the nearby Mead Stream section. Superabundant Homotryblium, a euryhaline dinocyst, in the early and middle EECO suggests elevated salinity and/or stratified surface waters, and there is no clear evidence of increased surface productivity associated with the EECO. Declining SST in the late EECO, 50 Ma, corresponds with an increase in cool-water taxa and terrigenous material. This article highlights the importance of combining well-calibrated paleontological and geochemical records to better constrain and understand past warm climate states.

TI  - Ocean acidification limits temperature-induced poleward expansion of coral habitats around Japan
VL  - 9
IS  - 12
SP  - 4955-4968
AB  - Using results from four coupled global carbon cycle-climate models combined with in situ observations, we estimate the effects of future global warming and ocean acidification on potential habitats for tropical/subtropical and temperate coral communities in the seas around Japan. The suitability of coral habitats is classified on the basis of the currently observed regional ranges for temperature and saturation states with regard to aragonite (Omega(arag)). We find that, under the "business as usual" SRES A2 scenario, coral habitats are projected to expand northward by several hundred kilometers by the end of this century. At the same time, coral habitats are projected to become sandwiched between regions where the frequency of coral bleaching will increase, and regions where Omega(arag) will become too low to support sufficiently high calcification rates. As a result, the habitat suitable for tropical/subtropical corals around Japan may be reduced by half by the 2020s to 2030s, and is projected to disappear by the 2030s to 2040s. The habitat suitable for the temperate coral communities is also projected to decrease, although at a less pronounced rate, due to the higher tolerance of temperate corals for low Omega(arag). Our study has two important caveats: first, it does not consider the potential adaptation of the coral communities, which would permit them to colonize habitats that are outside their current range. Second, it also does not consider whether or not coral communities can migrate quickly enough to actually occupy newly emerging habitats. As such, our results serve as a baseline for the assessment of the future evolution of coral habitats, but the consideration of important biological and ecological factors and feedbacks will be required to make more accurate projections.

TI  - Microbiota in the Rhizosphere and Seed of Rice From China, With Reference to Their Transmission and Biogeography
VL  - 11
AB  - Seeds play key roles in the acquisition of plant pioneer microbiota, including the transmission of microbes from parent plants to offspring. However, the issues about seed microbial communities are mostly unknown, especially for their potential origins and the factors influencing the structure and composition. In this study, samples of rice seed and rhizosphere were collected from northeast and central-south China in two harvest years and analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting 16S rRNA gene region. A higher level of vertical transmission (from parent seed microbiota to offspring) was revealed, as compared to the acquisition from the rhizosphere (25.5 vs 10.7%). The core microbiota of the rice seeds consisted of a smaller proportion of OTUs (3.59%) than that of the rice rhizosphere (7.54%). Among the core microbiota, species inArthrobacter,Bacillus,Blastococcus,Curtobacterium,Pseudomonas, andRamlibacterhave been reported as potential pathogens and/or beneficial bacteria for plants. Both the seed and the rhizosphere of rice showed distance-decay of similarity in microbial communities. Seed moisture and winter mean annual temperature (WMAT) had significant impacts on seed microbiota, while WMAT, total carbon, available potassium, available phosphorus, aluminum, pH, and total nitrogen significantly determined the rhizosphere microbiota. Multiple functional pathways were found to be enriched in the seed or the rhizosphere microbiota, which, to some extent, explained the potential adaptation of bacterial communities to respective living habitats. The results presented here elucidate the composition and possible sources of rice seed microbiota, which is crucial for the health and productivity management in sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Low genetic variation for Dendrobaena octaedra from Greenland compared to populations from Europe and North America: Refuge or selection?
VL  - 50
IS  - 3
SP  - 225-234
AB  - The genetic relationship of 345 specimens of the parthenogenetic lumbricid Dendrobaena octaedra from Greenland, Canada and Europe were analysed by means of isozymes. The results showed that populations from Greenland were markedly different from Canadian and European populations, suggesting that dispersal between Greenland and the continents has been much more restricted in the past than dispersal between North America and Europe. This observation supports to the notion that Greenland populations have persisted for a long period and perhaps have survived the Last glacial period in ice-free refugia. A highly significant positive correlation was seen between diversity measured either as mean haptoid diversity or clonal. diversity and mean temperature of the annual coldest month. These results indicate that temperature might cause selection in colder climates or that sexual processes in D. dendroboeno could have been active recently on an evolutionary time scale.

TI  - Aging mechanisms in fruit flies
VL  - 18
IS  - 10
SP  - 799-807
AB  - Genetic analysis of Drosophila has provided evidence in support of two proposed evolutionary genetic mechanisms of aging: mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy. Both mechanisms result from the lack of natural selection acting on old organisms. Analyses of large numbers of flies have revealed that mortality rates do not continue to rise with age as previously thought, but plateau at advanced ages. This phenomenon has implications both for models and for definitions of aging, and may be explained by the evolutionary theories. The physiological processes and genes most relevant to aging are being identified using Drosophila lines selected in the laboratory for postponed senescence. Oxidative stress and insufficient metabolic reserves/capacity may be particularly important factors in limiting the fruitfly lifespan. Genes which exhibit aging-related changes in expression are now being identified. Transgenic flies are being used to analyze the mechanisms of such aging-related gene expression, and to test the effects of specific genes on aging and aging-related deterioration.

TI  - Role of functionally dominant species in varying environmental regimes: evidence for the performance-enhancing effect of biodiversity
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Theory suggests that biodiversity can act as a buffer against disturbances and environmental variability via two major mechanisms: Firstly, a stabilising effect by decreasing the temporal variance in ecosystem functioning due to compensatory processes; and secondly, a performance enhancing effect by raising the level of community response through the selection of better performing species. Empirical evidence for the stabilizing effect of biodiversity is readily available, whereas experimental confirmation of the performance-enhancing effect of biodiversity is sparse. Results: Here, we test the effect of different environmental regimes (constant versus fluctuating temperature) on bacterial biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relations. We show that positive effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning are enhanced by stronger temperature fluctuations due to the increased performance of individual species. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence for the performance enhancing effect and suggest that selection towards functionally dominant species is likely to benefit the maintenance of ecosystem functioning under more variable conditions.

AB  - Observed changes in weather can reveal marginal impacts of climate change on economic outcomes and the potential for adaptation. When modeling the nonlinear relationship between weather and changes in economic outcomes empirically, model choice can confound the interpretation of marginal and percentage effects and their respective confidence intervals. I present a simple solution for better characterizing semi-elasticities of nonlinear climate damages, and evaluate its relevance in interpreting empirical climate damages. For small marginal effects, the implications of this interpretation error is small; for larger effects, however, the misinterpretation error can be substantial.

VL  - 26
IS  - 5
SP  - 634-648
AB  - We studied male phonotactic behaviors elicited by acoustic cues that simulate conspecific male songs in the field cricket, Gryllus texensis. Males exhibited significant positive phonotaxis in response to the simulated song stimuli, but showed no such response to atypical song stimuli. We found no significant relationship between males' own calling behavior and their phonotactic responses to the stimuli. Analyses indicated that larger males exhibited greater phonotactic responses, which may indicate a greater tendency to engage in aggressive interactions if size is an indicator of fighting ability. Male phonotactic responses were significantly weaker than those exhibited by females, and adult males did not exhibit stronger responses with increasing age as has been documented for females. Observed sex differences in the strengths of phonotactic responses may reflect differences in the fitness-payoffs of responding. That is, females are under strong selection pressure to respond to male songs and subsequently mate. In contrast, males responding to acoustic signals from other males need not precisely locate the signaler but would likely move to areas where females are likely to be found. Alternatively, males might benefit from avoiding areas with calling males and establishing their own calling stations away from competing males.

TI  - Ocean acidification influences host DNA methylation and phenotypic plasticity in environmentally susceptible corals
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SP  - 1165-1178
AB  - As climate change challenges organismal fitness by creating a phenotype-environment mismatch, phenotypic plasticity generated by epigenetic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation) can provide a temporal buffer for genetic adaptation. Epigenetic mechanisms may be crucial for sessile benthic marine organisms, such as reef-building corals, where ocean acidification (OA) and warming reflect in strong negative responses. We tested the potential for scleractinian corals to exhibit phenotypic plasticity associated with a change in DNA methylation in response to OA. Clonal coral fragments of the environmentally sensitive Pocillopora damicornis and more environmentally robust Montipora capitata were exposed to fluctuating ambient pH (7.9-7.65) and low pH (7.6-7.35) conditions in common garden tanks for similar to 6 weeks. M. capitata responded weakly, or acclimated more quickly, to OA, with no difference in calcification, minimal separation of metabolomic profiles, and no change in DNA methylation between treatments. Conversely, P. damicornis exhibited diminished calcification at low pH, stronger separation in metabolomic profiles, and responsiveness of DNA methylation to treatment. Our data suggest corals differ in their temporal dynamics and sensitivity for environmentally triggered real-time epigenetic reprogramming. The generation of potentially heritable plasticity via environmental induction of DNA methylation provides an avenue for assisted evolution applications in corals under rapid climate change.

TI  - A comparative modeling study on non-climatic and climatic risk assessment on Asian Tiger Mosquito (Aedes albopictus)
VL  - 6
AB  - Aedes albopictus, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, vector of Chikungunya, Dengue Fever and Zika viruses, has proven its hardy adaptability in expansion from its natural Asian, forest edge, tree hole habitat on the back of international trade transportation, re-establishing in temperate urban surrounds, in a range of water receptacles and semi-enclosures of organic matter. Conventional aerial spray mosquito vector controls focus on wetland and stagnant water expanses proven to miss the protected hollows and crevices favoured by Ae. albopictus. New control or eradication strategies are thus essential, particular in light of potential expansions in the southeastern and eastern USA. Successful regional vector control strategies require risk level analysis. Should strategies prioritize regions with non-climatic or climatic suitability parameters for Ae. albopictus? Our study used current Ae. albopictus distribution data to develop two independent models: (i) regions with suitable non-climatic factors, and (ii) regions with suitable climate for Ac. albopictus in southeastern USA. Non-climatic model processing used Evidential Belief Function (EBF), together with six geographical conditioning factors (raster data layers), to establish the probability index. Validation of the analysis results was estimated with area under the curve (AUC) using Ae. albopictus presence data. Climatic modeling was based on two General Circulation Models (GCMs), Miroc3.2 and CSIRO-MK30 running the RCP 8.5 scenario in MaxEnt software. EBF non climatic model results achieved a 0.70 prediction rate and 0.73 success rate, confirming suitability of the study site regions for Ae. albopictus establishment. The climatic model results showed the best-fit model comprised Coldest Quarter Mean Temp, Precipitation of Wettest Quarter and Driest Quarter Precipitation factors with mean AUC value of 0.86. Both GCMs showed that the whole study site is highly suitable and will remain suitable climatically, according to the prediction for 2055, for Ae. albopictus expansion.

TI  - Evaluating the effects of temperature, salinity, starvation and autotomy on molting success, molting interval and expression of ecdysone receptor in early juvenile mud crabs, Scylla paramamosain
VL  - 464
SP  - 11-17
AB  - Newly molted first stage juvenile mud crabs (C1), Scylla paramamosain, were subjected to different temperatures (14, 20, 26, 32 and 39 degrees C), salinity (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40), starvation conditions and autotomy (for the autotomy experiment, the second stage crabs (C2) were used) to assess their effects on molting success, molting interval and corresponding expressions of the crab's ecdysone receptor (EcR). The results showed that at a low temperature of 14 degrees C no molt occurred with a subdued EcR mRNA level detected. In contrast, a higher temperature of 32 degrees C induced a significant increase in the expression of EcR gene and dramatically reduced the Cl molting interval as compared to other treatments. As the temperature further increased to 39 degrees C and after a period of 6 or more hours the expression of EcR gene dropped abruptly and all C1 crabs died without molt. On the other hand, a low salinity of 5 increased EcR mRNA levels at 72 hand shortened the molting interval significantly whilst high salinity of 40 resulted in the opposite. No significant difference in percentage molting success was detected among salinity from 10 to 40. When C1 crabs were subjected to starvation for longer than 48 h, the expression of EcR was found to be significantly repressed as compared to the feeding control, in which none of the starved crabs successfully molted. Meanwhile, although the molting success of C2 crabs was not significantly affected by autotomy, the molting interval significantly increased from 5.8 days for intact crabs to 6.2 days for the autotomized crabs. Interestingly, when compared to intact crabs, the expression level of EcR gene in autotomized crabs was at first repressed (i.e. during the first 120 h) but increased sharply to a level significantly higher than the control at 134 h (i.e. during premolt stage of the autotomized crabs). Our results showed that temperature, salinity, starvation and autotomy all affected molting of early juvenile mud crabs and changes in their EcR mRNA levels appeared to play an important role in regulating the molting process. The current experiment also showed that S. paramamosain early juveniles could withstand a broad range of temperatures and salinity, therefore highlighting their adaptability to the seasonal variation in salinity and temperature of natural habitat.

VL  - 33
IS  - 6
SP  - 1535-1540
AB  - The rare maritime ringlet butterfly (Coenonympha tullia nipisiquit McDonnough), which inhabits salt marshes in maritime Canada, experiences tidal flooding throughout its development. Its low vagility and the imminence of sea level rise call for the immediate investigation on the effect of flooding on survival. The maritime ringlet's tolerance to tidewater submergence for up to 24 h was compared with that of the inornate ringlet (C. tullia inornata Edwards), a subspecies occupying nearby upland meadows. The suitability of salt meadow cordgrass [Spartina patens (Aiton) Muhl.], a major host of the maritime ringlet, for neonate inornate ringlet larvae was tested as well. Maritime ringlet larvae showed higher tolerance to tidewater submergence than inornate ringlet larvae, which were more likely to die from submergence stress after a few days. Although tidal submergence is probably not lethal to the maritime ringlet, there is a possibility of negative impact caused by prolonged submergence during storm tides. The inornate ringlet larvae failed to adopt S. patens, and all larvae died within 1 wk when forced to feed on it. The results suggest that the maritime ringlet has evolved physiological adaptations to saline wetland conditions that have enabled it to exploit its current habitat.

VL  - 54

SP  - 1448-1458
AB  - The recent increased market demand for locally grown produce is generating interest in the application of techniques developed for controlled environment agriculture (CEA) to urban agriculture (UA). Controlled environments have great potential to revolutionize urban food systems, as they offer unique opportunities for year-round production, optimizing resource-use efficiency, and for helping to overcome significant challenges associated with the high costs of production in urban settings. For urban growers to benefit from CEA, results from studies evaluating the application of controlled environments for commercial food production should be considered. This review includes a discussion of current and potential applications of CEA for UA, references discussing appropriate methods for selecting and controlling the physical plant production environment, resource management strategies, considerations to improve economic viability, opportunities to address food safety concerns, and the potential social benefits from applying CEA techniques to UA. Author's viewpoints about the future of CEA for urban food production are presented at the end of this review.

TI  - Response of Benthic Foraminifera to Organic Matter Quantity and Quality and Bioavailable Concentrations of Metals in Aveiro Lagoon (Portugal)
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - This work analyses the distribution of living benthic foraminiferal assemblages of surface sediments in different intertidal areas of Ria de Aveiro (Portugal), a polihaline and anthropized coastal lagoon. The relationships among foraminiferal assemblages in association with environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, Eh and pH), grain size, the quantity and quality of organic matter (enrichment in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids), pollution caused by metals, and mineralogical data are studied in an attempt to identify indicators of adaptability to environmental stress. In particular, concentrations of selected metals in the surficial sediment are investigated to assess environmental pollution levels that are further synthetically parameterised by the Pollution Load Index (PLI). The PLI variations allowed the identification of five main polluted areas. Concentrations of metals were also analysed in three extracted phases to evaluate their possible mobility, bioavailability and toxicity in the surficial sediment. Polluted sediment in the form of both organic matter and metals can be found in the most confined zones. Whereas enrichment in organic matter and related biopolymers causes an increase in foraminifera density, pollution by metals leads to a decline in foraminiferal abundance and diversity in those zones. The first situation may be justified by the existence of opportunistic species (with high reproduction rate) that can live in low oxic conditions. The second is explained by the sensitivity of some species to pressure caused by metals. The quality of the organic matter found in these places and the option of a different food source should also explain the tolerance of several species to pollution caused by metals, despite their low reproductive rate in the most polluted areas. In this study, species that are sensitive and tolerant to organic matter and metal enrichment are identified, as is the differential sensitivity/tolerance of some species to metals enrichment.

TI  - Population dynamics and phenotypic comparisons among six populations of Procambarus clarkii from the Donana National Park (SW Spain)
SP  - 629-642
AB  - The introduction of exotic species can often cause problems in the structure and function of ecosystems. The case of Procambarus clarkii is a good example. The amount of impact that crayfish have on ecosystems is strongly influenced by the environmental conditions of the habitat they occupy. The crayfrsh population structure is also affected by these conditions owing to the high adaptive plasticity of the species. The size structure of a population is useful in predicting its ecological success and therefore its impact on the ecosystem. The objective of this study was to comparatively analyse six populations of P. clarkii from different ecosystem types in the Donana National Park (DNP) in Spain. In order to evaluate possible differences related to adaptation processes, comparisons based on several phenotypic and population dynamic traits were made. Environmental physicochemical parameters and water regime were recorded monthly. From our results, we could infer that although P. clarkii populations in the DNP did not differ phenotypically, they greatly differ physiologically, resulting in different growth rates, and structure and dynamic of the populations. This fact helps us to explain why the ecological impact of P. clarkii is very different from one ecosystem to another, and hopefully, to gain insight concerning the role of P. clarkii on the ecosystems. Differences were due to water regime and temperature, so recruitment and reproduction seasons were longer in the places flooded in spring and in early autumn. Population parameters appear more appropriate for predicting future selection trends in P. clarkii population growth rate and possible maximum length in DNP than morphometric analyses. Furthermore, the present paper has illustrated the crayfish's great adaptability to different ecosystems, which is the basis of its great ecological success.

TI  - Heat and cold waves trends in the Carpathian Region from 1961 to 2010
VL  - 35
IS  - 14
SP  - 4197-4209
AB  - The past two decades of the 20th century and the first of the 21st century have been characterized by global temperature rise and increased frequency of weather-induced extreme events such as floods, droughts, heavy rainfall, and heat waves. We investigated the heat and the cold waves in the Carpathian Region, an area whose rich biosphere is endangered by extreme events. We used the daily minimum (T-N) and maximum (T-X) temperature data collected in the framework of the CARPATCLIM project. Such high-resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees) gridded data range from January 1961 to December 2010. In this study, a heat wave occurs when temperature is above the 90th percentile for at least five consecutive days and a cold wave occurs when temperature is below the 10th percentile for at least five consecutive days. The percentiles have been computed over the baseline period 1971-2000. We distinguish between night-time and daytime events and we discuss heat (and cold) waves considering at least five consecutive night and days with temperature above (below) the selected percentile. For each heat or cold wave event, we assigned duration, severity, and intensity. For these parameters and for frequency, we performed linear trend analysis for the period 1961-2010. The trends have been computed on an annual and seasonal basis and tested for statistical significance. Different spatial patterns of heat and cold waves characterize the Carpathian Region: heat wave events show general increase in all the parameters considered, while cold wave events show a decrease in all the variables West to the Carpathians and an increase North-East to the Carpathians. We also compiled a list of the most relevant heat waves that hit the Carpathian Region from 1961 to 2010: out of seven events, four occurred from 2000 to 2010. Instead, the 1960s and the 1980s have been the decades most hit by severe cold waves.

TI  - EFFECT OF GLASS-BATCH MAKEUP ON THE MELTING PROCESS
VL  - 54
IS  - 3
SP  - 193-211
AB  - The response of a glass batch to heating is determined by the batch makeup and in turn determines the rate of melting. Batches formulated for a high-alumina nuclear waste to he vitrified in an all-electric inciter were heated at a constant temperature-increase rate to determine changes in melting behavior in response to the selection of batch chemicals and silica grain-size as well as the addition of heat-generating reactants. The type of hatch materials and the size of silica grains determine how much, if any, primary foam occurs during melting. Small quartz grains, 5 mu m in size, caused extensive foaming because their major portion dissolved at temperatures <800 degrees C, contributing to the formation of viscous glass-forming melt that trapped evolving batch gases. Primary foam did not occur in batches with larger quartz grains, +/- 75 mu m in size, because their major portion dissolved at temperatures >800 degrees C when batch gases no longer evolved. The exothermal reaction of nitrates with sucrose was ignited at a temperature as low as 160 degrees C and caused a temporary jump in temperature of several hundred degrees. Secondary foam, the source of which is oxygen from redox reactions, occurred in all batches of a limited composition variation involving five oxides, B2O3, CaO, Li2O, MgO, and Na2O. The foam volume at the maximum volume-increase rate was a weak function of temperature and melt basicity. Neither the batch makeup nor the change in glass composition had a significant impact on the dissolution of silica grains. The impacts of primary foam generation on glass homogeneity and the rate of melting in large-scale continuous furnaces have yet to be established via mathematical modeling and melter experiments.

TI  - Does gestation or feeding affect the body temperature of the golden lancehead, Bothrops insularis (Squamata: Viperidae) under field conditions?
VL  - 27

SP  - 973-978
AB  - Temperature affects physiological performance in reptiles and, therefore, body temperature (T-b) control is argued to have an important adaptive value. Alterations in T-b due to transient changes in physiological state, as during digestion or gestation, are often linked to the potential benefits of a more precise T-b regulation. However, such thermoregulatory responses in nature remain controversial, particularly for tropical snakes. Herein, we measured T-b of the golden lanceheads, Bothrops insularis (Amaral, 1921), at Queimada Grande Island, southeastern Brazil, to test for alteration in selected body temperatures associated with feeding or gestation. We found no evidence that postprandial or gravid snakes selected for higher T-b indicating that, under natural conditions, body temperature regulation in B. insularis apparently encompasses other ecological factors beyond physiological state per se.

TI  - Selection originating from protein stability/foldability: Relationships between protein folding free energy, sequence ensemble, and fitness
VL  - 433
SP  - 21-38
AB  - Assuming that mutation and fixation processes are reversible Markov processes, we prove that the equilibrium ensemble of sequences obeys a Boltzmann distribution with exp(4N(e)m(1 - 1/(2N))), where m is Malthusian fitness and N-e and N are effective and actual population sizes. On the other hand, the probability distribution of sequences with maximum entropy that satisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise amino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with exp(-psi(N)), where the evolutionary statistical energy psi(N) is represented as the sum of one body (h) (compositional) and pairwise (J) (covariational) interactions over all sites and site pairs. A protein folding theory based on the random energy model (REM) indicates that the equilibrium ensemble of natural protein sequences is well represented by a canonical ensemble characterized by exp(-Delta G(ND)/k(B)T(S)) or by exp(-G(N)/k(B)T(S)) if an amino acid composition is kept constant, where Delta G(ND) equivalent to G(N) - G(D), G(N) and G(D) are the native and denatured free energies, and T-S is the effective temperature representing the strength of selection pressure. Thus, 4N(e)m(1 - 1/(2N)), -Delta psi(ND)(equivalent to -psi(N) + psi(D)), and -Delta G(ND)/k(B)T(S) must be equivalent to each other. With h and J estimated by the DCA program, the changes (Delta psi(N)) of psi(N) due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous substitutions are analyzed. The results indicate that the standard deviation of Delta G(N)(= k(B)T(S)Delta psi(N)) is approximately constant irrespective of protein families, and therefore can be used to estimate the relative value of T-s. Glass transition temperature T-g and Delta G(ND) are estimated from estimated T-S and experimental melting temperature (T-m) for 14 protein domains. The estimates of Delta G(ND) agree with their experimental values for 5 proteins, and those of T-s and T-g are all within a reasonable range. In addition, approximating the probability density function (PDF) of Delta psi(N) by a log-normal distribution, PDFs of Delta psi(N) and K-a/K-s, which is the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, in all and in fixed mutants are estimated. The equilibrium values of psi(N), at which the average of Delta psi in fixed mutants is equal to zero, well match f psi(N) averaged over homologous sequences, confirming that the present methods for a fixation process of mutations and for the equilibrium ensemble of psi(N) give a consistent result with each other. The PDFs of K-a/K-s at equilibrium confirm that T-s negatively correlates with the amino acid substitution rate (the mean of K-a/K-s) of protein. Interestingly, stabilizing mutations are significantly fixed by positive selection, and balance with destabilizing mutations fixed by random drift, although most of them are removed from population. Supporting the nearly neutral theory, neutral selection is not significant even in fixed mutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A poxvirus pseudokinase represses viral DNA replication via a pathway antagonized by its paralog kinase
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
AB  - Poxviruses employ sophisticated, but incompletely understood, signaling pathways that engage cellular defense mechanisms and simultaneously ensure viral factors are modulated properly. For example, the vaccinia B1 protein kinase plays a vital role in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor BAF, and likely orchestrates other pathways as well. In this study, we utilized experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to perform an unbiased search for suppressor mutations and identify novel pathways involving B1. After several passages of the B1 virus we observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. Interestingly, our characterization of the adapted viruses reveals that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provide a striking fitness enhancement to this virus. In support of predictions that reductive evolution is a driver of poxvirus adaptation, this is clear experimental evidence that gene loss can be of significant benefit. Next, we present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that expression of full length B12 leads to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. From these data we infer that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. Further investigation of B12 attributes revealed that it primarily localizes to the nucleus, a characteristic only rarely found among poxviral proteins. Surprisingly, BAF phosphorylation is reduced under conditions in which B12 is present in infected cells without B1, indicating that B12 may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF. Together, our studies of B1 and B12 present novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, perhaps serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate yet-to-be-discovered nuclear events during infection. Author summary Vaccinia virus is the archetype member of the Poxviridae family. This virus encodes similar to 200 genes that contribute to viral propagation in the cytoplasm and coordinate restriction of the host antiviral response through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Notably, the B1 kinase inhibits a highly conserved antiviral protein, allowing viral DNA replication to proceed in the cytoplasm. To better understand B1 driven signaling, we used experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to identify viral genes within shared signaling pathways. Herein we describe our success in isolating adapted viruses and the discovery of a genetic link between B1 and the related B12 gene. Thus this study illustrates the utility of experimental evolution to discover novel digenic relationships. Interestingly, we also elucidated an unexpected regulatory intersection between the B1 kinase and B12 pseudokinase that likely masked discovery of the repressive function of B12 during previous studies of this factor. As kinase-pseudokinase protein families are abundant in many forms of life, the genetic and functional relationship between B1 and B12 that we uncovered is likely of broad biological relevance. Further investigation of individual genes and gene families in multigenic knockout backgrounds may uncover similar masked phenotypes in a broad range of model systems.

TI  - Combined treatment of miltefosine and paromomycin delays the onset of experimental drug resistance in Leishmania infantum
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
AB  - Background Since miltefosine monotherapy against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania donovani has been discontinued in the Indian subcontinent due to an increase in the number of treatment failures, single dose liposomal amphotericin B is now advocated as a treatment option of choice. Paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy can be used as substitute first-line treatment in regions without cold-chain potential. Previous laboratory studies in the closely related species Leishmania infantum have demonstrated that paromomycin monotherapy fairly rapidly selects for resistance producing a phenotype with increased fitness. Given the possible clinical implications of these findings for the current field situation, the present study aimed to identify the potential hazards of paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy. Principal findings Drug interaction studies using the fixed-ratio isobologram method revealed an indifferent interaction between paromomycin and miltefosine. In hamsters infected with L. infantum, the combination resulted in cumulative efficacy in reducing parasite burdens in the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Selected resistant lines against the single drugs did not display cross-resistance. When the intracellular amastigote stage was repeatedly exposed to the paromomycin-miltefosine combination, either in vitro or in vivo, no significant susceptibility decrease towards either drug was noted. Conclusions These results suggest that implementation of paromomycin-miltefosine combination therapy indeed could represent a safe and affordable treatment option for L. donovani VL as miltefosine appears to overrule the anticipated rapid development of PMM resistance.

AB  - In this work, a simple and general procedure for optimally scaling-up exothermic semibatch processes has been applied to the analysis of a nitration reaction performed in the agrochemical industry for the production of an important class of herbicides. Such a reaction is performed in indirectly cooled semibatch reactors in which the species to be nitrated is added to a mixture of sulfuric and nitric acid, forming a heterogeneous (liquid-liquid) system. Adiabatic calorimetric experiments performed in an ARC equipment showed that the reaction in question belongs to the most critical class of exothermic reaction processes, for which maximum attainable temperature due to synthesis reaction (MTSR) is, at the same time, higher than system decomposition temperature and lower than boiling temperature of the reaction mass. It has been verified, through reaction calorimetry experiments (performed in an RC I equipment), that the optimization-scale-up procedure previously developed allows, with minimum calculation and experimental effort, both for a selection, at laboratory scale, of operating conditions characterized by a rapid coreactant consumption and for their safe scale-up, maximizing industrial reactor productivity.

TI  - Climate Change Alters Temperate Forest Canopies and Indirectly Reshapes Arthropod Communities
VL  - 4
AB  - Global change challenges the adaptive potential of forests. Large-scale alterations of forest canopies have been reported across Europe, and further modifications are expected in response to the predicted changes in drought and windstorm regimes. Since forest canopies are dynamic interfaces between atmosphere and land surface, communities of canopy-dwelling insects are at the forefront of major changes in response to both direct and indirect effects of climate change. First, we briefly introduce the factors shaping arthropod communities in the canopy of temperate forests. Second, we cover the significant impacts of a forest decline on canopy structure and functioning, and more specifically its contrasted effects on insect microhabitats, trophic resources and forest microclimates. Deleterious effects may be expected for several guilds of leaf-dwelling insects. Nonetheless, a forest decline could also lead to transient or long-lasting resource pulses for other canopy-dwelling guilds, especially saproxylic species depending on deadwood substrates and tree-related microhabitats. The novel microclimates may also become more favorable for some particular groups of insects. We pinpoint current knowledge gaps and the technological locks that should be undone to improve our understanding of the canopy biotope and biodiversity in temperate forests. We highlight the need for integrative approaches to reveal the mechanisms at play. We call for cross-scale studies and long-term collaborative research efforts, involving different disciplines such as community and disturbance ecology, plant and insect ecophysiology, and thermal ecology, to better anticipate ongoing functional and conservation issues in temperate forest ecosystems.

TI  - Variation Law of Air Temperature of a High-Geotemperature Tunnel the Construction
VL  - 2021
AB  - High geotemperature seriously impacts personnel and equipment during railway and expressway tunnel construction. In this study, the Nige tunnel in the expressway from Gejiu to Yuanyang in Honghe Prefecture was used as an example. Firstly, automatic temperature recording devices were used to monitor the variation characteristics of the tunnel temperature. Afterward, the variation characteristics of the temperature at 5-10 days and 150 days after tunnel's completion were revealed. The results showed that the evolution laws of air temperature in each stage could be revealed by logarithmic functions of increasing type and decreasing type. Based on the monitoring over 5-10 days after tunnel's completion, the temperature range was 26-44 degrees C, and the highest temperature in the tunnel is located near the middle of the tunnel. The temperature fluctuation near the tunnel entrance is relatively small, while it fluctuates greatly near the tunnel exit. Based on the monitoring over 150 days, the air temperature was maintained between 16 and 31 degrees C. The temperature near the tunnel entrance was high, while the temperature near the tunnel exit was low. The performance had a guiding significance for the design and construction of the high-geotemperature tunnel.

SP  - 1739-1754
AB  - Different Nile tilapia stocks belonging to the fish breeding program of the Epagri (Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuaria e Extensao Rural de Santa Catarina) were characterized by microsatellite markers. A total of nine stocks (S1 to S9) were evaluated, and for each stock the caudal fin of 30 individuals were sampled. A total of 75 alleles were found at the 11 microsatellite loci used (UNH104, UNH108, UNHI60, UNH208, UNH222, UNH848, UNH879, UNH898, UNH952, UNH998). Among the loci used, only UHN160 showed significance for null alleles in stocks S1, S2, S3 and S5. The average number of alleles per loci was 6.8, while the average number of alleles per tilapia stock was 4.4. Five unique alleles were identified between the stock Si and S5. The observed heterozygosity values (Ho) exceeded the expected heterozygosity (He), resulting in a negative inbreeding coefficient (F-IS = -0.092). F-ST for the total population was 0.109, demonstrating moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. According to the Euclidean distance, three groups were formed as follows: I - S6, S7 and S9; II - S2, S3 and S4; and III - SI, S5 and S8. However, the existence of two groups can be observed from the PCoA representation: I - S6, S7, S8 and S9; and II - S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5. The fonnation of these two genetic groups is consistent with the genealogy of stocks. The formation of group III (S1, S5 and S8) in the dendrogram can be explained by the higher average observed heterozygosity values of these stocks. Bayesian analysis revealed the formation of 16 groups with an F-ST value of 0.2107. This result reinforces the existence of variability existing in the Epagri breeding program, from which it is possible to form heterotic groups to enable the direction of potential crosses to obtain genetic gain. The study enabled genotypic characterization of the tilapia brood stock used in the Epagri breeding program, determining the genetic distance between the stocks, which will enable more accurate selection of individuals for mating for the next generation. It was possible to verify that there is high heterozygosity within the stocks, and moderate genetic differentiation between the stocks. Furthermore, all evaluated markers were polymorphic for this brood stock and will be used to characterize the next generations.

Therefore the yield of biomass and N-fixing capacity of a winter pea (Pisum sativum L.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) monocropped and intercropped with rye (Secale cereale L.) were examined for five years in a field trial. In mid-June above-ground biomass of winter crops was removed and maize transplanted. The winter crops achieved maximum dry matter yield about three to five weeks before maturity. Mixed stands yielded more biomass than pure stands and exhibited greater yield stability. The relative advantage of intercropping, expressed as land equivalent ratio (LER), determined for intercropped winter pea/rye were 1.1 to 1.2 and for crimson clover/rye 1.3. At maturity, the amount of fixed nitrogen ranged between 178 kg N for crimson clover and 242 kg N ha(-1) for winter pea, respectively. At the end of anthesis (middle of June, harvesting stage for silage fodder) 75% and 88% of the total fixed nitrogen was achieved, for clover and pea, respectively. In intercropping the amount of fixed nitrogen was lower than in pure stands due to a lower seed density of the legume; however, the N-fixing efficiency was greater than in pure stands. N-release of the winter pea in a pure stand produced a maximum yield in maize (Zea mays L.) without additional N-fertiliser. An additional N mineral fertilisation of 75 to 150 kg N and 75 to 225 kg N was necessary to achieve maximum yields in maize following intercropped winter pea and crimson clover, respectively. Legumes in mixed stands with rye resulted in lower amounts of residual nitrogen after maize harvest. The beneficial effect of legumes on maize can be divided into N-effects and rotation effects. Both effects were positive regarding winter pea. The rotation effect of crimson clover in pure stands on maize was negative. Allelopathic effects and the high sensitivity of crimson clover to mineral nitrogen in the soil, released by residues of the preceding crop, winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), were discussed as the reason for this observation. The combination of the winter pea in pure stand and maize achieved the highest total biomass yield from winter and summer crops, unfertilised (156 dt ha(-1) dry). The combinations of intercropped legumes and maize produced biomass yields of 142 to 145 dt ha(-1). Because winter pea is highly susceptible to lodging, intercropping with low seed density of rye is recommended (3/4 winter pea, 1/4 rye). The rye crop prevents lodging by providing support and high rates of N-fixation are achieved with high seed density of pea. lntercropping with crimson clover and rye should be based on high seed densities of legumes, too because rye is highly competitive within those mixtures.

TI  - Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster Reveal Features of an Uncharacterized Circadian Property: The Lower Temperature Limit of Rhythmicity
VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 167-180
AB  - Most cyclic biological processes are under control of a circadian molecular timing system that synchronizes these phenomena to the 24-h day. One generic property of circadian-controlled processes is that they operate within a specific temperature range, below which the manifestation of rhythm ceases. Little is known about the evolutionary relevance of the lower temperature limit of rhythmicity or about the mechanism underlying the loss of overt circadian behavior below this lower limit, especially in one model organism of chronobiology, Drosophila melanogaster. Natural populations of Drosophila are evolving under divergent selection pressures and so provide a source of diversity necessary to address these issues. Using lines derived from African populations, we find that there is natural variation in the expression of rhythmic behavior under low-temperature conditions. We found evidence that this variability is evolutionarily relevant at extremely low temperature (12 degrees C) because high-altitude populations exhibit selection for locally adapted genomes that contribute to rhythmic behavior. Lines resistant to 15 degrees C show an additional layer of diversity in their response to temperature extremes because some lines are resistant to low temperature (15 degrees C) only, whereas others are cross-resistant to high and low temperature (15 degrees C and 30 degrees C). Genetic analysis of one cold-resistant circadian line at 15 degrees C reveals that the phenotype maps to the X-chromosome but not to the core clock genes, per and sgg. Analysis of the central clock cells of this line reveals that maintenance of rhythm is associated with robust clock function, which is compromised in a standard laboratory strain. These data indicate that the cold-resistant circadian phenotype is clock based. This study highlights the importance of using natural populations to inform us of the basic features of circadian traits, especially those that might be under temperature-based selection.

SP  - 5-23
AB  - The following study was developed during experimental research to determine the most appropriate methods for quail egg (coturnix coturnixjaponica) preservation in order to extend their useful shelf life. Quail eggs are a highly perishable product which causes economic losses to their suppliers due to fluctuations in the demand of the product in spite of its nutritional content. Two specific objectives were established: 1) To formulate preserving solutions of different concentrations to apply to the quail egg as a liquid seal, determined through a Box-Behnken response surface design, which resulted in a preserving solution of NaCl 1.5%, potassium sorbate 400 ppm and acetic acid 0.125%. 2) To determine the ideal pasteurization temperature at which to preserve the quail eggs, using three randomly selected thermal values of 60, 70 and 80 degrees C, which resulted in a recommended temperature of 70 degrees C for 90 seconds. Finally, the stability of the final product was established by studying accelerated conditions at different storage temperatures and an estimated duration of approximately 500 days was established through a lineal regression mathematical model.

SP  - 49-59
AB  - Climate change presents potential increased threats to the comfort and health of urban populations as a result of higher summer temperatures. This paper reviews recent research on the climate change adaptation potential of urban environments and focuses on a major conurbation, London. Recent work relating to the impact of exposure to heat on population health is also noted. Data obtained from a pilot monitoring study carried out in a subset of 36 dwellings (from a total of 110 dwellings in the overall study) across London during the summer of 2009 is then discussed. Preliminary results illustrate the need to quantify the net impacts of individual building characteristics and the location of each dwelling within the London heat island. During a hot period, more than 40% of the monitored bedrooms failed the recommended overheating criteria during the night time. There was some indication of purpose built flats being more prone to overheating. The potential use of such data as the basis of a heat-related health risk epidemiological model for London is discussed. Such a tool would help health policy makers to target the most vulnerable building types and areas.

VL  - 13
IS  - 8
AB  - Many studies in the last few years have been dedicated to the increasing temperatures and extreme heat in Europe since the second half of the 20th century because of their adverse effects on ecosystems resilience, human health, and quality of life. The present research aims to analyze the spatio-temporal variations of extreme heat events in Southeastern Europe using daily temperature data from 70 selected meteorological stations and applying methodology developed initially for the quantitative assessment of hot weather in Bulgaria. We demonstrate the suitability of indicators based on maximum temperature thresholds to assess the intensity (i.e., magnitude and duration) and the tendency of extreme heat events in the period 1961-2020 both by individual stations and the Koppen's climate zones. The capability of the used intensity-duration hot spell model to evaluate the severity of extreme heat events has also been studied and compared with the Excess Heat Factor severity index on a yearly basis. The study provides strong evidence of the suitability of the applied combined approach in the investigation of the spatio-temporal evolution of the hot weather phenomena over the considered domain.

AB  - Adaptation strategies and policies are normally based on climate impact assessments that fail to take account of the social nature and distribution of vulnerability to climate change. This is largely a product of the dominant assessment techniques that are used to inform such strategies and the limits of existing evidence. In this paper I contribute to filling gaps in the current adaptation literature by exploring the social nature of vulnerability and the potential for socially just adaptation. It does so by reviewing studies from the UK, in particular those under the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Climate Change and Social Justice programme. It finds that vulnerability to high temperatures and fluvial and coastal flooding, in terms of sensitivity, exposure, and the capacity to anticipate, respond, and recover, is concentrated in certain disadvantaged and socially marginalized groups, including those on low incomes. It also finds that both autonomous and planned adaptation may fail to protect the most vulnerable individuals and groups, and may even reinforce existing patterns of vulnerability in some cases, i.e., mal-adaptation, especially where they rely on unmediated market forces or where they fail to explicitly recognize aspects of social vulnerability in their design and implementation. I argue that social justice should be an explicit objective of adaptation strategy.

TI  - Limited Immune Diversity in Urodela: Chronic Transplantation Responses Occur Even with Family-disparate Xenografts
VL  - 30
IS  - 7
SP  - 577-584
AB  - Urodele amphibians are thought to have poorer immune responses than evolutionary more ancestral vertebrate classes, such as bony fish. We investigated skin graft rejection and transplantation immunity in Urodele amphibians, Japanese newts, and Asiatic salamanders, and compared these findings to those from transplants in several species of frogs. The skin grafts used in this study were either allogeneic or xenogeneic. The mean survival time of the first set of allografts at 20 degrees C was approximately 60 days for chronic responses in Urodela and 20 days for acute responses in Anura. As the graft survival times of urodeles were significantly longer than those of anurans, even when urodeles were repeatedly grafted from identical donors, there appear to be substantial differences in transplantation immunity between Urodela and Anura. These slow responses in Urodela may not be accompanied by the expansion of cytotoxic T cells, as observed in fish and anuran species, which are known to have functional major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I systems. In our study, approximately five histo-incompatible immunogenic components were found to be involved in chronic responses in newts. Similar chronic responses were also observed in xenograft rejection in newts. In contrast, xenografts were rejected in frogs due to an accelerated acute response, possibly involving natural killer cells. Our findings that some anti-allogeneic components appear to be shared with xenogeneic components indicate that the diversification of the acquired immune system is poorly developed in Urodela.

TI  - Seasonal activity patterns of Ixodes pacificus nymphs in relation to climatic conditions
VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 235-244
AB  - In western North America, the tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae) is the primary vector to humans and domestic animals of the disease agents causing Lyme disease and granulocytic ehrlichiosis. We examined the seasonal activity patterns of I. pacificus nymphs over a 4-year period, including the wet and cold El Nino winter/spring of 1998, in a dry oak/madrone woodland, and for one year in a cooler and moister redwood/tanoak woodland in Mendocino County, California. Linear regressions were used to estimate when nymphal densities first exceeded and then fell below 25, 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peak densities. In oak/madrone woodland, nymphs typically were active by mid-March, reached 50% of their yearly peak densities in early to mid-April, peaked by early May, fell below 50% of their peak densities by early to mid-June, and were absent by late July to mid-August. The lengths of the periods with nymphal densities exceeding 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peaks in oak/madrone woodland were associated positively with rainfall and negatively with maximum air temperatures during April-May. Moreover, nymphal numbers typically reached 50% of their peak 10-15 days later, remained at levels above 50% of the peak 1.3-1.5 times longer, and started declining 4-6 weeks later under cooler, moister climatic conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 1998 and redwood/tanoak woodland in 2000) relative to warmer, drier conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 2000-2001). In oak/madrone woodland, nymphal densities typically started to decline when mean maximum daily air temperatures exceeded 23degreesC. Nymphal densities were higher in dry oak/madrone relative to moist redwood/tanoak woodland from mid-March to late May 2000, similar in both habitat types in early June, but higher in redwood/tanoak woodland from late June onwards. We conclude that large-scale studies of the density of I. pacificus nymphs in California need to consider spatial variation in the length of nymphal activity periods and select temporal sampling regimens that yield representative data for all included habitat types.

TI  - Plasma Generating-Chemical Looping Catalyst Synthesis by Microwave Plasma Shock for Nitrogen Fixation from Air and Hydrogen Production from Water for Agriculture and Energy Technologies in Global Warming Prevention
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - Simultaneous generation of plasma by microwave irradiation of perovskite or the spinel type of silica supported porous catalyst oxides and their reduction by nitrogen in the presence of oxygen is demonstrated. As a result of plasma generation in air, NOx generation is accompanied by the development of highly heterogeneous regions in terms of chemical and morphological variations within the catalyst. Regions of almost completely reduced catalyst are dispersed within the catalyst oxide, across micron-scale domains. The quantification of the catalyst heterogeneity and evaluation of catalyst structure are studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy and XRD. Plasma generating supported spinel catalysts are synthesized using the technique developed by the author (Catalysts; 2016; 6; 80) and BaTiO3 is used to exemplify perovskites. Silica supported catalyst systems are represented as M/Si = X (single catalysts) or as M((1))/M((2))/Si = X/Y/Z (binary catalysts) where M; M((1)) M((2)) = Cr; Mn; Fe; Co; Cu and X, Y, Z are the molar ratio of the catalysts and SiO2 support. Composite porous catalysts are synthesized using a mixture of Co and BaTiO3. In all the catalysts, structural heterogeneity manifests itself through defects, phase separation and increased porosity resulting in the creation of the high activity sites. The chemical heterogeneity results in reduced and oxidized domains and in very large changes in catalyst/support ratio. High electrical potential activity within BaTiO3 particles is observed through the formation of electrical treeing. Plasma generation starts as soon as the supported catalyst is synthesized. Two conditions for plasma generation are observed: Metal/Silica molar ratio should be > 1/2 and the resulting oxide should be spinel type; represented as MaOb (a = 3; b = 4 for single catalyst). Composite catalysts are represented as {M/Si = X}/BaTiO3 and obtained from the catalyst/silica precursor fluid with BaTiO3 particles which undergo fragmentation during microwave irradiation. Further irradiation causes plasma generation, NOx formation and lattice oxygen depletion. Partially reduced spinels are represented as MaOb-c. These reactions occur through a chemical looping process in micron-scale domains on the porous catalyst surface. Therefore; it is possible to scale-up this process to obtain NOx from MaOb for nitric acid production and H-2 generation from MaOb-c by catalyst re-oxidized by water. Re-oxidation by CO2 delivers CO as fuel. These findings explain the mechanism of conversion of combustion gases (CO2 + N-2) to CO and NOx via a chemical looping process. Mechanism of catalyst generation is proposed and the resulting structural inhomogeneity is characterized. Plasma generating catalysts also represent a new form of Radar Absorbing Material (RAM) for stealth and protection from radiation in which electromagnetic energy is dissipated by plasma generation and catalytic reactions. These catalytic RAMs can be expected to be more efficient in frequency independent microwave absorption.

TI  - Do angiosperms with highly divergent mitochondrial genomes have altered mitochondrial function?
VL  - 49
SP  - 1-11
AB  - Angiosperm mitochondrial (mt) genes are generally slow-evolving, but multiple lineages have undergone dramatic accelerations in rates of nucleotide substitution and extreme changes in mt genome structure. While molecular evolution in these lineages has been investigated, very little is known about their mt function. Some studies have suggested altered respiration in individual taxa, although there are several reasons why mt variation might be neutral in others. Here, we develop a new protocol to characterize respiration in isolated plant mitochondria and apply it to species of Silene with mt genomes that are rapidly evolving, highly fragmented, and exceptionally large (similar to 11 Mbp). This protocol, complemented with traditional measures of plant fitness, cytochrome c oxidase activity assays, and fluorescence microscopy, was also used to characterize inter- and intraspecific variation in mt function. Contributions of the individual "classic" OXPHOS complexes, the alternative oxidase, and external NADH dehydrogenases to overall mt respiratory flux were found to be similar to previously studied angiosperms with more typical mt genomes. Some differences in mt function could be explained by inter- and intraspecific variation. This study suggests that Silene species with peculiar mt genomes still show relatively normal mt respiration. This may be due to strong purifying selection on mt variants, coevolutionary responses in the nucleus, or a combination of both. Future experiments should explore such questions using a comparative framework and investigating other lineages with unusual mitogenomes.

TI  - The Molecular Chaperone DnaK Is a Source of Mutational Robustness
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SP  - 2979-2991
AB  - Molecular chaperones, also known as heat-shock proteins, refold misfolded proteins and help other proteins reach their native conformation. Thanks to these abilities, some chaperones, such as the Hsp90 protein or the chaperonin GroEL, can buffer the deleterious phenotypic effects of mutations that alter protein structure and function. Hsp70 chaperones use a chaperoning mechanism different from that of Hsp90 and GroEL, and it is not known whether they can also buffer mutations. Here, we show that they can. To this end, we performed a mutation accumulation experiment in Escherichia coli, followed by whole-genome resequencing. Overexpression of the Hsp70 chaperone DnaK helps cells cope with mutational load and completely avoid the extinctions we observe in lineages evolving without chaperone overproduction. Additionally, our sequence data show that DnaK overexpression increases mutational robustness, the tolerance of its clients to nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions. We also show that this elevated mutational buffering translates into differences in evolutionary rates on intermediate and long evolutionary time scales. Specifically, we studied the evolutionary rates of DnaK clients using the genomes of E. coli, Salmonella enterica, and 83 other gamma-proteobacteria. We find that clients that interact strongly with DnaK evolve faster than weakly interacting clients. Our results imply that all three major chaperone classes can buffer mutations and affect protein evolution. They illustrate how an individual protein like a chaperone can have a disproportionate effect on the evolution of a proteome.

TI  - Analysis of the genitalia rotation in the male Anopheles funestus (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 132
SP  - S20-S25
AB  - Anopheles funestus is a major malaria vector in Africa. Insecticide resistance has developed in populations of this species in several African countries, prompting the need to develop additional vector control methods such as the sterile insect technique (SIT). This technique requires an understanding of those underlying physiological events that lead to sexual maturity of An. funestus males, the rotation of their genitalia in particular. The aim of this study was to qualitatively and quantitatively describe genital rotation in An. funestus males as it is an essential function of sexual maturation. Genital rotation of all the males reached its final rotation stage (135-180 degrees rotation) 36 h post emergence at 23 +/- 1 degrees C in laboratory colonised An. funestus males. These males had a comparable rotation rate to wild caught An. funestus at the same temperature setting. A temperature change (either 18 +/- 1 degrees C or 29 +/- 1 degrees C versus 23 +/- 1 degrees C) significantly influenced the genital rotation rate such that this rate increased with increasing temperature. This information enhances our knowledge of the An. funestus male biology. This is important in terms of applying the sterile insect technique as the understanding and manipulation of the rate of sexual maturation in males has implications for the timing of sterile male release.

TI  - Is dietary or microhabitat specialization associated with environmental heterogeneity in horned lizards (Phrynosoma)?
VL  - 9
IS  - 10
SP  - 5542-5550
AB  - Niche breadth is predicted to correlate with environmental heterogeneity, such that generalists will evolve in heterogeneous environments and specialists will evolve in environments that vary less over space and time. We tested the hypothesis that lizards in a heterogeneous environment were generalists compared to lizards in a homogeneous environment. We compared niche breadths of greater short-horned lizards by quantifying resource selection in terms of two different niche axes, diet (prey items and trophic level), and microhabitat (ground cover and shade cover) between two populations occurring at different elevations. We assessed the heterogeneity of dietary and microhabitat resources within each population's environment by quantifying the availability of prey items, ground cover, and shade cover in each environment. Overall, our results demonstrate that despite differences in resource heterogeneity between elevations, resource selection did not consistently differ between populations. Moreover, environmental heterogeneity was not associated with generalization of resource use. The low-elevation site had a broader range of available prey items, yet lizards at the high-elevation site demonstrated more generalization in diet. In contrast, the high-elevation site had a broader range of available microhabitats, but the lizard populations at both sites were similarly generalized for shade cover selection and were similarly specialized for ground cover selection. Our results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity of a particular resource does not necessarily predict the degree to which organisms specialize on that resource.

AB  - Field studies were carried out at two sites in 2005 using common lambsquarters seed collected from long-term research plots near Scottsbluff, NE; Fort Collins, CO; and Torrington, WY, to determine the effect of herbicide selection pressure on glyphosate susceptibility. Parental herbicide exposure influenced the level of glyphosate susceptibility exhibited by a subsequent generation. Common lambsquarters selected from historical I plots receiving continuous and exclusive use of glyphosate exhibited lower mortality in response to 420 g ae ha(-1) glyphosate compared with selections from nonglyphosate treatment histories. Selections from rotating glyphosate treatment histories demonstrated an intermediate tolerance response. Differences in response were also influenced by environmental conditions.

TI  - The effect of discontinuous gas exchange on respiratory water loss in grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) varies across an aridity gradient
VL  - 218
IS  - 16
SP  - 2510-2517
AB  - The significance of discontinuous gas-exchange cycles (DGC) in reducing respiratory water loss (RWL) in insects is contentious. Results from single-species studies are equivocal in their support of the classic 'hygric hypothesis' for the evolution of DGC, whereas comparative analyses generally support a link between DGC and water balance. In this study, we investigated DGC prevalence and characteristics and RWL in three grasshopper species (Acrididae, subfamily Pamphaginae) across an aridity gradient in Israel. In order to determine whether DGC contributes to a reduction in RWL, we compared the DGC characteristics and RWL associated with CO2 release (transpiration ratio, i.e. the molar ratio of RWL to CO2 emission rates) among these species. Transpiration ratios of DGC and continuous breathers were also compared intraspecifically. Our data show that DGC characteristics, DGC prevalence and the transpiration ratios correlate well with habitat aridity. The xericadapted Tmethis pulchripennis exhibited a significantly shorter burst period and lower transpiration ratio compared with the other two mesic species, Ocneropsis bethlemita and Ocneropsis lividipes. However, DGC resulted in significant water savings compared with continuous exchange in T. pulchripennis only. These unique DGC characteristics for T. pulchripennis were correlated with its significantly higher mass-specific tracheal volume. Our data suggest that the origin of DGC may not be adaptive, but rather that evolved modulation of cycle characteristics confers a fitness advantage under stressful conditions. This modulation may result from morphological and/or physiological modifications.

TI  - Quality assessment of ferrous burdens: Utopian dream?
VL  - 60
SP  - 689-703
AB  - Many tests are in use to assess the quality of the ferrous burden for the blast furnace. Generally, these tests are designed to routinely control the agglomerate quality based on given blast furnace requirements. However, in the case of a burden design for an optimum blast furnace process, a test strategy based on blast furnace simulation tests is the justified approach. These simulation tests can either be based on the blast furnace operating line, or its working line. A careful selection of the applied process conditions, notably the heating rate, is a prerequisite since they have a major impact on the test results. Slow heating rates, like at the wall of the blast furnace, promote burden disintegration. Although knowledge on each burden component is beyond dispute, the understanding of the behaviour of the burden as a whole is emphasized and decisive in the set off to the optimum mixture of agglomerates in relation to its associated costs, the required blast furnace productivity and the reducing agent consumption. A single test suitable for all requirements on the whole burden might be an utopian dream, but with a conscious combination of blast furnace simulation tests, proper quality assessment is achievable.

TI  - Sustainability of forest management under changing climatic conditions in the southern United States: Adaptation strategics, economic rents and carbon sequestration
VL  - 139
SP  - 80-87
AB  - The impacts of climate change on profitability and carbon storage in even-aged forest stands of two dominant commercial pine species, loblolly and slash pine, in the southern United States were assessed under alternative assumptions about the impact of climate change on forest productivity and catastrophic disturbance rates. Potential adaptation strategies to reduce losses from disturbance included: 1) alternative planting densities, and 2) planting slash pine instead of loblolly pine. In addition, the amount of sequestered carbon was used to develop an index of economic efficiency for carbon sequestration, which further helps rank the suitability of alternative adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that greater economic rents from forests occur with lower planting densities and the substitution of slash pine for high density loblolly pine. However, less carbon is sequestered by low density loblolly pine compared to slash pine and high density loblolly pine. Both adaptation strategies are economically more effective in terms of carbon sequestration compared to the baseline since they generate more economic revenues per Mg of sequestered carbon.

AB  - This work provides a mathematical model and process simulations of a monolith reactor operated in Taylor mode and film flow mode. The three-phase hydrogenation of a-methylstyrene into cumene and the consecutive hydrogenation of phenyl acetylene were studied as model reactions. The influences of operating conditions and reactor parameters, such as superficial gas and liquid velocities, bed structure, pressure and temperature on conversion, selectivity and productivity were examined. This model also includes the correlations for estimating mass transfer coefficients and kinetic parameters obtained from the literature. The proposed model has been successfully verified with experimental data. A comparison of the reactor performance between Taylor flow and film flow under optimum operating conditions was carried out. Key operating parameters have been identified to maintain optimal performance, which can subsequently be used as criteria for design and scale up. Furthermore, the behaviour of a trickle-bed reactor was modelled using correlations from the literature. The simulations for both monolithic and trickle-bed reactors were performed under optimum operating conditions of each system. It shows that the monolith reactor has higher selectivity and increased product yield.

VL  - 7
IS  - 10
SP  - 6691-6698
AB  - A molecular catalyst, (sal)Mo-VI, and a heterogeneous catalyst, either Pd or Au nanoparticles (NPs), were integrated into one UiO-66 MOF microcrystal. The resulting dually functionalized catalysts, Pd@UiO-66-(sal)Mo and Au/UiO-66-(sal)Mo, have been utilized for a one-pot tandem reaction of H2O2 generation and selective liquid-phase alkene oxidation. The NPs serve as catalysts for the production of H2O2 from H-2 and O-2 gases, while the (sal)Mo moieties function as the oxidation catalyst. When the metal NPs are fully encapsulated within the MOF microcrystals, the alkene hydrogenation side reaction is largely suppressed, with a 6-fold decrease in the hydrogenation/oxidation product ratio for 5-bromo-1-cyclooctene favoring the epoxide as the major product. For Au/UiO-66-(sal)Mo, where the two catalysts are in close proximity on the MOF microcrystal, the enhancement in oxidation productivity is increased by 10 times in comparison to the [Au/UiO-66-NR2 + UiO-66-sal(Mo)] physical mixture of the two singly functionalized MOFs.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation in grassland degradation and its main drivers, based on biomass: Case study in the Altay Prefecture, China
VL  - 20
AB  - Analyzing the spatio-temporal characteristics and identifying of main factors that drive grassland degradation are essential for formulating ecological restoration measures for grassland. In this study, we addressed two main scientific questions: (1) how to accurately characterize the spatial and temporal variability in grassland degradation; and (2) how to identify the dominant factors that affect grassland degradation. Based on the data obtained from 270 field sampling points (912 quadrats) and MODIS, we selected the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), vegetation coverage ( VC), biomass and ecosystem service values (ESVs) to study the degradation of grassland in Altay Prefecture, China. From 2000 to 2016, the area with decrease in TVDI accounted for 93.4% of the total grassland. The VC values in the warm steppe and mountain meadow areas decreased by 5.3% and 1.6%, respectively, and the biomass decreased by 80% and 76.4% in these areas. Compared with 2000-2005, the mean total ESVs decreased by 5.1% in 2011-2016, where the reductions in the ESVs for warm steppe and mountain meadow accounted for 54.3% and 38% of the total reduction, respectively. The results showed that the degradation trends were more significant in the warm steppe and mountain meadow than the other land types. These findings improve our understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of grassland degradation. Human disturbance was the main factor responsible for grassland degradation in Altay Prefecture, according to the framework developed in this study based on biomass and TVDI metrics. Our results provide a reference for characterizing the spatio-temporal variability of grassland degradation by combining statistical and spatial analyses, as well as a simple framework for application in similar regions to analyze the effects of climate change and human disturbance on grassland degradation.

TI  - Genomic insights to facilitate the construction of a high-xylose-utilization Enterococcus faecalis OPS2 for 2,3-BDO production
VL  - 448
AB  - Sustainable bioconversion of plant biomass sugars for 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production is a carbon-neutral practice, however, its economic feasibility has been hindered by inefficient utilization of xylose. In this study, a novel Enterococcus faecalis strain OPS1 was isolated from palm oil-polluted soil, which assimilates xylose for 2,3-BDO production. While this wild-type strain OPS1 was suppressed with an increase in xylose concentration (60 g/L), strain OPS2, constructed using an adaptive laboratory evolution, achieved a desirable 2,3-BDO production with high-xylose (>100 g/L) tolerance. Whole-genome sequencing analysis reconstructed the metabolic pathways facilitating xylose utilization and 2,3-BDO production in these two novel strains that evolved within from a lactic acid-producing genus Enterococcus. A rpiB gene encoded for ribose-5-phosphate isomerase B enzyme of xylose metabolism in these two strains was identified to be horizontally acquired from a different family Enterobacteriaceae. The detection of a bacteriocin gene UviB and an antitoxin gene hicB in strain OPS1 and OPS2 which are absent in the E. faecalis type strain indicates their beneficial probiotic and antitoxin features. A mutation in uge (UDP-xylose 4-epimerase) was identified between strain OPS1 and OPS2 which may cater to the high-xylose stress. The evolved E. faecalis OPS2 showed a 3-fold increase in xylose consumption rate (2.19 g/L/h) with 0.67 g/L/h 2,3-BDO productivity than OPS1. For the first time, a maximum of 65.3 g/L 2,3-BDO was successfully produced via fed batch xylose fermentation. These results provide the genomic insights to the xylose regulatory metabolism in Enterococci and pave the way for industrial implication as a microbial biocatalyst in a 2,3-BDO biorefinery.

TI  - Practical Design Considerations for a Si IGBT plus SiC MOSFET Hybrid Switch: Parasitic Interconnect Influences, Cost, and Current Ratio Optimization
VL  - 34
IS  - 1
SP  - 724-737
AB  - In this paper, a hybrid switch (HyS) consisting of a large current rated Si insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) device connected in parallel with a small current rated SiC MOSFET device (low SiC/Si current ratio below unity) is proposed for high-current high-power converters. A systematic analysis involving a parametric sweep to understand the influence and to derive a boundary line of the parasitic interconnection inductance unbalance between Si and SiC within the HyS is presented. The boundary line prescribes the selection of an appropriate gate sequence control. A comprehensive cost analysis was performed using commercial 1.2 kV devices to demonstrate the cost viability of a 1:4 or 1:6 SiC/Si current ratio HyS compared to a SiC MOSFET. An algorithm using a dynamic junction temperature prediction is presented to select an optimum SiC/Si current ratio, which ensures a reliable HyS operation. Using a design example, the possibility of reliability using a 1:6 SiC/Si HyS is studied. A 650 V Si-IGBT- and SiC-MOSFET-based HyS (1:5 SiC/Si current ratio) was successfully demonstrated in a dc-dc boost converter. Also, electromagnetic interference analysis is presented for the HyS-based converter operation.

VL  - 41
AB  - Understanding the role of urbanization in extreme temperature events can help mitigate their negative impacts. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the effect of urbanization on extreme temperature events in Liaoning Province, China, from a spatiotemporal perspective. First, eight extreme temperature indices were selected from the temperature data for the period 1959-2018. Climatic regions corresponding to 24 meteorological stations were divided, and land use data were used to classify urban and rural areas. Then, the dynamic "urban minus rural" method was improved and used to quantify the urbanization effect (UE) and temporal variation trend of extreme temperature events. Furthermore, landscape indices were used to quantify the impact of the spatial layout of urban landscapes on extreme temperatures. The results showed that the UE in the northern region of Liaoning Province was reflected by most indices (minimum urbanization contribution, UC = 9.61%), while that in the southern region was mainly observed at night (maximum UC = 75.00% observed during frost days). The area and fragmentation of the urban landscape were the main spatial factors affecting extreme temperatures, primarily extremely high temperatures at night. Further, the highest correlation coefficient (-0.74) was between the contagion index and tropical nights index.

TI  - Simulated diurnal pH fluctuations radically increase variance in-but not the mean of-growth in the barnacle Balanus improvisus
VL  - 73
IS  - 3
SP  - 596-603
AB  - Shallow coastal waters are characterized by substantial diurnal fluctuations in pH, especially in nearshore environments. The biological effects of ocean acidification in combination with these natural fluctuations have received relatively little attention to date. We exposed multiple batches (approximate to different genotypes) of newly settled barnacles, Balanus improvisus, to constant pH under "control" (pH = 8.1) or "stable acidified" (pH = 7.7) conditions, as well as a treatment that simulated the maximum diurnal pH fluctuations seen in the nearshore habitats where this barnacle lives (+/- 0.2 pH units), superimposed on the stable acidified treatment ("fluctuating acidified"; 7.5 <= pH <= 7.9). We found that fluctuating acidification had no effect on mean response in growth and shell mineralogy, but caused an similar to 20-fold increase in variance of responses, compared with stable acidification. In contrast to these results, we found no effect of fluctuating acidification on variances of response ratios for barnacle survival and shell strength. Similarly, mean survival did not vary significantly with pH. However, we observed a strong negative effect of stable and fluctuating acidification on mean shell strength. Our finding that barnacles respond differently to fluctuating pH than to stable low pH indicate the importance of including fluctuating acidification treatments when studying species that live in variable environments. Importantly, because phenotypic variance is the raw material for natural selection, and thus lays at the heart of evolutionary responses to environmental variability and change, our findings also highlight the need to study changes in variance of-as well as mean-responses to changing ocean climates.

VL  - 111

SP  - 693-699
AB  - Conventional platelet storage in a blood bank is up to 5 days at room temperature in plasma. I We investigated the optimal medium for assessing the quality of stored platelets by comparing in vitro test responses after resuspension in autologous plasma prepared from platelet-rich plasma after 5 days of storage at room temperature, autologous plasma stored cell-free for 5 days at room temperature, or autologous plasma stored cell-free for 5 days at -20 degrees C. Five-day-old platelets were prepared from aliquots of the same unit and resuspended in 1 of the 3 plasma preparations. The platelet-plasma mixtures were monitored for changes in pH, mean platelet volume, hypotonic shock response, P-selectin expression, and aggregation. There were statistically significant differences between platelets resuspended in original plasma and platelets resuspended in either plasma stored cell-free at room temperature or frozen, with regard to hypotonic shock response, agonist-induced aggregation, and P-selectin expression. Plasma stored with platelets for 5 days yielded inferior platelet function test responses when? compared with plasma stored cell-free at room temperature or frozen. Therefore, for direct comparison of platelet responses following novel storage methods, the resuspending plasma should be stored under the same conditions as the control platelet unit.

TI  - A comparative analysis of the neutronic performance of thorium mixed with uranium or plutonium in a high-temperature pebble-bed reactor
VL  - 45
IS  - 11
SP  - 16824-16841
AB  - High-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) present an interesting concept for the next generation of nuclear reactors due to them having many advantages. In particular, their fuel is based on coated particles known as tri-structural-isotropic (TRISO) particles, and these provide a strong container capacity for fission products. Solid graphite acts as a moderator by delaying the transient temperature in the event of an accident, while neutronically inert helium acts as a coolant. What is more, several TRISO particle models are in various stages of development. Nowadays, numerous studies have sought to investigate the integration of thorium as a fertile absorber with a driver fuel (ie, U-233, U-235, or Pu-293) in nuclear reactors due to its natural abundance and its potential for producing fissile material (U-233). In addition, there are numerous perspectives for recycling and reusing the fissile isotopes released during thorium irradiation and the spent fuels from current reactors, with the main goal being to dispose of the world's growing stocks of radioactive waste and surplus weapons material. The primary objective of this study is not just to discuss the advantages of using thorium in a (pebble-bed type) HTGR but also to investigate how thorium can be incorporated into the fuel with different drivers and how this affects the neutronic parameters in comparison to the nominal HALEU (UO2 17 wt%) fuel. These parameters include the burnup behavior, spent fuel compositions, effective delayed neutron fractions, neutron spectra, and temperature coefficients. The investigated fuel mixtures include thoria (ThO2) fuel mixed with high-assay, low enriched uranium (HALEU 20 wt%), reactor-grade plutonium (RGPuO(2)), weapons-grade plutonium (WGPuO(2)), and U-233. Neutronic analyses show that cores fueled by (Th + U-233)O-2 and ThO2 + WGPuO(2) achieved higher excess reactivity at the beginning of cycle (BOC), compared with the UO2 core which achieves higher discharge burnups. Cores fueled by ThO2 + RGPuO(2), in contrast, can achieve higher discharge burnup despite having the lowest excess reactivity at BOC. Further comparisons of the examined fuel mixtures reveal that the (Th + U-233)O-2 and ThO2 + PuO2 mixtures have less favorable effective delayed neutron fractions and temperature coefficients than the UO2. However, the moderator temperature coefficients of the (Th + U-233)O-2 mixtures were sufficiently negative for all time steps.YY

TI  - The Usefulness of Selected Physicochemical Indices, Cell Membrane Integrity and Sperm Chromatin Structure in Assessments of Boar Semen Sensitivity
VL  - 28
IS  - 12
SP  - 1713-1720
AB  - The present work describes experiments undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of selected physicochemical indices of semen, cell membrane integrity and sperm chromatin structure for the assessment of boar semen sensitivity to processes connected with pre-insemination procedures. The experiments were carried out on 30 boars: including 15 regarded as providers of sensitive semen and 15 regarded as providers of semen that is little sensitive to laboratory processing. The selection of boars for both groups was based on sperm morphology analyses, assuming secondary morphological change incidence in spermatozoa as the criterion. Two ejaculates were manually collected from each boar at an interval of 3 to 4 months. The following analyses were carried out for each ejaculate: sperm motility assessment, sperm pH measurement, sperm morphology assessment, sperm chromatin structure evaluation and cell membrane integrity assessment. The analyses were performed three times. Semen storage did not cause an increase in the incidence of secondary morphological changes in the group of boars considered to provide sperm of low sensitivity. On the other hand, with continued storage there was a marked increase in the incidence of spermatozoa with secondary morphological changes in the group of boars regarded as producing more sensitive semen. Ejaculates of group I boars evaluated directly after collection had an approximately 6% smaller share of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes than the ejaculates of boars in group II (p <= 0.05). In the process of time the percentage of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes decreased. The sperm of group I boars was characterised with a lower sperm motility than the semen of group II boars. After 1 hour of storing diluted semen, the sperm motility of boars producing highly sensitive semen was already 4% lower (p <= 0.05), and after 24 hours of storage it was 6.33% lower than that of the boars that produced semen with a low sensitivity. Factors that confirm the accuracy of insemination male selection can include a low rate of sperm motility decrease during the storage of diluted semen, low and contained incidence of secondary morphological changes in spermatozoa during semen storage and a high frequency of spermatozoa with undamaged cell membranes.

AB  - Survey-based choice scenarios used to value non-market public goods typically preclude any risk that the benefits described may not be delivered. Our survey specifies explicit risks of (a) outright program failure and (b) program redundancy due to possible private sector substitutes. Additionally, most analyses assume that survey subjects fully accept these scenarios and that all provided information receives their complete attention. Our discounted expected utility model of choice accommodates both these objective risks and the possibility of subjective scenario adjustment or selective inattention by respondents. We then counterfactually simulate willingness-to-pay in the absence of these distortions.

TI  - Evolutionary potential of a widespread clonal grass under changing climate
VL  - 32
IS  - 10
SP  - 1057-1068
AB  - Adaptive responses are probably the most effective long-term responses of populations to climate change, but they require sufficient evolutionary potential upon which selection can act. This requires high genetic variance for the traits under selection and low antagonizing genetic covariances between the different traits. Evolutionary potential estimates are still scarce for long-lived, clonal plants, although these species are predicted to dominate the landscape with climate change. We studied the evolutionary potential of a perennial grass, Festuca rubra, in western Norway, in two controlled environments corresponding to extreme environments in natural populations: cold-dry and warm-wet, the latter being consistent with the climatic predictions for the country. We estimated genetic variances, covariances, selection gradients and response to selection for a wide range of growth, resource acquisition and physiological traits, and compared their estimates between the environments. We showed that the evolutionary potential of F. rubra is high in both environments, and genetic covariances define one main direction along which selection can act with relatively few constraints to selection. The observed response to selection at present is not sufficient to produce genotypes adapted to the predicted climate change under a simple, space for time substitution model. However, the current populations contain genotypes which are pre-adapted to the new climate, especially for growth and resource acquisition traits. Overall, these results suggest that the present populations of the long-lived clonal plant may have sufficient evolutionary potential to withstand long-term climate changes through adaptive responses.

TI  - Revisiting Trends in the Evolution of Egg Size in Hatchery-Enhanced Populations of Chinook Salmon from British Columbia
VL  - 139
IS  - 2
SP  - 579-585
AB  - Hatchery enhancement has been reported to result in an increase in egg size in coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch and a decline in egg size in Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha. Egg size may be directly influenced by selection, a larger egg size evolving as a consequence of hatchery incubation. Alternatively, a smaller egg size could evolve as a correlated response to fecundity selection, and a unidirectional change in egg size over time may reflect selection and an underlying genetic change in the population. To address this question, temporal trends in egg size were investigated for two hatchery-enhanced populations of Chinook salmon from Vancouver Island, British Columbia. After the effect of female length variation was removed by standardizing egg sizes to a female of common length (the overall mean for each population), there was no temporal trend in egg size from the 1970s to 2008 for any of the hatchery-enhanced populations evaluated. These results do not support a previous report of genetically based declines in egg size in hatchery-enhanced Chinook salmon populations from this region.

TI  - Influence of nest location and yolkless eggs on the hatching success of leatherback turtle clutches in French Guiana
VL  - 84
IS  - 6
SP  - 908-915
AB  - The hatching success of leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea (Vandelli, 1761), is influenced by heterogeneously distributed ecological factors. However, the hatching success according to nest-site selection has rarely been studied and little is known about the role of nest-site selection and infertile (yolkless) egg production on the predation rate and development of fertile eggs in leatherback turtle nests laid in French Guiana. A field study of 99 leatherback turtle nests was conducted to quantify the relationships between hatching success and (i) the nest-site selection (i.e., vegetation line, sea tide line) and (ii) the infertile eggs, especially their state after incubation (i.e., hydrated or dehydrated) and their effects on predation rate. We found that hatching success on this beach was very low (38.2%). This study illustrates that nest-site selection influences the predation rate and the dehydration of yolkless eggs, while the production of yolkless eggs by leatherback turtles has consequences on nest success. The proportion of yolkless eggs in the clutch, as well as their status at the end of incubation (hydrated or not, preyed upon), correlates with predation rate, development of yolked eggs, and hatching success. There was a significant relationship between nest location (relative to high tide line and vegetation line) and both the predation rates of eggs and the percentage of dehydrated yolkless eggs within a clutch. The production of yolkless eggs was related to hatching success and supports the hypothesis that yolkless eggs have a positive effect on the future of the clutch.

TI  - Restoring Global Gene Regulation through Experimental Evolution Uncovers a NAP (Nucleoid-Associated Protein)-Like Behavior of Crp/Cap
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - How do hierarchical gene regulation networks evolve in bacteria? Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) influence the overall structure of bacterial genomes, sigma factors and global transcription factors (TFs) control thousands of genes, and many operons are regulated by highly specific TFs that in turn are controlled allosterically by cellular metabolites. These regulatory hierarchies have been shaped by millions of years of evolution to optimize fitness in response to changing environmental conditions, but it is unclear how NAPs and TFs relate and have evolved together. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) is the paradigmatic global TF in Escherichia coli, and here we report that mutations in the topA gene compensate for loss of cAMP, showing that the interplay between Crp and the supercoiling status of promoters is key to global stress response. Furthermore, we observed an effect of apoCrp on gene expression in the absence of its effector cAMP. This provides support for the proposed NAP-like role for Crp, suggesting that it represents an intermediate point in the evolution of a ligandcontrolled TF from a NAP.

TI  - Transcriptome Expression of Biomineralization Genes in Littoraria flava Gastropod in Brazilian Rocky Shore Reveals Evidence of Local Adaptation
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
AB  - Understanding how selection shapes population differentiation and local adaptation inmarine species remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of evolutionary biology. The selection of genes in response to environment-specific factors and microenvironmental variation often results in chaotic genetic patchiness, which is commonly observed in rocky shore organisms. To identify these genes, the expression profile of the marine gastropod Littoraria flava collected from four Southeast Brazilian locations in ten rocky shore sites was analyzed. In this first L. flava transcriptome, 250,641 unigenes were generated, and 24% returned hits after functional annotation. Independent paired comparisons between 1) transects, 2) sites within transects, and 3) sites from different transects were performed for differential expression, detecting 8,622 unique differentially expressed genes. Araca (AR) and Sao Joao (SJ) transect comparisons showed the most divergent gene products. For local adaptation, fitness-related differentially expressed genes were chosen for selection tests. Nine and 24 genes under adaptative and purifying selection, respectively, were most related to biomineralization in AR and chaperones in SJ. The biomineralization-genes perlucin and gigasin-6 were positively selected exclusively in the site toward the open ocean in AR, with sequence variants leading to pronounced protein structure changes. Despite an intense gene flow among L. flava populations due to its planktonic larva, gene expression patterns within transects may be the result of selective pressures. Our findings represent the first step in understanding how microenvironmental genetic variation is maintained in rocky shore populations and the mechanisms underlying local adaptation in marine species.

TI  - Environmental conditions differently affect the wing size and shape of two blow fly species (Calliphoridae) of forensic importance in the Brazilian tropical ecosystems
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 1903-1911
AB  - Environmental pressures challenge the survivorship of wildlife, and adaptive ability is key to their success and establishment. However, it remains unclear how changes in environmental conditions affect the phenotypic plasticity of some species. Studies that consider the effect of the environment (e.g., climate changes) on species morphology are essential to better understand his potential resilience. Thus, Diptera species appear as an excellent model. Here we investigated the effect of environmental conditions on wing size and shape within and between one native and one invasive blowfly species populations, along an ecoregional gradient in Brazil. For native species, wing size was affected by almost all environmental variables, while wing shape was unaffected. For invasive species, humidity best explained both wing size and wing shape variation. Our results show a differentiation between populations for both species, but a transversal comparison reveals that invasive species do not seem to be affected in the same way as the native species by climatic variations in the field. Temperature and humidity are the most significant environmental variables associated with differences in wing size and shape for invasive species, indicating an elevated climate tolerance of this species, which may be associated with its invasive characteristics and adaptive potential. Thus, our findings shed light on the importance of assessing the individual and compound effect of environmental variation and biological invasion on the adaptation of native species, since it is expected to increase 3 degrees C with a 20% overall reduction in the amount of rainfall in the tropical region of Brazil by 2100.

TI  - Proteolytic enzymes in the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug Euschistus heros: Reduced activities in imidacloprid-resistant strains
VL  - 179
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-95
AB  - Proteases present in the salivary glands of phytosuccivorous insects are responsible for the initial breakdown of dietary protein into the amino acids necessary for insect growth and development. Here, we characterised the total proteases and trypsin-like activities in the salivary glands of the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros (F.) and used in silico and biochemical approaches to determine the interactions between trypsin-like enzymes and the soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (SKTI). Additionally, we evaluated whether these enzyme activities were affected in individuals resistant to the actions of the insecticide imidacloprid. We used an originally field-collected strain to select individuals resistant to imidacloprid alone (ImiGoiasRes) or synergised with piperonyl butoxide (ImiPBORes). A laboratory-susceptible (ImiSusc) strain was also used to select piperonyl butoxide synergised imidacloprid-resistant (ImiPBOSel) individuals. Our results revealed that pH and temperature significantly affected the specific trypsin-like activities in imidacloprid-susceptible individuals. Significant alterations in the total protease activities were recorded for field- (ImiGoiasRes) and laboratory-selected imidacloprid-resistant individuals (ImiPBOSel and ImiPBORes). Our computational docking analysis demonstrated that the molecular interactions and the presence of the SKTI inhibitor (0.5 mg mL(-1)) could reduce up to 40% of the trypsin-like activities of imidacloprid-susceptible individuals. However, all imidacloprid-resistant strains exhibited significantly less trypsin-like activities and exhibited lower hydrolysing velocity (V-MAX) and affinity (K-M) rates, and the prior exposure to SKTI only synergised the imidacloprid toxicity for individuals of ImiFieldRes strain. Collectively, our findings demonstrate, for the first time, insecticide resistance detrimentally affected the activities of proteolytic enzymes in phytosuccivorous stink bug pests.

VL  - 113
IS  - 3
SP  - 247-256
AB  - It has been proposed that population genetic structure at the mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (Mpi) locus in the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides (L.) could be due to selection by ice scour acting through variation in larval settlement behavior. Homogeneity of Mpi allele frequencies for barnacles within the Gulf of St. Lawrence could be maintained by a combination of selection and limited gene flow from populations of S. balanoides on the Atlantic coast of Canada south of the Cabot Strait. We sampled S. balanoides from 19 sites in Greenland and Baffin Island, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, Canada, in order to test these hypotheses. Presumptive genetic variation at 2 enzyme loci, Mpi and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Gpi), was quantified by isoelectric focusing. All populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and no linkage disequilibrium between loci was observed. We found significant spatial variation in allele frequencies at both loci. In particular, S. balanoides populations within the Gulf of St. Lawrence were not genetically homogeneous at either locus. A discontinuity in allele frequencies at both the Gpi and Mpi loci occurred in the vicinity of the Miramichi estuary, in the southern Gulf. Comparisons of allele frequencies between barnacle recruits and adults suggested this population structure may have resulted from selection, in the case of Mpi, possibly associated with environmental temperature. Selection by ice scour does not appear to affect spatial variation in allele frequencies in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

AB  - The ability of Listeria monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures is critical for transmission of this foodborne pathogen. We evaluated the contributions of different transcriptional regulators and two-component regulatory systems to L monocytogenes cold adaptation and cold growth. L. monocytogenes parent strain 10403S and selected isogenic null mutants in genes encoding four alternative sigma factors (sigB, sigH, sigC, and sigL), two regulators of sigma(B) (rsbT and rsbV), two negative regulators (ctsR and hrcA), and 15 two-component response regulators were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 4 degrees C with (i) a high-concentration starting inoculum (10(8) CFU/ml), (ii) a low-concentration starting inoculum (102 CFU/ml), and (iii) a high-concentration starting inoculum of cold-adapted cells. With a starting inoculum of 108 CFU/ml, null mutants in genes encoding selected alternative (T factors (Delta sigH, Delta sigC, and Delta sigL), a negative regulator (Delta ctsR), regulators of sigma(B) (Delta rsbT and Delta rsbV), and selected two-component response regulators (Delta lisR, Delta lmo,1172, and Delta lmo]060) had significantly reduced growth (P < 0.05) compared with the parent strain after 12 days at 4 degrees C. The growth defect for Delta sigL was limited and was not confirmed by optical density (OD600) measurement data. With a starting inoculum of 102 CFU/ml and after monitoring growth at 4 degrees C over 84 days, only the Delta ctsR strain had a consistent but limited growth defect; the other mutant strains had either no growth defects or limited growth defects apparent at only one or two of the nine sampling points evaluated during the 84-day growth period (Delta sigB, Delta sigC, and Delta lmo1172). With a 10(8) CFU/ml starting inoculum of cold-adapted cells, none of the mutant strains that had a growth defect when inoculation was performed with cells pregrown at 37 degrees C had reduced growth as compared with the parent strain after 12 days at 4 degrees C, suggesting a specific defect in the ability of these mutant strains to adapt to 4 degrees C after growth at 37 degrees C. Our data indicate (i) selected or factors and two-component regulators may contribute to cold adaptation even though two-component regulatory systems, alternative or factors, and the negative regulators CtsR and HrcA appear to have limited contributions to L. monocytogenes growth at 4 degrees C in rich media, and (ii) inoculum concentration and pregrowth conditions affect the L. monocytogenes cold-growth phenotype.

VL  - 53

SP  - 2225-2238
AB  - Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is an important turfgrass species used for lawns, sports fields, and recreational areas. Insufficient tolerance to subfreezing temperatures compromises its persistence in northern climates. A recurrent selection method, entirely performed indoors, was applied to two initial genetic backgrounds to generate populations putatively more tolerant to freezing (TF populations). The objective of the present study was to assess physiological and molecular responses after four cycles of selection (TF1-TF4). Freezing tolerance and cold-induced metabolites were monitored in plants hardened to natural variations in temperatures in fall and winter in an unheated greenhouse. Recurrent selection improved freezing tolerance expressed as the lethal temperature for 50% of the plants (LT50) and the vigor of regrowth after freezing. Significant changes in the levels of total and individual cold-induced carbohydrates (fructans) and amino acids (glutamine and proline) in crowns of hardened plants occurred in response to selection. Both groups of metabolites showed an opposite response to selection. The observation of DNA polymorphisms and progressive genetic differentiation between the initial populations and advanced cycles of selection suggests an impact of selection on allelic composition. Recurrent selection had a positive impact on freezing tolerance of perennial ryegrass through modifications in the molecular and genetic makeup of the populations.

VL  - 12
IS  - 17
AB  - Subtropical forests face pressure from both rapidly changing climate and increasing harvest activity in southern China. However, the interactive effects of various spatial processes on forests are not well known. The objective of the present study was to answer the question of how forest aboveground biomass (AGB) changes under alternative climate change and harvesting scenarios and to determine whether there will be a tipping point for forest AGB before 2300. Our simulation results show that, although total forest AGB did not reach a tipping point before 2300 under possible climate change and harvesting scenarios, the slope of the total forest AGB showed a decreasing trend around 2100 and 2200. Moderate climate warming was conducive to AGB accumulation, except for in the high emissions Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) scenario. Our results also indicate that timber harvesting is adaptable to the accumulation of biomass under climate change scenarios. Harvesting intensity was a key variable affecting forest AGB more than harvesting frequency. Our findings will help develop more sustainable forest management strategies that can adapt to potential climate change scenarios, as well as determining the effectiveness of implementing alternative forest harvesting policies.

AB  - Mutation breeding is one of the breeding methods used successfully in durum wheat for selecting lines with increased agronomic values. This study was carried out to determine gamma rays effect and interaction between gamma-rays and the genotype of treated variety of winter wheat in mutations induction. We used physical mutagens: gamma-rays in doses 100, 150, 200, 250 Gy. Seeds of eight winter wheat varieties were exposed with gamma-rays. Insensitive and most sensitive for mutagen actions varieties have been developed. Thirty-six different types mutated traits were observed. Among them there were seven valuable for breeding process. Mutations rate was waved from 0,4 to 30 %. Medium dose of gamma rays (100 Gy) is recommended for winter wheat mutation breeding and high dose (200 Gy) for obtaining genetic-value mutants (parent components for crossbreeding with some valuable traits like as semi-dwarf, early-heading and other). For high-productivity lines were identified. Positive desirable mutants will be selected and be incorporated in future breeding programs. We have shown that varieties obtained by gamma radiation are less sensitive to this mutagen. Their re-exposure is inappropriate by same mutagen. However, the varieties which obtained by field hybridization or treatment by mutagens of another nature (chemical agents, temperature) indicate a higher level of mutation rate and variability of traits.

SP  - 9-16
AB  - Laboratory scale determination of metallurgical characteristics of iron ores plays a major role in the evaluation of new orebodies, flowsheet development, plant design, process optimisation and quality, control. An important single factor affecting the productivity and efficiency of a blast furnace and DRI operation is the quality of the feedstocks charged in furnace. It has been the endeavour in the past few decades to evolve tests, in the light of the understanding of the physical chemistry of the blast furnace process, to assess the metallurgical characteristics of iron ores. It has been realised that it is virtually impossible to simulate conditions inside the blast furnace in evolving these tests. Laboratory tests, however have been devised by the International Standards Organization (ISO) to investigate, identity, and quantify, on a relative basis, an increasing number of burden properties to assess the extent of suitability of feedstocks for the blast furnace. This paper describes the laboratory test methods used for the resource evaluation and relative pre-determination of the criteria where the effects of temperature, gas composition and physical load in the blast furnace are duly considered. The correlation between the burden material tests and blast furnace performance is shown. Possible test methods for the direct reduction process plant are also presented and discussed.

The expression of the maximum yield of a plant is determined mainly for its genetic characteristics and the adaptation level to the predominant environmental conditions, factors that can also be affected by human management. Among the factors involved in crop production, climate appears to be the most difficult to control and the factor with the greatest impact on maximum yields. The principal climatic factors determining maximum yield are temperature, solar radiation and water, although others such as wind, photoperiod and atmospheric humidity can also play a role. Of the climatic elements, the most restrictive is water. The variability of water availability during the crop growth season is the main limitation to the expression of maximum soybean yield potential. The adoption of appropriate crop management practices can help minimize the negative effects of water shortage grain yields and farm revenue. However, any intervention in the production system must strive to obtain a optimum economical returns, based on sound technical knowledge. In the future, much of the potential increases in soybean yields will probably be related to the tolerance of new varieties to short drought periods. The adoption of Management practices, that increases water storage and/or plat available water in the soil, will also contribute greatly to, improve soybean productivity.

TI  - Optimization of Phytase Production by Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) under Solid-State Fermentation by Using Box Behnken Design
VL  - 65
AB  - Phytase production by Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) isolated from soil was investigated by solid-state fermentation (SSF) using wheat bran as substrate. After screening, morphological and molecular identification, Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) was selected for experiments due to high phytase activity. The SSF conditions were optimized by using one-variable-at-a-time strategy. A Box-Behnken design was employed to investigate the optimization of the most significant variables affecting the enzyme production. Maximum enzymes production was observed after 72 hrs with inoculums 2mL at 45 degrees C and pH 5. Maximum partial purification was obtained with 60% ammonium sulfate. Protein contents in crude extract and partially purified enzyme were found to be 9.58 and 3.95 mg/mL, respectively. Optimum temperature and pH of the partially purified phytase after characterization were found to be 45 degrees C and 5, respectively. The study of different metal ions sources revealed that Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions registered the highest enzyme productivity) but Zn2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Mn(2+)and Fe2+ ions exhibited inhibitory effect on phytase activity. Briefly, the Bacillus sp. (HCYL03) production of phytase utilizing the low-cost agro-residue wheat bran as substrate is an innovative and cheap way for the production of this important enzyme and opens a new way for researchers to investigate this dome.

TI  - Numerical analysis of gas recovery enhancement from natural gas hydrate reservoir by using a large-diameter casing
VL  - 262
AB  - Multi-well patterns and complex structural wells can enlarge the contact area between the wellbore and natural gas hydrate (NGH) to improve productivity significantly, but the construction cost of drilling is still too high. The previous study has proposed a self-entry exploitation device (SEED) with an enlarged device diameter, allowing more NGHs to dissociate simultaneously. While for conventional wellbore, a large-diameter casing may be applied in NGH development to enlarge the wellbore diameter of the production section. This work continued to study the influences of enlarged device/wellbore diameter on gas production characteristics, temperature-pressure evolutions, and the dissociation front movement pattern. The sensitivity analysis was also carried out by various reservoir and depressurization parameters under different wellbore diameters. Results show that the enlarged wellbore diameter can enlarge the drainage area and increase the dissociation efficiency. The tem-perature and pressure around the wellbore remain relatively stable, meeting the conditions for long-term pro-duction. Also, the dissociation front moves farther away faster as the wellbore diameter enlarges, accelerating NGH dissociation at distant wells. Finally, the sensitivity analysis reveals that the enlarged wellbore diameter enhances gas production significantly in unfavorable production parameters: poor production pressure, low permeability, low NGH saturation, and narrow reservoir thickness.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Molecular Insights in Overwintering Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae)
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - Monochamus alternatus, the dominant vector of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Aphelenchida: Aphelenchoididae), has caused immense damage to forest resources. In China, this vector was native to the southern regions but has spread northward recently. To adapt to more challenging environments in the northern winter, M. alternatus has evolved an intricate strategy for overwintering, which remains largely unknown. Herein, we compared the transcriptome data of the overwintering and non-overwintering larvae of M. alternatus larvae to investigate the molecular mechanisms in overwintering. A total of 53.10 GB clean bases and 28, 245 unigenes were obtained by RNA-seq. Analysis of 2597 upregulated and 2429 downregulated unigenes, as well as the enrichment of DEGs showed that many genes and pathways were jointly involved in the overwintering period. Besides, the accuracy of the RNA-seq data was tested by using qPCR experiment involving 13 selected genes. The results revealed that the overwintering process relied largely on the energy allocation trade-off. Specifically, overwintering M. alternatus inhibited energy-intensive activities, such as growth and molting, detoxification, and trehalose transport, and the reserved energy was skewed towards the synthesis of antifreeze compounds and immune response to cope with the deleterious effects of winter.

TI  - Ecotypes of European grass species respond differently to warming and extreme drought
VL  - 99
IS  - 3
SP  - 703-713
AB  - P>1. Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming. 2. Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited. 3. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be 'extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions. 4. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany. 5. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19 days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+1.5 K compared with control; +2.5 K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units). 6. Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes. 7. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general.

TI  - Non-ecological speciation, niche conservatism and thermal adaptation: how are they connected?
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SP  - 229-240
AB  - During the last decade, the ecological theory of adaptive radiation, and its corollary "ecological speciation", has been a major research theme in evolutionary biology. Briefly, this theory states that speciation is mainly or largely the result of divergent selection, arising from niche differences between populations or incipient species. Reproductive isolation evolves either as a result of direct selection on mate preferences (e.g. reinforcement), or as a correlated response to divergent selection ("by-product speciation"). Although there are now many tentative examples of ecological speciation, I argue that ecology's role in speciation might have been overemphasised and that non-ecological and non-adaptive alternatives should be considered more seriously. Specifically, populations and species of many organisms often show strong evidence of niche conservatism, yet are often highly reproductively isolated from each other. This challenges niche-based ecological speciation and reveals partial decoupling between ecology and reproductive isolation. Furthermore, reproductive isolation might often evolve in allopatry before ecological differentiation between taxa or possibly through learning and antagonistic sexual interactions, either in allopatry or sympatry. Here I discuss recent theoretical and empirical work in this area, with some emphasis on odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) and suggest some future avenues of research. A main message from this paper is that the ecology of species differences is not the same as ecological speciation, just like the genetics of species differences does not equate to the genetics of speciation.

TI  - Development of Range-Corrected Deep Learning Potentials for Fast, Accurate Quantum Mechanical/Molecular Mechanical Simulations of Chemical Reactions in Solution
VL  - 17
IS  - 11
SP  - 6993-7009
AB  - We develop a new deep potential-range correction (DPRc) machine learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are important in mechanistic studies of RNA- cleaving enzymes. Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2 semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6 angstrom. We further find that the model's initial training benefits from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure, so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.

TI  - Ocean Acidification Disrupts Prey Responses to Predator Cues but Not Net Prey Shell Growth in Concholepas concholepas (loco)
VL  - 8
IS  - 7
AB  - Background: Most research on Ocean Acidification (OA) has largely focused on the process of calcification and the physiological trade-offs employed by calcifying organisms to support the building of calcium carbonate structures. However, there is growing evidence that OA can also impact upon other key biological processes such as survival, growth and behaviour. On wave-swept rocky shores the ability of gastropods to self-right after dislodgement, and rapidly return to normal orientation, reduces the risk of predation. Methodology/Principal Findings: The impacts of OA on this self-righting behaviour and other important parameters such as growth, survival, shell dissolution and shell deposition in Concholepas concholepas (loco) were investigated under contrasting pCO(2) levels. Although no impacts of OA on either growth or net shell calcification were found, the results did show that OA can significantly affect self-righting behaviour during the early ontogeny of this species with significantly faster righting times recorded for individuals of C. concholepas reared under increased average pCO(2) concentrations (+/- SE) (716 +/- 12 and 1036 +/- 14 mu atm CO2) compared to those reared at concentrations equivalent to those presently found in the surface ocean (388 +/- 8 mu atm CO2). When loco were also exposed to the predatory crab Acanthocyclus hassleri, righting times were again increased by exposure to elevated CO2, although self-righting times were generally twice as fast as those observed in the absence of the crab. Conclusions and Significance: These results suggest that self-righting in the early ontogeny of C. concholepas will be positively affected by pCO(2) levels expected by the end of the 21st century and beginning of the next one. However, as the rate of self-righting is an adaptive trait evolved to reduce lethal predatory attacks, our result also suggest that OA may disrupt prey responses to predators in nature.

TI  - Genetic variation in senescence marker protein-30 is associated with natural variation in cold tolerance in Drosophila
VL  - 92
IS  - 2
SP  - 103-113
AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation in nature requires the identification of the functional allelic variation underlying adaptive phenotypes. The manner in which organisms respond to temperature extremes is an adaptation in many species. In the current study, we investigate the role of molecular variation in senescence marker protein-30 (Smp-30) on natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster. Smp-30 encodes a product that is thought to be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ ion homeostasis and has been shown previously to be differentially expressed in response to cold stress. Thus, we sought to assess whether molecular variation in Smp-30 was associated with natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance in a panel of naturally derived inbred lines from a population in Raleigh, North Carolina. We identified four non-coding polymorphisms that were strongly associated with natural phenotypic variation in cold tolerance. Interestingly, two polymorphisms that were in close proximity to one another (2 bp apart) exhibited opposite phenotypic effects. Consistent with the maintenance of a pair of antagonistically acting polymorphisms, tests of molecular evolution identified a significant excess of maintained variation in this region, suggesting balancing selection is acting to maintain this variation. These results suggest that multiple mutations in non-coding regions can have significant effects on phenotypic variation in adaptive traits within natural populations, and that balancing selection can maintain polymorphisms with opposite effects on phenotypic variation.

VL  - 10
IS  - 12
AB  - In this study, thermo-tolerant strain of Lactobacillus bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus) was developed using gradual increase in temperature to induce Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE). Viable colony count of 1.87 +/- 0.98 log cfu/mL was achieved at 52 degrees C, using MRS agar supplemented with 2% lactose. Changes in bacteria morphology were discovered, from rod (control) to filament (52 degrees C) to cocci after frozen storage (-80 degrees C). When milk was inoculated with thermo-tolerant L. bulgaricus, lactic acid production was absent, leaving pH at 6.84 +/- 0.13. This has caused weakening of the protein network, resulting in high whey separation and lower water-holding capacity (37.1 +/- 0.35%) compared to the control (98.10 +/- 0.60%). Significantly higher proteolytic activity was observed through free amino acids analysis by LC-MS. Arginine and methionine (237.24 +/- 5.94 and 98.83 +/- 1.78 mu g/100 g, respectively) were found to be 115- and 275-fold higher than the control, contributing to changing the aroma similar to cheese. Further volatile analysis through SPME-GC-MS has confirmed significant increase in cheese-aroma volatiles compared to the control, with increase in diacetyl formation. Further work on DNA profiling, metabolomics and peptidomics will help to answer mechanisms behind the observed changes made in the study.

TI  - Episodes of Aqueous Flooding and Effusive Volcanism Associated With Hrad Vallis, Mars
VL  - 123
IS  - 6
SP  - 1484-1510
AB  - Hrad Vallis is an Amazonian-age outflow channel located in the northwestern part of the Elysium Volcanic Province of Mars. The formation of Hrad Vallis may have been associated with catastrophic aqueous floods and volcanism, which makes determining its emplacement history important for constraining the planet's hydrological and thermal evolution during the Amazonian Period. Through geological mapping, geomorphologic analysis, and numerical simulations we assess whether Hrad Vallis formed in association with mudflows (i.e., lahars), effusive volcanism, or a combination of both processes. Among the three youngest flows in the region, the lower and upper flow units are inferred to be the products of catastrophic aqueous floods, whereas the middle unit is interpreted to be phoehoe-like lava flow formed through the process of inflation over the course of decades. The latter flow unit is similar to terrestrial lava-rise plateaus, but its emplacement may have involved interactions with surficial ice deposits, which affected the flow path and resulted in a range of lava-water interactions. We conclude that Hrad Vallis had a complex history involving episodes of both aqueous flooding and effusive volcanism and that the interactions between lava and ice in these regions may have generated ephemeral hydrothermal systems with potential astrobiological significance. Plain Language Summary Major outflow channels on Mars may have been carved by either catastrophic aqueous floods or turbulent lava flows. Addressing the ambiguous origin of these channels is therefore important for constraining the hydrological and volcanic history of the planet. This study focuses on Hrad Vallis, which is a geologically recent (Amazonian-age) outflow channel located within the Elysium Volcanic Province, through a combination of mapping and modeling. We find evidence for both aqueous flooding and effusive volcanism associated with this channel, indicating a complex hydrologic and geologic history. However, lava flows in this region are interpreted to be the products of phoehoe-like lava flow emplacement, similar to terrestrial lava flows on Earth in New Mexico and Hawaii, and not highly turbulent flows as previously suggested. The identification of similar to 50m thick phoehoe-like lava flows near Hrad Vallis implies a gradual formation process over the course of decades, and heat from these lava flows may have interacted with ground ice to produce meltwater and steam. Lava-water interactions on Mars are important because they could generate habitable environments for microbial organisms that have adapted for survival within hydrothermal systems.

TI  - Mantle material in the main belt: Battered to bits?
VL  - 31
IS  - 5
SP  - 607-620
AB  - The complete (or near complete) differentiation of a chondritic parent body is believed to result in an object with an Fe-Ni core, a thick olivine-dominated mantle and a thin plagioclase/pyroxene crust. Compositional groupings of iron meteorites give direct evidence that at least 60 chondritic parent bodies have been differentiated and subsequently destroyed. A long standing problem has been that our meteorite collections, and apparently our asteroid observations as well, show a great absence of olivine-dominated metal-free mantle material. While the basaltic achondrites (HED meteorites) represent metal-free pyroxene-dominated crustal samples, the isotopic and geochemical evidence implies that this class is derived from only one parent body (perhaps Vesta). Thus the meteoritic (and perhaps astronomical) evidence also suggests a great absence of crustal material resulting from the collisional disruption of numerous parent bodies. One explanation for the rarity of olivine-dominated metal-free and basaltic asteroids that fits all the available evidence is that all differentiated parent bodies, with the exception of Vesta, were either disrupted or had their crusts and mantles stripped very early in the age of the solar system. The resulting basaltic and olivine-dominated metal-free fragments were continually broken down until their sizes dropped at least below our current astronomical measurement limit (similar to 5-10 km for inner-belt objects) and perhaps completely comminuted such that meteorite samples are no longer delivered. Because of their greater strengths and longer survival time in interplanetary space, only the iron and the stony-iron meteorites remain as the final tracers of this differentiation and collisional history. However, other scenarios remain plausible such as those which invoke ''space weathering'' processes that effectively disguise the distinctive basaltic and olivine spectra of possible remnant crustal and mantle material within the main asteroid belt.

TI  - Potential Impacts of Global Warming on the Diversity and Distribution of Stream Insects in South Korea
VL  - 28
IS  - 2
SP  - 498-508
AB  - Globally, the East Asian monsoon region is one of the richest environments in terms of biodiversity. The region is undergoing rapid human development, yet its river ecosystems have not been well studied. Global warming represents a major challenge to the survival of species in this region and makes it necessary to assess and reduce the potential consequences of warming on species of conservation concern. We projected the effects of global warming on stream insect (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera [EOPT]) diversity and predicted the changes of geographical ranges for 121 species throughout South Korea. Plecoptera was the most sensitive (decrease of 71.4% in number of species from the 2000s through the 2080s) order, whereas Odonata benefited (increase of 66.7% in number of species from the 2000s through the 2080s) from the effects of global warming. The impact of global warming on stream insects was predicted to be minimal prior to the 2060s; however, by the 2080s, species extirpation of up to 20% in the highland areas and 2% in the lowland areas were predicted. The projected responses of stream insects under global warming indicated that species occupying specific habitats could undergo major reductions in habitat. Nevertheless, habitat of 33% of EOPT (including two-thirds of Odonata and one-third of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) was predicted to increase due to global warming. The community compositions predicted by generalized additive models varied over this century, and a large difference in community structure in the highland areas was predicted between the 2000s and the 2080s. However, stream insect communities, especially Odonata, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were predicted to become more homogenous under global warming. Impacto Potencial del Calentamiento Global sobre la Diversidad y la Distribucion de Insectos de Arroyo en Corea del Sur Resumen A nivel global, la region de monzon del este de Asia es uno de los ambientes mas ricos en cuanto a la biodiversidad. La region esta sufriendo un rapido desarrollo humano y sus ecosistemas fluviales no han sido bien estudiados aun. El calentamiento global representa un obstaculo mayor en la supervivencia de las especies en esta region y hace necesario estudiar y reducir las consecuencias potenciales del calentamiento sobre las especies de importancia para la conservacion. Proyectamos los efectos del calentamiento global sobre la diversidad de insectos de arroyo (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera [EOPT]) y predijimos los cambios de los rangos geograficos para 121 especies a lo largo y ancho de Corea del Sur. Plecotpera fue el orden mas sensible (disminucion del 71.4% en el numero de especies desde el 2000 hasta la decada de 2080), mientras que Odonata se beneficio de los efectos del calentamiento global (incremento del 66.7% desde el 2000 hasta la decada de 2080). El impacto del calentamiento global sobre insectos de arroyo se predijo seria minimo antes de 2060; sin embargo, para 2080, se predijo una extirpacion de especies hasta de 20% en las areas de tierras altas y del 2% en las areas de tierras bajas. Las respuestas proyectadas de insectos de arroyo bajo el calentamiento global indicaron que las especies que ocupan habitats especificos podrian sufrir una reduccion mayor en el habitat. Sin embargo, se predijo que el habitat del 33% de EOPT (incluyendo dos tercios de Odonata y un tercio de Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera y Trichoptera) incrementaria debido al calentamiento global. Las composiciones de la comunidad predichas por modelos aditivos generalizados vario en este siglo y una gran diferencia en la estructura de la comunidad en las areas de tierras altas se predijo entre 2000 y 2080. Sin embargo, se predijo que las comunidades de insectos de arroyo, especialmente Odonata, Plecoptera y Trichoptera, se volverian mas homogeneas bajo el calentamiento global.

SP  - 41-46
AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the possibility of the use of zeolites in agriculture. Zeolites are a large group of aluminosilicate minerals with different chemical composition. Due to their unique physical and chemical properties (high sorption capacity, ion-exchange selectivity and structural thermal stability), they can be used for example in the production of mineral fertilizers. Their addition increases plant production levels and improves soil properties. Also, zeolite can be used for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy metals.

VL  - 65

AB  - It is agreed that climate (precipitation and temperature) influences the distribution of plant species. Near the margins of a species' natural range, climate becomes limiting to physiological processes. There, climate change may be expected to have a significant impact on tree growth and the species' ranges may be altered. In order to assess what influence climate change could exert on the distribution of pine species at their margin, radial growth trends in ring-width chronologies over the last century were analysed. In the French Mediterranean area where climate change is characterized by increased temperature, forest plots were selected along an altitudinal transect on the north-facing slope of the Sainte-Baume mountain (Bouches-du-Rhone, France) where the ranges of Pinus sylvestris and Pinus halepensis overlap. Two growth patterns were identified. For P. halepensis, radial growth has increased at all altitudes indicating that climate change has improved growth conditions of this species near the margin of its ecological range. For P. sylvestris, radial growth has increased only at low altitudes and even decreased at high altitudes. It must be deduced that the growth changes observed cannot be generalised either at the species level or at the geographical level and must be interpreted with great caution.

VL  - 110
SP  - 31-40
AB  - The effect of projected future changes in temperature, wind speed, precipitation and particulate organic carbon on concentrations of persistent organic chemicals in the Baltic Sea regional environment is evaluated using the POPCYCLING-Baltic multimedia chemical fate model. Steady-state concentrations of hypothetical perfectly persistent chemicals with property combinations that encompass the entire plausible range for non-ionizing organic substances are modelled under two alternative climate change scenarios (IPCC A2 and B2) and compared to a baseline climate scenario. The contributions of individual climate parameters are deduced in model experiments in which only one of the four parameters is changed from the baseline scenario. Of the four selected climate parameters, temperature is the most influential, and wind speed is least. Chemical concentrations in the Baltic region are projected to change by factors of up to 3.0 compared to the baseline climate scenario. For chemicals with property combinations similar to legacy persistent organic pollutants listed by the Stockholm Convention, modelled concentration ratios between two climate change scenarios and the baseline scenario range from factors of 0.5 to 2.0. This study is a first step toward quantitatively assessing climate change-induced changes in the environmental concentrations of persistent organic chemicals in the Baltic Sea region.

TI  - A remote sensing monitoring method for alpine grasslands desertification in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
SP  - 1423-1437
AB  - Alpine grassland is the typical vegetation in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which has important ecological service functions, and also supports the development of alpine stock farming. In recent years, under both the natural and human disturbance, alpine grasslands in this area have appeared to different degrees of desertification. A diagnosis of the desertification degree serves as the basis for grassland ecological restoration. This study constructs a comprehensive index based on remote sensing called alpine grassland desertification index (AGDI) to monitor the areas and degree of desertification. The most relevant indicators of desertification, namely, vegetation fraction, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and land surface temperature, were selected to establish AGDI. The geographical detector is used to reselect and assess these indicators. The results show that the overall verification accuracy of AGDI is 82.05%. In particular, the accuracy of identifying severe desertification is the highest. Our study confirms that the desertification of alpine grasslands in the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is characterized by fragmentation. Thus, Landsat-8 OLI data with a spatial resolution of 30 m is more suitable than MODIS data for alpine grasslands desertification monitoring. The research results can provide a methodological reference for monitoring desertification of alpine grasslands and other grassland regions in the world.

VL  - 12
IS  - 20
AB  - End energy user is dependent on fossil fuel-based main-grid and contributes toward greenhouse gasses (GHG) emissions. Changing its energy source will change the dynamics of the power plant, contribution towards GHG production. This case study aims to highlight the minute but positive role of a single end energy user, invisible to the main grid in GHG mitigations through photovoltaic energy source, selected among Pakistan's top 10 most populous cities as per census 2017. Quetta is a selected city in Pakistan as the best fit location based on annual average daily solar radiations (AADSR) data retrieved from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) meteorological data. Helioscope software is used to select -15 degrees tilt and 180 degrees azimuthal angles, which further increased Quetta's AADSR value from 5.54 kWh/m(2)/d to 5.93 kWh/m(2)/d. For research significance, a realistic approach is undertaken by proper selection of solar panel type based on Quetta's annual average temperature, load categorization, user selection and inputs from a solar energy expert. Finally, initial cost, investment and GHG mitigation analysis are carried out in RETScreen Expert software, which validates the minute but the prominent role of a single, end energy user by mitigating 122 tons of CO2 in 25-year project life span. Further, the proposed project favors end-user financially by recovering its $4501 initial cost in less than four years by effectively meeting its energy demand and saving $1195 per annum.

VL  - 33

SP  - 295-308
AB  - Lynn (1987, 1991ab) hypothesized that the Eurasian ecological niche is the selective agent responsible for racial differences in intelligence. More specifically, the difficulties of survival in cold northern latitudes necessitated increased intelligence. This explanation could account for the lower IQ scores of Negroid populations relative to Caucasoid and Mongoloid populations. However, the IQ scores of Amerindians, who are Mongoloids, was inconsistent with that hypothesis. In order to account for that anomaly, Lynn argued that Amerindians are the descendants of an archaic Mongoloid population that crossed the Bering Land Bridge before the main Wurm glaciation, and thus, escaped the selective forces that impelled further increases in Asiatic Mongoloid intelligence. The anthropological evidence, however, fails to support Lynn's hypothesis. It is suggested instead that disease and war were dysgenic selective forces affecting the current IQ scores of Amerindians.

TI  - Surface-circulation change in the southwest Pacific Ocean across the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum: inferences from dinoflagellate cysts and biomarker paleothermometry
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
SP  - 1667-1689
AB  - Global climate cooled from the early Eocene hothouse (similar to 52-50 Ma) to the latest Eocene (similar to 34 Ma). At the same time, the tectonic evolution of the Southern Ocean was characterized by the opening and deepening of circum-Antarctic gateways, which affected both surface- and deep-ocean circulation. The Tasmanian Gateway played a key role in regulating ocean throughflow between Australia and Antarctica. Southern Ocean surface currents through and around the Tasmanian Gateway have left recognizable tracers in the spatiotemporal distribution of plankton fossils, including organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts. This spatiotemporal distribution depends on both the physicochemical properties of the water masses and the path of surface-ocean currents. The extent to which climate and tectonics have influenced the distribution and composition of surface currents and thus fossil assemblages has, however, remained unclear. In particular, the contribution of climate change to oceanographic changes, superimposed on long-term and gradual changes induced by tectonics, is still poorly understood. To disentangle the effects of tectonism and climate in the southwest Pacific Ocean, we target a climatic deviation from the long-term Eocene cooling trend: the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; similar to 40 Ma). This 500 kyr phase of global warming was unrelated to regional tectonism, and thus provides a test case to investigate the ocean's physicochemical response to climate change alone. We reconstruct changes in surface-water circulation and temperature in and around the Tasmanian Gateway during the MECO through new palynological and organic geochemical records from the central Tasmanian Gateway (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1170), the Otway Basin (southeastern Australia), and the Hampden Beach section (New Zealand). Our results confirm that dinocyst communities track specific surface-ocean currents, yet the variability within the communities can be driven by superimposed temperature change. Together with published results from the east of the Tasmanian Gateway, our new results suggest a shift in surface-ocean circulation during the peak of MECO warmth. Simultaneous with high sea-surface temperatures in the Tasmanian Gateway area, pollen assemblages indicate warm temperate rainforests with paratropical elements along the southeastern margin of Australia. Finally, based on new age constraints, we suggest that a regional southeast Australian transgression might have been coincident with the MECO.

TI  - The 2011 heat wave in Greater Houston: Effects of land use on temperature
VL  - 135
SP  - 81-87
AB  - Effects of land use on temperatures during severe heat waves have been rarely studied. This paper examines land use-temperature associations during the 2011 heat wave in Greater Houston. We obtained high resolution of satellite-derived land use data from the US National Land Cover Database, and temperature observations at 138 weather stations from Weather Underground, Inc (WU) during the August of 2011, which was the hottest month in Houston since 1889. Land use regression and quantile regression methods were applied to the monthly averages of daily maximum/mean/minimum temperatures and 114 land use-related predictors. Although selected variables vary with temperature metric, distance to the coastline consistently appears among all models. Other variables are generally related to high developed intensity, open water or wetlands. In addition, our quantile regression analysis shows that distance to the coastline and high developed intensity areas have larger impacts on daily average temperatures at higher quantiles, and open water area has greater impacts on daily minimum temperatures at lower quantiles. By utilizing both land use regression and quantile regression on a recent heat wave in one of the largest US metropolitan areas, this paper provides a new perspective on the impacts of land use on temperatures. Our models can provide estimates of heat exposures for epidemiological studies, and our findings can be combined with demographic variables, air conditioning and relevant diseases information to identify 'hot spots' of population vulnerability for public health interventions to reduce heat-related health effects during heat waves.

TI  - Nest site selection in leatherbacks, Dermochelys coriacea: individual patterns and their consequences
VL  - 68
SP  - 357-366
AB  - We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Cultivating climate justice: Green infrastructure and suburban disadvantage in Australia
VL  - 89
SP  - 52-60
AB  - Green infrastructure has recently risen to international prominence for its purported capacity to enhance urban sustainability, and particularly to modulate ambient temperatures in the context of climate change. We assess whether residents in a sub-tropical Australian city perceive green infrastructure as an effective climate adaptation response for reducing vulnerability to heat stress. Gold Coast City has pursued urban densification policies, such as reducing block sizes and increasing building heights, to accommodate rapid population growth. Little attention has been given to the combined impact of local heat island effects and global climate change upon lower-income residents in the city's suburban fringe, including rising energy costs associated with cooling homes. The study has three aims: to assess whether social disadvantage is associated with (1) concern about climate change impacts; (2) perceptions about the potential of green infrastructure to offer potential climate adaptive benefits; and (3) the desire for more urban greening in a working class suburb. We used a mail-back survey to elicit information related to cooling dwellings, awareness of, and concern about, climate change impacts, perceptions of the benefits of green infrastructure, and desire for more urban greening. Results indicate that despite their vulnerability to heat stress, comparatively disadvantaged residents are no more concerned about climate change; nor are they any more inclined to encourage local government to enhance neighbourhood greenery. These residents are, if anything, less likely to perceive benefits of urban greening. Our findings indicate that cultivating support for green infrastructure in disadvantaged neighbourhoods will require parallel efforts to redress inequality.

VL  - 24
IS  - 10
SP  - 4696-4708
AB  - Human and natural systems have adapted to and evolved within historical climatic conditions. Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to alter these conditions such that onset of unprecedented climatic extremes will outpace evolutionary and adaptive capabilities. To assess whether and when future climate extremes exceed their historical windows of variability within impact-relevant socioeconomic, geopolitical, and ecological domains, we investigate the timing of perceivable changes (time of emergence; TOE) for 18 magnitude-, frequency-, and severity-based extreme temperature (10) and precipitation (8) indices using both multimodel and single-model multirealization ensembles. Under a high-emission scenario, we find that the signal of frequency- and severity-based temperature extremes is projected to rise above historical noise earliest in midlatitudes, whereas magnitude-based temperature extremes emerge first in low and high latitudes. Precipitation extremes demonstrate different emergence patterns, with severity-based indices first emerging over midlatitudes, and magnitude- and frequency-based indices emerging earliest in low and high latitudes. Applied to impact-relevant domains, simulated TOE patterns suggest (a) unprecedented consecutive dry day occurrence in >50% of 14 terrestrial biomes and 12 marine realms prior to 2100, (b) earlier perceivable changes in climate extremes in countries with lower per capita GDP, and (c) emergence of severe and frequent heat extremes well-before 2030 for the 590 most populous urban centers. Elucidating extreme-metric and domain-type TOE heterogeneities highlights the challenges adaptation planners face in confronting the consequences of elevated twenty-first century radiative forcing.

VL  - 40
IS  - 4
SP  - 625-639
AB  - Within a similar to 60-Myr interval in the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic, a major mass extinction took place at the end of Triassic, and several biotic and environmental events of lesser magnitude have been recognized. Climate warming, ocean acidification, and a biocalcification crisis figure prominently in scenarios for the end-Triassic event and have been also suggested for the early Toarcian. Radiolarians, as the most abundant silica-secreting marine microfossils of the time, provide a control group against marine calcareous taxa in testing selectivity and responses to changing environmental parameters. We analyzed the origination and extinction rates of radiolarians, using data from the Paleobiology Database and employing sampling standardization, the recently developed gap-filler equations and an improved stratigraphic resolution at the substage level. The major end-Triassic event is well-supported by a late Rhaetian peak in extinction rates. Because calcifying and siliceous organisms appear similarly affected, we consider global warming a more likely proximate trigger of the extinctions than ocean acidification. The previously reported smaller events of radiolarian turnover fail to register above background levels in our analyses. The apparent early Norian extinction peak is not significant compared to the long-term trajectory, and is probably a sampling artifact. The Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, previously also thought to have caused a significant radiolarian turnover, did not significantly affect the group. Radiolarian diversity history appears unique and complexly forced, as its trajectory parallels major calcareous fossil groups at some events and deviates at others.

TI  - Environmental change and the rate of phenotypic plasticity
VL  - 28
IS  - 18
SP  - 5337-5345
AB  - With rapid and less predictable environmental change emerging as the 'new norm', understanding how individuals tolerate environmental stress via plastic, often reversible changes to the phenotype (i.e., reversible phenotypic plasticity, RPP), remains a key issue in ecology. Here, we examine the potential for better understanding how organisms overcome environmental challenges within their own lifetimes by scrutinizing a somewhat overlooked aspect of RPP, namely the rate at which it can occur. Although recent advances in the field provide indication of the aspects of environmental change where RPP rates may be of particular ecological relevance, we observe that current theoretical models do not consider the evolutionary potential of the rate of RPP. Whilst recent theory underscores the importance of environmental predictability in determining the slope of the evolved reaction norm for a given trait (i.e., how much plasticity can occur), a hitherto neglected possibility is that the rate of plasticity might be a more dynamic component of this relationship than previously assumed. If the rate of plasticity itself can evolve, as empirical evidence foreshadows, rates of plasticity may have the potential to alter the level predictability in the environment as perceived by the organism and thus influence the slope of the evolved reaction norm. However, optimality in the rate of phenotypic plasticity, its evolutionary dynamics in different environments and influence of constraints imposed by associated costs remain unexplored and may represent fruitful avenues of exploration in future theoretical and empirical treatments of the topic. We conclude by reviewing published studies of RPP rates, providing suggestions for improving the measurement of RPP rates, both in terms of experimental design and in the statistical quantification of this component of plasticity.

TI  - Improving active space telescope wavefront control using predictive thermal modeling
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - Active control algorithms for space telescopes are less mature than those for large ground telescopes due to differences in the wavefront control problems. Active wavefront control for space telescopes at L2, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), requires weighing control costs against the benefits of correcting wavefront perturbations that are a predictable byproduct of the observing schedule, which is known and determined in advance. To improve the control algorithms for these telescopes, we have developed a model that calculates the temperature and wavefront evolution during a hypothetical mission, assuming the dominant wavefront perturbations are due to changes in the spacecraft attitude with respect to the sun. Using this model, we show that the wavefront can be controlled passively by introducing scheduling constraints that limit the allowable attitudes for an observation based on the observation duration and the mean telescope temperature. We also describe the implementation of a predictive controller designed to prevent the wavefront error (WFE) from exceeding a desired threshold. This controller outperforms simpler algorithms even with substantial model error, achieving a lower WFE without requiring significantly more corrections. Consequently, predictive wavefront control based on known spacecraft attitude plans is a promising approach for JWST and other future active space observatories. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Effect of monocropping on maize yield on meadow soil in long-term fertilization experiments
VL  - 44
IS  - 4
SP  - 359-374
AB  - The yield changes' of maize produced in crop-rotation and monoculture were studied on the basis of data collected from filed experiments on meadow soil. The experiments are part of the National Long-Term Fertilization Experiment started in 1966. Applied crop-rotations in the experiment: a) triculture: pea - wheat - maize - maize; b) biculture: wheat - maize - wheat; c) monoculture: since 1966. The soil characteristics of the experiments are: difficult tillage, slow mineralization of N in the springtime and considerable absorption of P, K. The study covers the period between 1982-1993. I present the amounts of the yearly precipitation (Table 1.) and precipitation fallen in the vegetation period of maize compared to the average. Heavy drought occurred in 1982-83-86-90-93. During the examined 12 years the precipitation was 1600.7 mm less than the 50-years average. Because of the global warming half of the examined years were droughty. Maize can tolerate the partial monoculture considerably well, but after 10-15 years of monocropping the yield decreases by 1-3 t/ha in droughty years compared to the yields achieved in crop rotation. Monocultural maize yields decreased significanty in 1983,'90,'92,'93. The best forecrop for maize was the wheat. The forecrop influences the requierement for fertilizer. The best yields were obtained as follows: after wheat in triculture (pea-wheat-maize) with a dose of 50-60 kg/ha N, in biculture (wheat-maize) with a dose of 60-80 kg/ha N, after maize in biculture with a dose of 80-100 kg/ha N, and in monoculture with a dose of 100-120 kg/ha N. In monoculture cropping the number of bacteria in the soil decreased significantly. The number of bacteria in 1 g soil was 59 million after wheat, 285 million after maize, and only 16 million in monoculture cropping, which can effect the soil life considerably. In monoculture cropping the Zn content of the grain decreased by 4-5 mg/kg which can limit the yield or cause losses in nutritive value. The yield decrease of monocultural maize can be explained by the impoverishment of the soil water supply. Thus the monocropping of maize, particularly in areas with poor rainfall, must be placed into crop-rotation after 10-15 years of monoculture. The risk of monocropping should be decreased by using partial monoculture, a hybrid with good adaptability, 5-10 thousand less plant density per hectare and irrigation if the conditions are given.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a global threat due to the ability of bacteria to quickly evolve in response to the selection pressure induced by anti-infective drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics against resistant bacteria. In this review, we discuss pathways involving bacterial protein biogenesis as attractive antibacterial targets since many of them are essential for bacterial survival and virulence. We discuss the structural understanding of various components associated with bacterial protein biogenesis, which in turn can be utilized for rational antibiotic design. We highlight efforts made towards developing inhibitors of these pathways with insights into future possibilities and challenges. We also briefly discuss other potential targets related to protein biogenesis.

TI  - The evolution of the Indian nuclear power programme
VL  - 101
SP  - 4-18
AB  - The strategy for growth of nuclear power in India was planned nearly sixty years ago, noting the rather small uranium and large thorium reserves in the country. This has prompted India to adopt the well-known three stage programme. The first stage is primarily based on the Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs). The evolution of technology of PHWRs is discussed in the first part of this paper. India has constructed eighteen PHWRs, has achieved impressive availability factors and some of these reactors have achieved annual capacity factors of nearly hundred percent in the recent past. Having installed a nuclear power generation capacity of 6780 MWe (4460 MWe from PHWRs, 2000 MWe from PWRs and 320 MWe from BWRs), India is now poised to launch a major expansion programme. This will be based on the increased availability of uranium from import and from the augmented domestic supply. In the immediate future, the nuclear power capacity will grow by installing a series of indigenous PHWRs in addition to, light water reactors built under international civil nuclear cooperation agreements. The growth of nuclear capacity in this period is aimed at increasing the share of nuclear power in meeting the base-load demand of non-carbon electricity required for the rapid economic growth in the country. India embarked on its second stage programme with the successful operation of a research reactor named Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR). Based on the experience of FBTR and following the development of all the required enabling technologies in India, the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) of 500 MWe (gross) capacity has been designed, constructed and is now at an advanced stage of commissioning. A large increase in the nuclear power generation capacity is envisaged through deployment of fast breeder reactors. These reactors will not only help in building up nuclear power capacity but also, in due course, enable conversion of thorium into fissile U-233, which will fuel the reactors in the third stage of India's nuclear programme. The adoption of the closed fuel cycle for both thermal and fast reactors has dual objectives: multiplying the fissile inventory by fertile to fissile conversion and reducing the burden of long lived radioactive waste-both being essential for attaining near sustainability of nuclear power. India has designed an Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR). This reactor can use one of the following fuels: (i) Low enriched uranium dioxide-thorium dioxide based mixed oxide (MOX) fuel primarily in once through mode. (ii) Plutonium dioxide thorium dioxide MOX fuel in the closed fuel cycle mode. Eventually when enough of U-233 is generated the reactor can operate with the U-233 thorium MOX fuel. A large number of passive safety features are incorporated in this design. As a part of the long term objective of the development of Accelerator Driven Sub-critical Systems (ADSS), work on the development of high power linear accelerator has been initiated.

VL  - 39
IS  - 4
AB  - Drought or water deficit stress is one of the main environmental stresses affecting plants, resulting in reduced productivity and crop loss. Black pepper, a major spice cultivated across the globe, is drought sensitive and water stress often results in plant death. The present study compared the difference in physiological parameters: relative water content (RWC) and cell membrane leakage, and also analyzed the differential expression of 11 drought responsive genes in drought tolerant and drought sensitive black pepper genotypes. Tolerant black pepper genotype exhibited significantly higher RWC and lower cell membrane leakage 10 days after stress induction than the sensitive genotype. The relative expressions of the 11 selected drought responsive genes were normalized against ubiquitin and RNA-binding protein which was identified as the most stable reference genes in black pepper under the present experimental condition using the RefFinder software. Dehydrin showed the highest transcript accumulation in both the black pepper genotypes under drought stress condition and the relative expression of the gene was higher in the tolerant genotype compared to the susceptible. Similar pattern of higher relative expression was also observed in the stress responsive gene, osmotin. The membrane protein aquaporin and the transcription factor bZIP were relatively down-regulated in the tolerant genotype. The differential expression of these important drought responsive genes in tolerant genotype of black pepper indicates its further usefulness in developing varieties with improved water stress tolerance.

TI  - Enhancing the Bioconversion of Azelaic Acid to Its Derivatives by Response Surface Methodology
VL  - 23
IS  - 2
AB  - Azelaic acid (AzA) and its derivatives have been known to be effective in the treatment of acne and various cutaneous hyperpigmentary disorders. The esterification of azelaic acid with lauryl alcohol (LA) to produce dilaurylazelate using immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica (Novozym 435) is reported. Response surface methodology was selected to optimize the reaction conditions. A well-fitting quadratic polynomial regression model for the acid conversion was established with regards to several parameters, including reaction time and temperature, enzyme amount, and substrate molar ratios. The regression equation obtained by the central composite design of RSM predicted that the optimal reaction conditions included a reaction time of 360 min, 0.14 g of enzyme, a reaction temperature of 46 degrees C, and a molar ratio of substrates of 1:4.1. The results from the model were in good agreement with the experimental data and were within the experimental range (R-2 of 0.9732). The inhibition zone can be seen at dilaurylazelate ester with diameter 9.0 +/- 0.1 mm activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis S273. The normal fibroblasts cell line (3T3) was used to assess the cytotoxicity activity of AzA and AzA derivative, which is dilaurylazelate ester. The comparison of the IC50 (50% inhibition of cell viability) value for AzA and AzA derivative was demonstrated. The IC50 value for AzA was 85.28 mu g/mL, whereas the IC50 value for AzA derivative was more than 100 mu g/mL. The 3T3 cell was still able to survive without any sign of toxicity from the AzA derivative; thus, it was proven to be non-toxic in this MTT assay when compared with AzA.

TI  - Mechanobiological Modulation of Cytoskeleton and Calcium Influx in Osteoblastic Cells by Short-Term Focused Acoustic Radiation Force
VL  - 7
IS  - 6
AB  - Mechanotransduction has demonstrated potential for regulating tissue adaptation in vivo and cellular activities in vitro. It is well documented that ultrasound can produce a wide variety of biological effects in biological systems. For example, pulsed ultrasound can be used to noninvasively accelerate the rate of bone fracture healing. Although a wide range of studies has been performed, mechanism for this therapeutic effect on bone healing is currently unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of cellular response to mechanical stimuli induced by pulsed ultrasound radiation, we developed a method to apply focused acoustic radiation force (ARF) (duration, one minute) on osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and observed cellular responses to ARF using a spinning disk confocal microscope. This study demonstrates that the focused ARF induced F-actin cytoskeletal rearrangement in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, these cells showed an increase in intracellular calcium concentration following the application of focused ARF. Furthermore, passive bending movement was noted in primary cilium that were treated with focused ARF. Cell viability was not affected. Application of pulsed ultrasound radiation generated only a minimal temperature rise of 0.1 degrees C, and induced a streaming resulting fluid shear stress of 0.186 dyne/cm(2), suggesting that hyperthermia and acoustic streaming might not be the main causes of the observed cell responses. In conclusion, these data provide more insight in the interactions between acoustic mechanical stress and osteoblastic cells. This experimental system could serve as basis for further exploration of the mechanosensing mechanism of osteoblasts triggered by ultrasound.

TI  - Freezing susceptibility and freezing tolerance in Palaearctic Cetoniidae (Coleoptera)
VL  - 79
IS  - 1
SP  - 67-74
AB  - Insects have evolved various adaptations that allow them to survive adverse seasons. In terms of cold-hardiness, they may classically be divided into freezing-susceptible versus freezing-tolerant species. But this concept of two alternative cold-hardiness strategies is now amendable, and to better understand these adaptive mechanisms, it is of interest to study freezing resistance in taxonomically related insect species, i.e., belonging to the same family or to a group of closely related organisms sharing similar resources. Freezing susceptibility and freezing tolerance have previously been recorded in the larvae of species in the same guild of the family Cetoniidae, which mainly colonise wood mould in hollow trees. We compared freezing hardiness in five species of Cetoniidae, three species in the subfamily Trichiinae, Gnorimus nobilis (Linne), Trichius fasciatus (Linne), and Osmoderma eremita (Scopoli), and two species in the subfamily Cetoniinae, Cetonia aurata (Linne) and Cetonischema aeruginosa (Drury). Our results mainly show that two contrasting mechanisms are used during winter by third-instar larvae: those of the Trichiinae (apart from O. eremita) are probably characterized by year-round freezing susceptibility, and those of O. eremita and the are probably distinguished by seasonal freezing susceptibility (summer) and seasonal freezing tolerance Cetoniinae are probably distinguished by seasonal freezing susceptibility (summer) and seasonal freezing tolerance (winter). We question the current taxonomic position of the genus Osmoderma. Morphological, ecological, and behavioural arguments may be put forward to support the transfer of O. eremita from the Trichiinae to the Cetoniinae, and we stress that ecophysiological arguments, often neglected in this kind of taxonomic revision, must also be taken into account.

TI  - Effect of the combined treatments of high hydrostatic pressure and temperature on Zygosaccharomyces bailii and Listeria monocytogenes in smoothies
VL  - 47
SP  - 166-174
AB  - In the present study, the combined treatments of high hydrostatic pressure (100 to 300 MPa) and temperature (-5 to 45 degrees C) were performed according to a central composite design to inactivate Listeria monocytogenes LGB and two strains of Zygosaccharomyces bailii that were artificially added to commercial smoothies (6-7 Log cfu/mL). The response surfaces showed a synergistic effect of temperature and pressure for both species, resulting in the highest cell lethality at 300 MPa and at either 45 degrees C or 5 degrees C and lowest cell lethality when the temperature was closer to room temperature. For some combinations, the L monocytogenes LGB inactivation predicted in this study is in compliance with the FDA requirement of a 5 Log reduction of microorganisms in fruit juices and beverages. The appropriate selection of temperature values in the treatment of smoothies with high hydrostatic pressure permits cold pasteurization at pressure levels well below 300 MPa to be obtained, thus enabling cost reduction to manufacturing plants and making the industrialization of the process favourable. Selective and recovery media counts indicated that the content of injured L. monocytogenes LGB cells in the survivor population reached a maximum value after the most severe treatments. Regarding such a cell fraction, microscopy observations of LIVE/DEAD BacLight and JC-1 staining appear to indicate a widespread presence of plasmolysis in cells with a partially depolarized membrane, providing additional information about their physiological state.

TI  - Survival in space and time: Flexibility and variability guarantee reproductive success in the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii
VL  - 12
SP  - 595-598
AB  - Insects adjust their life cycles to the seasonally variable environmental conditions, so that growth, development and reproduction coincide with favourable seasons and adverse seasons are passed in a species-specific resistant stage. Life cycle traits are intimately associated with reproductive success, and yet a high degree of phenotypic variability is sometimes observed. Unfortunately, it is normally not known whether this variability is based on genetic differences among individuals or on phenotypic plasticity. A high degree of phenotypic variability was observed in the diapause response of the burnet moth Zygaena trifolii (ESPER, 1783) (Lepidoptera, Zygaenidae). It is a "long-day insect" with temperature-influenced photoperiodic responses, and larval diapause may occur at the 3rd or any subsequent larval instar. The observed variability is partly based on genetic differences between individuals. In a selection experiment, the larval instar at which diapause occurs,vas changed within six generations. Diapause instars were dependent on the time of pre-diapause development of larvae, which varied considerably between larvae. A part of the variability in development time is based on additive genetic variance. Genetic variability in life cycle traits closely associated with reproductive success is normally eroded by strong natural selection on such traits. One may speculate, that the maintenance of genetic variability in the diapause response of Z. trifolii may result from temporal changes in selection pressure close to the border of the distribution range, where unsuitable weather conditions prevent successful reproduction in some years.

TI  - Metamorphic petrology of a high-T/low-P granulite terrane (Damara belt, Namibia) - Constraints from pseudosection modelling and high-precision Lu-Hf garnet-whole rock dating
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 41-69
AB  - Migmatites comprise a minor volume of the high-grade part of the Damara orogen of Namibia that is dominated by granite complexes and intercalated metasedimentary units. Migmatites of the Southern Central Zone of the Damara orogen consist of melanosomes with garnet+cordierite+biotite+K-feldspar, and leucosomes, which are sometimes garnet- and cordierite-bearing. Field evidence, petrographic observations, and pseudosection modelling suggest that, in contrast to other areas where intrusion of granitic magmas is more important, in situ partial melting of metasedimentary units was the main migmatite generation processes. Pseudosection modelling and thermobarometric calculations consistently indicate that the peak-metamorphic grade throughout the area is in the granulite facies (similar to 5 kbar at similar to 800 degrees C). Cordierite coronas around garnet suggest some decompression from peak-metamorphic conditions and rare andalusite records late, near-isobaric cooling to P-T path is consistent with minor crustal thickening through continent-continent collision followed by limited post-collisional exhumation and suggests that the granulite facies terrane of the Southern Central Zone of the Damara orogen formed initially in a metamorphic field gradient of similar to 35-40 degrees C/km at medium pressures. New high-precision Lu-Hf garnet-whole rock dates are 530 +/- 13 Ma, 522.0 +/- 0.8 Ma, 520.8 +/- 3.6 Ma, and 500.3 +/- 4.3 Ma for the migmatites that record temperatures of similar to 800 degrees C. This indicates that high-grade metamorphism lasted for c. 20-30 Ma, which is compatible with previous estimates using Sm-Nd garnet-whole rock systematics. In previous studies on Damara orogen migmatites where both Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf chronometers have been applied, the dates (c. 520-510 Ma) agree within their small uncertainties (0.6-0.8% for Sm-Nd and 0.1-0.2% for Lu-Hf). This implies rapid cooling after high-grade conditions and, by implication, rapid exhumation at that time. The cause of the high geothermal gradient inferred from the metamorphic conditions is unknown but likely requires some extra heat that was probably added by intrusion of magmas from the lithospheric mantle, i.e., syenites that have been recently re-dated at c. 545 Ma. Some granites derived from the lower crust at c. 545 Ma are the outcome rather than the cause of high-T metamorphism. In addition, high contents of heat-producing elements K, Th, and U may have raised peak temperatures by 150-200 degrees C at the base of the crust, resulting in the widespread melting of fertile crustal rocks. The continuous gradation from centimetre-scale leucosomes to decametre-scale leucogranite sheets within the high-grade metamorphic zone suggests that leucosome lenses coalesced to form larger bodies of anatectic leucogranites, thereby documenting a link between high-grade regional metamorphism and Pan-African magmatism. In view of the close association of the studied high-T migmatites with hundreds of synmetamorphic high-T granites that invaded the terrane as metre- to decametre-wide sills and dykes, we postulate that crystallization of felsic lower crustal magma is, at least partly, responsible for heat supply. Late-stage isobaric cooling of these granites may explain the occurrence of andalusite in some samples.

TI  - Summer Habitat Use of Large Adult Striped Bass and Habitat Availability in Lake Martin, Alabama
VL  - 33
IS  - 4
SP  - 762-772
AB  - To identify the summer habitat use by Gulf strain Striped Bass Morone saxatilis in Lake Martin, Alabama, 36 fish greater than 4kg were tracked weekly from June through September in 2009 and 2010. Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles were collected biweekly from July to October each year and were incorporated into a hypsographic curve to estimate summertime volumes of Striped Bass habitat. Striped Bass moved downstream in the reservoir and deeper in the water column as the summer progressed in both years. Across all temperatures and dissolved oxygen concentrations (DOCs) measured, fish generally selected cooler temperatures when DOCs were greater than 3.1mg/L, but below that level, fish selected warmer temperatures. By early July each year, quality Striped Bass habitat (21.0 degrees C and 3.2mg/L DOC) comprised 40-50% of the total habitat available in Lake Martin. However, in 2009 all quality habitat was gone from the reservoir by August 1, and total habitat (25.0 degrees C and 1.6mg/L DOC) rapidly decreased until there was no suitable habitat found in Lake Martin by mid-September. The quantity of quality and total habitat declined more rapidly in 2009 than in 2010; although quality habitat was eliminated from the reservoir by the end of August 2010, total habitat persisted throughout the summer. In both years, habitat availability increased when reservoir destratification began. Analysis of historical data indicated that quality habitat was found in the lower portion of the reservoir during the latter half of August in only 6 of 15years; total Striped Bass habitat was available in all but 1 year. The amount of water flowing through the system during the spring and summer was a key determinant of Striped Bass habitat availability by late summer.

TI  - Gold mineralization assisted by crustal melting: the case of the Maevatanana mesothermal gold deposit, Madagascar
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
AB  - The genesis of mesothermal Au-quartz vein deposits, which are among the more economically important type of Au deposits, is still under debate. There are two main theories, proposed in the literature, for the subsequent formation of these deposits in suitable structure involved: (1) Au-bearing ore fluid was derived from magmatic intrusions; or (2) Au was extracted from a greenstone belt by metamorphic fluids. In this paper, we report geochemical data from the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit in Madagascar, from which we deduce, based on synthesis of these data with field observations and with data from previous studies, that Au-quartz veins and silicified gneisses in the footwall of the granite dike were derived from both greenstone rocks and magmatic intrusions. From this interpretation, we propose a two-stage fertilization model for the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit. The first stage involved recycling of metal-fertilized lower crust. The second stage involved emplacement of granitic magma into the greenstone belt, resulting in increase in temperature of the host rock, and subsequent low-degree partial melting of the crust produced volatile-rich high-silica melts. Subsequently, Au-rich fluid was extracted from the granitic magma and convection in the magma reservoir caused by ascent of the less-dense volatile-rich high-silica melt and settlement of crystals (e.g., plagioclase) resulted in the formation of ore-forming fluids at the top of the magma reservoir. Finally, the Au-rich fluids were carried by magmatic dikes and transported from the magma reservoir to shallow host structures to form the mesothermal Maevatanana Au deposit.

TI  - Climate change impacts on rainfed and irrigated soybean yield in Brazil's new agricultural frontier
VL  - 147
IS  - 1
SP  - 803-816
AB  - Climate is one of the main limiting factors for agricultural productivity, where climate change may increase the risk for food production. Based on that, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of climate change on rainfed and irrigated soybean yield in the MATOPIBA region, the new agricultural frontier in Brazil. The DSSAT CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean was used to simulate rainfed and irrigated yield using local soils, sowing dates, and maturity groups. The simulations included the baseline (1980-2010), and two future scenarios (2011-2040 and 2041-2070) for two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and 8.5). The future climate scenarios were obtained from global climate models (HadGEM2-ES and CSIRO mk3-6-0). The baseline showed a median yield of 3907 kg ha(-1) across the region, a value that increased to 4006 kg ha(-1) in the RCP 8.5 in 2011-2040. For the 2041-2070 period, RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 had a yield reduction to 3686 and 2388 kg ha(-1), respectively. The average yield reduction was higher than 23% under RCP 8.5 (2041-2070), reaching more than 53% in some areas. The yield impact in future climate scenarios was related to rainfall reduction by 300-400 mm cycle(-1), and temperature increased above 3 degrees C. The irrigation showed potential to offset negative climate change impacts, where yield gain was 2400 kg ha(-1) under RCP 8.5. The future climate impact can be reduced by moving soybean crops preferentially to areas of higher altitude, with lower air temperature associated with irrigation. Further studies could explore potential adaptations related with physiological traits and crop management.

TI  - Agrometeorological Models for Forecasting Coffee Yield
VL  - 109
IS  - 1
SP  - 249-258
AB  - Some forecasting techniques have been tested with crop models using various statistical analyses for generating future scenarios of yield (Y). Forecasting, however, can be achieved by simply using regression analysis and carefully selecting independent variables (IVs) with time displacement relative to the dependent variable. The early forecasting of Y is the vanguard of agronomic modeling, promoting improvements in planning, allowing more rational strategic decisions, and increasing food and economic security. Climatic variables are the most important factors controlling the yield and quality of coffee (Coffea arabica L.). We calibrated and tested agrometeorological models to forecast the annual Y of coffee for six traditional producing regions in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We used multiple linear regressions, selecting IVs to maximize the period between the forecast of Y and the harvest for each locality. The IVs were monthly meteorological variables from 1997 to 2014: air temperature, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, soil water storage, water deficit, and water surplus. The IVs were selected by testing all possible combinations in the domain and avoiding multicollinearity. The agrometeorological models were accurate for all regions, and the earliest forecasts were 6 and 5 mo before harvest for the producing locations of Guaxupe and Coromandel, respectively. The models for yield forecasting for Guaxupe included the water deficit in July and October and July precipitation for the high-yield season and the water deficit in April and September and October precipitation for the low-yield season. The models for yield forecasting for Coromandel included the November water surplus and February and September precipitation for the high-yield season and precipitation for January, April, and October for the low-yield season.

TI  - Oxyalkylated alcohols phthalates
VL  - 11

AB  - Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is used to obtain a wide range of materials for various purposes. High demand of PVC is explained by possibility to modify polyvinyl chloride and produce broad range of materials with improved properties as well as to have cost efficient ratio: productivity, available raw materials, saving of natural resources. However, under normal temperature polyvinyl chloride is brittle and inelastic, that limits the fields of PVC application. The production of basic PVC compositions is impossible without plasticizers - low-molecular compounds that allow direct regulating physical and mechanical properties of polymer. Production of plasticizers became one of the most important branch of petrochemical industry. Recently, however, the range and production of plasticizers have drastically decreased due to the increased cost, which reduced the competitiveness of plasticized PVC products. Therefore, the expansion of plasticizer variety for PVC is a strategic task of great practical significance. The present work describes synthesis methods of esters on the basis of oxyalkylated alcohols suggested as polyvinyl chloride plasticizers. Physico-chemical properties of synthesized compounds were studied. Conditions for their production with maximum outcome were selected. The results of experiments in which obtained compounds were tested as additives in the plasticization of PVC showed that the obtained samples of cable plastic, adhesive PVC tapes and multi-layered polyvinyl chloride linoleum satisfy all the technical requirements by the main indicators: cable plastic compound - GOST 5960-72 with amendment 1-9; a PVC adhesive tape - Technical Conditions - 2245-001-00203312-2003; multilayered linoleum - GOST 7251-77. According to the experimental results, phthalates of oxyalkylated alcohols possess rather high efficiency as plasticizers of polyvinyl chloride and are recommended for use in the above-mentioned industrial PVC recipes.

TI  - Agricultural adaptation to climate change in rich and poor countries: Current modeling practice and potential for empirical contributions
VL  - 46
SP  - 562-575
AB  - In this paper we discuss the scope of the adaptation challenge facing world agriculture in the coming decades. Due to rising temperatures throughout the tropics, pressures for adaptation will be greatest in some of the poorest parts of the world where the adaptive capacity is least abundant. We discuss both autonomous (market driven) and planned adaptations, distinguishing: (a) those that can be undertaken with existing technology, (b) those that involve development of new technologies, and (c) those that involve institutional/market and policy reforms. The paper then proceeds to identify which of these adaptations are currently modeled in integrated assessment studies and related analyses at global scale. This, in turn, gives rise to recommendations about how these models should be modified in order to more effectively capture climate change adaptation in the farm and food sector. In general, we find that existing integrated assessment models are better suited to analyzing adaptation by relatively well-endowed producers operating in market-integrated, developed countries. They likely understate climate impacts on agriculture in developing countries, while overstating the potential adaptations. This is troubling, since the need for adaptation will be greatest amongst the lower income producers in the poorest tropical countries. This is also where policies and public investments are likely to have the highest payoff. We conclude with a discussion of opportunities for improving the empirical foundations of integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on the poorest countries. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 122

AB  - This study evaluates the effects of climate change on agriculture in Northern Norway. It is based on downscaled climate projections for six different municipalities combined with interviews with farmers, advisors and administrative personnel in these municipalities. The projections document large climatic differences both between and within the different municipalities. The main predicted climatic changes include increasing temperatures and precipitation as well as increased frequency of certain types of extreme weather events. Despite challenges such as unstable winters, increased autumn precipitation and possibly more weeds and diseases, a prolongation of the current short growth season together with higher growth temperatures can give new opportunities for agriculture here. The impacts are expected to differ both within and between municipalities and will require tailored adaptive strategies. Most of these however should pose no difficulty implementing, having an agronomical basis that farmers are accustomed to cope with.

VL  - 38
IS  - 4
SP  - 295-300
AB  - Yersinia enterocolitica is a facultative intracellular pathogen which invades to epithelial cells and survives in phagocytes. Since the internal environment of phagocytes should be stressful conditions for the phagocytosed Yersinia, the bacteria should respond to protect themselves from otherwise lethal results. We analyzed the stress-induced proteins which possibly contribute to survival of Yersinia within the phagocytes. Y. enterocolitica was radiolabeled during the growth in macrophage-like J774-1 cells, and the bacterial proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. At least 16 proteins were selectively induced in response to phagocytosis, and several out of 16 proteins were also induced by heat shock at 42 C or oxidative stresses in vitro. Of those, two major stress proteins were identified to be homologues of DnaK and CRPA by immunoblotting analysis. These results have indicated that Y. enterocolitica exhibits a global stress response to the hostile environment in the phagocytosed macrophage.

TI  - Impacts of the combined exposure to seawater acidification and arsenic on the proteome of Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 203
SP  - 117-129
AB  - Proteomic analysis was performed to compare the effects of Arsenic (As), seawater acidification (Low pH) and the combination of both stressors (Low pH + As) on Crassostrea angulata and Crassostrea gigas juveniles in the context of global environmental change. This study aimed to elucidate if two closely related Crassostrea species respond similarly to these environmental stressors, considering both single and combined exposures, to infer if the simultaneous exposure to both stressors induced a differentiated response. Identification of the most important differentially expressed proteins between conditions revealed marked differences in the response of each species towards single and combined exposures, evidencing species-related differences towards each experimental condition. Moreover, protein alterations observed in the combined exposure (Low pH + As) were substantially different from those observed in single exposures. Identified proteins and their putative biological functions revealed an array of modes of action in each condition. Among the most important, those involved in cellular structure (Actin, Atlastin, Severin, Gelsolin, Coronin) and extracellular matrix modulation (Ependymin, Tight junction ZO-1, Neprilysin) were strongly regulated, although in different exposure conditions and species. Data also revealed differences regarding metabolic modulation capacity (ATP beta, Enolase, Aconitate hydratase) and oxidative stress response (Aldehyde dehydrogenase, Lactoylglutathione, Retinal dehydrogenase) of each species, which also depended on single or combined exposures, illustrating a different response capacity of both oyster species to the presence of multiple stressors. Interestingly, alterations of piRNA abundance in C. angulata suggested genome reconfiguration in response to multiple stressors, likely an important mode of action related to adaptive evolution mechanisms previously unknown to oyster species, which requires further investigation. The present findings provide a deeper insight into the complexity of C. angulata and C. gigas responses to environmental stress at the proteome level, evidencing different capacities to endure abiotic changes, with relevance regarding the ecophysiological fitness of each species and competitive advantages in a changing environment.

TI  - Hybridization leads to host-use divergence in a polyphagous butterfly sibling species pair
VL  - 158
IS  - 4
SP  - 651-662
AB  - Climate warming has lead to increased genetic introgression across a narrow hybrid zone separating the eastern and Canadian tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis). This situation has led to the formation of an allochronically separated hybrid population with a delayed emerging phenotype or "late flight''. Here, we assess how the recombination of the parental genomes that lead to this phenotype may have facilitated another major ecological shift, host-use divergence. We first contrast the ovipositional profiles of the late flight population to that of the parental species P. glaucus and P. canadensis. Subsequently we contrast the larval survival and growth of the late flight, a P. canadensis and a P. glaucus population, and a population from the northern edge of the hybrid zone on five hosts. Our results indicate that the ovipositional preference of this hybrid swarm is identical to that of the introgressing parental species, P. glaucus. Due to the absence of the preferred hosts of P. glaucus (Liriodendron tulipifera L. and Ptelea trifoliata L.) where the late flight occurs, this ovipositional pattern implies a functional specialization onto a secondary host of both parental species, Fraxinus americana L. In contrast, the larval host-use abilities represent a mixture of P. glaucus and P. canadensis, indicating divergence in larval host-use abilities has not taken place. However, high genetic variability (genetic coefficient of variation) is present for growth on F. americana in the late flight hybrid swarm and tradeoffs for larval performance on the preferred hosts of the parental species are evident; indicating a strong potential for future specialization in larval host-use abilities. This current scenario represents an instance where a shift in a major ecological trait, host use, is likely occurring as a byproduct of a shift in an unrelated trait (delayed emergence) leading to partial reproductive isolation.

TI  - An integrated analysis of micro- and macro-habitat features as a tool to detect weather-driven constraints: A case study with cavity nesters
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - The effects of climate change on animal populations may be shaped by habitat characteristics at both micro- and macro-habitat level, however, empirical studies integrating these two scales of observation are lacking. As analyses of the effects of climate change commonly rely on data from a much larger scale than the microhabitat level organisms are affected at, this mismatch risks hampering progress in developing understanding of the details of the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms and, ultimately, effective actions to preserve their populations. Cavity nesters, often with a conservation status of concern, are an ideal model because the cavity is a microenvironment potentially different from the macroenvironment but nonetheless inevitably interacting with it. The lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a cavity nester which was until recently classified by as Vulnerable species. Since 2004, for nine years, we collected detailed biotic and abiotic data at both micro- and macro-scales of observation in a kestrel population breeding in the Gela Plain (Italy), a Mediterranean area where high temperatures may reach lethal values for the nest content. We show that macro-climatic features needed to be integrated with both abiotic and biotic factors recorded at a microscale before reliably predicting nest temperatures. Among the nest types used by lesser kestrels, we detected a preferential occupation of the cooler nest types, roof tiles, by early breeders whereas, paradoxically, late breeders nesting with hotter temperatures occupied the overheated nest holes. Not consistent with such a suggested nest selection, the coolest nest type did not host a higher reproductive success than the overheated nests. We discussed our findings in the light of cavity temperatures and nest types deployed within conservation actions assessed by integrating selected factors at different observation scales.

TI  - The Combination of Lactate and Diacetate Synergistically Reduces Cold Growth in Brain Heart Infusion Broth across Listeria monocytogenes Lineages
VL  - 73
IS  - 4
SP  - 631-640
AB  - Combinations of organic acids are often used in ready-to-eat foods to control the growth of Listeria monocytogenes during refrigerated storage. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess synergy between two organic acid growth inhibitors under conditions similar to those present in cold-smoked salmon, and to assess the effect of evolutionary lineage on response to those growth inhibitors. Thirteen strains of L. monocytogenes. representing lineages land II, were grown at 7 degrees C in broth at pH 6.1 and 4.65% water-phase NaCl, which was supplemented with 2% potassium lactate, 0.14% sodium diacetate, or the combination of both at the same levels. Our data suggest that lineages adapt similarly to these inhibitors, as the only significant growth parameter difference between lineages was a minor effect (+/-0.16 day, P = 0.0499) on lag phase (lambda). For all strains, lactate significantly extended lambda, from 2.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 days (P < 0.001), and lowered the maximum growth rate (mu(max)) from 0.54 +/- 0.06 to 0.49 +/- 0.04 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001), compared with the control. Diacetate was ineffective alone, but in combination with lactate, synergistically increased lambda to 6.6 +/- 1.6 days (P < 0.001) and decreased mu(max) to 0.34 +/- 0.05 log(CFU/ml)/day (P < 0.001). Monte Carlo simulations provided further evidence for synergy between diacetate and lactate by predicting signficantly slower growth to nominal endpoints for the combination of inhibitors. This study shows potassium lactate and sodium diacetate have significant synergistic effects on both lambda and mu(max) of L. monocytogenes at refrigeration temperature in broth, and justifies combining these inhibitors, at effective levels, in food product formulations.

TI  - Variation among genotypes in responses to increasing temperature in a marine parasite: evolutionary potential in the face of global warming?
VL  - 44
IS  - 13
SP  - 1019-1027
AB  - Climates are changing worldwide, and populations are under selection to adapt to these changes. Changing temperature, in particular, can directly impact ectotherms and their parasites, with potential consequences for whole ecosystems. The potential of parasite populations to adapt to climate change largely depends on the amount of genetic variation they possess in their responses to environmental fluctuations. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to look at differences among parasite genotypes in response to temperature, with the goal of quantifying the extent of variation among conspecifics in their responses to increasing temperature. Snails infected with single genotypes of the trematode Maritrema novaezealandensis were sequentially acclimatised to two different temperatures, 'current' (15 degrees C) and 'elevated' (20 degrees C), over long periods. These temperatures are based on current average field conditions in the natural habitat and those predicted to occur during the next few decades. The output and activity of cercariae (free-swimming infective stages emerging from snails) were assessed for each genotype at each temperature. The results indicate that, on average, both cercarial output and activity are higher at the elevated acclimation temperature. More importantly, the output and activity of cercariae are strongly influenced by a genotype-by-temperature interaction, such that different genotypes show different responses to increasing temperature. Both the magnitude and direction (increase or decrease) of responses to temperature varied widely among genotypes. Therefore, there is much potential for natural selection to act on this variation, and predicting how the trematode M. novaezealandensis will respond to the climate changes predicted for the next century will prove challenging.

VL  - 94
SP  - 49-56
AB  - This study aimed to improve a sperm cryopreservation protocol for farmed Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai. Dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), glycerol, ethylene glycol (EG), propylene glycol (PG), and methanol were chosen as cryoprotectants (CPAs). Four different equilibration time (5, 10, 30, and 60 min), and two types of equilibration temperature (4 degrees C and 20 degrees C) were selected at the present experiment. Most equilibration temperatures with each CPA showed significant differences among different equilibration time. Post-thaw sperm motility of five CPAs showed no significant difference at two equilibration temperature. Based on these results, 8% Me2SO, 8% EG, 6% PG, 2% glycerol, and 2% methanol were chosen to determine optimal conditions for sperm cryopreservation of H. discus hannai. The highest post-thaw sperm motility (8% Me2SO: 50.6%, 8% EG: 45.6%, 2% glycerol: 44.5%, 6% PG: 28.7%, 2% methanol: 25.4%) was achieved after exposing sperm to liquid nitrogen (LN2) vapor for 10 min at 5 cm above the LN2 surface and then submerging them in LN2 for at least 2 h followed by thawing at 60 degrees C with seawater and recovering them at 20 degrees C with seawater. In this study, 8% Me2SO and 2% glycerol were chosen to check post-thaw sperm quality to estimate percentages of plasma membrane integrity (PMI), mitochondrial potential analysis (MP), and acrosome integrity (AI) using fluorescent techniques. No significant difference in PMI, MP, and AI was found between sperm cryopreserved with 8% Me2SO and those cryopreserved with 2% glycerol. The current study has demonstrated that 8% Me2SO was optimal for sperm cryopreservation for H. discus hannai with 5 min of equilibration time, 5 cm of rack height and 60 degrees C of thawing temperature. The present research provides more effective cryopreservation methods for H. discus hannai sperm than previous studies.

VL  - 123

SP  - 2955-2975
AB  - Plain Language Summary Phytoplankton growth in the seasonally productive Southern Ocean is typically limited by iron (Fe). In the next century, however, Fe inputs and temperature are predicted to increase. Dissolved concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) may also change due to physical and biological drivers, altering the stoichiometric N:P ratio of the water column. Two separate experiments were conducted to study how these predicted changes will impact nutrient utilization by two natural microbial communities from the Ross Sea, Antarctica. The first investigation focused on a Terra Nova Bay community amended with Fe and grown under a wide range of seven different N:P ratios. Building on the results of the first study, a McMurdo Sound community was incubated under a factorial design at high, medium (ambient), and low N:P ratios, with and without Fe addition, and at ambient versus elevated temperature. In both experiments absolute uptake rates of bicarbonate, nitrate, and amino acids by two size fractions (0.7-5.0m and>5.0m) of microorganisms were measured using stable isotopes. For Terra Nova Bay microorganisms, significant differences in nutrient uptake rates occurred when the N:P ratio was elevated, and nitrate uptake rates significantly increased early in the experiment but were not different at the end. For McMurdo Sound microorganisms, changing the N:P supply ratio did not have a clear effect, while temperature elevation and/or Fe addition significantly increased nutrient uptake. Results indicate that changing the dissolved N:P ratio can potentially alter nutrient uptake rates; however, the impact of temperature and Fe are greater. The Southern Ocean is one of the most biologically important ecosystems on our planet. Microscopic plants, called phytoplankton, form the base of the food web in the Southern Ocean and play a direct role in regulating how much and how fast elements like nitrogen and carbon are cycled throughout the world ocean. The goal of this research was to determine how predicted changes in the environment will impact how fast phytoplankton use these elements. The conditions that we tested included elevated temperature, addition of iron, and the proportion of nitrogen to phosphorus in the seawater. These parameters were selected because temperatures are increasing in the Southern Ocean, and the relative availability of nutrients can alter what species of phytoplankton are present and how fast they grow. Phytoplankton were collected from two locations in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, and grown for a few weeks under experimental conditions. Our results demonstrate that all three parameters, warmer temperatures, the addition of iron, and changing nitrogen to phosphorus ratios will increase how fast phytoplankton use nitrogen and carbon, but the impact of elevated temperature and the addition of iron had a much larger impact than the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio.

VL  - 68

SP  - 379-392
AB  - Neanderthals inhabited Western Eurasia from approximately 300 to 30 thousand years ago (ka). They are distinguished by a unique combination of anatomical traits, and are commonly associated with Middle Paleolithic lithic industries. Current consensus among paleoanthropologists is that they represented a separate Eurasian human lineage, which evolved in isolation from the rest of the Old World and which shared a common ancestor with modem humans in the Middle Pleistocene. It is thought that some aspects of the distinctive Neanderthal anatomy evolved in response to selection related to the extreme cold of the European glacial cycles. Nevertheless, genetic drift seems to be partially responsible for the evolution of these traits. The last appearance of Neanderthals in the fossil record ca. 30 ka BP dates a few millennia after the first appearance of modern humans in Europe. The retrieval of ancient mitochondrial and, more recently, nuclear DNA from Neanderthal fossil puts us in the unique position to combine fossil with genetic evidence to address questions about their evolution, paleobiology and eventual fate.

TI  - Climate-tree growth models in relation to long-term growth trends of white oak in Pennsylvania
VL  - 234
SP  - 527-537
AB  - We examined long-term growth trends of white oak by comparing tree-ring chronologies developed from an old-growth stand, where the average tree age was 222 years, with a second-growth stand where average tree age was 78 years. Evaluation of basal area growth trends suggested that an anomalous decrease in basal area increment trend occurred in both stands during the 1950s. To determine whether climatic factors could explain this decrease we developed conventional and ridge regression models based on step-wise selection of mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation variables for the period 1895 to 1940. The years from 1941 to 1950 were used for verification of developed models; only the ridge regression models produced verifiable models. All models failed to predict actual growth in the period from 1951 to 1980 for both stands. The inability to predict growth response in the more recent period may relate to a non-constant climatic response of white oak or to non-climatic factors such as air pollution or altered atmospheric CO2 concentrations that have affected tree growth-climate relationships.

TI  - Evaluation of the Thermostability of English Oak and Rock Oak and Their Degree of Adaptation to the Effects of Heat Shock
IS  - 4
SP  - 187-199
AB  - The leaves of sessile oak (Quercuspetraea Liebl.) and pedunculate oak (Quercusrobur L.) were subjected to heat shock at various high temperatures. The damage caused by the heat shock to the cellular structures of the leaves was determined using the electrolyte leakage technique. In the investigated species, a sigmoidal increase of electrolyte leakage from leaf tissues, depending of the applied temperatures, was observed. Pedunculate oak leaves, as compared with sessile oak ones, have shown increased resistance to high temperatures, suggesting that heat tolerance in pedunculate oak is higher than in sessile oak. Experiments with fractionation of heat shock doses allowed the estimation of the influence of the first dose value on induction of the lives adaptive capacity of the sessile oak leaves during different periods of time after their application. If the first fraction of dose was moderate, the thermotolerance of leaves grew rapidly. So, the functional status of leaves depended on three components that characterized the fractionation of dose: the value of the first part of dose (1), the value of the second part of dose two (2), the duration of the period that has passed between two fractions of dose (3). Summary effect of fractionated dose of heat shock is the result of balance between processes of degradation, recovery of damages, and adaptation. After application of moderate fractions of heat shock dose. the processes of the induction of adaptation dominated. Because of this the thermotolerance of leaves after application of the first dose of heat shock increased. After the application of higher fractions of dose, the processes of degradation prevailed under those of the recovery and adaptation. In combination they lead to the reduction leaves thermotolerance. The obtained results suggest that the method of fractional heat shock doses make possible determination of the initial thermotolerance and the adaptive capacity of leaves. Pooling of the processes that determine the initial leaves thermotolerance and their adaptive potential under variation of seasonal temperatures is important for plants survival in arid conditions.

TI  - Challenging convention: the winter ecology of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a productive and stable environment
VL  - 62
IS  - 1
SP  - 146-160
AB  - 1. Understanding of the winter ecology of stream salmonids is biased by research conducted in northern temperate and boreal regions dominated by hard rock geology. Such systems are driven by highly dynamic surface-flow regimes and tend to be physically diverse, nutrient poor and influenced by ice. This study investigated how the behaviour of brown trout, Salmo trutta, inhabiting a stable groundwater-fed, productive and comparatively warm southern English chalk stream differs from that described for other systems, and how this is translated to performance, measured as growth. 2. Physical characteristics were mapped, and high-resolution temperature data collected using a spatial array of data loggers installed throughout the study reach during the winter. A combination of passive integrated transponder and radio telemetry was used to monitor distribution, density, and movement of trout. Micro-archival data storage tags inserted in some individuals provided information on temperature regimes experienced. Growth performance was calculated for recaptured fish. 3. Trout density was positively related to depth and there was no evidence that temperature influenced microhabitat selection. Three patterns of movement were observed. Over three-quarters of tracked fish exhibited high site fidelity and tended to remain in a single focal position throughout the study. Fourteen per cent of trout exploited more than one distinct location, while the remainder were detected at multiple locations and showed no preference for any one. 4. Trout exhibited regular daily activity patterns and highly periodic local movements at dusk and dawn and tended to experience positive growth performance during periods that included winter. 5. This study challenges the conventional view of salmonid winter ecology, which is biased towards populations that inhabit hard rock surface-flow dominated rivers that experience the influence of ice. Despite inhabiting a distinctly different winter habitat template than more commonly studied populations, trout occupying a hydrologically stable and productive chalk stream exhibited behaviours similar to those described for elsewhere, yet performed considerably better.

TI  - Developing a scalable model of recombinant protein yield from Pichia pastoris: the influence of culture conditions, biomass and induction regime
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: The optimisation and scale-up of process conditions leading to high yields of recombinant proteins is an enduring bottleneck in the post-genomic sciences. Typical experiments rely on varying selected parameters through repeated rounds of trial-and-error optimisation. To rationalise this, several groups have recently adopted the 'design of experiments' (DoE) approach frequently used in industry. Studies have focused on parameters such as medium composition, nutrient feed rates and induction of expression in shake flasks or bioreactors, as well as oxygen transfer rates in micro-well plates. In this study we wanted to generate a predictive model that described small-scale screens and to test its scalability to bioreactors. Results: Here we demonstrate how the use of a DoE approach in a multi-well mini-bioreactor permitted the rapid establishment of high yielding production phase conditions that could be transferred to a 7 L bioreactor. Using green fluorescent protein secreted from Pichia pastoris, we derived a predictive model of protein yield as a function of the three most commonly-varied process parameters: temperature, pH and the percentage of dissolved oxygen in the culture medium. Importantly, when yield was normalised to culture volume and density, the model was scalable from mL to L working volumes. By increasing pre-induction biomass accumulation, model-predicted yields were further improved. Yield improvement was most significant, however, on varying the fed-batch induction regime to minimise methanol accumulation so that the productivity of the culture increased throughout the whole induction period. These findings suggest the importance of matching the rate of protein production with the host metabolism. Conclusion: We demonstrate how a rational, stepwise approach to recombinant protein production screens can reduce process development time.

TI  - Geomorphology and vegetation drive hydrochemistry changes in two Northeast Greenland streams
VL  - 35
IS  - 10
AB  - Climate change is causing drastic landscape changes in the Arctic, but how these changes modify stream biogeochemistry is not clear yet. We examined how catchment properties influence stream nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) in a high-Arctic environment. We sampled two contrasting headwater streams (10-15 stations over 4.8 and 6.8 km, respectively) in Northeast Greenland (74 degrees N). We characterized the geomorphology (i.e., bedrock, solifluction and alluvial types) and the vegetation (i.e., barren, fell field, grassland and tundra types) cover of each subcatchment area draining into each sampling station and collected water samples for hydrochemistry characterization. The two sampled streams differed in geomorphology and vegetation cover in the catchment. Aucellaelv catchment was mostly covered by a 'bedrock' geomorphology (71%) and 'fellfield' vegetation (51%), whereas K AE erelv was mostly covered by 'alluvial' geomorphology (65%) and 'grassland' and 'tundra' vegetation (42% and 41% respectively). Hydrochemistry also differed between the two study streams, with higher concentrations of inorganic N forms in Aucellaelv and lower DOC concentrations, compared to K AE relv. The results from the linear mixed model selection showed that vegetation and geomorphology had contrasting effects on stream hydrochemistry. Subcatchments with higher solifluction sheets and limited vegetation had higher nitrate concentrations but lower DOC concentrations. Interestingly, we also found high variability on the production and removal of nitrate across subcatchments. These results indicate landscape controls to nutrient and organic matter exports via flow paths, soil organic matter stocks and nutrient retention via terrestrial vegetation. Moreover, the results suggest that climate change induced alterations to vegetation cover and soil physical disturbance in high-Arctic catchments will affect stream hydrochemistry, with potential effects in stream productivity, trophic relations as well as change of solute export to downstream coastal areas.

TI  - Contrasting effects of environmental change on the radial growth of co-occurring beech and fir trees across Europe
VL  - 615
SP  - 1460-1469
AB  - Under predicted climate change, native silver fir (Abies alba) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are the most likely replacement species for the Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures planted across large parts of continental Europe. Our current understanding of the adaptation potential of fir-beech mixed forests to climate change is limited because long-term responses of the two species to environmental changes have not yet been comprehensively quantified. We compiled and analysed tree-ring width (TRW) series from 2855 dominant, co-dominant, sub-dominant and suppressed fir and beech trees sampled in 17 managed and unmanaged mixed beech-fir forest sites across Continental Europe, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Italy, Romania and Slovakia. Dendroecological techniques that combine various detrending methods were used to investigate variation in radial growth of co-occurring fir and beech trees. Coincidental with peak SO2 emissions, the growth of silver fir declined between 1950 and 1980 at most sites, whereas beech growth increased during this period. Correspondent to a significant warming trend from 1990-2010, average beech growth declined, but silver fir growth increased. Long-term growth patterns and growth-climate sensitivity of fir and beech trees did not significantly differ between managed and unmanaged forests. Multi-decadal changes in the growth rate of all vertical tree classes were similar. In contrast to previous indications of limited drought susceptibility of beech mixed stands, this study suggests that the mixture of tree species in forest stands does not necessarily prevent growth depressions induced by long-termenvironmental change. Our results further imply that forest management does not necessarily alter their sensitivity to environmental changes. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparing the Performance of Microsatellites and RADseq in Population Genetic Studies: Analysis of Data for Pike (Esox lucius) and a Synthesis of Previous Studies
VL  - 11
AB  - Population genetic studies reveal biodiversity patterns and inform about drivers of evolutionary differentiation and adaptation, including gene flow, drift and selection. This can advance our understanding and aid decision making regarding management and conservation efforts. Microsatellites have long been used in population genetic studies. Thanks to the development of newer techniques, sequencing approaches such as restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) are on their way to replace microsatellites for some applications. However, the performance of these two marker types in population genetics have rarely been systematically compared. We utilized three neutrally and adaptively differentiated populations of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) to assess the relative performance of microsatellites and RADseq with respect to resolution and conclusiveness of estimates of population differentiation and genetic structure. To this end, the same set of individuals (N = 64) were genotyped with both RADseq and microsatellite markers. To assess effects of sample size, the same subset of 10 randomly chosen individuals from each population (N = 30 in total) were also genotyped with both methods. Comparisons of estimated genetic diversity and structure showed that both markers were able to uncover genetic structuring. The full RADseq dataset provided the clearest detection of the finer scaled genetic structuring, and the other three datasets (full and subset microsatellite, and subset RADseq) provided comparable results. A search for outlier loci performed on the full SNP dataset pointed to signs of selection potentially associated with salinity and temperature, exemplifying the utility of RADseq to inform about the importance of different environmental factors. To evaluate whether performance differences between the markers are general or context specific, the results of previous studies that have investigated population structure using both marker types were synthesized. The synthesis revealed that RADseq performed as well as, or better than microsatellites in detecting genetic structuring in the included studies. The differences in the ability to detect population structure, both in the present and the previous studies, are likely explained by the higher number of loci typically utilized in RADseq compared to microsatellite analysis, as increasing the number of markers will (regardless of the marker type) increase power and allow for clearer detection and higher resolution of genetic structure.

TI  - Radioembolization of Colorectal Liver Metastases: Indications, Technique, and Outcomes
VL  - 58
SP  - 104S-111S
AB  - Liver metastases are a major cause of death from colorectal cancer. Intraarterial therapy options for colorectal liver metastases include chemoinfusion via a hepatic arterial pump or port, irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads, and radioembolization using Y-90 microspheres. Intraarterial therapy allows the delivery of a high dose of chemotherapy or radiation into liver tumors while minimizing the impact on liver parenchyma and avoiding systemic effects. Specificity in intra-arterial therapy can be achieved both through preferential arterial flow to the tumor and through selective catheter positioning. In this review, we discuss indications, contraindications, preprocedure evaluation, activity prescription, follow-up, outcomes, and complications of radioembolization of colorectal liver metastases. Methods for preventing off-target embolization, increasing the specificity of microsphere delivery, and reducing the lung-shunt fraction are discussed. There are 2 types of Y-90 microspheres: resin and glass. Because glass microspheres have a higher activity per particle, they can deliver a particular radiation dose with fewer particles, likely reducing embolic effects. Glass microspheres thus may be more suitable when early stasis or reflux is a concern, in the setting of hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion, and for radiation segmentectomy. Because resin microspheres have a lower activity per particle, more particles are needed to deliver a particular radiation dose. Resin microspheres thus may be preferable for larger tumors and those with high arterial flow. In addition, resin microspheres have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for colorectal liver metastases, whereas institutional review board approval is required before glass microspheres can be used under a compassionate-use or research protocol. Finally, radiation segmentectomy involves delivering a calculated lobar activity of Y-90 microspheres selectively to treat a tumor involving 1 or 2 liver segments. This technique administers a very high radiation dose and effectively causes the ablation of tumors that are too large or are in a location considered unsafe for thermal ablation. The selective delivery spares surrounding normal liver, reducing the risk of liver failure.

TI  - How Laramide-age hydration of North American lithosphere by the Farallon slab controlled subsequent activity in the western United States
VL  - 45
IS  - 7
SP  - 575-595
AB  - Starting with the Laramide orogeny and continuing through the Cenozoic, the U.S. Cordilleran orogen is unusual for its width, nature of uplift, and style of tectonic and magmatic activity. We present teleseismic tomography evidence for a thickness of modified North America lithosphere greater than or equal to200 km beneath Colorado and >100 km beneath New Mexico. Existing explanations for uplift or magmatism cannot accommodate lithosphere this thick. Imaged mantle structure is low in seismic velocity roughly beneath the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and New Mexico, and high in velocity to the east and west, beneath the tectonically intact Great Plains and Colorado Plateau. Structure internal to the low-velocity volume has a NE grain suggestive of influence by inherited Precambrian sutures. We conclude that the high-velocity upper mantle is Precambrian lithosphere, and the low-velocity volume is partially molten Precambrian North America mantle. We suggest, as others have, that the Farallon stab was in contact with the lithosphere beneath most of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. We further suggest that slab de-watering under the increasingly cool conditions of slab contact with North America hydrated the base of the continental lithosphere, causing a steady regional uplift of the western U.S. during the Laramide orogeny. Imaged low-velocity upper mantle is attributed to hydration-induced lithospheric melting beneath much of the southern Rocky Mountains. Laramide-age magmatic ascent heated and weakened the lithosphere, which in turn allowed horizontal shortening to occur in the mantle beneath the region of Laramide thrusting in the southern Rocky Mountains. Subsequent Farallon slab removal resulted in additional uplift through unloading. It also triggered vigorous magmatism, especially where asthenosphere made contact with the hydrated and relatively thin and fertile lithosphere of what now is the Basin and Range. This mantle now is dry, depleted of basaltic components, hot, buoyant, and weak.

AB  - Climate change creates new challenges for preventing and protecting human health against different diseases that could appear and propagate. The Aedes albopictus mosquito species is an important vector for different diseases like dengue fever or zika. Although this species is not "indigenous" in Europe, its presence is noticed in many countries on the continent. The Ae. albopictus establishment is conditioned by the species' characteristics and environmental factors. To assess the possible spread of Ae. albopictus in the Dobrogea region (situated in the Southeast of Romania), we conducted the following analysis: (1) Investigation of the current distribution and climatic factors favoring Ae. albopictus' establishment in Europe; (2) Analysis of climate dynamics in Dobrogea in terms of the parameters identified at stage (1); (3) Testing the hypothesis that the climate from Dobrogea favors Ae. albopictus' establishment in the region; (4) Building a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based model of the potential geographic distribution of Ae. albopictus in Dobrogea. Results show that the climate of Dobrogea favors the apparition of the investigated species and its proliferation.

VL  - 227

SP  - 427-439
AB  - Drought intensity and frequency are increasing under global warming, with soil water availability now being a major factor limiting tree growth in circumboreal forests. Still, the adaptive capacity of trees in the face of future climatic regimes remains poorly documented. Using 1481 annually resolved tree-ring series from 29-yr-old trees, we evaluated the drought sensitivity of 43 white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) populations established in a common garden experiment. We show that genetic variation among populations in response to drought plays a significant role in growth resilience. Local genetic adaptation allowed populations from drier geographical origins to grow better, as indicated by higher resilience to extreme drought events, compared with populations from more humid geographical origins. The substantial genetic variation found for growth resilience highlights the possibility of selecting for drought resilience in boreal conifers. As a major research outcome, we showed that adaptive genetic variation in response to changing local conditions can shape drought vulnerability at the intraspecific level. Our findings have wide implications for forest ecosystem management and conservation.

AB  - PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 mass concentrations have been measured at Delhi (28 degrees 35'N; 77 degrees 12'E) during the August to December 2007. The running mean of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 data shows large variations. The PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were ranged from 20 to 180 mu g/m(3) during the monsoon and from 100 to 500 mu g/m(3) during the winter (up to 1200 mu g/m(3) in November due to Deepavali fireworks). For the same running mean cycles, higher mass concentrations in the PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were corresponded with peaks in the relative humidity and lower levels linked to peaks in the ambient temperature. The evolutions of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentrations after the elapsed times are simulated with mean mass scavenging coefficients. These evolution patterns clearly show the difference in washout of PM10 with impaction scavenging relative to those for PM2.5 and PM1 particles over different rainfall durations. Air-mass pathways traced with HYSPLIT model over the study area illustrates the nature of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 levels with monsoon and winter air-mass circulations over Delhi.

AB  - Bacteria spend their lives buffeted by changing environmental conditions. To adapt to and survive these stresses, bacteria have global response systems that result in sweeping changes in gene expression and cellular metabolism. These responses are controlled by master regulators, which include: alternative sigma factors, such as RpoS and RpoH; small molecule effectors, such as ppGpp; gene repressors such as LexA; and, inorganic molecules, such as polyphosphate. The response pathways extensively overlap and are induced to various extents by the same environmental stresses. These stresses include nutritional deprivation, DNA damage, temperature shift, and exposure to antibiotics. All of these global stress responses include functions that can increase genetic variability. In particular, up-regulation and activation of errorprone DNA polymerases, down-regulation of error-correcting enzymes, and movement of mobile genetic elements are common features of several stress responses. The result is that under a variety of stressful conditions, bacteria are induced for genetic change. This transient mutator state may be important for adaptive evolution.

TI  - Projected Future Temporal Trends of Two Different Urban Heat Islands in Athens (Greece) under Three Climate Change Scenarios: A Statistical Approach
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - This is the first study to look at future temporal urban heath island (UHI) trends of Athens (Greece) under different UHI intensity regimes. Historical changes in the Athens UHI, spanning 1971-2016, were assessed by contrasting two air temperature records from stable meteorological stations in contrasting urban and rural settings. Subsequently, we used a five-member regional climate model (RCM) sub-ensemble from EURO-CORDEX with a horizontal resolution of 0.11 degrees (similar to 12 x 12 km) to simulate air temperature data, spanning the period 1976-2100, for the two station sites. Three future emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were implanted in the simulations after 2005 covering the period 2006-2100. Two 20-year historical reference periods (1976-1995 and 1996-2015) were selected with contrasting UHI regimes; the second period had a stronger intensity. The daily maximum and minimum air temperature data (T(max)and T-min) for the two reference periods were perturbed to two future periods, 2046-2065 and 2076-2095, under the three RCPs, by applying the empirical quantile mapping (eqm) bias-adjusting method. This novel approach allows us to assess future temperature developments in Athens under two UHI intensity regimes that are mainly forced by differences in air pollution and heat input. We found that the future frequency of days with T-max> 37 degrees C in Athens was only different from rural background values under the intense UHI regime. Thus, the impact of heatwaves on the urban environment of Athens is dependent on UHI intensity. There is a large increase in the future frequency of nights with T-min> 26 degrees C in Athens under all UHI regimes and climate scenarios; these events remain comparatively rare at the rural site. This large urban amplification of the frequency of extremely hot nights is likely caused by air pollution. Consequently, local mitigation policies aimed at decreasing urban atmospheric pollution are expected to be highly effective in reducing urban temperatures and extreme heat events in Athens under future climate change scenarios. Such policies directly have multiple benefits, including reduced electricity (energy) needs, improved living quality and strong health advantages (heat- and pollution-related illness/deaths).

TI  - Existing Host Range Mutations Constrain Further Emergence of RNA Viruses
VL  - 93
IS  - 4
AB  - RNA viruses are capable of rapid host shifting, typically due to a point mutation that confers expanded host range. As additional point mutations are necessary for further expansions, epistasis among host range mutations can potentially affect the mutational neighborhood and frequency of niche expansion. We mapped the mutational neighborhood of host range expansion using three genotypes of the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) bacteriophage phi 6 (wild type and two isogenic host range mutants) on the novel host Pseudomonas syringae pv. atrofaciens. Both Sanger sequencing of 50 P. syringae pv. atrofaciens mutant clones for each genotype and population Illumina sequencing revealed the same high-frequency mutations allowing infection of P. syringae pv. atrofaciens. Wild-type phi 6 had at least nine different ways of mutating to enter the novel host, eight of which are in p3 (host attachment protein gene), and 13/50 clones had unchanged p3 genes. However, the two isogenic mutants had dramatically restricted neighborhoods: only one or two mutations, all in p3. Deep sequencing revealed that wild-type clones without mutations in p3 likely had changes in p12 (morphogenic protein), a region that was not polymorphic for the two isogenic host range mutants. Sanger sequencing confirmed that 10/13 of the wild-type phi 6 clones had nonsynonymous mutations in p12, and 2 others had point mutations in p9 and p5. None of these genes had previously been associated with host range expansion in phi 6. We demonstrate, for the first time, epistatic constraint in an RNA virus due to host range mutations themselves, which has implications for models of serial host range expansion.

TI  - Environmental sustainability of fruit and vegetable production supply chains in the face of climate change: A review
VL  - 650
SP  - 2863-2879
AB  - This study discusses importance of assessing environmental sustainability of fruits and vegetable (F&V) production sector in future climate change (CC) scenarios. For the current production scenario, life cycle environmental footprints of F&V supply chain are discussed considering the influences of: agro-climates, production systems, raw material inputs, post-harvest managements to the products' yield and quality. Potential risks of CC to the sector are discussed in the context of elevated global temperature and carbon dioxide level, ozone depletion and changes in precipitation patterns. Potential risks due to CC are on the productivity and the quality of F&V products, such as texture, color, maturity and nutrients. Increased risk of failure of the current crop protection strategies, e.g. due to pest infestations and different crop-water and nutrient stresses are among the short and long-term risks. It also discusses potential adaptation and mitigation measures to CC, and therefrom argues on the related environmental consequences in the supply chain. From the LCA studies, it was revealed that environmental impacts of F&V supply chain varied as per agro-ecological characteristics and farming systems, e.g. greenhouse vs open-field, organic vs conventional, and grown in different agro-climatic conditions. The nexus among the climatic stresses, potential adaptation and mitigation measures, hence were in the form of potential changes in the raw material inputs and resource flows depending on the preferred future agro-management strategies and farming practices. Adaptation and other management options, included are, changes in: crop calendar, nutrient and pest management strategies, post-harvest handling and improved preservation of F&V products. These are argued eventually being determining factors leading to different environmental footprints compared to the existing management scenarios. Prospective life cycle environmental evaluation of F&V supply chain considering the relationship among product yield and qualities, CC stresses and potential adaptation and mitigation measures is thus a new thrust and direction.

TI  - Genetic differentiation and signatures of local adaptation revealed by RADseq for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SP  - 7951-7969
AB  - Connectivity of marine populations is shaped by complex interactions between biological and physical processes across the seascape. The influence of environmental features on the genetic structure of populations has key implications for the dynamics and persistence of populations, and an understanding of spatial scales and patterns of connectivity is crucial for management and conservation. This study employed a seascape genomics approach combining larval dispersal modeling and population genomic analysis using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained from RADseq to examine environmental factors influencing patterns of genetic structure and connectivity for a highly dispersive mud crab Scylla olivacea (Herbst, 1796) in the Sulu Sea. Dispersal simulations reveal widespread but asymmetric larval dispersal influenced by persistent southward and westward surface circulation features in the Sulu Sea. Despite potential for widespread dispersal across the Sulu Sea, significant genetic differentiation was detected among eight populations based on 1,655 SNPs (F-ST = 0.0057, p < .001) and a subset of 1,643 putatively neutral SNP markers (F-ST = 0.0042, p < .001). Oceanography influences genetic structure, with redundancy analysis (RDA) indicating significant contribution of asymmetric ocean currents to neutral genetic variation (Radj2 = 0.133, p = .035). Genetic structure may also reflect demographic factors, with divergent populations characterized by low effective population sizes (N-e < 50). Pronounced latitudinal genetic structure was recovered for loci putatively under selection (F-ST = 0.2390, p < .001), significantly correlated with sea surface temperature variabilities during peak spawning months for S. olivacea (Radj2 = 0.692-0.763; p < .050), suggesting putative signatures of selection and local adaptation to thermal clines. While oceanography and dispersal ability likely shape patterns of gene flow and genetic structure of S. olivacea across the Sulu Sea, the impacts of genetic drift and natural selection influenced by sea surface temperature also appear as likely drivers of population genetic structure. This study contributes to the growing body of literature documenting population genetic structure and local adaptation for highly dispersive marine species, and provides information useful for spatial management of the fishery resource.

TI  - Forecasting of ozone concentration using frequency MA-OWA Model
SP  - 3461-3466
AB  - Air pollution can cause the human health, plants growth and daily mortality in numerous studies over the past decade. Therefore, forecasting and analysis of air quality are important topics of research today. The causes of poor air quality are global warming, greenhouse effects, acid rain, etc. Air pollution problems are related to the emissions of sulfur dioxides (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended particulates (PM10), ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and so on. O-3 adverse effects on human health has received intensively concern in recent years, It has been recognized as one of the principal pollutants that degrades air quality, thus we uses O-3 attribute to evaluate air quality. This study proposed a frequency moving average - order weight average (MA-OWA) model to forecast air quality by daily O-3 concentration. Due to O-3 data is belong to time series pattern, MA can simple calculation and OWA operator can aggregate multiple lag periods into single aggregated value by different situation parameters alpha. Frequency MA-OWA based time series model can efficiently and accurately forecast O-3. To demonstrate of the proposed, air quality monitoring the urban sites of Hsinchu (Taiwan), is selected for the numerical experiment from 2007 was utilized. From the results, the proposed methods outperform the listing methods in RMSE and MAPE.

TI  - Modeling the volcanism on Mars
VL  - 150
IS  - 2
SP  - 195-205
AB  - The total amount of melt produced in Mars during its evolution is estimated by means of a parameterized, one-dimensional, analytic mantle convection model that assumes a stagnant lid and whole mantle convection. The fertility of the mantle-defined as the potential to create basalt-and its variation with time are taken into account. The model is composed of core, mantle, and lithosphere, with two boundary layers separating them. The contributions to volcanism by pressure release melting (PRM), and by plumes from the core-mantle boundary layer, are compared and discussed. We show that such models tend to produce considerable melting during the early evolution of the planet, and that the amount of melting depends strongly on the abundances of radioactive elements. Although the model's assumptions may not be valid for the early evolution of the planet, the model is relevant to the later history, which is insensitive to initial conditions. We find that PRM volcanism should have ceased between 1 and 2.5 Byr ago and any recent volcanic activity must have originated in plumes. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

TI  - Terrestrial hibernation in the northern cricket frog, Acris crepitans
VL  - 77
IS  - 8
SP  - 1240-1246
AB  - We used laboratory experiments and field observations to explore overwintering in the northern cricket frog, Acris crepitans, in southern Ohio and Indiana. Cricket frogs died within 24 h when submerged in simulated pond water that was anoxic or hypoxic, but lived 8-10 days when the water was oxygenated initially. Habitat selection experiments indicated that cricket frogs prefer a soil substrate to water as temperature decreases from 8 to 2C. These data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially. However, unlike sympatric hylids, this species does not tolerate extensive freezing: only 2 of 15 individuals survived freezing in the -0.8 to -2.6C range (duration 24-96 h). Cricket frogs supercooled when dry (mean supercooling point -5.5C; range from -4.3 to -6.8C), but were easily inoculated by external ice at temperatures between -0.5 and -0.8C. Our data suggested that cricket frogs hibernate terrestrially but are notfreeze tolerant, are not fossorial, and are incapable of supercooling in the presence of external ice. Thus we hypothesized that cricket frogs must hibernate in terrestrial sites that adequately protect against freezing. Indeed, midwinter surveys revealed cricket frogs hibernating in crayfish burrows and cracksof the pond bank, where wet soils buffered against extensive freezing of the soil.

TI  - Halophilic bacteria in a Lake Michigan drainage basin as potential biological indicators of chloride-impacted freshwaters
VL  - 846
AB  - There are few biological indicators for freshwater systems subjected to high chloride levels. Freshwater systems receive many forms of chloride such as road salts (e.g., NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2), fertilizers (e.g., KCl), and year-round water softener pollution. The goal our study was to investigate Halomonadaceae populations as prospective biological indicators of chloride-impacted freshwaters. The bacterial family Halomonadaceae are halophiles that generally require the presence of salt to survive, which make them an attractive candidate in determining chloride impaired areas. Field sediment surveys assessed how salt tolerant and halophilic bacteria abundance corresponded to chloride and conductivity measuremen ts. Colony forming unit (CFU) counts on modified M9 6% NaCl plates (w/v) at urbanized sites compared to the rural sites had highest counts during winter and spring when chloride concentrations were also highest. Select isolates identified as Halomonadaceae through 16S rRNA sequencing were kept as active cultures to determine the NaCl concentration and temperature preference that resulted in the isolates optimal growth. Isolates tested under 5 'C (cold) grew optimally in 2 % NaCl (w/v), whereas under 18 degrees C (warm), isolates showed optimal growth at 6 % NaCl. The majority of isolates had maximum growth in the warmer temperature, however, select isolates grew better in the cold temperature. Culture-independent methods were used and identified Halomonadaceae were widespread and permeant members of the microbial community in a lake Michigan drainage basin. Quantitative polymerasc chain reaction (qPCR) targeting Halomonadaceae genera demonstrated that abundance varied by site, but overall were present throughout the year. I lowever, community sequencing revealed there were a large relative proportion of specific Halomonadaceae populations present in winter versus summer. Methods targeting salt tolerant bacteria and specific members of Halomonadaceae appears to be a promising approach to assess chloride-impacted areas to better understand the long-term ecological impacts as we continue to salinize freshwater resources.

TI  - Impact of high temperature on heterosis and general combining ability in spring canola (Brassica napus L.)
VL  - 221
SP  - 61-70
AB  - Canola is an extremely important commodity to the western Canadian economy. Annual or geographic fluctuations in yield due to heat stress can have a significant influence on total production. To increase the stability of canola yield, breeders need to select for increased heat tolerance in a reliable, repeatable, cost effective manner that represents commercial production conditions. Field experiments with 10 (5 maintainer and 5 restorer) inbreds and the 25 corresponding hybrids were conducted across 2 years with 2 locations per year. Each experiment had two planting dates (normal planting date and a late planting date). The experiments were designed to determine If: 1) planting date can be used as a proxy for heat stress; 2) heterosis can minimize the impact of heat stress; and 3) direct selection within a heat-stress environment improves genetic gain for heat stress tolerance. Principal component analysis of the Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, soil moisture, daily light integral and yield were conducted. The resulting biplot analyses demonstrate that the temperature variables had a greater impact on yield than soil moisture or daily light integral and therefore planting date was identified as a successful proxy for heat stress. The heat-stress treatment caused a 23% mean reduction in seed yield (20% reduction within the hybrids and 25% reduction within the inbreds) indicating that heterosis can reduce the impact of higher temperatures on canola yield. The mean heat susceptibility index was 0.94 and 1.20 for the hybrids and inbreds respectively; further demonstrating that the hybrids were more heat tolerant than the inbreds. Analyses of the GCA for the inbreds shows 4 cross-over interactions between the two temperature treatments indicating that direct selection for heat tolerance will be necessary to increase the response to selection for this trait. Overall canola breeders interested in increasing heat tolerance need to consider utilizing planting date as a high-temperature treatment and cannot rely on indirect selection from experiments under optimal conditions.

TI  - Low tolerance of salt water in a marine fish: new and historical evidence for surprising local adaption in the well-studied commercially exploited capelin
VL  - 75
IS  - 5
SP  - 673-681
AB  - Intraspecific biodiversity among populations is ecologically and evolutionarily notable. Substantial adaptations in well-studied commercial species should be obvious and ought to have been uncovered. The tenet of marine stability posits relatively little local adaptation in the sea, except for temperature responses to latitude for widespread species. However, aquatic reproduction is tightly constrained by water chemistry, which may lead to abstruse adaptations. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) reproduction has been studied for over a century, occurring within pebble substrate on beaches or the seafloor of continental shelves. Offshore spawners (Iceland/Barents Sea) have embryos with tolerance of high salinity. I provide new and historical data on beach spawners from several areas indicating that their embryos perform well from similar to 2 to 28 psu, but at higher salinities indicative of coastal seawater, there is poor hatch success, larvae take longer to hatch, hatch at a smaller size, and starve more quickly. The body of evidence supports the hypothesis that beach spawning evolved from anadromy, with offshore spawning a derived state, enabled by increased salinity tolerance. The results have recovery implications for depleted Newfoundland stocks, which have been spawning seasonally late under relatively high salinity for over 25 years.

TI  - An improved land biosphere module for use in the DCESS Earth system model (version 1.1) with application to the last glacial termination
VL  - 10
IS  - 9
SP  - 3481-3498
AB  - Interactions between the land biosphere and the atmosphere play an important role for the Earth's carbon cycle and thus should be considered in studies of global carbon cycling and climate. Simple approaches are a useful first step in this direction but may not be applicable for certain climatic conditions. To improve the ability of the reduced-complexity Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model DCESS to address cold climate conditions, we reformulated the model's land biosphere module by extending it to include three dynamically varying vegetation zones as well as a permafrost component. The vegetation zones are formulated by emulating the behaviour of a complex land biosphere model. We show that with the new module, the size and timing of carbon exchanges between atmosphere and land are represented more realistically in cooling and warming experiments. In particular, we use the new module to address carbon cycling and climate change across the last glacial transition. Within the constraints provided by various proxy data records, we tune the DCESS model to a Last Glacial Maximum state and then conduct transient sensitivity experiments across the transition under the application of explicit transition functions for high-latitude ocean exchange, atmospheric dust, and the land ice sheet extent. We compare simulated time evolutions of global mean temperature, pCO(2), atmospheric and oceanic carbon isotopes as well as ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations with proxy data records. In this way we estimate the importance of different processes across the transition with emphasis on the role of land biosphere variations and show that carbon outgassing from permafrost and uptake of carbon by the land biosphere broadly compensate for each other during the temperature rise of the early last deglaciation.

TI  - Genotype-by-environment interactions during early development of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
VL  - 163
IS  - 10
AB  - The increase in seawater temperature due to anthropogenic climate change is likely to affect population persistence and changes in distributional ranges of marine species. Adaptation to warmer environmental conditions will be determined by the presence of tolerant genotypes within a population. The present study determined the genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions during early development of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus cultured at 18 degrees C (mean annual temperature), 21 degrees C (ambient summer temperature) and 24 degrees C (+ 3 degrees C above ambient summer temperature). The experiment was performed in 3 experimental blocks using gametes from 3 males and 3 females crossed in all combinations (North Carolina II cross-breeding design), resulting in 9 families per experimental block (i.e., total of 27 families). Differences between female and male identities were quantified during cleavage and gastrulation: Reaction norms (i.e., interaction plots) showed a clear G x E interaction, with some genotypes performing better than others at high temperatures. Heritability during gastrulation was 0.51, indicating that 51 % of the variability corresponds to genetic variation. Overall, the present study shows that seawater temperature has a negative effect on early development of E. chloroticus; however, there are resilient genotypes in the studied population that could provide the genetic potential to adapt to future ocean conditions.

VL  - 185

SP  - 905-915
AB  - This study was designed to determine the manner in which metabolism is suppressed during dormancy in black and white tegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae). To this end, heart rate (f (H)), respiration rate (f (R)), and deep body temperature (T (b)) were continuously monitored in outdoor enclosures by radio-telemetry for nine months. There was a continuous decline in nighttime breathing and heart rate, at constant T (b), throughout the late summer and fall suggestive of an active metabolic suppression that developed progressively at night preceding the entrance into dormancy. During the day, however, the tegus still emerged to bask. In May, when the tegus made a behavioural commitment to dormancy, T (b) (day and night) fell to match burrow temperature, accompanied by a further reduction in f (H) and f (R). Tegus, under the conditions of this study, did arouse periodically during dormancy. There was a complex interplay between changes in f (H) and T (b) associated with the direct effects of temperature and the indirect effects of thermoregulation, activity, and changes in metabolism. This interplay gave rise to a daily hysteresis in the f (H)/T (b) relationship reflective of the physiological changes associated with warming and cooling as preferred T (b) alternated between daytime and nighttime levels. The shape of the hysteresis curve varied with season along with changes in metabolic state and daytime and nighttime body temperature preferences.

TI  - Circadian rhythmicity and photoperiodism in the pitcher-plant mosquito: Adaptive response to the photic environment or correlated response to the seasonal environment?
VL  - 161
IS  - 5
SP  - 735-748
AB  - Many plants and animals use the length of day or photoperiod to cue their seasonal patterns of development, reproduction, dormancy, and migration. Among temperate arthropods, the median or critical photoperiod increases with latitude or altitude. Concomitantly, in beetles, moths, mites, flies, and mosquitoes, there is a declining expression of a rhythmic, presumably circadian-based, component of photoperiodic response. It has been proposed that the long summer days in the north select for a reduced response to light by the circadian clock, which results in this declining rhythmic expression and, consequently, longer northern critical photoperiods. However, these patterns might also be due to direct, seasonal selection on the critical photoperiod itself, which results in a correlated reduction in the rhythmic component as a result of internal physiological constraints within the organism. Using standard light duration and selection experiments, we show that evolution of photoperiodic time measurement in the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, results from the direct response of critical photoperiod to seasonal selection and a correlated response of the rhythmic component of photoperiodic time measurement. We conclude that expression of the circadian clock is necessary neither for the central mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement nor for the adaptive modification of critical photoperiod.

TI  - Phase transformation behavior during continuous cooling and isothermal holding of aluminum and silicon bearing trip steels
SP  - 549-561
AB  - Increased emphasis oil crash worthiness in combination with weight reduction has prompted automotive manufacturers to search for steels with unusual properties. TRansformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) Steels offer a unique combination of high tensile strength and ductility, factors that facilitate a high degree of energy absorption. As a consequence, TRIP steel has become a material of interest for automotive applications. However, in order to optimize these very complicated steels, a clear understanding of the microstructural evolution during heat treatment is necessary. This work was, therefore, undertaken to study phase transformation behavior during continuous cooling and isothermal holding of Al and Si hearing TRIP Steels. Comprehensive dilatometric investigation of four TRIP Steels based oil 0.15C-1.5Mn composition was carried out. Two steels contained 1.0% and 1.6%Si, two others were Si-free steels with 1.25% and 1.9%Al. A(C1) - A(C3) values were determined during continuous heating at 2-20degreesC/sec. An increase in Si or Al results in a decrease in the austenite fraction at compared temperatures due to the expanding A(C1) - A(C3) range. The differences in the austenitization kinetics occurred due to both different "equilibrium arnount" and the effects of constituent elements oil the rate of diffusion. A generalized method was developed to construct CCT diagrams from dilatometric data. Appropriate peaks in the plot of the second derivative dilatation curve Versus temperature identified the transformation temperatures. Comparison of CCT diagrams based oil hot rolled and cold rolled samples show a lack of fit between the two. The initially hot rolled (IHR) structure does not truly represent the real behavior of initially cold rolled (ICR) material. In particular, ICR samples exhibit considerably higher F-S and B-S temperatures (start of fertile and bainite transformation respectively) and a higher rate of ferrite formation that results in significantly lower M-S temperatures. Differences in the isothermal behavior of the studied steels are attributed not only to the role of alloying elements, but also to the initial carbon content in austenite, which is a function of the austenite Volume fraction formed at comparative temperatures. The microstructural evolution during isothermal holding is strongly correlated to the mechanical properties in these steels.

IS  - 1
SP  - 153-162
AB  - The annual patterns of oxygen tension (PO2) and temperature are described for two humanmade ponds in Alabama-one exposed, shallow, and much longer than wide (Road Pond); and one protected, deeper, and circular (Strip Mine Pond). Both ponds supported large populations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles. Wind-mixing produced complete water column overturn on several occasions throughout the year in the Road Pond but only incomplete turnover in the Strip Mine Pond and only then during the colder months, PO2 in the Strip Mine Pond fell below the critical O-2 tension (P-c) of the tadpoles during warmer months at depths of greater than or equal to 2 m; nevertheless the tadpoles favored depths near 2 m during the summer, reversing their winter tendency to move toward shore. Road Pond tadpoles also moved away from shore during the summer, but the PO2 in this pond did not normally fall below the P-c of the tadpoles. Summer tadpoles acclimated to 25 C selected a mean temperature of 28.9 C in a temperature gradient; winter tadpoles acclimated to 10 C selected a mean of 20.0 C, Diurnal and annual shifts in the patterns of distribution of bullfrog tadpoles within our study ponds were most likely related to temperature patterns, not to aquatic predators.

TI  - TEMPERATURE DETERMINATION OF MALE OUTCROSSING ABILITY IN A SIMULTANEOUS HERMAPHRODITE
VL  - 46
IS  - 6
SP  - 1698-1707
AB  - Phally, a genital dimorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine factors maintaining outcrossing within an animal species in the presence of recombination. Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilize but only euphallics develop a functional penis and prostate allowing them to donate sperm. Previous studies of phally in the gastropod Bulinus truncatus (Mollusca: Pulmonata) suggest that phally may be under direct genetic control in some populations and strongly influenced by environmental factors in others. Experiments reported here identify temperature as a cue affecting phally determination in two populations of B. truncatus. In both populations, a higher proportion of euphallics was produced at low temperature (22 +/- 1-degrees-C) than at high temperature (30 +/- 1-degrees-C). Temperatures experienced by parents did not affect the proportion of euphallics they produced. Instead, phally was sensitive to temperature during the egg stage postoviposition and during the hatchling stage; the relative influence of temperature before and after hatching varied between populations. The total number of hatchlings reaching maturity at high and low temperature did not differ, but at low temperature, snails took longer to hatch and mature, and had lower survivorship. Just as studies of environmental sex determination have shed light on selective pressures influencing sex ratio evolution, we suggest that temperature-sensitive phally determination may shed light on the selective pressures maintaining outcrossing in B. truncatus.

VL  - 69
SP  - 458-464
AB  - Adults of the noctuid moth Autographa gamma undertake seasonal migrations into areas where they are unable to breed continuously. Individuals migrate into Britain each spring and offspring of these migrants probably return in autumn to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East, although the existence of these return migrations has been questioned. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential because individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their potential for flight and to travel further. Significant, positive full-sib correlations showed that female offspring with long PRPs came from families where their brothers had correspondingly long PRPs. This suggests that the same genes control the rate of reproductive development in both sexes. There was a rapid response to selection for short and long PRP, with separation of the lines by the second generation of selection. Sib-analysis and parent-offspring regressions showed that the genes with the greatest influence on PRP are X-linked, although there is also an autosomal influence. The significance of X-linkage of genes controlling the PRP is discussed in relation to the migratory strategy of A. gamma.

TI  - The weather dictates the rhythms: Alpine chamois activity is well adapted to ecological conditions
VL  - 70
IS  - 8
SP  - 1291-1304
AB  - Activity rhythms play an important role in the ecological relations of a species and form part of its evolutionary adaptation. Such rhythms are strongly synchronised with the annual cyclic changes by environmental stimuli, the so-called zeitgebers. Animals' reliance on environmental stimuli is highly species-specific and allows behavioural adjustments to be made in preparation for the conditions expected in each season. We investigated daily and annual activity rhythms of Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) by analysing high-resolution data of animals monitored with GPS collars. This first detailed field study of chamois activity showed that this species exhibited clear daily and annual activity rhythms entrained to the light-dark cycle. Chamois were more active during spring-summer and less active during winter, likely in response to the variation in the availability of food resources: both sexes appeared to maximise energy intake during the season offering the highest amount of food resources to compensate for poor food supply during winter. Daily activity was influenced by the climatic factors considered. We showed a negative correlation between daily activity and adverse climatic conditions (i.e. precipitation and, during winter, snow depth). As activity was strongly influenced by the interplay between temperature and wind throughout the year and by radiation and wind in winter, we conjectured that it was critically dependent upon animals' thermal balance. In conclusion, our study highlighted that chamois is well adapted to the Alpine environment and seasonality but also raised questions about its ability to adapt to future climate change. In this study, we investigated the effects of ecological factors on Alpine chamois activity. Thanks to radio collars with accelerometers, we obtained highly detailed information on activity levels of wild animals. We found that chamois were more active during spring-summer (i.e. the seasons with the highest quality and quantity of food) and less active during winter. Our results showed that chamois activity was strongly influenced by such climatic factors as temperature, precipitation and wind speed. In winter time, chamois activity increased during the days with high solar radiation and decreased with high snow depth. Given their wide distribution in the Alps, chamois can be considered as a sentinel species of Alpine habitats. Thus, our results on the current relationship between climate and chamois behaviour may shed light on the animals' ability to track and adapt to climate change.

VL  - 21

SP  - 743-751
AB  - 1. Freshwater mussels are in decline throughout their range. The lack of natural recruitment in freshwater pearl mussel populations and other freshwater molluscs has led to controversies about the usefulness and applicability of captive breeding techniques for their conservation. 2. The current state of rearing and culturing programmes for freshwater mussels in Europe and North America is reviewed here with a focus on the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). Different strategies of propagation and the key factors of success are addressed and conservation management decisions are discussed with respect to risk reduction and the intensity of the culturing system. 3. Based on the rearing techniques applied for multiple species in North America, and for the genus Margaritifera in European countries, sufficient numbers of juveniles can be produced to sustain selected populations. However, captive breeding and stocking should be carefully documented and must not replace the restoration of functional stream habitats. 4. From a conservation point of view, captive breeding of endangered mussel species can be a last-minute rescue tool in order to retain the evolutionary potential of priority populations which would not persist long enough to benefit from habitat restoration practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuta absolutaMeyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is native to South America and has recently invaded European, African and Asian countries, where it is causing severe damage to tomato crops leading to an increase in the number of insecticide applications. This situation has prompted a demand for alternative pest management strategies aiming to control T. absoluta and concomitantly reduce insecticide applications. The development period for immature stages of T. absoluta at constant temperatures was modelled to select appropriatemathematical functions for simulating its development.

TI  - An improved method for the recovery of Salmonella serovars from orange juice using universal preenrichment broth
VL  - 64
IS  - 5
SP  - 659-663
AB  - The relative effectiveness of three methods for the recovery of Salmonella serovars from orange juice was determined. One method, a modified Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure consisted of preenrichment in lactose broth at 35 degreesC for 24 h, selective enrichment, and selective plating. Another method, a National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 1) procedure, consisted of direct enrichment in tetrathionate broth at 35 degreesC for 24 and 48 h, followed by selective plating. The third method (also from CDC and designated CDC 2) consisted of preenrichment in Universal Preenrichment (UP) broth at 35 degreesC for 24 h, selective enrichment, and selective plating. In 10 experiments encompassing five different Salmonella serovars and 200 test portions per broth, the CDC 1 method recovered 141 Salmonella-positive test portions, the BAM method recovered 151, and the CDC 2 method recovered 171. In 2 of the 10 experiments, with two different Salmonella serovars, the BAM recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did the CDC 2 method. On the basis of the above results, the second phase of this study focused on a comparison of the effectiveness of the BAM-recommended lactose broth and the CDC 2-recommended UP broth as preenrichment media for the recovery of Salmonella serovars from pasteurized and unpasteurized orange juice. Subsequent culture treatment of the two preenrichments was identical so that the effect of other variables (e.g., different selective enrichment media, various incubation temperatures, and different selective plating agars) on the relative performance of these two preenrichment media was excluded. In one of nine experiments, with pasteurized orange juice, lactose broth recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did UP broth. For the combined results of the nine pasteurized orange juice experiments (180 test portions per broth), lactose broth recovered 99 Salmonella-positive test portions, and UP broth recovered 116. In three of seven experiments, with unpasteurized orange juice, lactose broth recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did UP broth. For the combined results of the seven unpasteurized orange juice experiments (140 test portions per broth), lactose broth recovered 73 Salmonella-positive test portions, and UP broth recovered 117. For both pasteurized and unpasteurized orange juice, the total number of Salmonella-positive test portions recovered with UP broth was significantly greater than the number recovered with lactose broth. These results indicate that UP broth is a more effective enrichment broth for the recovery of Salmonella from orange juice than is lactose broth.

VL  - 10

AB  - The Hong Kong oyster Magallana hongkongensis, previously known as Crassostrea hongkongensis, is a true oyster species native to the estuarine-coast of the Pearl River Delta in southern China. The species-with scientific, ecological, cultural, and nutritional importance-has been farmed for hundreds of years. However, there is only limited information on its genetics, stress adaptation mechanisms, and gut microbiota, restricting the sustainable production and use of oyster resources. Here, we present population structure analysis on M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, as well as transcriptome analysis on heat shock responses and the gut microbiota profile of M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including those on the homeobox genes and heat shock protein genes, were revealed by the whole genome resequencing. Transcriptomes of oysters incubated at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C for 24 h were sequenced which revealed the heat-induced regulation of heat shock protein pathway genes. Furthermore, the gut microbe community was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing which identified Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes as the most abundant phyla. This study reveals the molecular basis for the adaptation of the oyster M. hongkongensis to environmental conditions.

AB  - The southern part of the Punjab province is blessed with a warm climate favorable for cotton production. Most of the rural families are dependent on cotton for socio-economic survival. Therefore, they utilize huge financial resources on pesticides to get maximum cotton production for sustainable rural livelihoods. However, lack of information about safe usage of pesticides may result not only in wastage of resources but also causes harmful effects. Therefore, the present study has been designed to assess the knowledge level of farmers about safe use of pesticides. From southern part of the Punjab, district Khanewal was selected for in-depth analysis about knowledge and behavior of pesticide users. A sample of 160 respondents was selected randomly and data from them was collected through interviews. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analyzing. Results depict that instructions regarding safe use of pesticides application was ranked 1st due to highest weighted score with value of 581. Based on ranking of health and environmental effects of pesticides, headache (health hazard) and ground water pollution (environmental hazard) were ranked 1st as perceived by farmer respondents. There is a need for training of farming community concerning safe usage of pesticides to avoid its health and the environmental effects.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Positioning of Service Crops in Cereals Affects Yield and Weed Control
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - Leguminous service crops (SCs) can provide multiple services to cropping systems, reducing the reliance on external resources if sufficient biomass is produced. However, rapid light and temperature reductions limit post-harvest cultivation of SCs in Northern Europe. A novel practice of intercropping SCs in two consecutive crops (spring-winter cereal) to extend the period of SCs growth, and hence improve yield and reduce weeds, was tested. Three spatial and temporal arrangements of SCs and cash crops were investigated, as well as three SC mixtures, characterized by their longevity and frost sensitivity. Compared to no SC, the best performing mixture, frost-tolerant annuals, increased grain and N yield of winter wheat by 10% and 19%, respectively, and reduced weed biomass by 15% and 26% in oats and winter wheat, respectively. These effects were attributed to high biomass production and winter survival. However, this SC reduced oat yields by 15% compared to no SC. Furthermore, SC growth and service provision varied largely between experiments, driven by the weather conditions. Extending the SC's growth period by intercropping in two consecutive cereal crops has potential, but locally adapted species choices and establishment strategies are needed to ensure SC vitality until termination.

TI  - Differences in the chemotype of two native spearmint clonal lines selected for rosmarinic acid accumulation in comparison to commercially grown native spearmint
VL  - 63
SP  - 87-91
AB  - Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a water soluble antioxidant present in many Lamiaceae species at varying levels, including spearmint (Mentha spicata L). Two proprietary spearmint clonal lines, KI110 and KI42, with elevated levels of RA (designated Hi-RA) are currently being grown in Indiana for the commercial extraction of RA. The two Hi-RA clonal lines were selected from a native spearmint genetic background and are distinct in their phytochemical composition relative to native spearmint that is commercially grown for purposes of extraction of volatile oils for flavoring applications ("commercial spearmint"). The aim of this study was to describe the major compositional chemotypic differences between the proprietary Hi-RA native spearmint clonal lines relative to a commercial native clonal line of spearmint grown in Indiana. Leaf tissue samples of KI110, KI42 and the commercial spearmint clonal line were collected from field locations in Indiana during June 2013 for RA quantitation and chemical profiling of the essential oil fraction. RA levels in KI110 and KI42 were significantly higher than the commercial spearmint samples. GC-MS analysis revealed major compositional differences between the Hi-RA and commercial spearmint oils. Carvone was the dominant molecule in the commercial spearmint oil, constituting 54% of its oil content. In contrast carvone was below the detection levels in the oils of the two Hi-RA clonal lines, KI110 and KI42. Limonene, another notable constituent of commercial spearmint, was found in lower amounts in the Hi-RA mint clonal lines. Mint lactone and alpha-cubebene, the predominant compounds in the oil fractions of Hi-RA clonal lines KI110 and KI42, respectively, were either absent or present in insignificant amounts in the commercial spearmint. Differential amounts of myrcene and 1,8-cineole were observed in the three mint oil samples. The chemical fingerprints of the Hi-RA spearmint clonal lines clearly differentiate them from commercial spearmint and they should therefore be considered distinct, clonal lines of spearmint (M. spicata) with potential heath-promotive properties associated with KI110 and KI42 plant extracts that contain higher level of rosmarinic acid.

TI  - Geocentric alternatives to site index for modeling tree increment in uneven-aged mixed stands
VL  - 392
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Due to their expected higher resilience following disturbances and adaptive potential to new climatic conditions, interest in uneven-aged mixed forests has increased in recent years. It is, however, unclear how to best quantify their site-specific growth potential, particularly at a time when there is a pressing need to consider the effects of a changing climate on tree and forest growth. Here, we address these topics using growth models for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) and Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), based on long-term observations from uneven-aged mixed forests in southwestern Germany. We used a linear mixed-effects framework for modeling basal area increment of individual trees. We accounted for site quality using a phytocentric index based on the past growth of dominant trees (growth index) and three classes of geocentric environmental descriptors: physiographic, edaphic and climatic (temperature means and precipitation sums aggregated over 5, 15 or 30 years). For a subset of the data where it was possible to determine site index, growth index proved to be better predictor of tree increment than site index. When considering the entire dataset, climate variables had the single largest positive impact on model fit, yet cross-validation results suggested that no improvement in predictive ability occurred unless physiographic variables were also added. Higher levels of spring and growing season precipitation stimulated growth for Norway spruce and Silver fir, respectively. Temperature-growth relationships were predominantly positive for Silver fir and negative for Norway spruce. Aggregating climate variables over progressively longer time spans clearly reduced model fit for Norway spruce, yet a similar pattern was not apparent for Silver fir. Our results indicate that without rigorous testing, tried-and-trusted decision tools developed for even aged, single-species stands cannot be transferred to uneven-aged mixed forests. Precipitation- and temperature-based variables provide dynamic proxies which may allow us to better grasp the complexity of climate-growth relationships. This understanding is essential for reducing the uncertainty around predictions of climate change impacts on forest ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 300
IS  - 1
SP  - 59-67
AB  - To determine the characteristic of carbonaceous species in atmospheric particles in Hong Kong, PM10 and PM2.5, samples were collected using high volume (hi-vol.) air samplers from November 2000 to February 2001. The organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were analyzed by the selective thermal manganese dioxide oxidation (TMO) method. The ratios of PM2.5/PM10 mass ratios were 0.61, 0.78 and 0.53 for particulate matter collected at PolyU station (PolyU, near a major traffic corridor), Kwun Tong station (KT, mixed residential/commercial/industrial) and the Hok Tsui background station (HT), respectively. These results indicate that the PM2.5 concentrations constitute the majority of the PM10 concentrations, especially in urban and industrial areas of Hong Kong. The average concentrations at the three sites ranged from 73.11 to 83.52 mug/m(3) for PM10 and from 42.37 to 57.38 mug/m(3) for PM2.5. The highest daily mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were 125.89 mug/m(3) and 116.89 mug/m(3) at KT, respectively. The correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 was high at KT and HT (r > 0.9, P < 0.01). This means that the sources of PM10 and PM2.5 may be the same at both sites. The highest mean concentration of OC (12.02 mug/ m(3)) and EC (6.86 mug/m(3)) in PM10 was found at the PolyU among the three sites. For PM2.5, the highest mean concentration of OC (10.16 mug/m(3)) was at KT while the highest mean concentration of EC (7.95 mug/m(3)) was at PolyU. However, the background concentrations at HT were higher than another background area, Kosan, Korea. Transportation of pollutants from the Asian continent may be responsible for the elevations of EC + OC at the remote site. More than 74% of the EC and more than 79% of the OC were found in the PK2.5 fraction at the three sampling locations. At PolyU station, PM2.5 consisted of 18.18% OC and 11.16% EC while 17.70% OC and 8.81% EC were found in KT station. Thus OC and EC are major constituents of aerosols in Hong Kong. OC/EC ratios for PM10 and PM, 5 were less than 2 at PolyU and KT stations while the ratio exceeded 3 at HT background station. This indicates that OC measured in the urban area may be emitted directly as a primary aerosol. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can the turgor loss point be used to assess drought response to select plants for green roofs in hot and dry climates?
VL  - 441
IS  - 1
SP  - 399-408
AB  - Aims Green roofs are important novel urban ecosystems, but their shallow substrates can create plant water deficits in dry climates. Physiological approaches can improve green roof plant selection, and shrubs with high drought tolerance and conservative water use under water-deficit should perform well. The water potential at turgor loss point (psi(tlp)) has been used to predict drought resistance. Therefore we aimed to determine whether psi(tlp) could be used as a screening tool to assess drought resistance for green roof plant selection. Methods We evaluated 20 shrub species, originating from ecosystems varying in water availability, quantified by heat moisture index (HMI) and mean annual precipitation. We conducted a water-deficit experiment to measure psi(tlp), the degree of iso-anisohydry (o psi(MD)) and water use (ET) in response to drought. Results Shrubs with lower psi(tlp) were more anisohydric (greater o psi(MD)) and had a more conservative water use (lower ET). However, psi(tlp), Delta psi(MD) and ET were not related to HMI. Conclusions These results suggest that psi(tlp) could be used to select shrubs for green roofs, as species with lower psi(tlp) tended to be more drought tolerant, more anisohydric and used less water under water-deficit. However, species with higher psi(tlp) could also potentially survive through drought avoidance.

TI  - The impact of climate change on mediterranean intertidal communities: losses in coastal ecosystem integrity and services
VL  - 14
SP  - S5-S17
AB  - As has been shown for other ecosystems, the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change on Mediterranean intertidal habitats are highly variable in space and time. We conducted field and laboratory measurements of cellular, ecophysiological and behavioural responses of selected intertidal invertebrates (mussels, gastropods and sponges) and completed a literature review to determine what is known of socio-economic consequences of these biological changes. Results suggest significant gaps in our knowledge that may impede a complete understanding of likely impacts (physical, biological and socio-economic) and that sufficient data for such an analysis are available only for mussels. Application of ecological models for native mussels Mytilaster minimus and invasive Brachidontes pharaonis bivalves indicates that the current distribution of these species is linked to the availability of food and local temperature. Choosing Israel as a case study, the study focused on the identification of ecosystem services and goods provided by the Mediterranean rocky intertidal and on the assessment of conservation approaches. Intertidal systems were poorly represented in the socio-economic literature, and there was low awareness of the value of these ecosystems among stakeholders. Subsequently, conservation efforts for intertidal communities were minimal. While climate change will very likely continue to impact these systems, our predictive capacity for the extent and locations of such impacts, and of any derived socio-economic consequences, remains limited.

TI  - Trends in the Diurnal Temperature Range over the Southern Slope of Central Himalaya: Retrospective and Prospective Evaluation
VL  - 12
IS  - 12
AB  - The Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) profoundly affects human health, agriculture, eco-system, and socioeconomic systems. In this study, we analyzed past and future changes in DTR using gridded Climate Research Unit (CRU) datasets for the years 1950-2020 and an ensemble means of thirteen bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) scenarios for the rest of the 21st century over the southern slope of Central Himalaya, Nepal. Furthermore, the potential drivers (precipitation and cloud cover) of seasonal and annual DTR were studied using correlation analysis. This study found that the DTR trends generally declined; the highest decrease was observed in the pre-monsoon and winter at a rate of 0.09 degrees C/decade (p <= 0.01). As expected, DTR demonstrated a significant negative correlation with cloudiness and precipitation in all four seasons. Further, the decreased DTR was weakly related to the Sea Surface Temperature variation (SST) in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. We found that the projected DTR changes in the future varied from a marginal increase under the SSP1-2.6 (only pre-monsoon) scenario to continued significant decreases under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Insights based on retrospective and prospective evaluation help to understand the long-term evolution of diurnal temperature variations.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of rice dehydrin gene family: Its evolutionary conservedness and expression pattern in response to PEG induced dehydration stress
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Abiotic stresses adversely affect cellular homeostasis, impairing overall growth and development of plants. These initial stress signals activate downstream signalling processes, which, subsequently, activate stress-responsive mechanisms to re-establish homeostasis. Dehydrins (DHNs) play an important role in combating dehydration stress. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is a paddy crop, is susceptible to drought stress. As drought survival in rice might be viewed as a trait with strong evolutionary selection pressure, we observed DHNs in the light of domestication during the course of evolution. Overall, 65 DHNs were identified by a genome-wide survey of 11 rice species, and 3 DHNs were found to be highly conserved. The correlation of a conserved pattern of DHNs with domestication and diversification of wild to cultivated rice was validated by synonymous substitution rates, indicating that Oryza rufipogon and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica follow an adaptive evolutionary pattern; whereas Oryza nivara and Oryza sativa ssp. indica demonstrate a conserved evolutionary pattern. A comprehensive analysis of tissue-specific expression of DHN genes in japonica and their expression profiles in normal and PEG (poly ethylene glycol)-induced dehydration stress exhibited a spatiotemporal expression pattern. Their interaction network reflects the cross-talk between gene expression and the physiological processes mediating adaptation to dehydration stress. The results obtained strongly indicated the importance of DHNs, as they are conserved during the course of domestication.

VL  - 153
IS  - 5
SP  - 1110-1135
AB  - The late Eocene - early Miocene Alpine-Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) lies in the transition between the Eastern Alps and the Western Carpathians, SE of the Bohemian crystalline massif. Our study shows the involvement of crystalline basement from the former European Jurassic continental margin in two distinct events. A first extensional event coeval with Eggerian-Karpatian (c. 28-16 Ma) thin-skinned thrusting reactivated the rift basement fault array and resulted from the large degree of lower plate bending promoted by high lateral gradients of lithospheric strength and slab pull forces. Slab break-off during the final stages of collision around Karpatian times (c. 17-16 Ma) promoted large-wavelength uplift and an excessive topographic load. This load was reduced by broadening the orogenic wedge through the reactivation of the lower-plate deep detachment beneath and ahead of the thin-skinned thrust front (with the accompanying positive inversion of the basement fault array) and ultimately, by the collapse of the hinterland summits, enhanced by transtensional faulting. Although this work specifically deals with the involvement of the basement in the Alpine-Carpathian Junction, the main conclusions are of general interest to the understanding of orogenic systems.

VL  - 308
SP  - 50-61
AB  - Rear edge populations, those residing at the low-latitude margins of species ranges, represent a critical genetic diversity for species conservation, management, and evolutionary potential. The present study analyses climate-radial growth relations for Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra at their dry distribution limit in the Mediterranean basin. The study was conducted in native relict forests of the two species in SE Spain, analyzing radial growth variability and climate-growth relations over time and between different ecological conditions. The lack of strong precipitation signals found could be due to high tree density, appropriate microclimatic conditions and/or high local adaptation. However, previous September temperatures exerted a negative impact on radial growth at all sites, presumably as a result of a prolonged summer drought. By contrast, high temperatures during winter and spring boosted radial growth at most locations. Both the negative and positive effects of temperature have gained relevancy in the last decades and can determine future performance of these Mediterranean pinewoods. Besides common patterns, recorded site-specific signals in climate-growth relationships reveal the influence of different ecological conditions. In this respect, tree-growth variability increased at low elevation coupled with increasing aridity, indicating higher vulnerability to rapid climate changes at low elevations. In contrast, the lack of strong precipitation signals and positive effects of temperatures at high elevation, could buffer the impact of drought and favor the persistence of P. sylvestris and P. nigra rear edge populations.

VL  - 15

SP  - 239-246
AB  - Waste generation and management has emerged as one of the greatest challenges facing our environment in recent times. In this study, waste dumping sites in Uyo metropolis, Nigeria were selected to assess waste generation and management and their effects on outdoor air quality. Concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as CO, SO2, NO2, HCN, H2S, Cl, NH3 and suspended particulate matter (SPM), as well as heat, noise and radiation, were measured using in situ portable digital monitors. Concentrations of those pollutants varied with location, partly due to variation in the composition of waste dumped and partly due to predominant activities at each site. Results obtained from the study revealed that the concentration of NO2 was highest at SP5 (0.45 +/- 0.07), while the concentration of ammonia was highest at SP3 (13.3 +/- 0.71 ppm). Concentrations of SO2 at all the sampled locations varied between 0.15 +/- 0.07 ppm and 0.45 +/- 0.07 ppm. All the sites under study recorded high levels of CO, with a range of 13.5 +/- 0.71 to 27.0 +/- 1.41 ppm. Also, 16 of the 19 locations recorded high SO2 concentrations. These concentrations were higher than the 2007 US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO and SO2. The concentrations of HCN, Cl, H2S and SPM were far below their instruments' alarm level. Heat, radiation and noise values varied from one location to another. The concentrations of these pollutants increased as the quantity, duration and decomposition of waste materials dumped at each dump site also increased.

TI  - Competition and climate influence growth of black spruce in western boreal forests
VL  - 443
SP  - 84-94
AB  - The effects of competition and climate on the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) were examined using long term measurement data collected across the western Canadian boreal forest. Non-linear mixed effect models were developed and used to examine tree growth responses to competition and climate across the range of upland forest types where black spruce is found in this region including: spruce/fir, deciduous and pine forest types. Basal area of competitor trees larger than the subject tree, and at least one of the following climate variables: frost free period, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, were selected as predictors of diameter and height growth. Spruce/fir competition had a stronger negative effect on the growth of black spruce than pine competition. However, deciduous competition had a positive effect on diameter and height growth of black spruce. Growth was generally sensitive to changes in climate across the three forest types. Increases in temperature (except in pine forest stand) and reductions in precipitation (except in deciduous forest stand) lead to increases in diameter and height growth; however, our model also predicted that increasing temperature when pine stand densities are high will lead to a reduction in growth. These results indicated that forest types and competition will determine the impact of climate on the growth of black spruce trees. Climate sensitive growth functions developed for black spruce in this study will be useful in modeling and managing pure and mixed stands of black spruce across the western boreal forest.

TI  - Inuit metabolism revisited: what drove the selective sweep of CPT1a L479?
VL  - 129
IS  - 4
SP  - 255-271
AB  - This article reassesses historical studies of Inuit metabolism in light of recent developments in evolutionary genetics. It discusses the possible selective advantage of a variant of CPT1a, which encodes the rate limiting enzyme in hepatic fatty acid oxidation. The L479 variant of CPT1a underwent one of the strongest known selective sweeps in human history and is specific to Inuit and Yu'pik populations. Recent hypotheses predict that this variant may have been selected in response to possible detrimental effects of chronic ketosis in communities with very low carbohydrate consumption. Assessing these hypotheses alongside several alternative explanations of the selective sweep, this article challenges the notion that the selection of L479 is linked to predicted detrimental effects of ketosis. Bringing together for the first time data from biochemical, metabolic, and physiological studies inside and outside the Inuit sphere, it aims to provide a broader interpretative framework and a more comprehensive way to understand the selective sweep. It suggests that L479 may have provided a selective advantage in glucose conservation as part of a metabolic adaptation to very low carbohydrate and high protein consumption, but not necessarily a ketogenic state, in an extremely cold environment. A high intake of n-3 fatty acids may be linked to selection through the mitigation of a detrimental effect of the mutation that arises in the fasted state. The implications of these conclusions for our broader understanding of very low carbohydrate metabolism, and for dietary recommendations for Inuit and non-Inuit populations, are discussed.

TI  - SNP Detection from De Novo Transcriptome Sequencing in the Bivalve Macoma balthica: Marker Development for Evolutionary Studies
VL  - 7
IS  - 12
AB  - Hybrid zones are noteworthy systems for the study of environmental adaptation to fast-changing environments, as they constitute reservoirs of polymorphism and are key to the maintenance of biodiversity. They can move in relation to climate fluctuations, as temperature can affect both selection and migration, or remain trapped by environmental and physical barriers. There is therefore a very strong incentive to study the dynamics of hybrid zones subjected to climate variations. The infaunal bivalve Macoma balthica emerges as a noteworthy model species, as divergent lineages hybridize, and its native NE Atlantic range is currently contracting to the North. To investigate the dynamics and functioning of hybrid zones in M. balthica, we developed new molecular markers by sequencing the collective transcriptome of 30 individuals. Ten individuals were pooled for each of the three populations sampled at the margins of two hybrid zones. A single 454 run generated 277 Mb from which 17K SNPs were detected. SNP density averaged 1 polymorphic site every 14 to 19 bases, for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, respectively. An FST scan detected high genetic divergence among several hundred SNPs, some of them involved in energetic metabolism, cellular respiration and physiological stress. The high population differentiation, recorded for nuclear-encoded ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase as well as most mitochondrial loci, suggests cytonuclear genetic incompatibilities. Results from this study will help pave the way to a high-resolution study of hybrid zone dynamics in M. balthica, and the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous barriers to gene flow in this system.

TI  - Impact of rainfall on Aedes aegypti populations
VL  - 385
SP  - 96-105
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of multiple diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Due to modifications in weather patterns, its geographical range is continuously evolving. Temperature is a key factor for its expansion into regions with cool winters, but rainfall can also have a strong impact on the colonization of these regions, since larvae emerging after a rainfall are likely to die at temperatures below 10 degrees C. As climate change is expected to affect rainfall regimes, with a higher frequency of heavy storms and an increase in drought-affected areas, it is important to understand how different rainfall scenarios may shape Ae. aegypti's range. We develop a model for the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti, coupled with a rainfall model to study the effect of the temporal distribution of rainfall on mosquito abundance. Using a fracturing process, we then investigate the effect of a higher variability in the daily rainfall. As an example, we show that rainfall distribution is necessary to explain the geographic range of Ae. aegypti in Taiwan, an island characterized by rainy winters in the north and dry winters in the south. We also predict that a higher variability in the rainfall time distribution will decrease the maximum abundance of Ae. aegypti during the summer. An increase in daily rainfall variability will likewise enhance its extinction probability. Finally, we obtain a nonlinear relationship between dry season duration and extinction probability. These findings can have a significant impact on our ability to predict disease outbreaks.

TI  - Habitat Selection and Movement Patterns of Spotted Turtles (Clemmys guttata): Effects of Spatial and Temporal Scales of Analyses
IS  - 1
SP  - 86-96
AB  - Habitat selection Is Important for a species' survival, and Its identification represents a crucial component in the development of conservation strategies. Habitat selection occurs when habitats are used disproportionately to their availability, and what constitutes available habitat will depend on the biology of the species under Investigation. Habitat selection and movement patterns of Spotted Turtles (Clemmys guttata) in a population near Lake Huron, Ontario, were studied over two consecutive years using radio telemetry. Selection was assessed at two spatial scales (second order, home range from population range; and third order, locations from home range) using compositional analyses. Spotted Turtles shift macrohabitat use throughout the annual cycle, therefore seasonal habitat selection was also analyzed. Selection occurred at both scales tested, and the ranking of preferred habitats differed based on the scale of analysis. Selection differed across seasons (emergence, nesting, post-nesting), but was similar between the sexes. Despite seasonal shifts In macrohabitat selection, microhabitat used did not differ seasonally, but females were more likely to choose locations with cover in the late summer compared to males. Individuals selected overwintering sites that afforded structural protection and a temperature near 0 degrees C. Movements were similar between the sexes, with a reduction In activity In July and August. The seasonal variability In habitat selection supports the need for surveys at multiple time-points within the year to fully document the critical habitat requirements of Spotted Turtles.

TI  - The grouping, merging and survival of subhaloes in the simulated Local Group
VL  - 402
IS  - 3
SP  - 1899-1910
AB  - We use a simulation performed within the Constrained Local Universe Simulation (CLUES) project to study a realistic Local Group (LG)-like object. We employ this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of the population of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may have on the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. We focus on the processes of tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and grouping before infall. The tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition between the phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occurs at the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape of their mass function with redshift. Although the satellites often form groups, they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. The infall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiar distribution of the LG satellites, but only if it occurred recently. Mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an early stage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 Gyr ago, when they are still outside the host haloes. Such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distant early-type Milky Way companions. Once the subhaloes enter the host halo the mergers become very rare.

TI  - Aptamer-Functionalized Drug Nanocarrier Improves Hepatocellular Carcinoma toward Normal by Targeting Neoplastic Hepatocytes
VL  - 20
SP  - 34-49
AB  - Site-specific delivery of chemotherapeutics specifically to neoplastic hepatocytes without affecting normal hepatocytes should be a focus for potential therapeutic management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aptamer TLS 9a with phosphorothioate backbone modifications (L5) has not been explored so far for preferential delivery of therapeutics in neoplastic hepatocytes to induce apoptosis. Thus, the objective of the present investigation was to compare the therapeutic potential of L5-functionalized drug nanocarrier (PTX-NPL5) with those of the other experimental drug nanocarriers functionalized by previously reported HCC cell-targeting aptamers and non-aptamer ligands, such as galactosamine and apotransferrin. A myriad of well-defined investigations such as cell cycle analysis, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) assay, and studies related to apoptosis, histopathology, and immunoblotting substantiated that PTX-NPL5 had the highest potency among the different ligand-attached experimental formulations in inducing selective apoptosis in neoplastic hepatocytes via a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. PTXNPL5 did not produce any notable toxic effects in healthy hepatocytes, thus unveiling a new and a safer option in targeted therapy for HCC. Molecular modeling study identified two cell-surface biomarker proteins (tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 [TAG-72] and heat shock protein 70 [HSP70]) responsible for ligand-receptor interaction of L5 and preferential internalization of PTX-NPL5 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neoplastic hepatocytes. The potential of PTX-NPL5 has provided enough impetus for its rapid translation from the pre-clinical to clinical domain to establish itself as a targeted therapeutic to significantly prolong survival in HCC.

TI  - Functional evolution of vertebrate sensory receptors
VL  - 124
AB  - Sensory receptors enable animals to perceive their external world, and functional properties of receptors evolve to detect the specific cues relevant for an organism's survival. Changes in sensory receptor function or tuning can directly impact an organism's behavior. Functional tests of receptors from multiple species and the generation of chimeric receptors between orthologs with different properties allow for the dissection of the molecular basis of receptor function and identification of the key residues that impart functional changes in different species. Knowledge of these functionally important sites facilitates investigation into questions regarding the role of epistasis and the extent of convergence, as well as the timing of sensory shifts relative to other phenotypic changes. However, as receptors can also play roles in non-sensory tissues, and receptor responses can be modulated by numerous other factors including varying expression levels, alternative splicing, and morphological features of the sensory cell, behavioral validation can be instrumental in confirming that responses observed in heterologous systems play a sensory role. Expression profiling of sensory cells and comparative genomics approaches can shed light on cell-type specific modifications and identify other proteins that may affect receptor function and can provide insight into the correlated evolution of complex suites of traits. Here we review the evolutionary history and diversity of functional responses of the major classes of sensory receptors in vertebrates, including opsins, chemosensory receptors, and ion channels involved in temperature-sensing, mechanosensation and electroreception.

TI  - Arclogites in the Subarc Lower Crust: Effects of Crystallization, Partial Melting, and Retained Melt on the Foundering Ability of Residual Roots
VL  - 62
IS  - 12
AB  - Thick-crusted (>45 km) Cordilleran arcs exhibit cyclic processes including periods of magmatic quiescence interspersed with pulses of high-flux magmatism. Most models assume that during high-flux events, fractional crystallization and partial melting within the deep crustal hot zone generate a dense (>3.4 g/cm(3)) arclogitic subarc root that can readily founder into the mantle. Yet these models do not consider that: (1) the retention of low-density melt within the subarc root, and (2) the protolith lithology of the restitic portion of the subarc root may greatly impact the density evolution of the root and its susceptibility to foundering. In this article, we first address the effect of retained melt on the foundering ability of the subarc root by calculating the density and time for foundering of melt-bearing arclogitic residue at 1.5, 2, and 2.5 GPa. We find that melt volumes >10-18% are required to stabilize the root within the lower crust; melt volumes below this threshold lower the viscosity of the residue so much so as to decrease the time for foundering by an order of magnitude. We then constrain through phase equilibria modeling the effect of partial melting of different lower crustal protoliths on the density of the restitic subarc root. To do this, we model the density and mineralogical evolution of restites in equilibrium with their derivative melts during open-system, isobaric partial melting of typical crustal assemblages from 600-1100 degrees C at 1.5 (similar to 50 km) and 2 GPa (similar to 65 km). In our models, typical end-member assemblages in a lower crustal hot zone include basalt, metapelite, and metagraywacke. We find that melt-depleted restites derived from basaltic compositions are amphibole-bearing arclogites with densities conducive to foundering, which at 2 GPa can occur even in the presence of the coexisting hydrous felsic residual melt. Foundering of the amphibole +/- melt-bearing root may refertilize the mantle wedge and induce melting of the surrounding asthenosphere as well as the arclogitic mass. However, if temperatures in a 50-km deep subarc hot zone are not sufficient to drive melt depletion of basaltic restites, these dense (3.1-3.3 g/cm(3)) residues are gravitationally stable, increasing the density of the lower crust and lowering the elevation of the arc. In comparison, partial melting of metasedimentary country rock produces alkali feldspar-rich residues that never achieve densities conducive to foundering. Thus, if high-flux events are driven by the influx of melt-fertile lithosphere beneath the arc as envisioned by the Cordilleran cycle model, then partial melting of the metasedimentary portion will generate low-density residues that remain in the lower crust and contribute to the thickness, geochemistry, and seismic structure of the bulk arc.

TI  - Changes in Amino Acid Metabolism of Staphylococcus aureus following Growth to the Stationary Phase under Adjusted Growth Conditions
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
AB  - The sharp increase in infections due to Staphylococcus aureus is associated with its ability to adapt to changes in its habitat. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the cytoplasmic amino acid profiles of a clinical strain of S. aureus under five combinations of stress-induced conditions representative of a wound site by varying temperature 35-37 degrees C, adding 0-5% NaCl and adjusting pH 6-8. The results indicated that aspartic acid, lysine, glutamic acid and histidine were the most abundant cytoplasmic amino acids in the control samples grown under optimal growth conditions. However, the magnitudes and levels of these amino acids were altered under the various wound site conditions, which led to differential cytoplasmic amino acid profiles as characterized by multivariate analyses (PLS-DA). The total cytoplasmic amino acid content was significantly reduced in the cells grown with 2.5% NaCl added at pH 7 and 37 degrees C relative to the control samples and other growth regimes. However, all combinations of enhanced stress conditions showed unique and characteristic changes in the concentration profiles of the cytoplasmic amino acids. These outcomes supported the hypothesis that bacterial cells of S. aureus maintain different metabolic homeostasis under various stress-induced conditions. The potent capability of S. aureus to constantly and rapidly acclimatize to variations within the environment may reflect the crucial feature supporting its virulence as an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium to invade the wound site. Understanding the control systems governing these marked changes in amino acids during the adaptation to the potential wound site conditions of this dangerous bacterium may offer new clinical controls to combat infection.

VL  - 39
IS  - 2
SP  - 94-104
AB  - Background: Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is an important medicinal herbs in Asia. However, ginseng varieties are less developed. Method: To developed ginseng varieties, a pure line selection method was applied in this study. Results: Gumpoong was testing of 4-yr-old specimens in 2002, the proportions of the below-ground roots that were rusty colored for Gumpoong was 1.29 in Daejeon and 1.45 in Eumseong, whereas the proportions for its yellow berry variant were 2.60 and 2.45 in the two regions, respectively. Thus the Gumpoong was resistant to root rust. Sunpoong has a high yielding property. Its average root weight is 70.6 g for 6-yr-old roots. Its yield is 2.9 kg/1.62m(2) and the rate of heaven- and earth-grade product is 20.9%, which is very high compared to 9.4% for Yunpoong. Sunone is resistance to root rot and the survival rate of 4-yr-old roots was 44.4% in 1997, whereas that of the violet-stem variant landrace was 21.7%. Sunhyang has content of arginyl-fructosyl-glucose (AFG), which produces the unique scent of red ginseng, is 95.1 mu mol/g and greater than the 30.8 mu mol/g of Chunpoong in 6-yr-old plants. Sunun and Cheongsun are being nurtured to protect genetic resources. Conclusion: Developed ginsneg varieties will be used as the basis for the protection of genetic resources and breeding.

TI  - The influence of STAT5 antisense oligonucleotides on the proliferation and apoptosis of selected human leukaemic cell lines
VL  - 36
IS  - 5
SP  - 265-278
AB  - The signal transducers and activators of transcription - STAT5A and STAT5B - take part in the regulation of many essential physiopathological processes. They influence the cell cycle, apoptosis and the proliferation of different types of cell lines. The STAT5 proteins are induced in response to multiple haematopoietic cytokines. Because they are constitutively active in certain haemato-oncologic diseases, it is also suggested that they play an important role in leukaemogenesis. However, function of these proteins in haematopoietic cell transformation and proliferation is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of perturbation of STAT5 expression [using oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) against STAT5 mRNA], on the clonogenicity and survival of selected human leukaemic cell lines, HEL, HL-60, K562, TF-1. We analysed the effect of ODN pre-treatment on the cell clonogenicity in methylcellulose cultures according to the time and the temperature of exposure. Moreover, we attempted to estimate apoptosis induced in examined cells, by flow cytometry using combined Annexin V-PI staining and the TUNEL method. We also applied the RT-PCR method to analyse Bax and Bcl-x(L) gene expression. We found that the perturbation of STAT5 expression with antisense oligonucleotides caused a decrease in the proliferative potential of human K562 and TF-1 cell lines. Also, we observed higher induction of apoptotic cell death in the K562 and TF-1 cells incubated with the antisense STAT5A ODNs. We did not notice any impact of ODNs on the HL-60 and HEL cells. Our studies using STAT5 antisense oligonucleotides showed that these proteins may be critical in the regulation of growth and apoptosis of some types of leukaemic blasts.

VL  - 46
IS  - 4
SP  - 4245-4257
AB  - Sulfide and hypoxia threaten marine organisms in various ways. Anadara broughtonii, a commercial marine bivalve in China which has great potential exposure to sulfide and hypoxia, was selected to test the responses to these stresses. Digital gene expression profile (DGE) analysis was performed on the juveniles' gills after exposed to normal condition (CG group), hypoxia (LO group), and low/high concentration of sulfide (LS/HS group, administered in hypoxia), respectively, using RNA-seq technology. A total of over 30 million clean reads were filtered from each DGE library and over 90% of them were annotated successfully. In total, 774 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected and assigned to Gene ontology (GO) classification and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis. The results show that many of the upregulated DEGs are related to hemoglobin, immunology, and stress responding. In the stressed A. broughtonii, cytochrome P450 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase may stimulate the glycolysis process to reduce oxygen consumption; Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, heat shock protein and protein disulfide isomerase probably help to maintain the genome integrity; Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 2/3, mitogen-activated protein kinase and tumor necrosis factor pathways were probably responsible for protein repair, proteolysis, apoptosis and immune responses to high concentration of sulfide. Combined challenges also induced alternative oxidase and sushi repeat-containing protein, which have indistinct but probably indispensable function in invertebrates. For the first time, comprehensive transcriptome information on A. broughtonii in response to sulfide and hypoxia were provided. Our research offers new insights into the molecular mechanism behind the resistance of shellfish to sulfide and hypoxia.

TI  - Tardigrade indexing approach on exoplanets
VL  - 19
SP  - 13-16
AB  - Finding life on other worlds is a fascinating area of astrobiology and planetary sciences. Presently, over 3800 exoplanets, representing a very wide range of physical and chemical environments, are known. Scientists are not only looking for traces of life outside Earth, but they are also trying to find out which of Earths known organisms (ex: tardigrades (water bears)) would be able to survive on other planets. In our study, we have established a metric tool for distinguishing the potential survivability of active and cryptobiotic tardigrades on rocky-water and water-gas planets in our solar system and exoplanets, taking into consideration the geometrical means of six physical parameters such as radius, density, escape velocity, revolution period, surface temperature, and surface pressure of the considered planets. More than 3800 exoplanets are available as the main sample from Planetary Habitable Laboratory - Exoplanet Catalog (PHL-EC), from which we have chosen 57 exoplanets in our study including Earth and Mars, with water composition as reference. The Active Tardigrade Index (ATI) and Cryptobiotic Tardigrade Index (CTI) are two metric indices with minimum value 0 (= tardigrades cannot survive) and maximum 1 (= tardigrades will survive in their respective state). Values between 0 and 1 indicate a percentage chance of the active or cryptobiotic tardigrades surviving on a given exoplanet. Among known planets some of the exoplanets are tabulated as ATI and CTI indices for sample representation like: Kepler-100d, Kepler-48d, Kepler-289b, TRAPPIST-1 f and Kepler-106e. The results with Mars as the threshold indicates that Mars could be the only rock-water composition planet that could be more suitable for tardigrades than other considered exoplanets.

TI  - The Miocene Gangdese porphyry copper belt generated during post-collisional extension in the Tibetan Orogen
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-51
AB  - The mid-Miocene Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet contains porphyry Cu deposits that developed after the Indian-Asian continental collision in the early Cenozoic. Field work confirms that these porphyry Cu deposits are temporally and spatially associated with mid-Miocene monzogranitic and quartz monzonitic stocks, which intruded Mesozoic-Cenozoic Gangdese granitoid batholiths and surrounding Triassic-Tertiary volcano-sedimentary sequences in the Lhasa Terrane, and formed a 50-km wide, 400-km long E-W belt. Magmatism occurred during the interval 11.2 to 19.7 Ma, peaking at similar to 16 Ma for the porphyry stocks; this is consistent with the age (10 to 18 Ma) of the east-west extension and subsequent NS-striking normal fault systems (>= 13.5 Ma) in the Tibetan Orogen. The stocks typically occur as multiple small diameter intrusions (<5 km), and have shallow emplacement depths (similar to 1 to 3 km). The Cu porphyries are shoshonitic and high-K calc-alkaline, showing geochemical affinities with adakites. The porphyries were derived from a thickened basaltic lower-crust source, rather than from the subducted oceanic-slab. Geochemical and geophysical data indicate that during the Paleocene-Oligocene mantle-derived mafic magmas created a newly-formed basaltic underplate at the bottom of the lower-crust, which undewent garnet amphibolite metamorphism under high pressure (>50 km). Breakdown of hornblende in the juvenile lower-crust source during melting is regarded as fundamental for the formation of the fertile adakite and porphyry Cu systems in south Tibet. The Gangdese belt contains four large, and three intermediate- and small-sized porphyry Cu-Mo deposits, and shows a continuous spectrum from typical porphyry-type Cu-Mo to skarn-type Zn-Pb mineralization. Twenty-three samples collected from four deposits yielded a limited range of molybdenite Re-Os isochron ages from 15.2 to 16.0 Ma, similar to previously-reported Re-Os ages (13.8 to 14.9 Ma) for other porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in the belt, suggesting that Cu-Mo mineralization in the belt occurred in a post-collisional extension environment. The characteristics of porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in the collisional zone are similar in many aspects to those in arc settings, i.e., mineralization style, alteration zoning, and metal association. Preliminary fluid inclusion studies indicate that the early hydrothermal fluids are preserved as high temperature (>= 450 degrees C), high salinity (40 to 47 wt.% NaCl equiv.) and high pressure (>= 1100 to 1500 bar) fluid inclusions. These fluids are interpreted to represent an orthomagmatic fluid that boiled episodically due to fluid overpressuring and hydrofracturing, resulting in potassic alteration and precipitation of chalcopyrite-molybdenite assemblages. On the basis of comparison with porphyry Cu deposits in arc settings, we proposed that melting of thickened, newly-formed basaltic crust resulted in generation of Cu-bearing magmatic systems in the Tibetan collision zone, and both orogen-transverse normal faults and orogen-parallel thrust zones during the Miocene post-collisional extension constrain the temporal and spatial localization of the porphyry Cu systems in the collision zone.

TI  - Crowd-Based Learning of Spatial Fields for the Internet of Things From harvesting of data to inference
VL  - 35
IS  - 5
SP  - 130-139
AB  - The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example, knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve cognitive radio systems [1], [2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios [3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area [4], [5]. A common way to sense environmental variables is the deployment of dedicated wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which continues to stimulate fertile research activities in the scientific community. Typical WSN applications are oriented to sense specific physical quantities (e.g., temperature) in well-defined areas [6], [7]. Unfortunately WSNs are generally characterized by significant constraints in terms of deployment cost, energy limitation, and the need for maintenance. These constraints prevent them from becoming scalable and therefore from being the ultimate solution for automated and distributed sensing of the physical world. The expected pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (fixed and mobile) opens up a unique opportunity for a wide and massive sensing and mapping (i.e., georeferencing of physical quantities). In fact, the IoT constitutes a paradigm where a multitude of heterogeneous devices is able to sense the environment, process data, and actuate, thus creating the necessary infrastructure for cyberphysical systems. This infrastructure galvanizes technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent transportation [8], [9]. From the extensive variety of applications of the IoT, we are interested in those that will benefit from having a spatial coverage of a wide area due to a large number of agents navigating through it. For instance, this can be the case when devices are carried by people or autonomous agents (e.g., vehicles, robots, or drones) moving in outdoor-and indoor-populated environments like malls, stadiums, or crowded buildings. One can even imagine cities at large, if one considers much larger settings in size. Thanks to the widespread diffusion of IoT devices with heterogeneous sensors, the estimation of spatial physical fields is creating a new trend for next-generation sensor networks, referred to as mobile crowdsensing networks [10]-[13]. This is basically a zero-effort approach to automatically collect and process data. Recently, as an example, this concept has been proposed for zero-effort automatic mapping of environmental features using sensors already embedded in smartphones, such as magnetometers and Wi-Fi [14]-[17]. In such settings, the contribution of the agent to the sensing process is as simple as carrying the personal device in a pocket while the individual is moving around. Individuals are not even requested to be participatory, as the sensing process could run in the background during the normal operation of the device. In other words, agents are aware of the background sensing process, but they are not participatory in the sense that they are not requested to follow particular paths to make the learning process more effective. Thus, the sensing process is not an exclusive task, and it arises from the dynamic reality of humans or autonomous agents. The sensing process is a result of piggybacking on the capabilities of today's and future wireless personal devices. Including data generated by these devices will dramatically increase the amount of data for sensing and mapping purposes, with obvious benefits in terms of the resulting accuracy. In this context, the IoT is the technological enabler for crowdsensing and learning of spatial fields. Interestingly, IoT devices are, in general, able to communicate among themselves, either directly or through a fusion node that can potentially be in the cloud. Thanks to communication capabilities, empirical data gathered by mobile agents (the crowd) can be collected and processed by learning algorithms located in the cloud. These algorithms exploit the correspondence between the position and the value of the physical quantity measured in that position to estimate the spatial field. As a consequence, positioning and spatial field estimation are intimately intertwined, as will be illustrated in the "Sensing and Positioning" section. Crowdsourcing-based learning methods rely on the experience gained by previous agents. In principle, it is possible that, with crowd-based learning, one can perform optimal information fusion [10]. On the other hand, moving from the well-controlled conditions of WSN scenarios, where nodes are deployed in ad hoc known locations, to crowdsensing settings, where agents move around in an uncontrolled manner, entails a number of issues that need to be addressed. The methods rely on sharing through cloud mechanisms [18], but they can be of practical relevance in IoT applications only if their computational and memory requirements do not grow with the amount of collected data. Therefore, novel methodologies for multisensor data fusion and information processing are needed. They should guarantee efficient statistical representation of spatial fields and a computational complexity that does not depend on the number of measurements. Further, the algorithms need to be robust against irregular positioning and measurement errors.

TI  - Mitochondrial physiology and responses to elevated hydrogen sulphide in two isogenic lineages of an amphibious mangrove fish
VL  - 224
IS  - 8
AB  - Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is toxic and can act as a selective pressure on aquatic organisms, facilitating a wide range of adaptations for life in sulphidic environments. Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) inhabit mangrove swamps and have developed high tolerance to environmental H2S. They are hermaphroditic and can self-fertilize, producing distinct isogenic lineages with different sensitivity to H2S. Here, we tested the hypothesis that observed differences in responses to H2S are the result of differences in mitochondria! functions. For this purpose, we performed two experimental series, testing (1) the overall mitochondrial oxidizing capacities and (2) the kinetics of apparent H2S mitochondrial oxidation and inhibition in two distinct lineages of mangrove rivulus, originally collected from Belize and Honduras. We used permeabilized livers from both lineages, measured mitochondrial oxidation, and monitored changes during gradual increases of sulphide. Ultimately, we determined that each lineage has a distinct strategy for coping with elevated H2S, indicating divergences in mitochondrial function and metabolism. The Honduras lineage has higher anaerobic capacity substantiated by higher lactate dehydrogenase activity and higher apparent H2S oxidation rates, likely enabling them to tolerate H2S by escaping aquatic H2S in a terrestrial environment. However, Belize fish have increased cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activities as well as increased succinate contribution to mitochondrial respiration, allowing them to tolerate higher levels of aquatic H2S without inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Our study reveals distinct physiological strategies in genetic lineages of a single species, indicating possible genetic and/or functional adaptations to sulphidic environments at the mitochondrial level.

TI  - Transcriptome-wide patterns of divergence during allopatric evolution
VL  - 25
IS  - 7
SP  - 1478-1493
AB  - Recent studies have revealed repeated patterns of genomic divergence associated with species formation. Such patterns suggest that natural selection tends to target a set of available genes, but is also indicative that closely related taxa share evolutionary constraints that limit genetic variability. Studying patterns of genomic divergence among populations within the same species may shed light on the underlying evolutionary processes. Here, we examine transcriptome-wide divergence and polymorphism in the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus, a species where allopatric evolution has led to replicate sets of populations with varying degrees of divergence and hybrid incompatibility. Our analyses suggest that relatively small effective population sizes have resulted in an exponential decline of shared polymorphisms during population divergence and also facilitated the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations within allopatric populations. Five interpopulation comparisons at three different stages of divergence show that nonsynonymous mutations tend to accumulate in a specific set of proteins. These include proteins with central roles in cellular metabolism, such as those encoded in mtDNA, but also include an additional set of proteins that repeatedly show signatures of positive selection during allopatric divergence. Although our results are consistent with a contribution of nonadaptive processes, such as genetic drift and gene expression levels, generating repeatable patterns of genomic divergence in closely related taxa, they also indicate that adaptive evolution targeting a specific set of genes contributes to this pattern. Our results yield insights into the predictability of evolution at the gene level. See also the Perspective by Renaut and Dion-Cote

TI  - Detection of lysozyme in body fluid based on two-dimensional colloidal sensor
VL  - 157
AB  - It is significant to detect lysozyme both in fundamental research and in clinical practice, since its concentration in body fluid is associated with many diseases. In this study, a new kind of sensor for rapid screening the lysozyme was fabricated based on the two-dimensional (2D) polystyrene colloidal crystal array together with the optimized hydrogel containing acrylamide-based functional groups. Distinct hydrogel volume shrink was observed due to the hydrogel crosslink induced by the functional ligand-protein interactions while the protein bound to the sensor. Therefore, the analyte concentration could be accessed by of the lattice spacing of the 2D colloidal crystal array, which was detected by a change in the Debye diffraction ring diameter. The lysozyme concentration could be easily monitored by measuring the diameter of the Debye diffraction ring in the pathophysiologic range. The particle spacing of 2D colloidal crystal hydrogel sensor increased to about 22 nm while lysozyme concentration increased from zero to 1.0 mg/mL, meanwhile the structural color of the sensor blue shifted from red to yellow. The detection limit was confirmed as 1.38 x 10(-3) mg/mL. The selective response to other common proteins in body fluids was also exhibited, indicating the great selective response properties to lysozyme. In addition, the 2D colloidal crystal hydrogel sensor was reusable to detect the lysozyme solution reversibly due to its thermal sensitivity. Moreover, the determination of lysozyme in artificial tears and human urine samples by this sensor demonstrated its feasibility in potential clinical analysis diagnosis.

TI  - CO2 hydrogenation to methanol and hydrocarbons over bifunctional Zn-doped ZrO2/zeolite catalysts
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 1249-1268
AB  - The tandem process of carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol and its conversion to hydrocarbons over mixed metal/metal oxide-zeotype catalysts is a promising path to CO2 valorization. Herein, we report three Zn-doped ZrO2 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation of Zn- and Zr-containing salts to obtain three different loadings of Zn (5, 15 and 30 wt%). In the context of bifunctional catalysts, we combined ZrZnOX with two of the most performing zeolite/zeotype catalysts for the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction: H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34. Catalytic testing at 250-350 degrees C and 20-40 bar revealed that H-ZSM-5 is more stable and more capable of converting methanol at low temperature, whereas H-SAPO-34 shows the highest C3 selectivity. The best performance was observed for the ZrZnOX sample with 30% Zn, combined with ZSM-5 at 350 degrees C, 30 bar and H-2/CO2/N-2 = 6/2/1. Under these conditions, the equilibrium methanol yield was observed after 0.4 s g(-1) ml(-1) over ZrZnOX alone. Mixing with ZSM-5 in a 1 : 1 weight ratio, methanol was rapidly converted to hydrocarbons, with an optimum C-3 productivity of 1.5 mol kg-1 h(-1) at 24000 ml h(-1) g(-1). An extensive surficial, textural and structural characterization of ZrZnOX alone was carried out by FT-IR spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature, PXRD and XAS. Formation of a ZrZnOX tetragonal solid solution was confirmed for all the samples (PXRD, XAS). The amount of Zr4+ sites at the surface was found to decrease, while the number of oxygen vacancies increased after H-2 treatment at 400 degrees C, coherent with an increase of Zn loading (FT-IR). DFT modelling pointed out that once a stoichiometric oxygen vacancy is induced by the presence of Zn, the formation of extra oxygen vacancies during activation is thermodynamically favored. Moreover, i) the oxygen vacancies were found to play an active role in CO2 hydrogenation, in accordance with experimental data, and ii) methanol is most likely formed via the formate pathway, and is energetically favored compared to CO formation, in agreement with the high methanol selectivity observed experimentally at low CO2 conversion. Importantly, operando-XAS, XPS, TEM and PXRD studies of the as-prepared, pretreated and tested catalysts showed that the structure and composition of the catalyst is not affected by the reaction. Indeed, a final catalytic test carried out on the regenerated ZrZnOX/H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed that the initial performances were completely restored and no Zn exchange in the zeolite was observed neither before nor after testing.

TI  - Tectonic configuration of the Apuseni-Banat-Timok-Srednogorie belt, Balkans-South Carpathians, constrained by high precision RE-Os molybdenite ages
VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-21
AB  - The Apuseni-Banat-Timok-Srednogorie magmatic-metallogenic belt (ABTS belt), forms a substantial metallogenic province in the Balkan-South Carpathian system in southeastern Europe. The belt hosts porphyry, skarn, and epithermal deposits mined since pre-Roman times. Generally, the deposits, prospects, and occurrences within the belt are linked to magmatic centers of calc-alkaline affinity. Fifty-one rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) ages and Re concentration data for molybdenites define systematic geochronologic trends and constrain the geochemical-metallogenic evolution of the belt in space and time. From these data and additional existing geologic-geochemical data, a general tectonic history for the belt is proposed. Mineralization ages in Apuseni-Banat, Timok, and Panagyurishte (the central district of the larger E-W Srednogorie Zone) range from 72-83, 81-88, and 87-92 Ma, respectively, and clearly document increasing age from the northwestern districts to the southeastern districts. Further, Re-Os ages suggest rapidly migrating pulses of Late Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal activity with construction of deposits in similar to 1 m.y., districts in similar to 10 m.y., and the entire 1,500 km belt in similar to 20 m.y. Ages in both Timok and Panagyurishte show systematic younging, while deposit ages in Banat and Apuseni are less systematic reflecting a restricted evolution of the tectonic system. Systematic differences are also observed for molybdenite Re concentrations on the belt scale. Re concentrations generally range from hundreds to thousands of parts per million, typical of subduction-related Cu-Au-Mo-(PGE) porphyry systems associated with the generation of juvenile crust. The geochronologic and geochemical trends are compatible with proposed steepening of subducting oceanic slab and relaxation of upper continental plate compression. Resulting influx of sub-continental mantle lithosphere (SCML) and asthenosphere provide a fertile metal source and heat, while the subducting slab contributes connate and mineral dehydration fluids, which facilitate partial melting and metal leaching of SCML and asthenosphere. Cu-Au-Mo-(PGE) porphyry deposits may develop where melts are trapped at shallow crustal levels, often with associated volcanism and epithermal-style deposits (South Banat, Timok, and Panagyurishte). Mo-Fe-Pb-Zn skarn deposits may develop where felsic melts are trapped adjacent to Mesozoic limestones at moderate crustal levels (North Banat and Apuseni). Systematic spatial variations in deposit style, commodity enrichment, Re-Os ages, and Re concentrations support specific tectonic processes that led to ore formation. In a post-collisional setting, subduction of Vardar oceanic crust may have stalled, causing slab steepening and rollback. The slab rollback relaxes compression, facilitating and enhancing orogenic collapse of previously thickened Balkan-South Carpathian crust. The progression of coupled rollback-orogenic collapse is evidenced by the width of Late Cretaceous extensional basins and northward younging of Re-Os ages, from Panagyurishte (similar to 60 km; 92-87 Ma) to Timok (similar to 20 km; 88-81 Ma) to Apuseni-Banat (similar to 5 km; 83-72 Ma). Generation of a well-endowed mineral belt, such as the ABTS, requires a temporally and spatially restricted window of magmatic-hydrothermal activity. This window is quickly opened as upper plate compression relaxes, thereby inducing melt generation and ingress of melt to higher crustal levels. The window is just as quickly closed as upper plate compression is reinstated. The transient tectonic state responsible for economc mineralization in the ABTS belt may be a paleo-analogue to transient intervals in the present subduction tectonics of SE Asia where much mineral wealth has been created in the last few million years.

TI  - Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events prolonged by phosphorus cycle feedbacks
VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 757-782
AB  - Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) document major perturbations of the global carbon cycle with repercussions for the Earth's climate and ocean circulation that are relevant to understanding future climate trends. Here, we compare the onset and development of Cretaceous OAE1a and OAE2 in two drill cores with unusually high sedimentation rates from the Vocontian Basin (southern France) and Tarfaya Basin (southern Morocco). OAE1a and OAE2 exhibit remarkable similarities in the evolution of their carbon isotope (delta C-13) records, with long-lasting negative excursions preceding the onset of the main positive excursions, supporting the view that both OAEs were triggered by massive emissions of volcanic CO2 into the atmosphere. However, there are substantial differences, notably in the durations of individual phases within the delta C-13 positive excursions of both OAEs. Based on analysis of cyclic sediment variations, we estimate the duration of individual phases within OAE1a and OAE2. We identify (1) a precursor phase (negative excursion) lasting similar to 430 kyr for OAE1a and similar to 130 kyr for OAE2, (2) an onset phase of similar to 390 and similar to 70 kyr, (3) a peak phase of similar to 600 and similar to 90 kyr, (4) a plateau phase of similar to 1340 and similar to 200 kyr, and (5) a recovery phase of similar to 380 and similar to 440 kyr. The total duration of the positive delta C-13 excursion is estimated at 2700 kyr for OAE1a and 790 kyr for OAE2, and that of the main carbon accumulation phase is estimated at 980 and 180 kyr. The long-lasting peak, plateau and recovery phases imply fundamental changes in global nutrient cycles either (1) by submarine basalt-seawater interactions, (2) through excess nutrient inputs to the oceans by increasing continental weathering and river discharge, or (3) through nutrient recycling from the marine sediment reservoir. We investigated the role of phosphorus in the development of carbon accumulation by analysing phosphorus speciation across OAE2 and the mid-Cenomanian Event (MCE) in the Tarfaya Basin. The ratios of organic carbon and total nitrogen to reactive phosphorus (C-org/P-react and N-total/P-react) prior to OAE2 and the MCE hover close to or below the Redfield ratio characteristic of marine organic matter. Decreases in reactive phosphorus resulting in C-org/P-react and N-total/P-react above the Redfield ratio during the later phase of OAE2 and the MCE indicate leakage from the sedimentary column into the water column under the influence of intensified and expanded oxygen minimum zones. These results suggest that a positive feedback loop, rooted in the benthic phosphorus cycle, contributed to increased marine productivity and carbon burial over an extended period of time during OAEs.

TI  - Endemic shrubs in temperate arid and semiarid regions of northern China and their potentials for rangeland restoration
VL  - 7
AB  - Some endemic shrubs in arid and semiarid ecosystems are in danger of extinction, and yet they can play useful roles in maintaining or restoring these ecosystems, thus practical efforts are needed to conserve them. The shrubs Amygdalus pedunculata Pall., Amygdalus mongolica (Maxim.) Ricker and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus (Maxim. ex Kom.) Cheng f. are endemic species in arid and semiarid regions of northern China, where rangeland desertification is pronounced due to chronic overgrazing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these endemic shrubs have developed adaptations to arid and semiarid environments and could play critical roles as nurse species to initiate the process of rangeland recovery. Based on careful vegetation surveys, we analysed the niches of these species in relation to precipitation, temperature and habitats. All sampling plots were categorized by these endemics and sorted by the non-metric multidimensional scaling method. Species ratios of each life form and species co-occurrence rates with the endemics were also evaluated. Annual average temperature and annual precipitation were found to be the key factors determining vegetation diversity and distributions. Amygdalus pedunculata prefers low hills and sandy land in temperate semiarid regions. Amygdalus mongolica prefers gravel deserts of temperate semiarid regions. Ammopiptanthus mongolicus prefers sandy land of temperate arid regions. Communities of A. pedunculata have the highest diversity and the largest ratios of long-lived grass species, whereas those of A. mongolicus have the lowest diversity but the largest ratios of shrub species. Communities of A. mongolica are a transition between the first two community types. These findings demonstrate that our focal endemic shrubs have evolved adaptations to arid and semiarid conditions, thus they can be nurse plants to stabilize sand ground for vegetation restoration. We suggest that land managers begin using these shrub species to restore degraded rangelands as part of a general conservation effort.

TI  - Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus on food contact surfaces: Relationship with temperature and cell surface hydrophobicity
VL  - 50
SP  - 930-936
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathogenic bacterium capable of developing biofilms on food processing surfaces, a pathway leading to cross contamination of foods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of S. aureus to form biofilm on food processing surfaces (polystyrene and stainless steel) with regard to different temperatures (12 and 37 degrees C) and cellular hydrophobicity. Biofilm assays were performed on n. 67 S. aureus isolates from food, food processing environments and food handlers and n. 3 reference strains (S. aureus ATCC 35556,S. aureus ATCC 12600 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228). A strain-specific variation in biofilm formation within S. aureus strains tested was observed. At 37 degrees C, n. 38/67 (56.7%) of strains were biofilm producer in at least one tested surface. A total of n. 25/38 (65.7%) of strains were biofilm producer on polystyrene whereas n. 24/38 (63.1%) were biofilm producer on stainless steel. Moreover, n. 11/38 (28.9%) of strains were biofilm producers on both selected surfaces. The majority of S. aureus strains which produced biofilms (n. 17/38-44.7%), were isolated from food environments. At 12 degrees C, only one S. aureus strain from food handler (S. aureus 374) was biofilm producer. Cell surface hydrophobicity level increased with temperature. Additionally, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between hydrophobicity at 37 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Finally, the architecture of biofilm formed by S. aureus strains on polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces at selected temperatures was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The appearance of thick extracellular products in strongly (S. aureus ATCC 35556 - positive control) and the absence of those products in the non-biofilm producer (S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 - negative control) is presented.

TI  - Optimization of Ionic Liquid-Assisted Extraction of Biflavonoids from Selaginella doederleinii and Evaluation of Its Antioxidant and Antitumor Activity
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
AB  - As new green solvents, ionic liquids (ILs) have been generally applied in the extraction and separation of natural product. In this study, microwave assisted extraction based on IL (IL-MAE) was firstly employed to extract total biflavonoids from Selaginella doederleinii. Based on single-factor experiment, microwave power (300-700 W), extract time (30-50 min) and extract temperature (40-60 degrees C) on total bioflavonoids and antioxidant activities of the extracts were further investigated by a Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM) selecting total bioflavonoids yields and IC50 of radical scavenging as index. Besides antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydarzyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) radical scavenging assay, ferric reducing power assay and chelation of ferrous ions assay, and then anticaner activity was also researched against A549 cell line and 7721 cell line. The results illustrated that three factors and their interactions could be well suited for second-order polynomial models (p < 0.05). Through process parameters, optimization of the extract (460W, 40 min, and 45 degrees C) and detection of bioactivity, the yield of total bioflavonoids was 16.83 mg/g and IC50 value was 56.24 mu g/mL, respectively, indicating the extract has better anti-oxidation effect and antitumor activity. Furthermore, IL-MAE was the most efficient extracting method compared with MAE and Soxhlet extraction, which could improve extraction efficiency in a shorter time and at a lower temperature. In general, ILs-MAE was first adopted to establish a novel and green extraction process on the yields of total biflavonoids from S. doederleinii. In addition, the extract of containing biflavones showed potent antioxidant and anticancer capacity as a utilized valuable bioactive source for natural medicine.

TI  - Salinity Fluctuation on the Genetic Regulatory Mechanisms of the Crustacean, Charybdis japonica
VL  - 9
AB  - The intertidal salinity fluctuations provide pose a significant physical challenge for the crustaceans that live here. In the present study, Charybdis japonica was selected as the research species to explore the genetic regulatory mechanisms of intertidal crustaceans responding to salinity fluctuations. We cultured C. japonica s with three salinity gradients (the salinity of 15 parts per thousand, 25 parts per thousand, and 35 parts per thousand) and 68.90 Gb clean transcriptome reads were obtained by RNA-seq. All clean reads were then de novo assembled to 41,058 unigene with a mean length of 1,179.39 bp and an N50 length of 2,033 bp. Furthermore, a total of 18,100 (24.74%) unigenes were successfully matched with the sequences from at least one database. We further analyzed the transcriptome structure of C. japonica and a total of 26,853 CDSs and 12,190 SSRs were predicted. The gene expression levels of C. japonica at 25 parts per thousand were used as control, and 204 and 5,392 DEGs were found at the salinity of 35 parts per thousand and 15 parts per thousand, respectively. Based on the annotated information of DEGs, we speculated that C. japonicas were subjected to greater stress under the salinity of 35 parts per thousand and isotonic intracellular regulation was activated. Furthermore, neuronal activity, oxidation response, intracellular regulatory activity and osmotic regulation-related genes were speculated to be critical genes for C. japonica to cope with salinity fluctuations. The present results will provide fundamental information for revealing the salinity fluctuation-related genetic regulatory mechanisms of C. japonica and other intertidal crustaceans, and then help us predict how future salinity changes will affect the survival of crustaceans.

TI  - Effect of lactic acid stress on biofilm formation of Escherichia coli O26 at different temperatures
VL  - 41
IS  - 2
AB  - Similar to Escherichia coli O157, non-O157 also inherits certain acid resistance, and its stress response can be induced under acidic conditions, which may be affected by temperature. In this study, O26, the main serotype of non-O157 E. coli, was investigated in order to evaluate the effect of lactic acid stress on its biofilm formation (BF) at different temperatures. Firstly, the BF ability of 22 isolates of E. coli O26 were compared by means of crystal violet staining and the result showed that all strains had certain BF ability with variation among strains. Then, the strain 126Z with strong capacity and strain G13Z2 with medium capacity were selected for BF experiment in acidic TSB (pH 4.0 and 5.0, adjusted with lactic acid) at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The results showed that the BF of O26 was decreased with increasing concentration of lactic acid, and the higher the concentration of lactic acid was, the less the amount of biofilm formed. Moreover, the effect of temperature on BF of different capacity strains was related to the pH value, that is, with a lower concentration of lactic acid, the higher the temperature was, the faster the biofilm amount increased. Under a higher acid concentration, the BF of two strains showed different dynamic changes and were inhibited in the later stage, in which the biofilm amount of 126Z decreased significantly at 15 degrees C, while that of G13Z2 decreased more significant at 25 degrees C. This observation was further confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This finding suggests that combined temperature and lactic acid intervention may be an effective method to prevent BF, and the results of present work would provide scientific basis for the risk assessment of E. coli O26 in food processing.

TI  - Performance of two potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains from the olive microbiota as starters in the fermentation of heat shocked green olives
VL  - 171
SP  - 68-76
AB  - The performance of two potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains from olive microbiota, namely L pentosus B281 and L plantarum B282 was assessed as starter cultures in Spanish-style fermentation of heat shocked green olives cv. Halkidiki. Two different initial salt levels were studied, 10% (w/v) and 8% (w/v) NaCl, and the brines were inoculated with (a) L. pentosus B281, (b) L plantarum B282, and (c) a mixture of both strains. A spontaneous fermentation was also taken into account as control treatment Prior to brining, olives were heat shocked at. 80 degrees C for 10 min to reduce the level of the indigenous microbiota on olive drupes and facilitate the dominance of the inoculated cultures. Microbiological, physicochemical and sensory analyses were conducted throughout fermentation. The composition of LAB population and the evolution of added inocula were assessed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). The final population of LAB was maintained above 6 log cycles in olive flesh. Both L pentosus B281 and L plantarum B282 were able to dominate over indigenous LAB, albeit strain B281 exhibited higher recovery percentages (100 or 94.7% for B281 and 58.8% or 55.0% for B282 in 10% or 8% NaCl, respectively). L pentosus B281 also dominated over L plantarum B282, when the two strains were co-inoculated in olive fermentations. The sensory assessment showed higher preference for inoculated fermentations of L pentosus and L plantarum separately in 8% NaCl, followed by the L plantarum in 10% NaCl. The present study showed that probiotic strains L pentosus B281 and L plantarum B282, may offer a great potential for use as functional starter cultures in olive fermentation and deliver a promising probiotic food to the consumer.

TI  - Autumn migration and selection of rock crevices as hibernacula by big brown bats in Colorado
VL  - 87
IS  - 3
SP  - 470-479
AB  - Movements, distribution, and roosting requirements of most species of temperate-zone bats in autumn are poorly understood. We conducted the 1st radiotelemetry study of autumn migrations and prehibernation roost selection of bats in western North America. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus, n = 55) in the Poudre River watershed, Colorado, moved from low-elevation summer ranges to high-elevation locations in autumn, where they roosted in rock crevices during the period leading up to winter hibernation. We characterized rock crevices used as roosts in autumn at these higher elevations at microhabitat and landscape scales. We used logistic regression combined with an information theoretic approach to determine which variables were most important in roost selection. At the microhabitat scale, autumn roosts were higher to the ground above and below the exit point and were in deeper crevices that had more constant temperatures than randomly selected crevices. At the landscape scale, aspect of the hillside was important, with autumn roosts typically facing north-northwest. Autumn roosts fell into 2 categories: those used for a few days (transient roosts) and those used for >= 7 days and presumed to be hibernacula. Temperature regimes in the presumed hibernacula appear to provide optimal conditions for use of winter torpor, whereas transient roosts may offer passive rewarming and energy savings for bats still active in early autumn. Elevational segregation of sexes also was documented in our region, with a preponderance of females found at lower elevations and males at higher elevations in summer. Sex ratios at higher elevations became even in autumn. Use of short elevational migrations and selection of hibernation sites in rock crevices may be a common overwintering strategy of insectivorous bats of western North America.

TI  - The ecological role of climate extremes: current understanding and future prospects
VL  - 99
IS  - 3
SP  - 651-655
AB  - P>1. Climate extremes, such as severe drought, heat waves and periods of heavy rainfall, can have profound consequences for ecological systems and for human welfare. Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences. 2. Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE). 3. The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA. 4. Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems.

TI  - Local and non-local controls on seasonal variations in water availability and use by riparian trees along a hydroclimatic gradient
VL  - 16
IS  - 8
AB  - As global climate change continues to impact regional water cycles, we may expect further shifts in water availability to forests that create challenges for certain species and biomes. Lowland deciduous riparian forests are particularly vulnerable because tree species cannot migrate out of the stream corridor, and they rely on root zone water availability that is controlled by variations in both local climate conditions (e.g. precipitation, evaporation, and infiltration) and non-local hydroclimatic forcing (e.g. streamflow, snowmelt, recharge). To determine how the seasonal water source usage of riparian trees is controlled by local versus non-local variability in hydroclimatic regime, we reconstructed the seasonal oxygen isotope (delta (18) O) signature of water used by two riparian tree species with contrasting rooting depths, comprising similar to 800 delta (18) O tree-ring cellulose measurements from 12 tree-level decadal time-series at sub-annual resolution (six samples per year), along a strong hydroclimatic gradient within the Rhone River basin, SE France. These results were evaluated alongside delta (18) O measurements made from potential endmember water sources and independent hydroclimatic metrics. Thus we characterize the seasonal evolution of both potential water availability at distinct rooting depths and tree water source use and investigate the generalized riparian tree response to seasonal variations in local versus non-local hydroclimatic forcing over a decade. We show: (a) distinct seasonal water use between species, based on differential access to groundwater; (b) substantial source switching in both species based on evolving water availability; and (c) that riparian trees are more dependent on locally controlled soil moisture with distance downstream, creating increased vulnerability to locally increasing temperatures. We also find that deeply rooted trees in lowland riparian floodplains are potentially vulnerable to climate change because of their high dependence on water supply from mountains. This effect is more pronounced downstream, where seasonal water table decline may lead to loss of water required for deeply rooted trees.

TI  - Climatic turning point for beech and oak under climate change in Central Europe
VL  - 4
IS  - 12
AB  - The growth behavior of coexisting tree species under climate change is important from an ecological, silvicultural and economic perspective. While many previous studies are concerned with climatic limits for species occurrence, we focus on climate related shifts in interspecific competition. A landmark for these changes in competition is the 'climatic turning point' (CTP): those climate conditions under which a rank reversal between key tree species occurs. Here, we used a common type of temperate mixed forest in Central Europe with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) to explore the CTP under a future climate projection of increasing temperature and aridity. We selected a dry region where the prerequisite of differential climate sensitivity in mixed beech-oak forests was fulfilled: In-situ dendrochronological analyses demonstrated that the currently more competitive beech was more drought sensitive than sessile oak. We then used two complementary forest growth models, namely SILVA and LandClim, to investigate the climate induced rank-reversal in species dominance and to quantify it as the CTP from beech to oak by simulating future forest development from the WETTREG 2010 A1B climate projection. Utilizing two models allowed us to draw conclusions robust against the assumptions of a particular model. Both models projected a CTP at a mean annual temperature of 11-12 degrees C (July temperature > 18 degrees C) and a precipitation sum of 500-530 mm. However, the change in tree species composition can exhibit a time-lag of several decades depending on past stand development and current stand structure. We conclude that the climatic turning point is a simple yet effective reference measure to study climate related changes in interspecific competition, and confirm the importance of competition sensitivity in climate change modeling.

TI  - GLAUCONITE FROM UPPER CRETACEOUS FORMATIONS OF VARVARINSKOE DEPOSIT (TURGAY DEPRESSION, NORTHERN KAZAKHSTAN)
VL  - 329
IS  - 2
SP  - 104-117
AB  - Glauconite is the dioctahedral micaceous mineral with a high Fe content and structure of 2:1 layers linked by interlayer K cations. Wide distribution among marine sedimentary deposits and specific structural and chemical features of glauconites attract considerable attention of scientists both for paleogeographic reconstructions and for practical economical applications. The main aim of the study is a detailed investigation of mineralogical and structural-chemical characteristics of glauconite from the Upper Cretaceous formations of the Varvarinskoe deposit to determine origin of glauconite and to obtain initial information about possibilities of its practical applications. The methods: scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence analysis, optical microscopy and petrographic analysis. As a result of this investigation the following main conclusions vvere obtained. The formation of glauconite-quartz sandstones and sands occurred in coastal fades near the terrigenous input in dysoxic and anoxic conditions. The studied rocks mainly consist of glauconite (9,2...9,4 %) and terrigenous quartz (82,6...86,8 %). Glauconite is characterized by the following chemical composition (%): K20 6,73_8,89, 5i02- 49,67_55,99, Fe202;,,,,)- 19,36...26,85, MgO- 3,26...4,91, At0,- 3,90...7,31. The total content of adsorption and crystallization water is 3,46 and 412 %, respectively, according to the thermal analysis. Glauconite is evolved and highly evolved by degree of maturity. Glauconite is in situ origin. The glauconitization proceeded along the organic substrate according to the verdissement model due to chemical diffusion and transformation of the initial ferrous and ferrous-aluminum smectite, as evidenced by the structural and crystallochemical characteristics of glauconite. The studied structural and chemical characteristics of glauconite of the Varvarinskoe deposit indicate the possibility of its practical applications.

TI  - Adaptation to salinity in Atlantic cod from different regions of the Baltic Sea
VL  - 478
SP  - 62-67
AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occur in marine water of different salinities: from oceanic waters at salinity of 35 to Baltic Sea waters where the lowest level of salinity reaches 5-6. The stress response to different salinities in the eastern and western Baltic cod populations was examined. Two genes of Na+, K+ -ATPase 1a (atp1 a) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) expression, plasma cortisol and osmolality were used as markers of osmotic stress to characterize the reaction profiles of two populations of G. morhua from the western and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea. Atlantic cod were sampled in November 2012 from western Kiel Bight (KIEL, salinity of 18) and eastern Gdansk Bay (GDA, salinity of 8). Live fish were transported to the Marine Station of the University of Gdansk in Hel and were settled in tanks (3500 L). Cod were kept at 10 degrees C in recirculated water, which simulated the natural salinities of the geographic source region of the fish. Results showed that in the reduced and elevated salinity water of the KIEL group, we observed no change in expression of atp 1a and slightly increased expression of hsp70. In the GDA group, there were no significant changes of hsp70 expression but the level of atp 1a was significantly increased in both salinities. In both groups, concentration of cortisol increased after exposure to elevated salinity, while in fish exposed to reduced salinity, a significantly higher concentration of cortisol was observed after 72 h. The high expression of atp la that observed in the eastern group (GDA) supports the thesis of a genetic background to the adaptation to variable salinity. This adaptation may protect this species against an osmotic stress caused by daily vertical migrations and long-distance migration to spawning areas. At the same life-time, salinity is a barrier maintaining the genetic and physiological separations between G. morhua stocks and affecting the structure of this fish subpopulation in the Baltic Sea.

TI  - The Role of Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria on Organic Acid Accumulation during Wet and Spray-Dried Fish-Based Silages. Contributions to the Winning Combination of Microbial Food Safety and Environmental Sustainability
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - Organic acid contents of acidified and fermented fish silages made from gibel carp (Caracius gibelio) and klunzinger's ponyfish (Equulites klunzingeri) fishes, and from fish processing residues or by-products, were determined and studied. The silages were undertaken in wet and spray-dried fish-based raw-materials for 3 weeks at room temperature (ca. 25 degrees C). Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus spp. were employed to produce fermented fish-based silages, while acidified silage was prepared resorting to the addition of formic acid (3%, v/v). Lactic and propionic acids were the dominant produced organic acids, while succinic acid was formed at the smallest amounts in fermented silages. In the acidified silage, lactic and formic acids were produced in amounts higher than 800 and 1000 mg (organic acid)/100 g (samples) respectively. Among the fermented fish-based silages, LAB strains unfolded considerable ability to presumptively produce propionic acid in gibel carp silage (>2370 mg (organic acic)/100 g sample). Spray-dried fermented silages displayed significantly higher organic acid content than wet silages. Propionic acid accumulation was found at the highest levels in gibel carp silage fermented with L. plantarum (6335.40 mg (propionic acic)/100 g sample). This research effort pointed out the good capability of various selected lactic acid bacteria strains to produce significant amounts of organic acids especially lactic, acetic, and propionic acids- during the fermentation of fish-based silages. In terms of food safety and quality, such a production of relatively high amounts of organic acids in wet and spray-dried fish-based silages clearly indicated their suitableness to be used for animal feed.

AB  - Deciphering the pre-orogenic evolution of subducted continental basement is challenging due to pervasive reworking of crust during subduction and exhumation. Survival of such polycyclic basement may occur locally in low strain domains bounded by intensely overprinted rocks. The Palaeozoic history of basement involved in Alpine continental subduction is investigated in the northern Dora-Maira Massif where a kilometre-scale domain of low strain preserves a pre-Alpine amphibolite-facies foliation in garnet-biotite orthogneiss and garnet-staurolite micaschist. By contrast, a first generation garnet is the only pre-Alpine relict in pervasively reworked domains surrounding the low-strain domain. Thermodynamic modelling based on garnet isopleths in micaschist constrains the pre-Alpine pressure-temperature (P-T) evolution from 4 to 5 kbar and similar to 500 degrees C to 6-7 kbar and similar to 650 degrees C, which is consistent with Barrovian metamorphism up to the staurolite zone. In this micaschist, monazite included in garnet rims provide an age of 324 +/- 6 Ma (95% confidence interval; c.i.). On the basis of textural and chemical data, this is interpreted as recording peak Barrovian metamorphic conditions. Low Th/U metamorphic zircon overgrowths and crystals yield an age of 304 +/- 2 Ma (95% confidence interval). On the basis of the trace element concentrations and rare earth element (REE) patterns measured in garnet and metamorphic zircon, the latter is tentatively interpreted as having grown during early exhumation or cooling, involving garnet consumption and fluid infiltration. The reconstructed Variscan Barrovian metamorphism of the northern Dora-Maira basement is consistent with that documented in the External Crystalline Massifs and in the Austroalpine domain of the Alps. The Palaeozoic basement of the Dora-Maira Massif likely represents upper crustal material, later involved in Alpine continental subduction under high- to ultra-high-pressure conditions.

TI  - ARE WE MOVING TOWARDS CONTINUOUS TREATMENT IN SMALL-CELL LUNG-CANCER (SCLC)
VL  - 14

SP  - 309-311
AB  - In the late sixties the first randomized placebo controlled study with cyclophosphamide demonstrated improved survival inpatients with extensive small cell king cancer (SCLC). Since then chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment of SCLC. A number of active combination chemotherapy programs for SCLC were developed during the 1970s and early 1980s. Administration of three or four effective drugs simultaneously appeal ed to be required for optimal results, but the particular regimen selected was of less importance than the delivery of doses that induced moderately severe but not life-threatening myelosuppression. The drugs chosen for a combination were justified on the basis of single agent activity, difference in mechanism of action and non-overlapping toxic effects. The actual doses were usually the result of feasibility studies in which the doses of all except one drug were held constant. Certain combinations became popular quickly, long before it was appreciated that one of the drugs in the combination added more toxicity than benefit. It is therefore not surprising that the old concept that two drugs in combination are better than one, or three drugs in combination are better than two, is being increasingly criticized. There is recognition that at the time of diagnosis SCLC may already be partially resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents and that the strategy simulated by Goldie and Coldman may only partly be applicable to SCLC. Moreover, the development of hematopoietic growth factors hs provided a reason to re-evaluate the doses of individual cytostatic agents in current combination regimes and to combine drugs that previously, were thought to be incompatible. But even without growth factors, recent investigations with the single agent etoposide and the combination of etoposide and cisplatin have provided arguments against the old theories of <<more is better>>. Drug combinations must preferably be selected on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies. Dose intensity has to be revised and fascinating opportunities will arrive as soon as efficient oral formulations of active drugs, such as platinum, ifosfamide and etoposide become available.

TI  - On the chronology of lunar origin and evolution Implications for Earth, Mars and the Solar System as a whole
VL  - 21
AB  - An origin of the Moon by a Giant Impact is presently the most widely accepted theory of lunar origin. It is consistent with the major lunar observations: its exceptionally large size relative to the host planet, the high angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, the extreme depletion of volatile elements, and the delayed accretion, quickly followed by the formation of a global crust and mantle. According to this theory, an impact on Earth of a Mars-sized body set the initial conditions for the formation and evolution of the Moon. The impact produced a protolunar cloud. Fast accretion of the Moon from the dense cloud ensured an effective transformation of gravitational energy into heat and widespread melting. A "Magma Ocean" of global dimensions formed, and upon cooling, an anorthositic crust and a mafic mantle were created by gravitational separation. Several 100 million years after lunar accretion, long-lived isotopes of K, U and Th had produced enough additional heat for inducing partial melting in the mantle; lava extruded into large basins and solidified as titanium-rich mare basalt. This delayed era of extrusive rock formation began about 3.9 Ga ago and may have lasted nearly 3 Ga. A relative crater count timescale was established and calibrated by radiometric dating (i.e., dating by use of radioactive decay) of rocks returned from six Apollo landing regions and three Luna landing spots. Fairly well calibrated are the periods approximate to 4 Ga to approximate to 3 Ga BP (before present) and approximate to 0.8 Ga BP to the present. Crater counting and orbital chemistry (derived from remote sensing in spectral domains ranging from gamma- and x-rays to the infrared) have identified mare basalt surfaces in the Oceanus Procellarum that appear to be nearly as young as 1 Ga. Samples returned from this area are needed for narrowing the gap of 2 Ga in the calibrated timescale. The lunar timescale is not only used for reconstructing lunar evolution, but it serves also as a standard for chronologies of the terrestrial planets, including Mars and possibly early Earth. The Moon holds a historic record of Galactic cosmic-ray intensity, solar wind composition and fluxes and composition of solids of any size in the region of the terrestrial planets. Some of this record has been deciphered. Secular mixing of the Sun was constrained by determining He-3/He-4 of solar wind helium stored in lunar fines and ancient breccias. For checking the presumed constancy of the impact rate over the past approximate to 3.1 Ga, samples of the youngest mare basalts would be needed for determining their radiometric ages. Radiometric dating and stratigraphy has revealed that many of the large basins on the near side of the Moon were created by impacts about 4.1 to 3.8 Ga ago. The apparent clustering of ages called "Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB)" is thought to result from migration of planets several 100 million years after their accretion. The bombardment, unexpectedly late in solar system history, must have had a devastating effect on the atmosphere, hydrosphere and habitability on Earth during and following this epoch, but direct traces of this bombardment have been eradicated on our planet by plate tectonics. Indirect evidence about the course of bombardment during this epoch on Earth must therefore come from the lunar record, especially from additional data on the terminal phase of the LHB. For this purpose, documented samples are required for measuring precise radiometric ages of the Orientale Basin and the Nectaris and/or Fecunditatis Basins in order to compare these ages with the time of the earliest traces of life on Earth. A crater count chronology is presently being built up for planet Mars and its surface features. The chronology is based on the established lunar chronology whereby differences between the impact rates for Moon and Mars are derived from local fluxes and impact energies of projectiles. Direct calibration of the Martian chronology will have to come from radiometric ages and cosmic-ray exposure ages measured in samples returned from the planet.

TI  - Data-Driven Techniques for Low-Cost Sensor Selection and Calibration for the Use Case of Air Quality Monitoring
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
AB  - With the emergence of Low-Cost Sensor (LCS) devices, measuring real-time data on a large scale has become a feasible alternative approach to more costly devices. Over the years, sensor technologies have evolved which has provided the opportunity to have diversity in LCS selection for the same task. However, this diversity in sensor types adds complexity to appropriate sensor selection for monitoring tasks. In addition, LCS devices are often associated with low confidence in terms of sensing accuracy because of the complexities in sensing principles and the interpretation of monitored data. From the data analytics point of view, data quality is a major concern as low-quality data more often leads to low confidence in the monitoring systems. Therefore, any applications on building monitoring systems using LCS devices need to focus on two main techniques: sensor selection and calibration to improve data quality. In this paper, data-driven techniques were presented for sensor calibration techniques. To validate our methodology and techniques, an air quality monitoring case study from the Bradford district, UK, as part of two European Union (EU) funded projects was used. For this case study, the candidate sensors were selected based on the literature and market availability. The candidate sensors were narrowed down into the selected sensors after analysing their consistency. To address data quality issues, four different calibration methods were compared to derive the best-suited calibration method for the LCS devices in our use case system. In the calibration, meteorological parameters temperature and humidity were used in addition to the observed readings. Moreover, we uniquely considered Absolute Humidity (AH) and Relative Humidity (RH) as part of the calibration process. To validate the result of experimentation, the Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were compared for both AH and RH. The experimental results showed that calibration with AH has better performance as compared with RH. The experimental results showed the selection and calibration techniques that can be used in designing similar LCS based monitoring systems.

TI  - Managing Uncertainty in Scots Pine Range-Wide Adaptation Under Climate Change
VL  - 9
AB  - Forests provide important ecosystem services and renewable materials. Yet, under a future climate, optimal conditions will likely shift outside the current range for some tree species. This will challenge the persistence of populations to rely on inherent plasticity and genetic diversity to acclimate or adapt to future uncertain conditions. An opportunity to study such processes is offered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), a forest tree with a large distribution range including populations locally adapted to a wide variety of environments, which hinders a range-wide assessment of the species to climate change. Here we evaluate tree height growth uncertainty of Scots pine marginal populations in Spain and the Nordic countries linked to their genetic adaptation promoted by different climatic drivers. Our aims are to: (i) review the main climatic drivers of Scots pine adaptation across its range; (ii) undertake provenance-based modeling and prediction of tree height under current and future climate scenarios including four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and five general circulation models (GCMs) at two extremes of its climatic niche; (iii) estimate uncertainty in population tree height linked to the main drivers of local adaptation that may change among RCPs and GCMs in the Nordic countries and Spain. Our models revealed that tree height adaptation is mostly driven by drought in Spain and by photoperiod in the Nordic countries, whereas the literature review also highlighted temperature as a climatic driver for the Nordic region. Model predictions for the Nordic countries showed an overall increase in tree height but with high uncertainty in magnitude depending on the RCPs and GCMs whereas predictions for Spain showed tree height to be maintained in the north and reduced in the south, but with similar magnitudes among RCPs and GCMs. Both models predicted tree height outside the data range used to develop the models (extrapolation). Predictions using higher emission RCPs resulted in larger extrapolated areas, constituting a further source of uncertainty. An expanded network of Scots pine field trials throughout Europe, facilitated by data collection and international research collaboration, would limit the need for uncertain predictions based on extrapolation.

TI  - Intelligent Completion Inside Uncemented Liner For Selective High-Rate Carbonate Matrix Acidizing
VL  - 29
IS  - 2
SP  - 165-181
AB  - This paper describes the design, testing, installation, and performance of the first fully completed well by use of an intelligent inner completion inside an uncemented liner with openhole packers for zonal isolation. The well-design concept evolved from technical challenges associated with completing long cased-and-cemented laterals in the mature Ekofisk waterflood. The term fully completed implies full reservoir access along the pay length for production and high-rate matrix acid stimulation by use of limited entry for fluid diversion within well segments. The paper covers the development and qualification of custom openhole 75/8-in.-liner components that can handle high differential pressures and severe temperature fluctuations of 200 degrees F; the marriage of this complex liner with a five-zone intelligent-completion system; and results from 1 year of system-integration testing. The paper also discusses the strategic placement of both mechanical openhole and inner-string packers based on caliper and drilling logs; challenges met and overcome during installation; and comprehensive downhole-gauge data that confirms the performance of each component before, during, and after the stimulation. The Ekofisk field waterflood began in 1987 and continues to date, exceeding expectations for improved oil recovery while mitigating reservoir compaction. As the waterflood matures, new wells are more often found partially water-swept. Limited infrastructure for lifting and handling the high water production has led to increased emphasis on isolating these water-swept intervals. Cased, cemented, and perforated completions have traditionally been used for this service. Effective placement of cement is challenging in horizontals 4,000-8,000 ft in length, where rotation of the liner is not possible and high effective-circulating densities limit rates during cementing. Wide variations in reservoir pore pressures, often in excess of 2,000-psi difference along the lateral, are typical of the Ekofisk chalk and compound the difficulties of cementing. As a result, a new method for zonal isolation has been developed to ensure the success of future infill-drilling campaigns. The design and careful planning that went into the fully completed openhole uncemented-liner strategy resulted in a successful field trial and has proved this solution to be an effective alternative to cemented reservoir liners in long horizontals where zonal isolation is critical. Use of the intelligent-well system (IWS) allowed offline acid stimulation without rig, coiled-tubing, or wireline intervention. What would have traditionally been a significant water producer, with three water-swept zones totaling nearly 2,000 ft across a 4,000-ft reservoir section, has turned out to be one of the best oil producers in the field, with nearly zero water cut. Production results show high productivity with highly negative acidized-completion skins. With large investments in intelligent completions to provide zone-specific inflow control and water shutoff, isolation outside the liner becomes much more important. Over recent years, the Ekofisk wells have illustrated the difficulty of achieving effective cement along lengthy reservoir targets. The openhole fully completed solution combining an accessorized uncemented liner with an inner intelligent-completion string will allow operators to push the limits in terms of lateral length while maintaining full control over producing and nonproducing zones.

TI  - Modelling Rain Rate by Means of Arrival Processes
SP  - 1021-1022
AB  - We try to address in this paper our current work toward the generation of synthetic time series of rain rate, R, in mm/h with an integration time of 1 min This is the ITU-R, standard for predicting rain induced attenuation [1]. For one, the availability of rain intensity records adapted to the ITU-R requirements is very limited given that the main users of rain information (weather prediction, water management, etc.) do not require such a short integration time and data with longer accumulation periods, even exceeding 1 hour, are commonly found. In this respect, there is recent published work where a method based on a physical model (EXCELL) [2] has been proposed for converting recordings with longer integration times to the standardized 1-min period. On the other hand, even using 1-second resolution rain gauge data, it is rather difficult to agree on how to produce R(t) series from which reliable yearly complementary cumulative distributions, CCDFs, are obtained. From such statistics, CCDFs of rain-induced attenuation, A (dB), are generated for use in link budgets. Several methods have been compared in [3] showing important discrepancies in critical outage probability levels. Moreover, if the interest is in generating instantaneous time series of A(t) for simulation purposes, for example making use of Matricciani's Synthetic Storm Technique [4], the resulting series would consist of frequent, unrealistic signal plateaus as a consequence of the somehow unrealistic rain rate series. The latter are produced with the current tipping bucket data processing methods [3], [5-6]. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of an R(t) series obtained from bucket tip series using [6]. Note the presence of frequent plateaus, especially in the lower intensity sections. However, one would expect that the series of both R and A should contain an additional, superposed random component, not present using with the actual processing techniques. It is thus important to investigate the smaller scale nature of the precipitation phenomenon in order to being able to reproduce it more accurately. Additionally, we need to find a better approach toward the conversion of bucket tip data into rain intensity and then on to obtaining cumulative statistics. Our current approach to the above issues is developing a model capable of simulating the occurrence of rain gauge tips according to an it-state hidden Markov model representing it rainy regimes within which different arrival (tip) rates are defined. Moreover, the idea is to further complement the above approach with a similar model which derives rain drop arrivals of different sizes associated to each tip. Thus, we are exploring the application of a class of stochastic point process models, Markovian Arrival Process (1VIAPs) [7], in the analysis of fine time-scale rain rate. MAPs can model statistics of any order of inter-arrival times between measured events. We are using these models to generate synthetic tippingbucket rain gauge data at a specific site. Since R(t) series derived from tipping series are strongly dependent on the processing methodology, five methods are being used to calculate R(t) and their corresponding CCDFs for comparison with those provided by the ITU-R for the same location. In this application, the arrival pattern of rain gauge bucket tip times, {NO}, is viewed as a MAP whose rate of occurrence varies according to an unobserved finite state irreducible Markov process. An it-state MAP is specified by two nxn matrices: (1) a stable matrix Do with non-negative off-diagonal entries, and (2) a non-negative matrix D1 describing the transition rates between the it states. Each transition in D1 produces an arrival event (tip). Matrix Do describes the background transitions, not associated with arrivals. The matrix Q=Do+D-i is the infinitesimal generator of the underlying Markov process. Here, we are considering a special case of MAP where D-1 is a diagonal matrix: a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPPs) [8]. In particular, for our initial work we are using the MMPP model parameters listed in Table 1 of [9] corresponding to 13 years of 0.2 mm rainfall tip time data for Heathrow, West of London, UK. Twelve parameters sets, one for each month of the year, are available. The model assumes three states: (1) intense rainy state, (2) wet state, and (3) dry state (little or no rain). A realization of this model is illustrated in Fig. 2, the state series on the top line and the actual tips on the bottom line, with the highest tipping rate corresponding to the state 1. The synthetic rain gauge data generated with the above 3-state MIVIPP model was used to generate R(t) series. Five methods were considered for producing R(t): Natural, Usual meteorological, First IAP, Novel IAP, Novel IAP-RM, and D'Amico et al. [3],[5-6]. Fig. 1 shows an example result using the Novel IAP-RM method [6]. As indicated earlier, the generated R(t) series does not provide the expected realism: lack of random variability. The same happens for the other processing methods. This is due to the fact that most of the above studied techniques correspond to some sort of convolution between a rectangular window with a train of Dirac deltas (tips), which are later accumulated in 1-min integration intervals. We would assume that an experimentally derived, random window should give rise to more realistic R(t) series. One of our current lines of work involves the derivation of one or a family of such windows from fine time resolution disdrometer data. After all R(t) series are obtained through the different data processing methods, the final step involves the analysis of results by comparing the yearly CCDFs with that for Heathrow according to ITU-R P.837-6 [1]. It has been observed that the model parameters proposed in [9] give rise to an average CCDF that follows quite well that provided by the ITU-R for the lower intensities. However, the higher intensities produced seem to be underestimated. We suspect that this originates from the fact that the optimization process used for extracting the model parameters targeted matching the yearly mean amount of rain. We are working toward a parameter extraction method that overcomes this problem and that could be used in other climatic areas. In conclusion, a summary of our current work toward the study and characterization of rain intensity at a finer scale that can be used both for simulation purposes and for the generation of yearly or other periods (seasonal, monthly, ...) cumulative distributions for link budget applications has been presented. It is expected that through the study of arrivals: first of rain gauge tips and, possibly, drop arrivals, a more faithful reproduction of rain induced effects on radio links could be achieved.

TI  - Territorial alienation through World Heritage: analysis of the World Heritage List of Latin America and the Caribbean from a critical geopolitical approach
IS  - 48
SP  - 123-141
AB  - Cultural heritage,understood as the selection of sites or cultural manifestations transmitted for future generations, is rooted in the nationalist projects of states during European modernity. After the terrible consequences of the world wars this conservation model was universalized searching to preserve the heritage of mankind and supporting, at the same time, the construction of a liberal international order. Since then, international organizations have sought to direct efforts towards this goal. In 1972 the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage emerged as a result of discussions at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This convention was concerned about the deterioration or disappearance of cultural or natural heritage, something viewed as harmful and an impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world.This is why the agreement summoned the states to participate in the protection of world heritage of outstanding universal value, by cultivating collective cooperation and assistance.A list of monuments and sites that form part of world heritage was established,in terms of aesthetic,historical, artistic or scientific criteria. However, over time, in the selection process of world heritage sites disputes and power asymmetries have arisen between countries around the control of space. This problem can be analyzed through Critical Heritage and Critical Geopolitics approaches, spanning the historical changes and current critical debates about heritage, as well as the political processes of narratives, metaphors and social image constructions around territory. We propose that nominating a territory as a world heritage site generates its alienation. That is, states absorb local territories (understood as a social construct) into dominant national narratives and images, subsequently, countries consolidate their appropriation by enlisting their nationalized territories within the meta-narrative of world heritage. In this process, countries must participate in a highly politicized and structurally unequal international negotiation that reproduces spatial hierarchies. Ultimately, these local territories and practices suffer a process of assimilation into the allegory of world heritage.With this in mind, the aim of this study is to analyze the territorial alienation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List by Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries as a case study. This alienation occurs because, given the conditions of UNESCO, the countries of the region must adopt an artificial set of categories, typologies and narratives, absorbing or denying other territorial practices. This paper is divided in two sections. The first section gives a brief overview of world heritage origins centered on national projects within a specific European context, and explains Critical Heritage and Critical Geopolitics approaches. A discussion of the evolution of world heritage categories and symbolic aspects of power is reviewed, highlighting the imposition of historical narratives in official documents, the reproduction of aesthetic codes and the construction of imaginaries around the past of territories.The second section analyses the particular case of the World Heritage List in Latin America and the Caribbean. In order to study territorial alienations, methodologically we review countries ratifications of the 1972 convention, the total number of sites, obstacles in international negotiations, narratives, as well as historical events commemorated by the world heritage officially recognized in this part of the planet. The inscription of a site on the World Heritage List requires a nomination file. We used the UNESCO's files to detect these historical narratives and discourses. Some conclusions are drawn, our findings would seem to show that world heritage sites in LatinaAmerica and the Caribbean are underrepresented compared to Europe and North America. In addition, these sites are geographically concentrated in South America, with the Caribbean as the least favored sub-region. At the beginning, countries were reluctant to ratify the 1972 convention due to the prevailing Cold War context,but gradually all countries in the region accepted the commitment. States like Mexico top the List of World Heritage sites, but others have no sites recognized; differences in the number of sites registered by the countries do not only stem from their geographical attributes and their historical past, but also because of the political, technical and economic potential to participate in diplomatic negotiations at UNESCO. Arguments for inscribing a site as world heritage in this region highlights the relevance of natural and exotic places. This looks like a continuity of dominant imperialist narratives during the conquest and colonization of the continent America. The separation between natural and cultural world heritage is an artificial division adopted, but contrary to some local traditions in the region. The arrival of Europeans to LatinAmerica has been established as a time marker used for example to talk about "pre-Columbian" cultures. In any case, few sites commemorate pre-Columbian civilizations, with the exception of the Mayas and the Incas,which contrasts with the cultural diversity and traditional groups that are not part of these dominant versions of the past. It may be assumed that in historical commemorations of world heritage sites in this region, the colonial past is notoriously overvalued and magnified; that is, it is presented as a favorable stage indicating a kind of cultural sophistication for indigenous people. Amazingly, territories essential to fulfilling their goal of extracting natural resources for the European settlers are now uncritically recognized as world heritage (for example mining centers, plantations, seaports or strategic villages). Similarly, cultural sites of Roman Catholic Christianity are evoked as a favorable contribution for the historical regional memory, but denying impositions around the conflictive and complex process of evangelization; in the same way other religions and beliefs are omitted. There are many colonial sites enlisted as world heritage but very few referring to the modern history of the region, significantly reformist narratives are absent: independence movements, abolition of slavery or contemporary indigenous and black population claims are not raised. In summary, these results suggest that,from a critical perspective,the world heritage sites in Latina America and the Caribbean allow dominant relations to continue through values of European origin, selective historical narratives and illusory images as a colonized region. As long as other relevant regional historical events or social actors are ignored, the regional past and cultural heritage will be incomplete. The region reaffirms its peripheral and subordinated position in the international system through historical narratives acritically adopted. Latin American and Caribbean territories are more than exotic landscapes and places of colonial splendor for tourism. Analyzing world heritage from a critical perspective is a way to re-center the territory as a key axis in this dynamic and to recognize other memories and spatial relations.

AB  - Bathyal cold seeps are isolated extreme deep-sea environments characterized by low species diversity while biomass can be high. The Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barents Sea, 1,280 m) is a rather stable chemosynthetic driven habitat characterized by prominent surface bacterial mats with high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Here, the nematode Halomonhystera hermesithrives in high abundances (11,000 individuals 10 cm(-2)). Halomonhystera hermesi is a member of the intertidal Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex that includes five cryptic species (GD 1-5). GD1-5's common habitat is characterized by strong environmental fluctuations. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of H. hermesi and GD1, H. hermesi's closest relative. Genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are more strongly expressed in H. hermesi than in GD1, and many genes were only observed in H. hermesi while being completely absent in GD1. Both observations could in part be attributed to high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Additionally, fatty acid elongation was also prominent in H. hermesi confirming the importance of highly unsaturated fatty acids in this species. Significant higher amounts of transcription factors and genes involved in signaling receptor activity were observed in GD1 (many of which were completely absent in H. hermesi), allowing fast signaling and transcriptional reprogramming which can mediate survival in dynamic intertidal environments. GC content was approximately 8% higher in H. hermesi coding unigenes resulting in differential codon usage between both species and a higher proportion of amino acids with GC-rich codons in H. hermesi. In general our results showed that most pathways were active in both environments and that only three genes are under natural selection. This indicates that also plasticity should be taken in consideration in the evolutionary history of Halomonhystera species. Such plasticity, as well as possible preadaptation to low oxygen and high sulfide levels might have played an important role in the establishment of a cold-seep Halomonhystera population.

TI  - Reconstructing the demise of Tethyan plants: climate-driven range dynamics of Laurus since the Pliocene
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
SP  - 685-695
AB  - Aim Climate changes are thought to be responsible for the retreat and eventual extinction of subtropical lauroid species that covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Palaeogene and early Neogene; little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal patterns of this demise. Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios. Location The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores). Methods We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent) to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences. Results Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range. Main conclusions The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr. This marked niche conservatism imposed largely deterministic range dynamics driven by climate conditions. This species's relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct. Climatic scenarios for the end of this century would favour an expansion of the species's range towards northern latitudes, while severely limiting southern populations due to increased water stress.

TI  - Tree suitability under climate change conditions: susceptibility of major forest tree species from tree-rings widths
VL  - 182
IS  - 5
SP  - 98-112
AB  - The predicted increase in frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, like drought episodes, imposes a challenge on the choice of commercial forest trees under climate change conditions. The present study aims at quantifying the impact of summer drought on growth of spruce, pine, silver fir, beech and oak as the main forest tree species in Southern Germany, and includes Douglas fir as a possible alternative for spruce. Series of tree-ring widths from more than 1400 trees from 48 sites all over Bavaria and adjacent states are employed for growth/climate modeling and pointer year analysis to derive predications about the climatic limitation of tree growth subject to species, regional climate and site quality. Response functions relating tree growth to climatic variables in monthly resolution have been applied. The obtained parameters were subject to principal component analysis to derive a more condensed representation of climatic constraints on tree growth. Soil water balance modeling was applied to refine the connections between regional climate and growth reactions to drought in terms of site quality. A modification of Brook90 (Brook90-LWF) has been employed for water balance modeling. Pointer years were choosen a priori according to documented drought years and used to calculate short- and long-term impact of drought on tree-growth. For all species under investigation, critical areas for tree growth could be identified. Generally, the warmer and drier northern part of the investigation area is more unfavorable, with spruce generally being more affected than other species in terms of short- and long-term impact of summer drought on tree-growth (Figure 1). Furthermore, in a condensed view of dendroclimatic forcings, spruce depicts the strongest connection to the aspect "summer drought" throughout the investigation area, whereas oak shows the weakest connection (Figure 5). As a main result, oak is superior to all other species under investigation regarding drought tolerance throughout the investigation area. But also silver fir could replace the most critical spruce on a wide range of sites. Furthermore, the surprisingly high variability in reaction to drought observed on regional and stand level (Figure 3) implies a high adaptive potential of the populations within the possibilities of their inherent genetic diversity, hampering the derivation of clear climatic or site-related thresholds (compare Figure 2).

TI  - Prevention of infectious tick-borne diseases in humans: Comparative studies of the repellency of different dodecanoic acid-formulations against Ixodes ricinus ticks (Acari: Ixodidae)
VL  - 1
AB  - Background: Ticks of the species Ixodes ricinus are the main vectors of Lyme Borreliosis and Tick-borne Encephalitis - two rapidly emerging diseases in Europe. Repellents provide a practical means of protection against tick bites and can therefore minimize the transmission of tick-borne diseases. We developed and tested seven different dodecanoic acid (DDA)-formulations for their efficacy in repelling host-seeking nymphs of I. ricinus by laboratory screening. The ultimately selected formulation was then used for comparative investigations of commercially available tick repellents in humans. Methods: Laboratory screening tests were performed using the Moving-object (MO) bioassay. All test formulations contained 10% of the naturally occurring active substance DDA and differed only in terms of the quantitative and qualitative composition of inactive ingredients and fragrances. The test procedure used in the human bioassays is a modification of an assay described by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and recommended for regulatory affairs. Repellency was computed using the equation: R = 100 - N-R/N x 100, where N-R is the number of non-repelled ticks, and N is the respective number of control ticks. All investigations were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment offering standardized test conditions. Results: All test formulations strongly repelled nymphs of I. ricinus (100-81% protection) as shown by the MO-bioassay. The majority of ticks dropped off the treated surface of the heated rotating drum that served as the attractant (1 mg/cm(2) repellent applied). The 10% DDA-based formulation, that produced the best results in laboratory screening, was as effective as the coconut oil-based reference product. The mean protection time of both preparations was generally similar and averaged 8 hours. Repellency investigations in humans showed that the most effective 10% DDA-based formulation (similar to 1.67 mg/cm(2) applied) strongly avoided the attachment of I. ricinus nymphs and adults for at least 6 hours. The test repellent always provided protection (83-63%) against I. ricinus nymphs equivalent to the natural coconut oil based reference product and a better protection (88-75%) against adult ticks than the synthetic Icaridin-containing reference repellent. Conclusion: We found that the 10% DDA-based formulation (ContraZeck (R)) is an easily applied and very effective natural repellent against I. ricinus ticks. By reducing the human-vector contact the product minimises the risk of transmission of tick-borne diseases in humans.

TI  - YOUNG-OF-THE-YEAR STONE CRAB (GENUS MENIPPE) RECRUITMENT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO OFF FLORIDA: KEY SHALLOW-WATER HOTSPOTS
VL  - 40
IS  - 2
SP  - 339-398
AB  - Knowledge of juvenile recruitment (defined here as the quantitative addition of early benthic life stages to a local population) is important for conserving heavily harvested species and their critical habitats. Stone crabs (genus Menippe) are commercially and ecologically important throughout the Gulf of Mexico nearshore waters off Florida, but very little is known about their recruitment. Using standard commercial stone crab traps, megalopal and postsettlement juvenile (collectively, youngof-the-year, "YOY") stone crabs were sampled at multiple spatial scales and for multiple stone crab generations to characterize geographical, seasonal, and interannual variation in their distribution and relative abundance (numbers collected on traps) in the Gulf of Mexico off peninsular Florida and north of the Florida Keys (the "Florida Gulf"). The influences of potentially relevant oceanographic and biological variables [temperature, salinity, benthic community on the traps (trap fouling community), depth, distance from shore] on YOY stone crabs were investigated at locations distributed throughout the study area. Trap fouling communities had never been analyzed in detail prior to this study; an importance index was developed to quantify the seasonality, commonality, and density of the fouling communities and organisms composing the communities. Continuous, long-term data from the Tampa Bay location allowed investigation of the effects of biological relationships [relative abundance of female Menippe carrying eggs (ovigerous), occurrences of red tide (Karenia brevis, a toxic dinoflagellate) blooms] and meteorological events [tropical cyclones, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurrences] on temporal patterns of variation in recruitment. High relative abundances of YOY stone crabs were collected off peninsular Florida from dense, complex benthic biota that grew on crab traps located off large, pristine estuaries in relatively turbid water less than 5 m deep, where salinity ranged 24-36 and water temperature averaged 29 degrees C-32 degrees C. Two major recruitment locations, stable through decades, consistently accounted for approximately 50% of the YOY stone crabs collected; two secondary recruitment locations similarly accounted for another 25%. Relative abundance of YOY stone crabs was highest nearshore at the major recruitment locations, particularly during years of high relative abundance. Approximately 65%-75% of the recruits were collected August to October; however, the timing of both peak relative abundance and lowest relative abundance shifted to later in the year as latitude decreased. Patterns of change among months in relative abundance differed among locations within years and among years within locations. Water temperature, salinity, and trap fouling community were the important determinants of temporal and spatial variation in YOY stone crab relative abundance; depth and distance from shore were also important in areas where they varied notably among stations within locations and across broader expanses of the study area. At Tampa Bay, a sharp increase in relative abundance of ovigerous females in spring was followed by a similarly sharp increase in YOY stone crab relative abundance (principally stage 3-5 crabs) 3 mo later; whereas a sharp decrease in ovigerous female relative abundance in autumn was followed by a similarly sharp decrease in YOY stone crab relative abundance 1 mo later. Coincidence of the normal autumnal decrease in YOY stone crab relative abundance with red tides and tropical cyclones prevented assigning clear relationships between seasonal change in relative abundance and these potential external influences. Annual decreases in relative abundance were significantly related to the occurrence of tropical cyclones that came near Tampa Bay during the previous year. Twice, confluences of multiple hurricanes, timely red tides, and ENSO events were followed by nearly complete, 1- to 2-y recruitment collapses. In contrast, a single meteorologically and oceanographically highly anomalous year coincided with exceptionally high abundances of both YOY and ovigerous female stone crabs. A relationship between YOY stone crabs and subsequent fishery harvest was not evident, possibly due to a variety of fishery practices. Because stone crabs are subjected to intense fishing pressure throughout the Florida Gulf, the YOY stone crab recruitment grounds and their associated estuaries should be protected from the effects of development, agriculture, aquaculture, and commercial and recreational crabbing.

TI  - Episodic growth of Precambrian lower crust beneath the North China Craton: A synthesis
VL  - 222
SP  - 255-264
AB  - A comprehensive review of U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopes of zircons separated from granulite xenoliths entrained in Phanerozoic magmatic rocks and inherited xenocrysts from the associated lower crust rocks from various domains of the North China Craton (NCC) provides new insights into understanding the evolution of the lower crust in this part of the Precambrian nucleus of Asia. The oldest zircons recorded in granulite xenoliths show ages up to 3.6 Ga, slightly younger than the oldest zircons (3.8 Ga) from samples of the exposed Archean upper crust. However, the Hf isotope features indicate that the oldest lower crust might have been derived from a 4.0 to 4.1 Ga primordial crust as indicated by the data from an inherited zircon in the North Qinling Orogenic Belt at the southern part of the NCC. Our synthesis also suggests that ca. 2.5 Ga mark an important period for the evolution of the lower crust of the NCC and the cratonization of the Archean blocks in the NCC, at least for the Eastern Block, with a possible link to mantle plume activity. The occasional presence of zircons with 2.6-3.1 Ga ages in the lower crustal granulite xenoliths suggests a continuous reworking of the Paleoarchean lower crust during the Archean. The comprehensive data also show that 1.8-2.0 Ga period was the first significant event for the evolution of the lower crust after the cratonization of the Archean blocks of the NCC, which affected the whole lower crust of the Eastern NCC. Episodic growth or rejuvenation of the Precambrian lower crust beneath the NCC is also revealed by U-Pb and Hf isotope data, resulting from the corresponding addition of juvenile materials from mantle to lower crust, with a mixing of the old crust with juvenile magma. This compositional modification of the lower crust resembles the compositional transformation from the refractory lithospheric mantle to a fertile one through the refractory peridotite - infiltrated melt reaction as revealed in the lithospheric mantle beneath the NCC.

TI  - Absorption cross sections and correlation functions of the NH2 (A)over-tilde (2)A(1)-(X)over-tilde B-2(1) Renner-Teller system
VL  - 122
IS  - 23
AB  - We present a quantum-mechanical study of absorption cross sections and correlation functions of the title system, using a spinless Hamiltonian that includes the nonadiabatic Renner-Teller (RT) coupling between the electronic states, and taking into account the nuclear-spin statistics. We consider also the stimulated emission, assuming a Boltzmann distribution of the molecular levels, and we express correlation functions in terms of wave-packet (WP) overlaps. Assuming that the body-fixed z component of the angular momentum is a constant of motion of isolated NH2, we calculate (X) over tilde rotational and rovibrational, and (X) over tilde+(A) over tilde rovibronic cross sections and correlation functions at 4.2 and 300 K, up to 26 000 cm(-1) and 3000 fs. We also report the rotational spectrum at 3000 K. The number of absorbing states is large at high T, and the number of lines with appreciably intensity thus increases remarkably with T, from 67 at 4.2 K, to 847 at 300 K, and up to 10 609 at 3000 K. The cold spectrum consists only of Pi lines, due to ground-level absorption. At room and higher T, the hot spectrum presents long progressions of rovibronic lines. The strongest spectral intensities are X Pi and Phi rotational lines and (A) over tilde bending Sigma and Pi lines. We also find many Fermi resonances between (A) over tilde bending and combination states, and that similar to 50% of the lines belong to both electronic states. This latter result points out many RT couplings above 11 000 cm(-1). The theoretical intensities agree very well with the few available experimental data. The time evolution of the correlation functions reflects all internal motions, with periods ranging from similar to 750 to 2 fs, from slow rotational modes to ultrafast electronic dynamics. At low T, the correlation function is proportional to the survival probability of an initial WP, it has many recursions, and can be very regular, without decaying on the average. At high T, the correlation function is associated with the dynamics of many WPs, which present different dephasing times, and the dynamics thus becomes very irregular. The internal dynamics is nonadiabatic above 11 000 cm(-1), because the WPs move from the vertical to the linear region of the excited surface, and can jump to the ground surface owing to RT couplings.

TI  - The response of deltas to sea-level rise: Natural mechanisms and management options to adapt to high-end scenarios
VL  - 65
SP  - 122-130
AB  - The response of deltas to sea level rise (SLR) has mostly been studied from a perspective of human impacts like global warming and impoundment, or from a perspective of natural changes associated with glacial cycles. Here we synthesize the response of deltas to SLR by integrating research looking at past and future evolution to improve the potential to manage deltas to adapt to high rates of SLR. We hypothesize that fluvial-dominated deltas can be managed to survive high rates of SLR (>1 cm year(-1)) that characterized the post-glacial period and will likely characterize coming centuries due to global warming. There are three known mechanisms for deltas to cope with SLR that are self-reinforcing as the rates increase, tending to enhance the efficiency of the deltaic sedimentary trap: (a) an increase in the frequency of delta lobe switching with accelerated SLR leading to the formation of new lobes in shallow areas (b) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of flood events in the delta plain as a consequence of an increased crevassing through the river natural levees, leading to enhanced sediment deposition (c) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of overwash events in the delta fringe enhancing the ability of sandy beaches to adapt to SLR. The current view by much of the management community is that coastal protection is the best strategy for future SLR up to 2-5 m, and beyond 5 m that retreat would be the best (or the only) strategy. However, for the case of deltas a more functional adaptation strategy based on restoration can be envisioned provided that natural processes and ecosystem functions can be managed to increase system's resilience. The central element of this alternative strategy is the idea of "rising grounds" (vertical aggradation), instead of "rising dikes", but a combination of both can also be foreseen and may be needed in many cases. This means that "rising dikes" will be only feasible if "rising grounds" is also implemented; if not, retreat will be the only long-term alternative. We propose that "rising grounds" is the best adaptation strategy inmost deltas for high-end scenarios of SLR, though in some cases the option of retreating may be necessary in combination with structural and functional measures.

TI  - Hibernation Conditions Contribute to the Differential Resistance to Cadmium between Urban and Forest Ant Colonies
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
AB  - Simple Summary The resistance of organisms to trace metals can have a genetic or a plastic origin. Indeed, differential environmental conditions experienced before the exposure to trace metals could physiologically condition organisms and plastically enhance their subsequent resistance to trace metals. In this study on the ant Temnothorax nylanderi, we investigated whether the better cadmium resistance of urban colonies relative to forest colonies could originate from the distinct hibernation conditions that they experienced prior to cadmium exposure. We compared the ability of urban and forest colonies to resist cadmium depending on whether they had hibernated in their respective urban or forest habitats or under a laboratory common garden setup. We found that urban colonies resisted cadmium better than forest colonies when they had hibernated under a common garden. Surprisingly, this difference was not observed between urban and forest colonies that had hibernated in the field, in contrast with a previous study. One reason may be that winter was particularly mild on the year of our experiment. Our results therefore support the idea that urban colonies are genetically adapted to resist trace metals, but that this adaptation is only revealed under specific environmental conditions. Trace metals such as cadmium are found in high concentrations in urban environments. Animal and plant populations living in heavily contaminated environments could adapt to trace metals exposure. A recent study shows that urban populations of the acorn ant Temnothorax nylanderi are more resistant to cadmium than their forest counterparts. However, this study was performed using field colonies that had just come out of hibernation. Because urban and forest hibernation environments differ, the differential resistance to trace metals may originate either from differential hibernation conditions or from a different resistance baseline to cadmium. In this study, we tested these two hypotheses using laboratory common garden hibernation conditions. We let urban and forest colonies of the ant T. nylanderi hibernate under the same laboratory conditions for four months. After this hibernation period, we also collected field-hibernating colonies and we compared cadmium resistance between urban and forest colonies depending on the hibernation condition. We found a differential response to cadmium under common garden, with urban colonies displaying less larval mortality and lower size reduction of the produced individuals. This suggests a different resistance baseline of urban colonies to cadmium. However, unexpectedly, we did not detect the differential response between urban and forest colonies in the field, suggesting a more complex scenario involving both genetic and environmental influences.

TI  - KOH/urea pretreatment of bagasse for ethanol production without black liquor or wastewater generation
VL  - 178
AB  - Alkaline pretreatment is a simple and effective method for removing lignin at low temperatures and normal pressure, but this process consumes large amounts of water and produces wastewater, both of which limit its industrial applications. To develop a process with zero discharge of black liquor and wastewater, in this study, KOH/urea-treated bagasse was directly subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis without detoxification or washing after adjusting the pH. Adaptive Laboratory Evolved (ALE) Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y2034, which can endure threefold diluted black liquor, was obtained. The results showed that SCB treated with 1.5% KOH/urea (1.5% KOH/ 1.5% urea) for 4 h could be directly enzymatically hydrolyzed and fermented. The enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and ethanol yield reached 89.9% and 97%, respectively. The cellulosic ethanol production method developed in this research provides a possibility for industrial application.

TI  - Genetically based adaptive trait shifts at an expanding mangrove range margin
VL  - 849
IS  - 8
SP  - 1777-1794
AB  - Neotropical black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) is expanding poleward into temperate salt marsh along Atlantic Florida, USA, with field evidence of trait shifts consistent with greater cold tolerance within range margin populations. However, whether these shifts have a genetic basis remains unanswered. To address this gap, we measured multiple phenotypic traits of twenty A. germinans maternal cohorts from areas in both the Atlantic Florida range core and margin in a 2-year greenhouse common garden with annual temperatures analogous to range margin conditions. Compared to those from the range core, range margin cohorts survived in greater numbers, established (i.e., produced first true leaves) more quickly, and were less stressed under winter temperatures. Range margin cohorts were not taller, but invested more into lateral growth and biomass accumulation that presumably reflects adaptation to their colder and open-canopy environment. Range margin cohorts also exhibited leaf traits consistent with greater resource acquisition that may compensate for a shorter growing season and reduced light quality at higher latitude. Our results suggest that genetically based phenotypic differences better enable these range margin mangroves to thrive within their stressful environment and may facilitate further poleward expansion. An improved understanding of adaptive trait variation within ecologically important mangrove foundation species should also help inform coastal restoration initiatives.

TI  - Declining amphibians might be evolving increased reproductive effort in the face of devastating disease
VL  - 75
IS  - 10
SP  - 2555-2567
AB  - The devastating infectious disease chytridiomycosis has caused declines of amphibians across the globe, yet some populations are persisting and even recovering. One understudied effect of wildlife disease is changes in reproductive effort. Here, we aimed to understand if the disease has plastic effects on reproduction and if reproductive effort could evolve with disease endemism. We compared the effects of experimental pathogen exposure (trait plasticity) and population-level disease history (evolution in trait baseline) on reproductive effort using gametogenesis as a proxy in the declining and endangered frog Litoria verreauxii alpina. We found that unexposed males from disease-endemic populations had higher reproductive effort, which is consistent with an evolutionary response to chytridiomycosis. We also found evidence of trait plasticity, where males and females were affected differently by infection: pathogen exposed males had higher reproductive effort (larger testes), whereas females had reduced reproductive effort (smaller and fewer developed eggs) regardless of the population of origin. Infectious diseases can cause plastic changes in the reproductive effort at an individual level, and population-level disease exposure can result in changes to baseline reproductive effort; therefore, individual- and population-level effects of disease should be considered when designing management and conservation programs for threatened and declining species.

TI  - Ammonia emission from staple crops in China as response to mitigation strategies and agronomic conditions: Meta-analytic study
VL  - 279
AB  - Numerous strategies for mitigating ammonia volatilization (AV) from agricultural land have been investigated with limited evaluation of their efficacy and response to differing field conditions across China. Therefore, this meta-analysis seeks to draw conclusions about AV in China, and assess the effect of crop type (wheat, maize, and rice as staple crops), climatic conditions, and soil properties on AV and variations in responses that can guide selection of appropriate strategies under different conditions. Novel analysis indicates nitrogen (NH3-N) losses of 7.62 Tg due to AV from these three crops in China. AV is 12.8 and 18.0% (95% CI) higher from maize than from wheat and rice, respectively, without N application under warm and sub-humid conditions (MM), and 13.8 and 2.8% higher under hot and humid conditions (HH). AV increases notably under HH as compared with cold and sub-arid conditions (LL) by 11.5% and 28.4% under the control treatment and application of 150 kg N ha(-1), respectively in rice fields while it is most substantially under maize (52.5%) with application of 150 kg N ha(-1). The ratio of change in AV between soil grades 3 and 1 (potential AV 1.0 and < 0 cmol kg(-1)) is significantly greater for wheat and rice (2.5%) than for maize (1.9%). The strategy of reducing N rate is more effective for maize and rice than wheat, where applying N at a rate of 150-220 kg N ha(-1) to them has similar effects to applying 300 kg N ha(-1) to wheat. For wheat and maize, urea should be partially substituted with organic amendments, while improved urea is the preferable N source for rice. Subsurface application has competitive efficacy, especially for maize, and higher N rates. Applying inhibitors achieves the highest AV reduction, especially with rice under various conditions, creating more actively options for future research to increase applicability.

TI  - SUSCEPTIBILITY OF WINE GRAPES TO DROSOPHILA SUZUKII - A THREE YEAR FIELD AND LABORATORY STUDY IN AUSTRIA
VL  - 70
IS  - 3
SP  - 219-232
AB  - The infestation dynamics of Drosophila suzukii in vineyards and the vulnerability of a wide range of grapevine varieties to this pest in Austria were studied in field and laboratory studies. Oviposition of D. suzukii in the field was investigated on 19 vine varieties at two locations from calendar weeks 33 to 42 in the years 2015 to 2017. The field studies were complemented by laboratory no-choice and free-choice oviposition experiments. In the field in 2015 virtually no oviposition was recorded, in 2016 and 2017 oviposition was detected from calender week 36 and 37 onwards. Significant differences between varieties in regard to oviposition were noticed, 'Blauer Portugieser, 'Fruhroter Veltliner' and 'St. Laurent' were the most sensitive ones and their vulnerability increased with progressed ripening. Medium susceptibility was recorded for 'Zweigelt' ('Rotburger') and 'Roesler. No or almost no eggs were recorded on berries of 'Cabernet Sauvignon', 'Pinot Gris', 'Roter Veltliner, 'Blaufrankisch', 'Blauer Wildbacher', 'Pinot noir', 'Syrah', 'Cabernet franc', 'Chardonnay', 'Gruner Veltliner' and Welschriesling'. In laboratory no-choice experiments with visually undamaged berries the flies penetrated the skins of all 12 varieties in the test already from calendar week 33 and 34. Selection behavior in laboratory free-choice experiments confirmed the field results as the flies laid significantly more eggs on 'Fruhroter Veltliner', 'St. Laurent', 'Blauer Portugieser' and sometimes also on 'Zweigelt' ('Rotburger'). All in all the data indicate that in cooler wine producing areas such as Austria and the neighboring countries D. suzukii poses a threat to vulnerable varieties in unfavorable years.

TI  - Sex biased expression of anti-Mullerian hormone (amh) gene in a live bearing fish, Gambusia holbrooki: Evolutionary implications and potential role in sex differentiation
VL  - 231
SP  - 59-66
AB  - The amh, a member of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, is known to play a critical role in vertebrate male sex differentiation, with its paralogue/s evolving to determine sex in few heterogametic (XX/XY) teleosts. However, it remains relatively unexplored in the reproductively unique live bearing teleosts. Therefore, this study comparatively examined the structure and content of G. holbrooki amh as well as characterised its expression. A paralogous Y-specific antis (amhy) was not detected, suggesting an unlikely role in sex determination. Two transcripts (1.4 and 1.5 kb) were detected in adults: the larger (1.5 kb) retaining intron 5, coding for a truncated AMH-N and no TGF-beta domain. The small (1.4 kb) transcript, had both domains intact and clustered with members of Poeciliidae. In contrast to other vertebrates, a higher conservation between the N- rather than the C- terminus of amh in Poeciliidae was observed, suggesting an adaptation that may be unique to live bearing teleosts. The amh expression was 6 times higher in brain of both sexes and testis compared with ovaries (p = .001). Intriguingly, female splenic tissues showed 10 times higher expression (p = .006) and such female bias splenic expression has not been reported in any teleosts. Ontogenic expression was 25 times higher in male embryos at gastrulation stage (p = .001), much earlier than those reported in egg-laying teleosts. Such heightened expression in male embryos suggests a repressive role associated with proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) that are known to occur earlier at blastulation in teleosts potentially influencing gonadal fate.

TI  - The evolution of phenotypic plasticity when environments fluctuate in time and space
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 15-27
AB  - Most theoretical studies have explored the evolution of plasticity when the environment, and therefore the optimal trait value, varies in time or space. When the environment varies in time and space, we show that genetic adaptation to Markovian temporal fluctuations depends on the between-generation autocorrelation in the environment in exactly the same way that genetic adaptation to spatial fluctuations depends on the probability of philopatry. This is because both measure the correlation in parent-offspring environments and therefore the effectiveness of a genetic response to selection. If the capacity to genetically respond to selection is stronger in one dimension (e.g., space), then plasticity mainly evolves in response to fluctuations in the other dimension (e.g., time). If the relationships between the environments of development and selection are the same in time and space, the evolved plastic response to temporal fluctuations is useful in a spatial context and genetic differentiation in space is reduced. However, if the relationships between the environments of development and selection are different, the optimal level of plasticity is different in the two dimensions. In this case, the plastic response that evolves to cope with temporal fluctuations may actually be maladaptive in space, resulting in the evolution of hyperplasticity or negative plasticity. These effects can be mitigated by spatial genetic differentiation that acts in opposition to plasticity resulting in counter-gradient variation. These results highlight the difficulty of making space-for-time substitutions in empirical work but identify the key parameters that need to be measured in order to test whether space-for-time substitutions are likely to bevalid.

TI  - Understanding the role of DNA methylation in successful biological invasions: a review
VL  - 20
IS  - 9
SP  - 2285-2300
AB  - Biological invasions provide a unique opportunity to investigate rapid adaptation and evolution as the introduced taxa adapt to biogeographic contexts or habitats in which they have not evolved. The capacity of populations to evolve is generally thought to be constrained by their existing heritable genetic variation, which is usually associated with variation in genomic DNA nucleotide sequences. However, there is increasing acceptance that a range of mechanisms-collectively termed 'epigenetics' can alter gene function and affect ecologically important traits. Epigenetic processes may mediate adaptive phenotypic plasticity and provide heritable variation on a finer timescale than DNA sequence-based mutations. This review focuses on DNA methylation, a well-studied epigenetic mechanism known to be associated with biological adaptation to environmental stress. We explore the role of DNA methylation in characterising the adaptive potential of invasive species. We also provide an overview of studies focused on DNA methylation and invasive species to date, and identify knowledge gaps and potential ways to advance understanding of epigenetic-based adaptation. A summary of the literature suggests that DNA methylation could play a key role in the success of invasive species. Introduced populations with reduced genetic diversity often display increased DNA methylation variation in comparison with native populations, which could create phenotypic diversity when it is most required. Recent data show that DNA methylation could contribute to adaptation through both phenotypic plasticity and heritable variation, particularly through clonal reproduction. From a methodological perspective, recent advances in molecular techniques provide an exciting opportunity to explore the functional relevance of DNA methylation to successful biological invasions. Gaining a greater understanding of the adaptive and evolutionary processes that contribute to invasion success is critical for preventing and managing the future introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species.

TI  - Assessment of Semen Quality among Workers Exposed to Heat Stress: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Steel Industry
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SP  - 232-235
AB  - Background: This study was conducted to investigate the heat stress and semen quality among male workers in a steel industry in Iran and investigate the relationship between heat stress indices and semen parameters. Methods: The study was conducted on workers exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 14) to heat in a steel industry. After obtaining a brief biography of the selected employees, scrotal temperature, oral temperature, and environmental parameters were measured, and their semen samples were analyzed according to the procedure recommended by the World Health Organization. The heat stress indices, including wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and predicted heat strain (PHS), in their workplace were calculated according to environmental parameters (ISO 7243:1989 and 7933:2004, respectively). Results: Time-weighted averages of WBGT and PHS (35.76 degrees C and 491.56 w/m(2) w/m(2), respectively) for the exposed group were higher than threshold limit values. The mean difference of environmental, physiological, and semen parameters (exception: pH of semen), and also WBGT and PHS indices were statistically significant (p < 0.05) between the two groups. Mean semen parameters were in the normozoospermic range. WBGT and PHS indices showed significantly "negative" correlation with physiological parameters (scrotal and oral temperature) and most semen parameters (semen volume, sperm morphology, sperm motility, sperm count; p < 0.05); moreover, the correlation of WBGT with these parameters was stronger than PHS. Conclusion: Semen parameters of the studied workers exposed to heat were in the borderline level of normozoospermic range, and their semen parameters were significantly lower than controls. For better assessment of occupational environment concerning physiological and semen parameters in steel industries, WBGT can be a more useful index.

TI  - Modelling of transport processes in concrete exposed to elevated temperatures - An alternative formulation for sorption isotherms
VL  - 106
SP  - 144-154
AB  - There is a significant need to understand, analyse and assess moisture transport in cementitious materials exposed to elevated temperatures in order to confidently predict the behaviour and ultimately the development of damage in safety critical applications such as nuclear reactor vessels, structures exposed to fire and well bore grouts. In view of this need a rigorous and robust formulation to describe water retention curves (sorption isotherms) as a function of temperature based on the evolution of physical parameters is presented. The model formulation is successfully validated against independent sets of experimental data up to temperatures of 80 degrees C. It is then further validated under isothermal drying conditions and then high temperature conditions through the numerical reproduction of laboratory experiments following implementation in a fully coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical finite element model. The new formulation is found to work well under a variety of conditions in a variety of cementitious material types.

TI  - A novel sperm adaptation to evolutionary constraints on reproduction: Pre-ejaculatory sperm activation in the beach spawning capelin (Osmeridae)
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 2343-2349
AB  - Reproduction of external fertilizing vertebrates is typically constrained to either fresh or salt water, not both. For all studied amphibians and fishes, this constraint includes immotile sperm that are activated after ejaculation only by the specific chemistry of the fertilizing medium in which the species evolved (fresh, brackish, or salt water). No amphibians can reproduce in the sea. Although diadromous fishes may migrate between salt and fresh water, they are shackled to their natal environment for spawning in part because of sperm activation. Here, we report for the first time among all documented external fertilizing vertebrates, that in the absence of any external media, sperm are motile at ejaculation in a marine spawning fish (Osmeridae, capelin, Mallotus villosus). To illuminate why, we evaluated sperm behavior at different salinities in M.villosus as well as the related freshwater spawning anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). Surprisingly, sperm performance was superior in fresh water for both species. M.villosus spend their entire life at sea but our results show that their sperm are deactivated by sea water, suggesting a freshwater ancestry. By circumventing constraining water chemistry, we interpret the unique pre-ejaculatory sperm activation in this species as a novel adaptation that enables fertilization in the marine environment. These findings also contribute to understanding the persistence of anadromy, despite great energetic costs to adult fishes.

VL  - 246
IS  - 11
SP  - 827-837
AB  - Background: Hatching is modulated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Annual killifish are adapted to complete their entire life cycle in annually desiccating habitats. Spending most of their life in the embryonic stage, they have evolved adaptations to survive desiccated conditions and match their hatching with the unpredictable onset of the aquatic phase of the pool. We examined spatial and temporal synchrony of hatching in natural populations of four species of African annual killifish (genus Nothobranchius). We compared differences and variability in hatching dates among years, regions, pools, and species and matched them with data on inundations of individual pools. Results: Inundations typically coincided with peak rainfall in early January. We found considerable spatial and temporal synchrony in 1 year, but less synchrony in the other 2 years. Hatching generally occurred 0-20 days after inundation; fish at most sites hatched synchronously (<1 week) but some sites showed protracted hatching or two age cohorts. One species tended to hatch earlier than the other three. Conclusions: We suggest that hatching of annual killifish in the wild is a result of the interplay between environmental conditions and individual predisposition to respond to threshold environmental cues, ensuring effective bet-hedging against unpredictable inundation.

TI  - Salinity-induced phenotypic plasticity in threespine stickleback sperm activation
VL  - 13
IS  - 10
AB  - Phenotypic expression may be and often is influenced by an organism's developmental environment, referred to as phenotypic plasticity. The sperm cells of teleosts have been found to be inactive in the seminal plasma and are activated by osmotic shock for most fish species, through release in either hypertonic (for marine fish) or hypotonic (for freshwater fish) water. If this is the case, the regulatory system of sperm mobility should be reversed in salt-and freshwater fish. We tested this hypothesis by first activating sperm of salt-and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback in salt-and freshwater. The sperm from saltwater stickleback could be activated in either salinity, which matches the freshwater colonization history of the species, whereas the sperm from the freshwater population acted as predicted by the osmotic shock theory and was activated in freshwater only. As the freshwater population used here was calculated to be thousands of years old, we went on to test whether the trait(s) were plastic and sperm from freshwater males still could be activated in saltwater after individuals were exposed to saltwater. After raising freshwater stickleback in saltwater, we found the mature males to have active sperm in both saltwater and freshwater. Further, we also found the sperm of wild-caught freshwater stickleback to be active in saltwater after exposing those mature males to saltwater for only 2 days. This illustrates that the ability for stickleback sperm to be activated in a range of water qualities is an environmentally induced plastic trait.

TI  - Parallel adaptive evolution of geographically distant herring populations on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean
VL  - 114
IS  - 17
SP  - E3452-E3461
AB  - Atlantic herring is an excellent species for studying the genetic basis of adaptation in geographically distant populations because of its characteristically large population sizes and low genetic drift. In this study we compared whole-genome resequencing data of Atlantic herring populations from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. An important finding was the very low degree of genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations (fixation index = 0.026), suggesting lack of reproductive isolation across the ocean. This feature of the Atlantic herring facilitates the detection of genetic factors affecting adaptation because of the sharp contrast between loci showing genetic differentiation resulting from natural selection and the low background noise resulting from genetic drift. We show that genetic factors associated with timing of reproduction are shared between genetically distinct and geographically distant populations. The genes for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), the SOX11 transcription factor (SOX11), calmodulin (CALM), and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2A), all with a significant role in reproductive biology, were among the loci that showed the most consistent association with spawning time throughout the species range. In fact, the same two SNPs located at the 5' end of TSHR showed the most significant association with spawning time in both the east and west Atlantic. We also identified unexpected haplotype sharing between spring-spawning oceanic herring and autumn-spawning populations across the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The genomic regions showing this pattern are unlikely to control spawning time but may be involved in adaptation to ecological factor(s) shared among these populations.

TI  - Experimental and Numerical Study on Sensible Heat Transfer at Droplet/Wall Interactions
SP  - 304-311
AB  - The present study addresses a detailed experimental and numerical investigation on the impact of water droplets on smooth heated surfaces. High-speed infrared thermography is combined with high-speed imaging to couple the heat transfer and fluid dynamic processes occurring at droplet impact. Droplet spreading (e.g. spreading ratio) and detailed surface temperature fields are then evaluated in time and compared with the numerically predicted results. The numerical reproduction of the phenomena was conducted using an enhanced version of a VOF-based solver of OpenFOAM previously developed, which was further modified to account for conjugate heat transfer between the solid and fluid domains, focusing only on the sensible heat removed during droplet spreading. An excellent agreement is observed between the temporal evolution of the experimentally measured and the numerically predicted spreading factors (differences between the experimental and numerical values were always lower than 3.4%). The numerical and experimental dimensionless surface temperature profiles along the droplet radius were also in good agreement, depicting a maximum difference of 0.19. Deeper analysis coupling fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes was also performed, evidencing a strong correlation between maximum and minimum temperature values and heat transfer coefficients with the vorticity fields in the lamella, which lead to particular mixing processes in the boundary layer region. The correlation between the resulted temperature fields and the droplet dynamics was obtained by assuming a relation between the vorticity and the local heat transfer coefficient, in the first fluid cell i.e. near the liquid-solid interface. The two measured fields revealed that local maxima and minima in the vorticity corresponded to spatially shifted local minima and maxima in the heat transfer coefficient, at all stages of the droplet spreading. This was particularly clear in the rim region, which therefore should be considered in future droplet spreading models.

TI  - Contributions of genetic and environmental variance in early development of the Antarctic sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri in response to increased ocean temperature and acidification
VL  - 163
IS  - 6
AB  - Breeding designs such as the North Carolina II can be used to identify the sources of genetic and environmental variances in embryo performance. Here this approach is used for the Antarctic sea urchin S. neumayeri to explore how the contribution of sire and dam can influence the performance of cleavage stage embryos and blastulae, and how these contributions differ when exposed to stress from increased temperature and acidification. The interrelationship of sire-dam effects was also compared across developmental stages. The effects of warming (+3 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3 and -0.5 pHT units) on 24 sire-dam crosses were investigated. These stressors decreased cleavage success and the percentage of normal blastulae, with a negative interactive effect between stressors. The response to these factors differed among the sire-dam pairs indicating the influence of gamete compatibility. A positive genetic correlation indicated that genotypes that performed well as blastulae in low pH also performed well at increased temperatures. Performance at cleavage was a good predictor of performance at the later blastula stage. Significant dam by temperature interactions indicated differential performance among maternal half-siblings in response to increased temperature. Adaptation depends on additive genetic variance for stress tolerance being present in populations; however, there were no sire by stressor interactions found. This indicates that S. neumayeri will need to rely on phenotypic plasticity to persist through an ocean decreasing in pH and warming, at least with respect to early development.

VL  - 16
IS  - 3
SP  - 794-808
AB  - The sea urchin Arbacia lixula is a keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems that drive landscape changes in littoral communities. However, genomic information available for the whole order Arbacioida is very limited. Using RNA-seq techniques, we have characterized the transcriptome of four different tissue types in A.lixula: the somatic' tissues (coelomocytes and digestive tissue) and the reproductive' tissues (ovary and testis), from two replicated cDNA libraries for each sample. Additionally, we performed a de novo assembly to build the reference' transcriptome, pooling reads of the four tissues, to analyse the differential expression (DE) in pairwise comparisons between tissues. The complete de novo assembly yielded 186084 transcripts, with a sequence size limit of 100nt, being 31% of them spliced isoforms. Approximately 21% of the transcripts had blast hits against proteins of metazoans (E<10(-5)), being less than 2.2% functionally annotated. Between coelomocytes and digestive, 30794 transcripts showed DE (similar to 11.8% of them with blast hit), and 19567 transcripts did so between testis and ovary (similar to 28.5% of them with blast hit). Major GO-term categories upregulated in somatic tissues were those related to muscle contraction and energy generation in digestive, and lipid metabolism associated with immune response in coelomocytes. Between reproductive tissues, the major upregulated GO categories were related to energy generation in testis, and negative regulation of nucleotide metabolism in ovary. We particularly screened for a collection of target genes in each tissue because of their relevance for further studies on evolution and adaptation of echinoids.

TI  - An information-theoretic approach to estimating the composite genetic effects contributing to variation among generation means: Moving beyond the joint-scaling test for line cross analysis
VL  - 70
IS  - 2
SP  - 420-432
AB  - The pace and direction of evolution in response to selection, drift, and mutation are governed by the genetic architecture that underlies trait variation. Consequently, much of evolutionary theory is predicated on assumptions about whether genes can be considered to act in isolation, or in the context of their genetic background. Evolutionary biologists have disagreed, sometimes heatedly, over which assumptions best describe evolution in nature. Methods for estimating genetic architectures that favor simpler (i.e., additive) models contribute to this debate. Here we address one important source of bias, model selection in line cross analysis (LCA). LCA estimates genetic parameters conditional on the best model chosen from a vast model space using relatively few line means. Current LCA approaches often favor simple models and ignore uncertainty in model choice. To address these issues we introduce Software for Analysis of Genetic Architecture (SAGA), which comprehensively assesses the potential model space, quantifies model selection uncertainty, and uses model weighted averaging to accurately estimate composite genetic effects. Using simulated data and previously published LCA studies, we demonstrate the utility of SAGA to more accurately define the components of complex genetic architectures, and show that traditional approaches have underestimated the importance of epistasis.

AB  - Climate change is modifying the environmental conditions in all the vineyards across the world. The expected effects on grape and wine production can be positive in some grape growing regions, but under warmer or dryer conditions the volume and quality of the wines produced can be impaired. Adaptation to new climatic conditions includes changes in the cultivation areas, changes in the vineyard or cellar practices, and use of new rootstock x scion combinations. In this article, we provide an overview of the possible effects of climate change on grapevine physiology and berry quality and we describe the more important traits and the genetic variability that can be used in the adaptation process. We also present the modern techniques that can be used by researchers to identify the links between genomic information and behaviors in the field. Finally, we discuss the existing opportunities in the present grapevine collections and the strategies that can be used by breeders to create new varieties.

TI  - Rotifers in Lake Orta: a potential ecological and evolutionary model system
VL  - 75
SP  - 67-75
AB  - Lake Orta experienced for a few decades a unique history of chronic pollution, with extreme changes in pH and copper concentration. Currently, the lake has recovered to its almost pristine oligotrophic conditions, but its sediments still preserve the record of all the changes that happened since the establishment of the first polluting factories in the 1920s, through to the liming activities in 19891990, and to the recovery phase that is still going on. Here we review the current knowledge for Lake Orta regarding rotifers, a diverse component of the zooplankton of the lake, through studies on living organisms and on their resting stages accumulated in the sediments. We also report a brief review of what is known in general on the effects of changes in pH and copper concentration on rotifers at the population, species and community level, providing expectations for such effects on the rotifers of Lake Orta. Then, we conclude our review with a perspective on the potential use of rotifers hatched from the resting stages in the sediment of Lake Orta with the description of experiments that can be performed in the future in the framework of resurrection ecology, in order to understand the mechanisms of past and future changes in the environment.

TI  - Characterizing a hybrid zone between a cryptic species pair of freshwater snails
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 643-655
AB  - Characterizing hybrid zones and their dynamics is a central goal in evolutionary biology, but this is particularly challenging for morphologically cryptic species. The lack of conspicuous divergence between parental types means intermediate hybrid forms often go undetected. We aimed to detect and characterize a suspected hybrid zone between a pair of morphologically cryptic lineages of the freshwater snail, Radix. We sampled Radix from across a contact zone between two mitochondrial lineages (Radixbalthica and an undescribed lineage termed MOTU3') and detected admixture between two nuclear genotype clusters, which were significantly but not categorically associated with the mitochondrial lineages. Using a model selection approach, we show that the admixture cline is best explained by an interaction between precipitation and temperature gradients over the area, rather than geographic distance. We thus hypothesize that the correlation with climatic gradients suggests environmental selection has played a role in maintaining the hybrid zone. In a 2050 climate change scenario, we furthermore predict an expansion of one of the nuclear clusters and a widening of the hybrid zone as the climate warms and dries.

TI  - Lack of genetic divergence in capelin (Mallotus villosus) spawning at beach versus subtidal habitats in coastal embayments of Newfoundland
VL  - 92
IS  - 5
SP  - 377-382
AB  - Capelin (Mallotus villosus (Muller, 1776)), a focal forage fish in the north Atlantic, spawn on both beach and demersal (deep-water) sites throughout their circumpolar distribution. Although these habitats rarely occur in close proximity, demersal spawning sites within 4 km of beach spawning sites (subtidal) have recently been discovered in two coastal embayments in Newfoundland, Canada. The physical environment differs considerably between beach and subtidal spawning sites, creating the potential for local adaptation and genetic divergence of capelin from the two habitats, but this has never been investigated on a fine spatial scale. Weuse eight microsatellite loci to test for genetic divergence between capelin spawning at beach and subtidal sites within these two coastal regions in Newfoundland. Wefound no genetic differentiation between fish spawning at beach and subtidal sites or between the two regions. The results from this fine-scale study are in agreement with the lack of habitat-based structure reported in other studies examining beach and demersal sites separated by a larger geographic area. We suggest that instead of showing site fidelity and local adaptation, the facultative use of alternate spawning habitats may be a more successful strategy in an unpredictable environment.

TI  - A mechanistic model for baking of unleavened aerated food
VL  - 53

SP  - 146-155
AB  - A mechanistic model for baking of unleavened aerated food is proposed. The aerated food was assumed to consist initially of uniformly distributed same sized bubbles. The liquid medium was assumed to be Newtonian. Bubble coalescence, nucleation of bubbles and formation of interconnected channels were neglected. Unsteady state heat conduction and moisture diffusion equations were solved to obtain the evolution of temperature, moisture and air volume fraction profiles as well as cake rise. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, the height of aerated food was found to increase with time, reach a maximum and decreased at longer times. The cake rise was found to be faster and larger at higher oven temperatures and for aerated food of higher initial air fraction and larger sugar content. The model predictions of cake rise agreed fairly well with the experimental data of Pernell, Luck, Foegeding, & Daubert, 2002 for fitted initial air volume fractions with the agreement being better at longer times for decreasing air volume fractions. The calculated air volume fraction profiles indicated an expanded inner region of more or less uniform density and a denser surface crust region whose thickness increased with baking time.

AB  - Adaptive developmental plasticity can enable an organism to modify its phenotype rapidly, in response to local (and perhaps, unpredictable) conditions, by altering reaction norms during development. Previous studies on this topic have been dominated by western scientists, employing western study systems and approaches. Recently, the expansion of Chinese ecological research has seen a broadening of studies taxonomically (phylogenetically). Here, we briefly summarize research that has been conducted on developmental plasticity in Chinese reptiles over the past two decades, and suggest productive directions for future studies in this field. There are exciting research opportunities in this field in China, and we call for increased collaboration between western and eastern scientists to elucidate the role of developmental plasticity in evolutionary responses of organisms to environmental changes. As human activities increase the intensity and frequency of such changes, the need to understand responses of biological systems becomes an increasingly urgent priority.

TI  - Polygenic Sex Determination System in Zebrafish
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
AB  - Background: Despite the popularity of zebrafish as a research model, its sex determination (SD) mechanism is still unknown. Most cytogenetic studies failed to find dimorphic sex chromosomes and no primary sex determining switch has been identified even though the assembly of zebrafish genome sequence is near to completion and a high resolution genetic map is available. Recent publications suggest that environmental factors within the natural range have minimal impact on sex ratios of zebrafish populations. The primary aim of this study is to find out more about how sex is determined in zebrafish. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using classical breeding experiments, we found that sex ratios across families were wide ranging (4.8% to 97.3% males). On the other hand, repeated single pair crossings produced broods of very similar sex ratios, indicating that parental genotypes have a role in the sex ratio of the offspring. Variation among family sex ratios was reduced after selection for breeding pairs with predominantly male or female offspring, another indication that zebrafish sex is regulated genetically. Further examinations by a PCR-based "blind assay" and array comparative genomic hybridization both failed to find universal sex-linked differences between the male and female genomes. Together with the ability to increase the sex bias of lines by selective breeding, these data suggest that zebrafish is unlikely to utilize a chromosomal sex determination (CSD) system. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our study suggests that zebrafish sex is genetically determined with limited, secondary influences from the environment. As we have not found any sign for CSD in the species, we propose that the zebrafish has a polygenic sex determination system.

TI  - Mating system shifts on the trailing edge
VL  - 109
IS  - 3
SP  - 613-620
AB  - The trailing edges of species ranges are becoming a subject of increasing interest as the environment changes due to global warming. Trailing edge populations are likely to face extinction because of a decline in numbers and an inability to evolve new adaptations with sufficient speed. Discussions of character change in the trailing edge have focused on physiological, exomorphic and phenological traits. The mating pattern within populations has not been part of the discourse, in spite of the fact that the mating pattern may affect the ability of populations to respond to environmental change and to maintain their sizes. In this paper, the case is made that a substantial increase in self-fertilization rates may occur via plastic responses to stress. Small populations on the trailing edge are especially vulnerable to environmental change because of inadequate levels of cross-fertilization. Evidence is presented that a deficiency of cross-seed production is due to inadequate pollinator services and a paucity of self-incompatibility alleles within populations. Evidence also is presented that if plants are self-compatible, self-fertilization may compensate in part for this deficiency through a stress-induced increase in levels of self-compatibility and stress-induced alterations in floral morphology that elevate self-pollination. Whereas increased self-fertility may afford populations the time to adapt to their changing environments, it can be concluded that increased selfing is not a panacea for the ills of environmental change, because it will lead to substantial reductions in genetic diversity, which may render adaptation unlikely.

TI  - Scanning the genome for gene SNPs related to climate adaptation and estimating selection at the molecular level in boreal black spruce
VL  - 20
IS  - 8
SP  - 1702-1716
AB  - Outlier detection methods were used to scan the genome of the boreal conifer black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) for gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially involved in adaptations to temperature and precipitation variations. The scan involved 583 SNPs from 313 genes potentially playing adaptive roles. Differentiation estimates among population groups defined following variation in temperature and precipitation were moderately high for adaptive quantitative characters such as the timing of budset or tree height (Q(ST) = 0.189-0.314). Average differentiation estimates for gene SNPs were null, with F-ST values of 0.005 and 0.006, respectively, among temperature and precipitation population groups. Using two detection approaches, a total of 26 SNPs from 25 genes distributed among 11 of the 12 linkage groups of black spruce were detected as outliers with F-ST as high as 0.078. Nearly half of the outlier SNPs were located in exons and half of those were nonsynonymous. The functional annotations of genes carrying outlier SNPs and regression analyses between the frequencies of these SNPs and climatic variables supported their implication in adaptive processes. Several genes carrying outlier SNPs belonged to gene families previously found to harbour outlier SNPs in a reproductively isolated but largely sympatric congeneric species, suggesting differential subfunctionalization of gene duplicates. Selection coefficient estimates (S) were moderate but well above the magnitude of drift (>> 1/N-e), indicating that the signature of natural selection could be detected at the nucleotide level despite the recent establishment of these populations during the Holocene.

VL  - 6
SP  - 180-193
AB  - This study examined the mass loss and CO2 production from Pinus patula (Schlecht et Cham) leaf litter collected from fertilized plots in the Mpumalanga Province. Litter decomposition increased with increasing temperature. Warming between 15 and 18 degrees C significantly increased the amount of CO2 emissions from the litter. Mass loss positively correlated with temperature levels. Nitrogen fertilizer applications had significant effects on litter decomposition rate but a minor effect on litter nitrogen quality. Litter quality was not a strong predictor of decomposition rates implying temperature is the major factor influencing the decomposition rate of Pinus patula needle litter. Results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of nutrient cycling in non-limiting environments will increase, due primarily to an increase in litter decomposition as a result of increased temperatures.

TI  - One function of sex - an empirical study of genetic and ecological variation
VL  - 142
IS  - 6
SP  - 601-628
AB  - The question "why sex?" is a longstanding fundamental puzzle in biology. Although there may be several answers, no satisfactory theory has emerged. We present an argument in favour of one function of sex, derived from a study of the population genetics and ecology of the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), on three continents between 1984 and 2009, and from previously published studies of other organisms. We provide evidence that responsiveness to directional selection (RDS), a measure related to "narrow-sense heritability", can be dramatically reduced by truncation selection in a single generation and rapidly restored within a few generations. Viewing a population as a collection of sexual families, we show that rapid restoration of RDS after truncation selection is essential to maintain population variance. The only known mechanism that will rapidly restore RDS is sexual recombination. We therefore conclude that in P. rapae, sex restores the genetic variation that a population needs to match unpredictable environmental variation, despite selection tending to reduce that genetic variation.

VL  - 709
IS  - 2
SP  - 1042-1066
AB  - We have carried out long-term (14 years) V and R photometric monitoring of 12 carbon-rich proto-planetary nebulae. The light and color curves display variability in all of them. The light curves are complex and suggest multiple periods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to pulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in the range of similar to 150 days for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 days for the warmest (F3). A clear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the pulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse relationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective temperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) star evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published spectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to have cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that intensive mass loss ended 400-2000 years ago. The detection of periods as long as 150 days in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution models that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume that intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100 days. This revision will have the effect of extending the timescale for the early phases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the pulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the timescale of two or three decades.

TI  - Evolution of insect-plant relationships: chemical constraints, coadaptation, and concordance of insect/plant traits
VL  - 104
IS  - 1
SP  - 217-235
AB  - Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades. Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.

VL  - 239
IS  - 1
SP  - 125-156
AB  - This study investigated the daily activities of juvenile sea cucumbers Holothuria scabra Jaeger. All individuals exhibited daily burrowing and feeding rhythms in response to environmental factors. The cycle of the smallest juvenile, > 10-40 mm, was linked to light; they began to burrow around sunrise and emerged close to sunset. Their burrowing activity was inhibited by continuous darkness. Juveniles >40-140 mm responded to changes in temperature; they burrowed earlier around 03:30 h, seeking shelter in the sediment as temperature declined, and emerged around mid-day. The maintenance of a constant warm temperature prevented them from burrowing. For all juveniles, time spent on the surface corresponded with feeding and periods of locomotion; while burrowed they remained stationary, did not feed and had a low intestinal transit. Organic matter content in the intestine was also found to vary with the daily cycle. Decreases in salinity from 35 to 30, 25 and 20 parts per thousand induced the burrowing of all juveniles within minutes, but they began to re-emerge after a few hours. Acclimation occurred most rapidly at salinity 30 parts per thousand and was slowest at salinity 20 parts per thousand. Conversely, nearly 40% of the juveniles were unable to cope with a decrease to salinity 15 parts per thousand. Juveniles of all sizes demonstrated a strong selectivity for sediment characteristics. In two substrate selection experiments, their preference for sand with a grain size around 0.4 mm and for organically rich material was firmly expressed within an hour. The general behavior of juvenile H. scabra reflects their ability to inhabit shallow sandy areas with high terrigenous inputs and variable environmental conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Climatic change has long been regarded as an important factor in evolutionary history. In particular, periods of enhanced extinction in marine tara (especially those from warmer waters) have frequently been linked to decreases in seawater temperature. Studies of the physiology of marine invertebrates and fish alive today have revealed well-developed abilities to cope with temperature change, and there would thus appear to be a dichotomy between the rates of temperature change associated with extinction in geological history and the very much faster rates (by several orders of magnitude) with which many marine organisms can cope today. Nevertheless, evidence from ecology and biogeography indicates that temperature, or some temperature-associated factor, does play a significant role in determining the limits to performance, and hence distribution. The resolution of the dichotomy between the evidence from paleontology and physiology may come through a consideration of the role of the previous evolutionary history of the fauna, the influence of sudden temperature events, or the impact of climatic change on individual competitive ability, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Studies of the energetics of marine invertebrates in relation to temperature and the evolutionary history of polar faunas indicate that we should beware of anthropocentric judgements in attempting to understand the role of climatic change in evolutionary history, and be critical in distinguishing the role of temperature per se from temperature-associated ecological factors. present evidence suggests that climatic change in the sea, at least at the rates currently believed to be typical, is unlikely to cause extinction by direct physiological impact. It is more likely that extinction is caused by ecological factors; temperature change is thus only one of several factors that may promote those ecological changes that are currently the best candidates for the proximate cause of extinction in the sea.

AB  - Flies previously selected for high fecundity in poor and good environments (purebred and crossbred) were examined under heat stress and in top-crosses with males from a homozygous strain. Flies selected in good environment appeared to be more sensitive to stress and individuals from unselected lines were more resistant than those from selected lines. Response to stress, effects of top-crossing, and manifestation of heterosis were more affected by complicated interactions; genetic properties of base population x kind of environment x selection history than by each of these factors themselves. Lines selected for combining ability did not show greater resistance to environmental changes than purebred tines. Positive genetic correlation between resistance to ethanol and to heat appears to be present.

VL  - 49
SP  - 222-247
AB  - The South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ), in the French Armorican Variscan belt is a lithospheric wrench fault that acted during the Late Carboniferous as a transition zone between two distinct domains: a thickened domain to the south affected by extension and crustal magmatism, and a weakly thickened domain to the north subjected to dextral wrenching and crust- and mantle-derived magmatism. The Pontivy-Rostrenen complex is a composite intrusion emplaced along the SASZ. To the south, the complex is made of leucogranites whereas, to the north, monzogranites outcrop together with small intrusions of quartz monzodiorite. U-Pb dating of magmatic zircon by LA-ICP-MS reveal that most magmatic rocks were emplaced at ca. 315 Ma (between 316.7 +/- 2.5 Ma and 310.3 +/- 4.7 Ma), excepted a late leucogranitic intrusion that was emplaced at 304.7 +/- 2.7 Ma. The leucogranites (-4.8 < epsilon Nd (T) < 2.1; presence of Archean to Paleozoic inherited zircon) are strongly peraluminous (A/CNK>1.1) and formed by partial melting of metasediments and peraluminous orthogneisses. The monzogranite (-4.0 < epsilon Nd (T) < -3.2; scarce Paleozoic inherited zircon) is moderately peraluminous (1 <A/CNK< 1.3) and formed by partial melting of an oithogneiss with a probable metaluminous composition whereas the quartz monzodiorite (-3.2 < epsilon Nd (T) < -2.2; no inherited zircon) is metaluminous (0.7 < A/CNK < 1.1) and formed by partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The evolution of the magmas was controlled by fractional crystallization, magma mixing and/or peritectic mineral entrainment. At the scale of the Armorican Variscan belt, crustal partial melting, to the south of the SASZ, was triggered by lithospheric thinning and adiabatic decompression during extension. Conversely, to the north, asthenosphere upwelling during strike-slip deformation and subsequent slab tearing, as suggested by tomographic data, induced the melting of both the crust and the mantle fertilized during previous subduction events. This process is likely not exclusive to the Armorican Massif and may be applied to other regions in the Variscan belt, such as Iberia. (C) 2017 International Association for Gondwana Research.

TI  - High-temperature aerosol formation in wood pellets flames: Spatially resolved measurements
VL  - 147
IS  - 4
SP  - 278-293
AB  - The formation and evolution of high-temperature aerosols during fixed bed combustion of wood pellets in a realistic combustion environment were investigated through spatially resolved experiments. The purpose of this work was to investigate the various stages of aerosol formation from the hot flame zone to the flue gas channel. The investigation is important both for elucidation of the formation mechanisms and as a basis for development and validation of particle formation models that can be used for design optimization. Experiments were conducted in an 8-kW-updraft fired-wood-pellets combustor. Particle samples were withdrawn from the centerline of the combustor through 10 sampling ports by a rapid dilution sampling probe. The corresponding temperatures at the sampling positions were in the range 200-1450 degrees C. The particle sample was size-segregated in a low-pressure impactor, allowing physical and chemical resolution of the fine particles. The chemical composition of the particles was investigated by SEM/EDS and XRD analysis. Furthermore, the experimental results were compared to theoretical models for aerosol formation processes. The experimental data show that the particle size distribution has two peaks, both of which are below an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). The mode diameters of the fine and coarse modes in the PM2.5 region were similar to 0.1 and similar to 0.8 mu m, respectively. The shape of the particle size distribution function continuously changes with position in the reactor due to several mechanisms. Early, in the flame zone, both the fine mode and the coarse mode in the PM2.5 region were dominated by particles from incomplete combustion, indicated by a significant amount of carbon in the particles. The particle concentrations of both the fine and the coarse mode decrease rapidly in the hot oxygen-rich flame due to oxidation of the carbon-rich particles. After the hot flame, the fine mode concentration and particle diameter increase gradually when the temperature of the flue gas drops. The main contribution to this comes from condensation on preexisting particles in the gas of alkali sulfates, alkali chlorides, and Zn species formed from constituents vaporized in the fuel bed. The alkali sulfates were found to condense at a temperature of similar to 950 degrees C and alkali chlorides condensed later at similar to 600 degrees C. This agrees well with results of chemical equilibrium calculation of the gas-to-particle conversion temperature. After the hot flame the coarse mode concentration decreased very little when the flue gas was cooled. In addition to carbon, the coarse mode consists of refractory metals and also considerable amounts of alkali. (c) 2006 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluating area-specific adaptation strategies for rainfed maize under future climates of India
VL  - 836
AB  - This study investigates the spatio-temporal changes in maize yield under projected climate and identified the potential adaptation measures to reduce the negative impact. Future climate data derived from 30 general circulation models were used to assess the impact of future climate on yield in 16 major maize growing districts of India. DSSAT model was used to simulate maize yield and evaluate adaptation strategies during mid (2040-69) and end-centuries (207099) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Genetic coefficients were calibrated and validated for each of the study locations. The projected climate indicated a substantial increase in mean seasonal maximum (0.9-6.0 degrees C) and minimum temperatures (1.1-6.1 degrees C) in the future (the range denotes the lowest and highest change during all the four future scenarios). Without adaptation strategies, climate change could reduce maize yield in the range of 16% (Tumkur) to 46% (Jalandhar) under RCP 4.5 and 21% (Tumkur) to 80% (Jalandhar) under RCP 8.5. Only at Dharwad, the yield could remain slightly higher or the same compared to the baseline period (1980-2009). Six adaptation strategies were evaluated (delayed sowing, increase in fertilizer dose, supplemental irrigation, and their combinations) in which a combination of those was found to be effective in majority of the districts. District-specific adaptation strategies were identified for each of the future scenarios. The findings of this study will enable in planning adaptation strategies to minimize the negative impact of projected climate in major maize growing districts of India.

TI  - Relationship modelling for surface finish for laser-based additive manufacturing
AB  - Nickel-based superalloys belong to a special class of high-performance alloys that feature large amounts of nickel. The uniqueness of superalloys lies in their design features, most notably mechanical strength, durability, etc. Inconel 718 (IN718) is a nickel-based superalloy that exhibits high tensile and impact-resistant properties, along with good high-temperature corrosion resistance. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is additive manufacturing (AM) technology aimed at melting and fusing metal powders using high power density lasers to produce precision functional parts. The accuracy and functional characteristics of manufactured parts are highly dependent on process parameters. The processing parameters that control the SLM process comprise laser power (P), hatch spacing (HS), exposure time (t), and border power (BP). This work primarily focuses on finding the combined effect of these process parameters on the surface roughness (SR) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of IN718 manufactured by SLM using the design of experiments (DOE).

VL  - 22
AB  - Water temperatu r e is an important modulator of variation of phenotype in poikilothermic fish and therefore of body shape. The present study explores the phenotypic response of commercial O. mykiss parr when they are subjected to rearing temperatures of 8 degrees and 16 degrees C under controlled conditions with the aim of demonstrating , with the use of Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics, the influence of rearing temperature on body shape. O. mykiss males and neomales from eggs to parr stages, belonging to the same family and strain, were reared at different temperatures (8 degrees C and 16 degrees C) and grouped according to: Group 16 degrees C/neomales (n = 15), Group 16 degrees C/ males (n = 15), Group 8 degrees C/neomales (n = 15) and Group 8 degrees C/males (n = 15). Differences in body shape among sex and rearing temperatures were examined by geometric morphometrics and traditional morphometry. At 16 weeks, geometric morphometric analysis revealed a dimorphism, which was not detected by traditional morphome t r y , mainly in the dorsal and caudal fin area. This dimorphism was not observed in neomales. This difference may be the product of the potential for phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to genetically controlled environmental and local fluctuations, which affects to indicators of adaptation in unfavorable environmental conditions such a biomechanical action of swimming and propulsion. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the differential effect of 8 degrees and 16 degrees C water temperature on lateral body shape in male O. mykiss parr during the early stages of body development and in controlled conditions.

TI  - The effect of climate change on the production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants: A short and long term ARDL modelling for the case of Tunisia
IS  - 55
SP  - 75-92
AB  - We propose to analyze the direct effect of climate change on the agricultural production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants, in the short and long term, in Tunisia. The methodological is based on the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The originality of this method is that it allows time dynamics to be taken into account in the explanation of a variable, thus improving forecasts and economic policies to be implemented in the short and long term. To this end, we used a highly disaggregated database describing the evolution of average temperature, rainfall, fertilizer, agricultural labor and the surface area of each plant in Tunisia over a long period, from 1984 to 2019.The results found reveal that, in the long term, there is a strong positive correlation between cereal production and rainfall in the governorates of North-West Tunisia. Contrary to the results found by the cereal crop, our results show that the average temperature has a positive effect on vegetable production. They also show that rainfall generally has a greater effect on vegetable and cereal production in the long term than in the short term. Our results also show that long term fruit production shows remarkable declines in the most fruit-producing governorates following an increase in rainfall and fertilizers, while an increase in production has taken place following an increase in labor force and agricultural area.

VL  - 11
IS  - 23
SP  - 16661-16679
AB  - Genetic differentiation has been observed in marine species even when no obvious barriers to gene flow exist, and understanding such differentiation is essential for effective fisheries management. Highly differentiated outlier loci can provide information on how genetic variation might not only contribute to local adaptation but may also be affected by historical demographic events. A locus which aligned to a predicted zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3 gene (ZP3) in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was previously identified as the highest outlier based on F-ST in a RADseq study of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) across the West Coast of North America. However, because of the limited length of the RAD sequence and restricted geographic area of sampling, no conclusion on the functional significance of the observed variation was possible. In other marine species, ZP3 is involved in reproductive isolation, local adaptation, and has neofunctionalized as an antifreeze gene, and so it may provide important insights in functional population structure of Pacific cod. Here, we sequenced a 544-bp region of ZP3 in 230 Pacific cod collected from throughout their geographic range. We observed striking patterns of spatial structuring of ZP3 haplotypes, with a sharp break near Kodiak, Alaska, USA where populations within similar to 200 km of each other are nearly fixed for different haplotypes, contrasting a pattern of isolation by distance at other genetic markers in this region (F-ST = 0.003). Phylogenetic analysis of ZP3 haplotypes revealed that the more southern haplotypes appear to be ancestral, with the northern haplotype evolving more recently, potentially in response to a novel selective pressure as Pacific cod recolonized northern latitudes after glaciation. The sharp break in haplotype frequencies suggests strong selective pressures are operating on small spatial scales and illustrates that selection can create high divergence even in marine species with ample opportunities for gene flow.

TI  - Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Options of Rain-Fed Agriculture in Africa with Integrated Modelling Framework
VL  - 330
SP  - 203-212
AB  - Rain-fed agriculture areas in Africa are experiencing heavy pressure from climatic changes and food insecurity risk. This paper aims to provide an integrated modeling framework to identify food-insecurity hotspots in African agricultural systems and potential effective adaptation strategies at a local scale. We use the integrated modeling framework to drive rain-fed maize simulation models with baseline and generated climatic data. Maize yields simulated with the current and doubling CO2 concentration are then compared to analyze the effect of CO2 fertilization. Incorporating two local adaptive strategies into crop modeling provided some insights on preferred types of adaptation in different areas. The results showed that rain-fed maize production is highly vulnerable to simulated global warming. Such impacts differed with different weather conditions. Climate change has greater impacts on the relatively arid area. The results of the effectiveness of adaptive strategies imply that adaptive strategies need to be tailored to the local and community level to buffer the yield reduction impacts of climate change effectively.

TI  - The influence of environmental heterogeneity on the morphological and genetic diversity of Circaea lutetiana (Onagraceae) in Hyrcanian forests
VL  - 78
IS  - 1
AB  - Environmental gradients are important factors that can potentially influence the genetic diversity and differentiation of populations. The present study examines the effect of environmental heterogeneity of the Hyrcanian forests on populations of Circaea lutetiana L. (Onagraceae). Using morphometrics, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of leaf epidermis, and molecular markers, we analyzed genetic diversity and differentiation among nine populations from environmentally divergent habitats. Three different gene pools were observed. Our results indicate that the genetic structure is significantly correlated to environmental factors, but not to the geographical distance. Genetic clustering in C. lutetiana is affected by temperature, humidity, elevation, and average annual rainfall. Overall, our data indicate that gene flow does not contribute to explaining spatial patterns of genetic structure and the adaptation to the environment is the main factor shaping the genetic structure of the C. lutetiana populations. The populations belonging to each of the three gene pools have similarities in microclimate parameters, despite their geographical proximity, and populations from the same genetic pool can be up to 470 km apart. This evidence, as well as morphological and genetic similarities of the populations with greater geographical distance, suggest the possibility of cryptic speciation in this species.

TI  - Maintenance of Species Differences in Closely Related Tetraploid Parasitic Euphrasia (Orobanchaceae) on an Isolated Island
VL  - 1
IS  - 6
AB  - Polyploidy is pervasive in angiosperm evolution and plays important roles in adaptation and speciation. However, polyploid groups are understudied due to complex sequence homology, challenging genome assembly, and taxonomic complexity. Here, we study adaptive divergence in taxonomically complex eyebrights (Euphrasia), where recent divergence, phenotypic plasticity, and hybridization blur species boundaries. We focus on three closely related tetraploid species with contrasting ecological preferences that are sympatric on Fair Isle, a small isolated island in the British Isles. Using a common garden experiment, we show a genetic component to the morphological differences present between these species. Using whole-genome sequencing and a novel k-mer approach we call "Tetmer", we demonstrate that the species are of allopolyploid origin, with a sub-genome divergence of approximately 5%. Using -2 million SNPs, we show sub-genome homology across species, with a very low sequence divergence characteristic of recent speciation. This genetic variation is broadly structured by species, with clear divergence of Fair Isle heathland Euphrasia micrantha, while grassland Euphrasia erotica and coastal Euphrasia foulaensis are more closely related. Overall, we show that tetraploid Euphrasia is a system of allopolyploids of postglacial species divergence, where adaptation to novel environments may be conferred by old variants rearranged into new genetic lineages.

TI  - Simulating adaptation strategies to offset potential impacts of climate variability and change on maize yields in Embu County, Kenya
VL  - 15
IS  - 11
AB  - In this study, we assessed the possible impacts of climate variability and change on growth and performance of maize using multi-climate, multi-crop model approaches built on Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) protocols in five different agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Embu County in Kenya and under different management systems. Adaptation strategies were developed that are locally relevant by identifying a set of technologies that help to offset potential impacts of climate change on maize yields. Impacts and adaptation options were evaluated using projections by 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Two widely used crop simulation models, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on maize. Results showed that 20 CMIP5 models are consistent in their projections of increased surface temperatures with different magnitude. Projections by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM tend to be higher than the rest of 17 CMIP5 climate models under both emission scenarios. The projected increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) which ranged between 2.7 and 5.8 degrees C is higher than the increase in maximum temperature (Tmax) that varied between 2.2 and 4.8 degrees C by end century under RCP 8.5. Future projections in rainfall are less certain with high variability projections by GFDL-ESM2G, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M suggest 8 to 25% decline in rainfall, while CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR and BNU-ESM suggested more than 85% increase in rainfall under RCP 8.5 by end of 21(st) century. Impacts of current and future climatic conditions on maize yields varied depending on the AEZs, soil type, crop management and climate change scenario. Impacts are largely negative in the low potential AEZs such as Lower Midlands (LM4 and LM5) compared with the high potential AEZs Upper Midlands (UM2 and UM3). However, impacts of climate change are largely positive across all AEZs and management conditions when CO2 fertilization is included. Using the differential impacts of climate change, a strategy to adapt maize cultivation to climate change in all the five AEZs was identified by consolidating those practices that contributed to increased yields under climate change. We consider this approach as more appropriate to identify operational adaptation strategies using readily available technologies that contribute positively under both current and future climatic conditions. This approach when adopted in strategic manner will also contribute to further strengthen the development of adaptation strategies at national and local levels. The methods and tools validated and applied in this assessment allowed estimating possible impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies which can provide valuable insights and guidance for adaptation planning.

TI  - Effect of different controlled atmosphere gas compositions on the developmental time of Cadra cautella pupae at different temperatures
VL  - 88
AB  - Low oxygen and/or high carbon dioxide environments (hypoxic, anoxic or hypercarbic atmospheres) can cause a delay in insect development, the length of which depends on the exposure time, gas concentration, environmental factors, species, etc. Therefore, in this study, delay in development in 0-72 h old pupae of Cadra (=Ephestia) cautella was investigated by exposing them to two low oxygen (1% and 3%) atmospheres supplemented with high carbon dioxide (95% and 85%) balanced with nitrogen for 6-112 h at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Development-delaying effects of controlled or modified atmospheres (MA) were strongest at 20 degrees C, followed by 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The shortest exposure time at which delay in development was statistically meaningful was 24 h. Development-delaying effects of both MAs were of similar pattern. When compared to control groups, delay in development was in the range of 2.03-9.64 d at 20 degrees C, 0.19-3.72 d at 25 degrees C, and 0.02-2.77 d at 30 degrees C. Cadra cautella pupae, which were exposed to 1% oxygen with 95% carbon dioxide (balance with nitrogen) at 20 degrees C for 64 h, could still hatch 24 d after the treatment in comparison to control groups in which pupal eclosion was max. 16 d. Therefore in MAs applications, delay in development could be an important issue to consider for controlling stored-products pests, especially at lower temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Quantitative genetics of wing morphology in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis: hosts increase sibling similarity
VL  - 125
IS  - 1
SP  - 40-49
AB  - The central aim of evolutionary biology is to understand patterns of genetic variation between species and within populations. To quantify the genetic variation underlying intraspecific differences, estimating quantitative genetic parameters of traits is essential. In Pterygota, wing morphology is an important trait affecting flight ability. Moreover, gregarious parasitoids such as Nasonia vitripennis oviposit multiple eggs in the same host, and siblings thus share a common environment during their development. Here we estimate the genetic parameters of wing morphology in the outbred HVRx population of N. vitripennis, using a sire-dam model adapted to haplodiploids and disentangled additive genetic and host effects. The results show that the wing-size traits have low heritability (h(2) similar to 0.1), while most wing-shape traits have roughly twice the heritability compared with wing-size traits. However, the estimates increased to h(2) similar to 0.6 for wing-size traits when omitting the host effect from the statistical model, while no meaningful increases were observed for wing-shape traits. Overall, host effects contributed to similar to 50% of the variation in wing-size traits. This indicates that hosts have a large effect on wing-size traits, about fivefold more than genetics. Moreover, bivariate analyses were conducted to derive the genetic relationships among traits. Overall, we demonstrate the evolutionary potential for morphological traits in the N. vitripennis HVRx-outbred population, and report the host effects on wing morphology. Our findings can contribute to a further dissection of the genetics underlying wing morphology in N. vitripennis, with relevance for gregarious parasitoids and possibly other insects as well.

TI  - Real-Time Corrosion Monitoring of Aluminum Alloy Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy
VL  - 167
IS  - 8
AB  - The evolution of the Volta potential of grade AA6063-T5 aluminum alloy microstructure with various intermetallic phases (IMP) during corrosion exposure to chloride-laden thin-film electrolytes at ambient temperature has been investigated, in situ and in real-time, using scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM), to gain insight into local corrosion processes. Trenching around micrometer-sized IMPs, de-alloying, oxidation, and the deposition of corrosion products were observed, which led to an inversion of the electrochemical nobility of the IMPs relative to the alloy matrix. Most of the IMPs showed cathodic Volta potentials (high nobility) relative to the matrix at 40%-80% relative humidity (RH), which became anodic (low nobility) when the surface was moistened with aqueous sodium chloride at elevated moisture (76%-87% RH) producing concentrations up to 5-6 M of chloride. The change of the Volta potential correlated with the onset and progress of corrosion and a nobility inversion of IMPs relative to the alloy matrix was observed. The corrosion behavior and the reasons for galvanic activities among microstructural constituents were elucidated and brought into a broader context to understanding localized corrosion.

TI  - Path Planning of Multiple Unmanned Marine Vehicles for Adaptive Ocean Sampling Using Elite Group-Based Evolutionary Algorithms
VL  - 99
IS  - 3
SP  - 875-889
AB  - This paper presents elite group-based evolutionary algorithms (EGEA) for adaptive ocean sampling using multiple unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs). The EGEA integrate a group-based framework and elitist selection methods into evolutionary path planner, which combine main advantages of these two techniques.The group-based framework allows each offspring individual of evolutionary algorithm to generate its own group of new solutions with a certain probability. Two elitist selection methods, herein referred to as group individual elitist selection (GIES) and whole population elitist selection (WPES), are proposed to facilitate selecting preferable solutions to be passed on to the next generation in the procedure of evolutionary algorithms. The EGEA path planners based on simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are tested to find trajectories for multiple UMVs to collect maximum interested ocean information from regions under investigation. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is also described and evaluated with the proposed EGEA for solving the adaptive sampling problem. Simulation results show that the whole elite group-based simulated annealing algorithm (WEGSA) is able to generate trajectories with more information gain from regions of high scientific interest with constrained energy of multiple UMVs than other techniques. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the EGEA in comparison with other techniques.

TI  - Hatchability of gemmules of two Neotropical freshwater sponges (Porifera: Spongillida)
VL  - 110
AB  - Inland waters experience extreme environmental conditions determining the evolution of several adaptive strategies of the fauna to these variable conditions. Freshwater sponges produce resisting bodies called gemmules that contain totipotent cells and specialized spicules (gemmuloscleres). Completely formed gemmules exhibit low metabolic rates and may become dormant during periods of environmental stress. Until now, few species had their hatchability tested against different environmental conditions. The purpose of the present study was to test the capacity of hatching gemmules of two freshwater sponge species (Heteromeyenia cristalina Batista, Volkmer-Ribeiro & Melao, 2007 and Radiospongilla inesi Nicacio & Pinheiro, 2011) from inland waters from different localities. Five assays were tested (A): A1 (water of sponge collection site); A2 (Pirangi River water); A3 (Araraquara Pond water); A4 (mineral water) and A5 (Al after drying gemmules). For each assay, three replicates with 30 gemmules were used. The gemmules were observed daily during 30 days. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA and a posteriori Tukey test. Results showed that gemmules from both species submitted to A3 have not hatched, probably due to its very high conductivity. There was a significant difference between assays (A1, A2 and A4) and between species (F-2,F-12 = 77.2; P < 0.001). Comparison between Al and A5 showed significant differences between both assays and species (F-1,F-8 = 27.5; P < 0.001). Radiospongilla inesi presented high hatching rate at all assays, while H. cristalina had a high hatching rate only on Al and A5. Results clearly show that each species has a different capacity of hatching.

VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 132-139
AB  - Trade-offs shaping behavioral variation are often influenced by the environment. We investigated the role that the environment plays in mediating trade-offs using a widespread frog with a conspicuous mating display, Pseudacris crucifer. We first demonstrated, using playback and desiccation experiments, that calling site selection involves a trade-off between sound transmission and desiccation. We then determined the influence of local environmental conditions on the intensity of the trade-off by examining range-wide behavioral and environmental data. We showed that the benefit of improved call transmission is positively influenced by vegetation density and ground cover. Behavioral data are consistent with this relationship: sites with a greater transmission benefit have increased prevalence of arboreally calling males. We also found that the prevalence of arboreal calling behavior increases with relative humidity and air temperature, suggesting an influence of these environmental variables on the desiccation cost of arboreal calling. This study provides a clear example of the role of the environment in mediating trade-off intensities and shaping critical behavioral traits.

VL  - 254
SP  - 336-339
AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a smell of rotten eggs which poses great threat on human health and environmental protection. Traditional metal oxide based H2S sensors always suffer from undesirable selectivity and elevated operation temperature. To overcome these obstacles, in this report cuprous oxide nanowires/nanoparticles (Cu2O) anchored onto reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO) were prepared to serve as the sensing layer. Multiple characterization techniques such as SEM, TEM, FTIR, and XRD were utilized to explore the sensor performance toward H2S gas. Compared to the partial recovery at 25 degrees C, the prepared rGO/Cu2O sensor showed a response of 20% toward 1 ppm H2S at 40 degrees C, together with full restoration, excellent repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. Favorable film porosity, highly conductive rGO nanosheets and nanometer size effect of Cu2O materials were responsible for these inspiring results, paving the avenue for future trace H2S detection in the aspects of higher sensitivity and lower power-consumption.

AB  - Current interrupt and galvanostatic EIS techniques were utilized in a complementary fashion to characterize the different sources of overpotential during anodic gas evolution. Room temperature anodic evolution of oxygen at a nickel working electrode in aqueous potassium hydroxide and the high temperature (348 degrees C) anodic evolution of chlorine at a glassy carbon working electrode in molten (LiCl)(57.5)-(KCl)(13.3)-(CsCl)(29.2) where investigatd. Combining of the two techniques enables to separate the total measured overpotential into its ohmic, charge transfer, and mass transfer components. Potential decay curves indicated that natural convection (due to both bubble evolution and density driven flow) was a major driving force in reestablishing equilibrium conditions at the working electrode surface. During oxygen evolution, charge transfer resistance dominated the total overpotential at low current densities, but as the current density approached similar to 100mA/cm(2), mass transfer overpotentials and ohmic overpotential became non-negligible. The mass transfer overpotential during chlorine evolution was found to be half that found during oxygen evolution. (c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

TI  - Biocatalytic solutions to cyclomethicones problem in cosmetics
VL  - 19
IS  - 5
SP  - 370-388
AB  - Silicones are polymers that have properties of great interest for cosmetic and personal care industry, especially D-4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) and D-5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane), generically named cyclomethicones. However, different studies show the hypothesis that the use of these products is harmful and, therefore, several countries have adopted legislative actions to limit their use in personal care and cosmetic products. Faced with this new situation, different cosmetic companies began to look for different alternatives to cyclomethicones, mainly: organomodified silicones or esters. The former are based on the addition of functional groups to the main chain of silicon and oxygen. The latter represent a totally different line, since their functional group is the ester, but they have properties similar to silicones. Esters, especially branched-chain ones are currently the more promising alternative to replace cyclomethicones in cosmetic formulations. Nowadays, most of them are obtained by chemical reactions that require high temperatures and non-selective /contaminant catalysts that lead to low-quality final products. As an alternative, biocatalytic synthesis occurs always at mild operation conditions supplying ultra-pure, odor, and colorless products with less wastes and side reactions. Therefore, biocatalysis is a valid and environmentally sustainable option for the synthesis of silicone-substitute esters used in cosmetic formulations.

TI  - Evaluation of climate change impacts and adaptation strategies on rainfed rice production in Songkhram River Basin, Thailand
VL  - 652
SP  - 189-201
AB  - This study investigates rice yield and evaluates potential adaptation measures on field management practices for rainfed rice production under climate change scenarios in the Songkhram River Basin, Thailand. The top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined to evaluate the future climate conditions in the Songkhram River Basin and identify adaptation strategies respectively. An ensemble of four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) bias-corrected using the Quantile Mapping technique was used to project the future climate under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The DSSAT crop simulation model was used to simulate rice yield and evaluate the impacts of climate change on rice yield, as well as the feasibility of four adaptation options, which were solicited from four hundred farmers through questionnaire surveys in the basin. The strategies include (i) change in planting date, (ii) change in fertiliser application date, (iii) change in fertiliser application dose, and (iv) supplying irrigation water. Based on the model results, future maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to increase by 2.8 and 3.2 degrees C respectively under RCP8.5 scenario for 2080s. Although annual rainfall may be unchanged, rainfall patterns will shift earlier in future. Evaluation of adaptation strategies suggest that supplying irrigation water under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively are the best strategies to increase rice yield under climate change scenarios. Change in fertiliser application date and change in planting date can increase the future rice yield by 12 and 8%, respectively under RCP4.5 scenario for 2080s. Adjusting the fertiliser application dose may however reduce future rice yield. Although supplying irrigation water can aid the production of rainfed rice, other concerns such as the source of water are involved. The feasibility of adaptation actions would depend largely on available resources and mindset of farmers. Further work is warranted in exploring a combination of adaptation strategies and management plans to combat the adverse impacts of climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Composting of biodegradable wastes from the university restaurant at Tecnologico de Costa Rica
VL  - 32
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-53
AB  - The university restaurant from Tecnologico de Costa Rica's main Campus in Cartago, has the purpose of a better waste management; therefore, three composting methods were evaluated to produce organic fertilizer from its biodegradable residues. The researchers selected the techniques through expert's opinion, assessing variables like pH, temperature, moisture and efficiency in each technique, in order to determine the most efficient one to re-valorize the organic waste. A factorial experimental design was selected, in which three treatments were compared: Takakura (TK), Mountain microorganisms (MM) and Pellets (P) with biodegradable solid wastes on each case, in tumbling composters and in pile composters (on the ground), with two repetitions. The used p value was 0,05. As a result, the Takakura treatment showed the best results from a technical, environmental and economic point of view, since it reached the highest average temperature (53 degrees C) and achieved the thermophilic phase faster than the other ones, maintaining the expected indicators for proper composting, such as a pH close to 7, moisture between 50% and 70% and efficiency of 81%.. Consequently, the researchers conclude this treatment represents a valid strategy to aim towards a circular economy approach at the university's restaurant from Tecnologico de Costa Rica.

TI  - Anticipating the response of the Brazilian giant earthworm (Rhinodrilus alatus) to climate change: implications for its traditional use
VL  - 91
IS  - 1
AB  - Our understanding of the impacts of ongoing global warming on terrestrial species has increased significantly during the last several years, but how climatic change has affected, and will affect, the distribution of earthworms remains largely unknown. We used climate niche modeling to model the current distribution of the giant earthworm Rhinodrilus alatus - an endemic species of the Cerrado Domain in Brazil, which is traditionally harvested and commercialized for fishing bait. R. alatus is sensitive to environmental changes because climate, in synergy with soil attributes, determine its annual reproductive cycle and distribution. The paleoclimatic reconstructions predict important geographical shifts from LGM (similar to 21,000 yBp) to the present potential distribution of R. alatus: range expansion, fragmentation, and shrinkage of the current core area. Further, the 2070 scenarios predict substantial shrink and losses of stable areas. Our results indicate that climate change will not only affect the extent of the distribution, but will also promote significant fragmentation and a geographical shift to outside of the currently recognized geographical boundaries. In this context, populations of R. alatus would decline and traditional harvesting would collapse, requiring immediate implementation of management and conservation measures for the species and economically sustainable alternatives for the local community.

TI  - Potentials and Limitations of a Growing Degree Day Approach to Predict the Phenology of Cereal Leaf Beetles
VL  - 47
IS  - 4
SP  - 1039-1046
AB  - Cereal leaf beetles (CLBs) are described as an invasive pest of small grain cereals in many regions worldwide. Prediction models aimed to prevent yield losses caused by these feeding insects have been developed by researchers all over the world. As a foundation for many of these prediction models, it is known that a specific number of heat units, or growing degree days (GDDs), is required for an insect to complete a certain physiological process. In this paper, we overview the existing GDD models for CLBs. Furthermore, we used our Belgian input data to compare model predictions with our own observations.Though, the existing models were not able to predict the seasonal trends present in our data: the occurrence of various life stages were monitored earlier then the model predicted. Hence, a weighted GDD model was tested on the data as well: the accumulated GDDs during certain periods were balanced according to the significance of this period for the insect. Rainfall and/or relative humidity were included as well. Based on these selected variables, multiple linear regression models, ridge regression models, and regression trees were fitted. This approach performed considerably better compared to the simple accumulation of GDD. However, based on cross-year cross-location validation method, to gain insight in the future performance of the models, the accuracy was still too low to serve as an accurate warning tool.

TI  - Multiscale scheme for the optimal use of residues for the production of biogas across Castile and Leon
VL  - 185
SP  - 239-251
AB  - This work evaluates the exploitation of four different types of waste for the production of biogas and fertilizer using a feedback multiscale analysis approach. The yield of sludge, manure, municipal solid wastes (MSW) and lignocellulosic residues is evaluated and the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion of each of these residues is determined by performing a parameter estimation using experimental data. It turns out that hydrolysis is the limiting stage. Next, a techno-economic evaluation of a processing facility is carried out. Finally a supply network model is developed to evaluate the optimal use of the residues over a region in Spain. The network is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem selecting the type of residue, the number and size of the digesters and the location of the plants across 59 shires of a particular region in Spain for the available budget. MSW is the selected waste due to its wide availability and large yield to fertilizer. Lignocellulosic residues are the second best option. Only intrashire transport is suggested. The shires selected for waste processing are rather scattered as a function of the resources available and the already installed facilities. However, the amount of residues available can provide more than three times the region demand for natural gas, but the budget required adds up to more than 4.4 .10(9) (sic) (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 209
IS  - 1
SP  - 173-193
AB  - Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins changes their function or marks them for proteolysis, and the specificity of ubiquitin attachment is mediated by the numerous E3 ligases encoded by animals. Mind Bomb is an essential E3 ligase during Notch pathway signaling in insects and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a Mind Bomb homolog (mib-1), it has never been recovered in the extensive Notch suppressor/enhancer screens that have identified numerous pathway components. Here, we show that C. elegans mib-1 null mutants have a spermatogenesis-defective phenotype that results in a heterogeneous mixture of arrested spermatocytes, defective spermatids, and motility-impaired spermatozoa. mib-1 mutants also have chromosome segregation defects during meiosis, molecular null mutants are intrinsically temperature-sensitive, and many mib-1 spermatids contain large amounts of tubulin. These phenotypic features are similar to the endogenous RNA intereference (RNAi) mutants, but mib-1 mutants do not affect RNAi. MIB-1 protein is expressed throughout the germ line with peak expression in spermatocytes followed by segregation into the residual body during spermatid formation. C. elegans mib-1 expression, while upregulated during spermatogenesis, also occurs somatically, including in vulva precursor cells. Here, we show that mib-1 mutants suppress both lin-12 and glp-1 (C. elegans Notch) gain-of-function mutants, restoring anchor cell formation and a functional vulva to the former and partly restoring oocyte production to the latter. However, suppressed hermaphrodites are only observed when grown at 25 degrees, and they are self-sterile. This probably explains why mib-1 was not previously recovered as a Notch pathway component in suppressor/enhancer selection experiments.

TI  - The hologenome concept of evolution after 10 years
VL  - 6
AB  - The holobiont (host with its endocellular and extracellular microbiome) can function as a distinct biological entity, an additional organismal level to the ones previously considered, on which natural selection operates. The holobiont can function as a whole: anatomically, metabolically, immunologically, developmentally, and during evolution. Consideration of the holobiont with its hologenome as an independent level of selection in evolution has led to a better understanding of underappreciated modes of genetic variation and evolution. The hologenome is comprised of two complimentary parts: host and microbiome genomes. Changes in either genome can result in variations that can be selected for or against. The host genome is highly conserved, and genetic changes within it occur slowly, whereas the microbiome genome is dynamic and can change rapidly in response to the environment by increasing or reducing particular microbes, by acquisition of novel microbes, by horizontal gene transfer, and by mutation. Recent experiments showing that microbiota can play an initial role in speciation have been suggested as an additional mode of enhancing evolution. Some of the genetic variations can be transferred to offspring by a variety of mechanisms. Strain-specific DNA analysis has shown that at least some of the microbiota can be maintained across hundreds of thousands of host generations, implying the existence of a microbial core. We argue that rapid changes in the microbiome genome could allow holobionts to adapt and survive under changing environmental conditions thus providing the time necessary for the host genome to adapt and evolve. As Darwin wrote, "It is not the strongest of the species that survives but the most adaptable".

TI  - The Responses Of Antioxidant System In Bitter Melon, Sponge Gourd, And Winter Squash Under Flooding And Chilling Stresses
VL  - 1954
AB  - The objective of this paper was to review the responses of antioxidant system and physiological parameters of bitter melon (BM), sponge gourd (SG), and winter squash (WS) under waterlogged and low temperature conditions. The BM and SG plants were subjected to 0-72 h flooding treatments, and BM and WS plants were exposed to chilling at 12/7 degrees C (day/night) for 0-72 h. Different genotypes responded differently to environmental stress according to their various antioxidant system and physiological parameters. Increased ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities provided SG and WS plants with increased waterlogging and chilling stress tolerance, respectively, compared to BM plants. The APX gene from SG and the SOD gene from WS were then cloned, and the regulation of APX and SOD gene expressions under flooding and chilling stress, respectively, were also measured. Increased expression of APX and SOD genes was accompanied by the increased activity of the enzyme involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to those stresses. Both APX and SOD activities can be used for selecting BM lines with the best tolerances to water logging and chilling stresses.

TI  - A warmer and drier climate in the northern sagebrush biome does not promote cheatgrass invasion or change its response to fire
VL  - 185
IS  - 4
SP  - 763-774
AB  - Dryland shrub communities have been degraded by a range of disturbances and now face additional stress from global climate change. The spring/summer growing season of the North American sagebrush biome is projected to become warmer and drier, which is expected to facilitate the expansion of the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and alter its response to fire in the northern extent of the biome. We tested these predictions with a factorial experiment with two levels of burning (spring burn and none) and three climate treatments (warming, warming + drying, and control) that was repeated over 3 years in a Montana sagebrush steppe. We expected the climate treatments to make B. tectorum more competitive with the native perennial grass community, especially Pseudoroegneria spicata, and alter its response to fire. Experimental warming and warming + drying reduced B. tectorum cover, biomass, and fecundity, but there was no response to fire except for fecundity, which increased; the native grass community was the most significant factor that affected B. tectorum metrics. The experimental climate treatments also negatively affected P. spicata, total native grass cover, and community biodiversity, while fire negatively affected total native grass cover, particularly when climate conditions were warmer and drier. Our short-term results indicate that without sufficient antecedent moisture and a significant disruption to the native perennial grass community, a change in climate to a warmer and drier spring/summer growing season in the northern sagebrush biome will not facilitate B. tectorum invasion or alter its response to fire.

TI  - Seasonal monitoring of blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) populations in a harbor area: A focus on responses to environmental factors and chronic contamination
VL  - 129
SP  - 24-35
AB  - Coastal waters corresponding to macrotidal systems are among the most variable marine biotopes. Sessile animals as bivalve mollusks may however be found forming intertidal beds at high densities, as allowed by full adaptation to local conditions. A better knowledge of adaptive responses to environmental factors is required to foresee possible adverse effects of global change. At the sub-cellular level, transcriptional responses are among the earliest signals of environmental disturbances and they can reveal subtle and meaningful changes in organism exposed to stress. Three blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) populations inhabiting the Bay of Brest (France) in sites exposed to different levels of chronic pollution, from low to moderate, were surveyed upon a seasonal schedule, with special attention to the reproductive cycle. Major seawater parameters were monitored over a full-year in the framework of the S! RANO project, based on an automatic high frequency acquisition system installed aboard a ship of opportunity. The health status of mussels has been assessed by measuring a condition index and gametogenesis has been followed by histology. Selected biological responses to environmental stress were detected using a multimarker approach including expression of genes involved in chemical stress response and energetic metabolism, and cellular immune parameters. Environmental parameters showed deep seasonal variations which differed among sites. Most biological responses followed a seasonal pattern. Late winter and spring corresponded to an active reproduction period in the Bay of Brest. Earlier spawning was observed in harbor areas compared to the oceanic site and an altered physiological state was assumed in commercial harbor mussels during the reproductive period, suggesting that their health is compromised at this time of year. However, no signs of severe chemical stress were detected in both harbor mussel populations, which could reflect adaptive responses to adverse environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 96
IS  - 8
SP  - 2811-2819
AB  - The overall aim of this research was to develop egg freshness prediction models in terms of selected quality indices. Six experiments (4 constant temperatures and 2 variable temperatures) were carried out on hen eggs for a total period of 10, 21, 26, 13, and 105 d at storage temperatures of 30, 20, 20 to 10, 30 to 10, and 5 and 10 degrees C, to observe trends in the relative weight loss (RWL), Haugh unit (HU), yolk index (YI), albumin index (AI), yolk pH, and albumin pH. The results showed that there was an increasing trend in the RWL and a decreasing trend in the YI, AI, and HU for all temperature conditions. The changes in the yolk and albumin pH were not uniform. The data from the constant temperature conditions were used to determine the coefficients of the egg quality prediction models, which consisted of the primary model controlling the change rate of the quality indicator at a temperature condition in differential equation form, and the secondary model controlling the change rate with temperature, which was in quadratic polynomial form. The models were applied to the data from the fluctuating temperature conditions, and the zeroth, third, and eighth order kinetic models described the stepwise change in the RWL, HU, and YI, respectively. The accuracy and bias factor values for the RWL, HU, and YI were 1.116 and 0.940, 1.028 and 1.001, and 1.038 and 0.966, respectively. It can be concluded that the models can be used to predict egg freshness in terms of the RWL, HU, and YI at any temperature condition with in the range of 5 to 30 degrees C during storage.

TI  - Sexual selection predicts brain structure in dragon lizards
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 244-256
AB  - Phenotypic traits such as ornaments and armaments are generally shaped by sexual selection, which often favours larger and more elaborate males compared to females. But can sexual selection also influence the brain? Previous studies in vertebrates report contradictory results with no consistent pattern between variation in brain structure and the strength of sexual selection. We hypothesize that sexual selection will act in a consistent way on two vertebrate brain regions that directly regulate sexual behaviour: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPON) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). The MPON regulates male reproductive behaviour whereas the VMN regulates female reproductive behaviour and is also involved in male aggression. To test our hypothesis, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with traditional histology of brains in 14 dragon lizard species of the genus Ctenophorus that vary in the strength of precopulatory sexual selection. Males belonging to species that experience greater sexual selection had a larger MPON and a smaller VMN. Conversely, females did not show any patterns of variation in these brain regions. As the volumes of both these regions also correlated with brain volume (BV) in our models, we tested whether they show the same pattern of evolution in response to changes in BV and found that the do. Therefore, we show that the primary brain nuclei underlying reproductive behaviour in vertebrates can evolve in a mosaic fashion, differently between males and females, likely in response to sexual selection, and that these same regions are simultaneously evolving in concert in relation to overall brain size.

TI  - Modelling cereal crops to assess future climate risk for family food self-sufficiency in southern Mali
VL  - 201
SP  - 133-145
AB  - Future climate change will have far reaching consequences for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Here we assessed the farm-level impact of climate change on family food self-sufficiency and evaluated potential adaptation options of crop management. Using three years of experimental data on maize and millet from an area in southern Mali representing the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa we calibrated and tested the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Changes in future rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and their simulated effects on maize and millet yield were analysed for climate change predictions of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 4.5 Wm(-2) and 8.5 Wm(-2) radiative forcing scenario (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5). In southern Mali, annual maximum and minimum temperatures will increase by 2.9 degrees C and 33 degrees C by the mid-century (2040-2069) as compared with the baseline (1980-2009) under the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Predicted changes in the total seasonal rainfall differed between the GCMs, but on average, seasonal rainfall was predicted not to change. By mid-century maize grain yields were predicted to decrease by 51% and 57% under current farmer's fertilizer practices in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenarios respectively. APSIM model predictions indicated that the use of mineral fertilizer at recommended rates cannot fully offset the impact of climate change but can buffer the losses in maize yield up to 46% and 51% of the baseline yield. Millet yield losses were predicted to be less severe under current farmer's fertilizer practices by mid-century i.e. 7% and 12% in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Use of mineral fertilizer on millet can offset the predicted yield losses resulting in yield increases under both emission scenarios. Under future climate and current cropping practices, food availability is expected to reduce for all farm types in southern Mali. However, large and medium-sized farms can still achieve food self-sufficiency if early planting and recommended rates of fertilizer are applied. Small farms, which are already food insecure, will experience a further decrease in food self-sufficiency, with adaptive measures of early planting and fertilizer use unable to help them achieve food self-sufficiency. By taking into account the diversity in farm households that is typical for the region, we illustrated that crop management strategies must be tailored to the capacity and resource endowment of local farmers. Our place-based findings can support decision making by extension and development agents and policy makers in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ammonia Volatilization from Urea Treated with NBPT and Two Nitrification Inhibitors
VL  - 109

SP  - 378-387
AB  - Nitrification inhibitors reduce the rate of transformation of ammonium to nitrate, which may increase ammonia volatilization from urea-based N fertilizers. The objective of this study was to quantify ammonia volatilization from surface-applied granular urea treated with combinations of NBPT and the nitrification inhibitors, DCD and nitrapyrin, under controlled laboratory conditions for three soils. Nine laboratory trials evaluated select combinations of application rates for NBPT, DCD, and nitrapyrin-treated urea. Trials were conducted on three soils selected for differences in pH, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Cumulative N loss as ammonia from untreated granular urea was 40.1, 44.5, and 38.2% of applied N for the Raub, Wheeling, and Pella soils, respectively. When the urease inhibitor, NBPT was applied alone at 900 mg NBPT kg(-1) urea, N loss through volatilization was reduced 48.5, 43.3, and 77.9% for the Raub, Wheeling and Pella soil types, respectively. Of the soil tested, cation exchange, texture, and organic matter had the greatest impact on the rate and cumulative ammonia loss from surface-applied untreated urea and urea treated with the urease/nitrification inhibitors. Nitrification inhibitors prevented the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by DCD and nitrapyrin, increasing ammonia losses of N in five out of six trials compared to untreated urea. When using nitrification inhibitors with surface-applied urea, ammonia losses were decreased with the application of NBPT as well.

VL  - 7

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. The complex relationships among the components of C cycle make the modelling of SOC variation difficult. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are models capable to determine interrelationships based on information. The objective was to develop and evaluate models based on the ANN technique to estimate the SOC in Mollisols of the Southeastern of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (SEBA). Data from three long term experiments were used. Management and meteorological variables were selected as input. Management information included numerical variables (initial SOC (SOCI); number of years from the beginning of the experiment (Year), proportion of soybean in the crop sequence; (Prop soybean); crop yields (Yield), proportion of cropping in the crop rotation (Prop agri), and categorical variables (Crop, Tillage). In addition, two meteorological inputs (minimum (Tmin) and mean air temperature (Tmed)), were selected. The ANNs were adequate to estimate SOC in the upper 0.20 m of Mollisols of the SEBA. The model with the best performance included six management variables (SOCI, Year, Prop soybean, Tillage, Yield, Prop agri) and one meteorological variable (Tmin), all of them easily available and with low level of uncertainty. Soil organic C changes related to soil use in the SEBA could be satisfactorily estimated using an ANN developed with simple and easily available input variables. Artificial neural network technique appears as a valuable tool to develop robust models to help predicting SOC changes.

AB  - A study of single-phase convection and flow condensation heat transfer in horizontal copper tubes (8.81 mm inside diameter) was conducted using three refrigerants (HCFC-22, HFC-134a and HFC-410A). A smooth tube and three micro-fin tubes (axial, helical and crosshatch enhancement) were examined. Local-mean flow condensation data were experimentally obtained. Experimental conditions were selected to reflect typical operating conditions encountered in refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. All micro-fin tubes illustrated significant enhancement in single-phase convection and flow condensation. The cross-hatch enhancement performed particularly better in both single-phase convection and flow condensation. For the three refrigerants investigated, the refrigerant type seemed to have little influence on the enhancement mechanism of the micro-fin tubes examined. The experimental results are presented in Part I. Development of design equations is presented in Part II.

TI  - The genomic basis of circadian and circalunar timing adaptations in a midge
VL  - 540
IS  - 7631
SP  - 69-+
AB  - Organisms use endogenous clocks to anticipate regular environmental cycles, such as days and tides. Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus, a marine midge whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 (CaMKII. 1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII activity in Drosophila melanogaster, and C. marinus (Cma)-CaMKII.1 increases the transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma-CLOCK and Cma-CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for natural adaptation in circadian timing.

VL  - 6
IS  - 16
SP  - 5771-5787
AB  - Steep genetic clines resulting from recent secondary contact between previously isolated taxa can either gradually erode over time or be stabilized by factors such as ecological selection or selection against hybrids. We used patterns of variation in 30 nuclear and two mitochondrial SNPs to examine the factors that could be involved in stabilizing clines across a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Increased heterozygote deficit and cytonuclear disequilibrium in populations near the center of the mtDNA cline suggest that some form of reproductive isolation such as assortative mating or selection against hybrids may be acting in this hybrid zone. However, only a small number of loci exhibited these signatures, suggesting locus-specific, rather than genomewide, factors. Fourteen of the 32 loci surveyed had cline widths inconsistent with neutral expectations, with two SNPs in the mitochondrial genome exhibiting the steepest clines. Seven of the 12 putatively non-neutral nuclear clines were for SNPs in genes related to oxidative metabolism. Among these putatively non-neutral nuclear clines, SNPs in two nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (SLC25A3 and HDDC2), as well as SNPs in the myoglobin, 40S ribosomal protein S17, and actin-binding LIM protein genes, had clines that were coincident and concordant with the mitochondrial clines. When hybrid index was calculated using this subset of loci, the frequency distribution of hybrid indices for a population located at the mtDNA cline center was non-unimodal, suggesting selection against advanced-generation hybrids, possibly due to effects on processes involved in oxidative metabolism.

TI  - Wolbachia in European Populations of the Invasive Pest Drosophila suzukii: Regional Variation in Infection Frequencies
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The invasive pest Drosophila suzukii is characterized by a specific fresh-fruit targeting behavior and has quickly become a menace for the fruit economy of newly infested North American and European regions. D. suzukii carries a strain of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, named wSuz, which has a low infection frequency and no reproductive manipulation capabilities in American populations of D. suzukii. To further understand the nature of wSuz biology and assess its utility as a tool for controlling this pest's populations, we investigated the prevalence of Wolbachia in 23 European D. suzukii populations, and compared our results with those available in American populations. Our data showed a highly variable infection frequency with a mean prevalence of 46%, which is significantly higher than the 17% found in American populations. Based on Multilocus Sequence Typing analysis, a single wSuz strain was diagnosed in all European populations of D. suzukii. In agreement with American data, we found no evidence of cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by wSuz. These findings raise two questions: a) why Wolbachia is maintained in field populations of D. suzukii and b) what are the selective forces responsible for the variation in prevalence within populations, particularly between European and American continents? Our results provide new insights into the D. suzukii-Wolbachia association and highlight regional variations that await further investigation and that should be taken into account for using Wolbachia-based pest management programs.

TI  - Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation through Agroforestry systems in Wolaita zone, Southern Highland of Ethiopia
VL  - 33
SP  - 209-221
AB  - Climate change is one of the most serious threats the world faces. It will have disproportionate impacts on millions of poor rural people in Ethiopia. For development work to be effective, it should not only help rural people emerge from poverty, it should also enable them to cope with and mitigate the impact of climate change. Agriculture is the human enterprise that is most vulnerable to climate change, because of the subsistence nature of the farming practices. Farmer's adaptive capacity is constrained by a lack of economic and technical resources, and they are vulnerable due to a strong dependence on rain-fed crops. While agroforestry may play a significant role in mitigating the atmospheric accumulation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), it also has a role to play in helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. This paper examines the mitigation and adaptation potential of home garden and tree-based agroforestry systems. The planting of fast growing and nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs releases nitrogen for crop growth and save fertilizers. They also buffer climate extremes and temperature increases. Within the Sodo reforestation project mainly Grevillea robusta is used due to its improvements by fixing nitrogen without chemical effects on the soil. The research focuses on the role of agroforestry in both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It is recommended that in low-income and food-deficit regions livelihoods including food security and climate change cannot be tackled in isolation.

SP  - 213-220
AB  - Due to its significant reliance on weather patterns, as well as other environmental factors, agricultural production is particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Adoption of climate change mitigating strategies are key to coping and building resilience against the vagaries of climate change and hence, increasing agricultural poverty, and lifting rural smallholder farmers out of poverty and food insecurity. This study analyzed the factors influencing the adoption of climate change mitigating measures by smallholder farmers in Imo State, Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used is selecting 60 respondents were used for the study. Primary data, collected using structured questionnaire, were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as frequency counts and percentages, mean, likert scale type analysis and probit regression. Results showed that unusual early rains followed by weeks of dryness, high temperature, incidence of diseases, heavy rainfall, decrease in soil fertility, increase in pest problems, erratic rainfall pattern, loss of forest resources, reduced harmattan, flooding, soil erosion, heavy winds, thunderstorms, heavy and long period of rainfall, weed infestation, overflowing of rivers and streams, and extinction of some crop species were some of the major effects or manifestations of climate change and they have severe effect on crop production. Also, climate change mitigation measures mostly adopted by the farmers were drainage/flood barrier construction, multiple cropping, mulching, use of improved varieties of crops, change of planting date, irrigation of crops, planting of cover crops, and tree planting. The probit regression showed that the significant variables influencing adoption of climate change mitigation measures were age of the farmer, farming experience, tenancy status, years of education, extension contact, income, access to credit and membership of farmers' association. Education and training of farmers especially as it pertains adoption of good agricultural practices was recommended, as well as the provision of credit to enable them adopt mitigation measures to climate change.

VL  - 16
IS  - 1
SP  - 118-136
AB  - Fertilization of Pinus radiata plantations mid-rotation after thinning can alter soil nitrogen availability. However, the magnitudes and durations of tree and stand growth responses are not well understood across different soils with specific site conditions. Two mid-rotation fertilization trials in Pinus radiata plantations with unexpected sustained growth responses for more than 6 years and volume gains of 25 m(3) ha(-1) and 50 m(3) ha(-1) in sandy and granitic soils, respectively, and one trial with no response to fertilization were selected to study the monthly dynamics of nitrogen availability and net mineralization using in situ core incubations. After 2 years, the results showed that fertilization increased nitrogen mineralization and availability until 6 years in sandy soil and until 7 years in granitic soil following fertilization. This result explained the sustained stand growth response observed at these sites. When considering the magnitude of the response, large increases in mineralization rates and soil N availability were observed in the granitic soil relative to the sandy soils. Our results suggest that stands with available N-(NH4+ + NO3-) evels less than 2 kg ha(-1) during spring and fall months or with N-(NO3-) levels lower than 0.2 kg ha(-1) during any month may respond to N fertilization.

VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 2376-2383
AB  - Indoles and indole-derivatives can be used to site-specifically label proteins on lysine and N-terminal amino groups under mild, nondenaturing reaction conditions. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and a-lactalbumin were labeled with indole, fluoroindole, or fluoroindole-2-carboxylate via electrophilic aromatic substitutions to lysine side chain N epsilon- and N-terminal amino imines, formed in situ in the presence of formaldehyde. The reaction is highly site-selective, easily controlled by temperature, and does not eliminate the native charge of the protein, unlike many other common lysine-specific labeling strategies. F-19 NMR was used to monitor reaction progression, and in the case of HEWL, unique resonances for each labeled side chain could be resolved. We demonstrate that the indole tags are highly selective for primary amino groups. F-19 NMR demonstrates that each lysine exhibits a different rate of conjugation to indoles making it possible to employ these tags as a means of probing surface topology by NMR or mass spectrometry. Given the site-specificity of this tagging method, the mildness of the reaction conditions (aqueous, buffered, or unbuffered) and the low stoichiometry required for the reaction, indole-derivatives should serve as a valuable addition to the bioconjugation toolkit. We propose that labeling lysine side chains and N-terminal amino groups with indoles is a versatile and general strategy for bioconjugations with substituted indoles having broad implications for protein functionalization.

SP  - 488-496
AB  - This study examined how genotypes of Daphnia pulicaria from a single population, separated by thousands of generations of evolution in the wild, differ in their sensitivity to a novel anthropogenic stressor. These genotypes were resurrected from preserved resting eggs isolated from sediments belonging to three time periods: 2002-2008, 1967-1977, and 1301-1646 A.D. Toxicity of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos was determined through a series of acute toxicity tests. There was a significant dose-response effect in all genotypes studied. Moreover, significant variation in toxicity among genotypes within each time period was detected. Importantly, a significant effect of time period on sensitivity to chlorpyrifos was found. Analysis of the median effect concentrations (EC50s) for genotypes within each time period indicated that the 1301-1646 genotypes were 2.7 times more sensitive than the 1967-1977 genotypes. This trend may be partially explained by microevolutionary shifts in response to cultural eutrophication.

VL  - 162
IS  - 4
SP  - A760-A767
AB  - Li-ion pouch cells were made to study the factors that influence gas evolution during formation (first charge). Electrode materials, electrolyte additives and temperature were varied. Measurements were made using the Archimedes' In Situ Gas Analyzer at Dalhousie University. When cells are charged to high voltages (>4.2 V) there is gas evolution, presumed to be from reactions on the surface of the positive electrode. This is separate from the gas evolution known to happen at lower voltage (<3.5 V) caused by reactions on the negative electrode. Both evolutions were characterized by the magnitude of volume changes and their onset voltages. Gas volumes appear to increase and onset voltages decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Use of the additive prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone at 2% by weight in Li[Ni0.42Mn0.42Co0.16]O-2/graphite cells yields smaller volume and higher onset voltage of gas evolution at all temperatures, compared to other additives tested. Certain cathode materials, namely some coated LiCoO2 samples, can be charged to high voltages (<= 4.7 V) without producing gas at high voltage. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

TI  - Length distributed measurement of temperature effects in Yb-doped fibers during pumping
VL  - 53
IS  - 6
AB  - We demonstrate a distributed measurement technique to observe temperature changes along pumped Yb-doped fibers. This technique is based on an array of fiber Bragg gratings acting as a temperature sensor line. The Bragg gratings are inscribed directly into the Yb-doped fiber core using high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses and an interferometric setup. We studied the temperature evolution in differently co-doped Yb fibers during optical pumping and identified different effects contributing to the observed temperature increase. We found that preloading of fibers with hydrogen supports the formation of Yb2+ during UV irradiation and has a large impact on fiber temperature during pumping. The proposed technique can be applied to investigate the homogeneity of pump absorption in active fibers and to support spatially resolved photodarkening measurements. (c) The Authors.

VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 410-420
AB  - Thrips-transmitted Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has a broad host range including crops and weeds. In Georgia, TSWV is known to consistently affect peanut, tomato, pepper, and tobacco production. These crops are grown from March through November. In the crop-free period, weeds are presumed to serve as a green bridge for thrips and TSWV. Previous studies have identified several winter weeds as TSWV and thrips hosts. However, their ability to influence TSWV transmission in crops is still not completely understood. To further understand these interactions, population dynamics of two prevalent vectors, viz., Frankliniella fusca (Hinds) and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), on selected winter weeds were monitored from October through April in four counties from 2004 to 2008. Peak populations were typically recorded in March. F. fusca and F. occidentalis adults were found on winter weeds and their percentages ranged from 0 to 68% in comparison with other adults. Immatures outnumbered all adults. Microcosm experiments indicated that the selected winter weeds differentially supported F. fusca reproduction and development. The time required to complete one generation (adult to adult) ranged from 11 to 16 d. Adult recovery ranged from 0.97 to 2.2 per female released. In addition, transmission assays revealed that thrips efficiently transmitted TSWV from peanut to weeds, the incidence of infection ranged from 10 to 55%. Back transmission assays with thrips from TSWV-infected weeds resulted in up to 75% TSWV infection in peanut. These whole-plant transmission and back transmission assays provide the basis for TSWV persistence in farmscapes year round.

TI  - Effect of Temperature on Gold Dissolution in Acidic Media
VL  - 161
IS  - 9
SP  - H501-H507
AB  - Temperature has a tremendous effect on the rate and amount of gold dissolution. In potentiodynamic experiments the total amount of dissolved gold increases by a factor of 4.5 when the temperature is increased from 25 to 75 degrees C. Moreover, the previously reported correlation between the onset of oxide formation and the commencement of the dissolution process is found to be correct for all studied temperatures. Negative shift in the advent of oxidation is accompanied by a similar shift in the dissolution onset potential. Similarly, the dissolution rate rises significantly with temperature during potentiostatic and galvanostatic polarization steps. A correlation between the temperature-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and gold dissolution is found. Arrhenius plots for the OER and gold dissolution are used to obtain information on the apparent activation energy EA for both processes. It is found that for OER and Au dissolution E-A = 57 kJ mol(-1). The later finding suggests that there is a common intermediate for both reactions, the formation of which constitutes the rate-determining step. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

VL  - 135
SP  - 128-136
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess size and morphological changes in response to temperature in the marine diatom, Ditylum brightwellii (West) Grunow, using ecological, morphological and physiological approaches. D. brightwellii has two distinct cell morphologies: prism (large-sized cell) and cylinder types (small-sized cell). In the coastal waters of South Korea, the prism type was found to be present at high frequency at low temperatures, whereas the cylinder type was predominant at high temperatures. Other environmental factors did not affect the presence of either cell type significantly. In growth experiments to determine the effect of temperature on the size of D. brightwellii, the abundance of the prism type increased at low temperature, but the abundance of the cylinder type increased at high temperature. These results are important for understanding temperature-induced size and morphological changes in D. brightwellii, and their potential role as an adaptive strategy.

AB  - Fruit flies were used by several laboratories between 1901 and 1910 for studies of experimental evolution at Harvard, Indiana University, and Cold Spring Harbor before Thomas Hunt Morgan found his white-eyed mutation that we associate with the beginnings of the fly lab at Columbia University. The major players prior to Morgan were William Castle and his students at Harvard University, Frank Lutz at Cold Spring Harbor, and Fernandus Payne whose ideas for working with fruit flies were shaped by his studies of blind cave fauna at Indiana University. Payne's interests were stimulated by the work of Carl Eigenmann, an authority on blind cave fauna, and William Moenkhaus, who introduced Payne to fruit flies at Indiana University before Payne moved to Columbia to pursue graduate work with Morgan and Edmund Wilson. The motivations of the laboratories differed in the theories used for their work. Castle spread the word about the utility of fruit flies for research, but Payne gave Morgan his first fruit flies for research leading to the discovery of the white-eye mutation.

TI  - A Novel C-Type Lysozyme from Mytilus galloprovincialis: Insight into Innate Immunity and Molecular Evolution of Invertebrate C-Type Lysozymes
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
AB  - A c-type lysozyme (named as MgCLYZ) gene was cloned from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Blast analysis indicated that MgCLYZ was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. The nucleotide sequence of MgCLYZ was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. The deduced mature peptide of MgCLYZ was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kD and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 8.08. Evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during evolution. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, MgCLYZ transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The optimal temperature and pH of recombinant MgCLYZ (rMgCLYZ) were 20 degrees C and 4, respectively. The rMgCLYZ displayed lytic activities against Gram-positive bacteria including Micrococcus luteus and Staphyloccocus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria including Vibrio anguillarum, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus aquimaris. These results suggest that MgCLYZ perhaps play an important role in innate immunity of M. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

TI  - Positive Selection within a Diatom Species Acts on Putative Protein Interactions and Transcriptional Regulation
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 422-434
AB  - Diatoms are the most species-rich group of microalgae, and their contribution to marine primary production is important on a global scale. Diatoms can form dense blooms through rapid asexual reproduction; mutations acquired and propagated during blooms likely provide the genetic, and thus phenotypic, variability upon which natural selection may act. Positive selection was tested using genome and transcriptome-wide pair-wise comparisons of homologs in three genera of diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia, Ditylum, and Thalassiosira) that represent decreasing phylogenetic distances. The signal of positive selection was greatest between two strains of Thalassiosira pseudonana. Further testing among seven strains of T. pseudonana yielded 809 candidate genes of positive selection, which are 7% of the protein-coding genes. Orphan genes and genes encoding protein-binding domains and transcriptional regulators were enriched within the set of positively selected genes relative to the genome as a whole. Positively selected genes were linked to the potential selective pressures of nutrient limitation and sea surface temperature based on analysis of gene expression profiles and identification of positively selected genes in subsets of strains from locations with similar environmental conditions. The identification of positively selected genes presents an opportunity to test new hypotheses in natural populations and the laboratory that integrate selected genotypes in T. pseudonana with their associated phenotypes and selective forces.

VL  - 1297
SP  - 83-97
AB  - Local adaptation and species interactions have been shown to affect geographic ranges; therefore, we need models of climate impact that include both factors. To identify possible dynamics of species when including these factors, we ran simulations of two competing species using an individual-based, coupled map-lattice model using a linear climatic gradient that varies across latitude and is warmed over time. Reproductive success is governed by an individual's adaptation to local climate as well as its location relative to global constraints. In exploratory experiments varying the strength of adaptation and competition, competition reduces genetic diversity and slows range change, although the two species can coexist in the absence of climate change and shift in the absence of competitors. We also found that one species can drive the other to extinction, sometimes long after climate change ends. Weak selection on local adaptation and poor dispersal ability also caused surfing of cooler-adapted phenotypes from the expanding margin backwards, causing loss of warmer-adapted phenotypes. Finally, geographic ranges can become disjointed, losing centrally-adapted genotypes. These initial results suggest that the interplay between local adaptation and interspecific competition can significantly influence species' responses to climate change, in a way that demands future research.

TI  - Assessing European Egg Parasitoids as a Mean of Controlling the Invasive South American Tomato Pinworm Tuta absoluta
VL  - 7
IS  - 10
AB  - The South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta) has recently invaded Europe and is rapidly spreading in the Afro-Eurasian continent where it is becoming a major pest on tomato crops. Laboratory tests were undertaken to evaluate the potential of 29 European strains of Trichogramma parasitoids to control T. absoluta. In addition to the host itself, the host plant (tomato) was used during the laboratory tests in order to increase the chance of selecting the best parasitoid strains. Trichogramma females were placed with T. absoluta eggs on a tomato leaflet in tubes. We compared the parasitism of T. absoluta by the various Trichogramma species tested to the Trichogramma species currently commercially available for the pest control in Europe, i.e. Trichogramma achaeae. Thereafter, the more promising strains were tested on a larger scale, in mesocosm (i.e. cages in greenhouses) and in greenhouse compartments to evaluate efficiency of laboratory selected strains under cropping conditions. The most efficient strain from the laboratory screening trials did not perform as efficiently under the greenhouse conditions. We discuss differences in parasitism levels among species and strains and among the different scales tested in the experiments, as well as implications of these results for further screening for biocontrol agents.

VL  - 156
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-30
AB  - We have used low temperatures (down to -20 degrees C) and high pressures (up to 2000 bar) to populate low-lying excited state conformers of hen lysozyme, and have analyzed their structures site-specifically using N-15/H-1 two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The resonances of a number of residues were found to be selectively broadened, as the temperature was lowered at a pressure of 2000 bar. The resulting disappearance of cross-peaks includes those of residues in the beta-domain of the protein and the cleft between the beta- and alpha-domains, both located close to water-containing cavities. The results indicate that low-lying excited state conformers of hen lysozyme are characterized by slowly fluctuating local conformations around these cavities, attributed to the opportunities for water molecules to penetrate into the cavities. Furthermore, we have found that these water-containing cavities are conserved in similar positions in lysozymes from a range of different biological species, indicating that they are a common evolutionary feature of this family of enzymes.

VL  - 66
SP  - 789-796
AB  - Currently, the great majority of the data that are used for solving macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography are collected at cryogenic temperatures. Selection of a suitable cryoprotectant, which ensures crystal stability at low temperatures, is critical for the success of a particular diffraction experiment. The effectiveness of salts of organic acids as potential cryoprotective agents is presented in the following work. Sodium formate, acetate, malonate and citrate were tested, as were sodium potassium tartrate and acetate in the form of potassium and ammonium salts. For each salt investigated, the minimal concentration that was required for successful cryoprotection was determined over the pH range 4.5-9.5. The cryoprotective ability of these organic salts depends upon the number of carboxylic groups; the lowest concentration required for cryoprotection was observed at neutral pH. Case-study experiments conducted using the tetragonal form of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) confirmed that salts of organic acids can successfully act as cryoprotective agents of protein crystals grown from high concentrations of inorganic salts. When crystals are grown from solutions containing a sufficient concentration of organic acid salts no additional cryoprotection is needed as the crystals can safely be frozen directly from the crystallizing buffers.

TI  - Abundance analysis for long period variables Velocity effects studied with O-rich dynamic model atmospheres
VL  - 517
AB  - Context. Measuring the surface abundances of AGB stars is an important tool for studying the effects of nucleosynthesis and mixing in the interior of low-to intermediate mass stars during their final evolutionary phases. The atmospheres of AGB stars can be strongly affected by stellar pulsation and the development of a stellar wind, though, and the abundance determination of these objects should therefore be based on dynamic model atmospheres. Aims. We investigate the effects of stellar pulsation and mass loss on the appearance of selected spectral features (line profiles, line intensities) and on the derived elemental abundances by performing a systematic comparison of hydrostatic and dynamic model atmospheres. Methods. High-resolution synthetic spectra in the near infrared range were calculated based on two dynamic model atmospheres (at various phases during the pulsation cycle) as well as a grid of hydrostatic COMARCS models with effective temperatures T-eff and surface gravities log g over an adequate range. Equivalent widths of a selection of atomic and molecular lines (Fe, OH, CO) were derived in both cases and compared with each other. Results. In the case of the dynamic models, the equivalent widths of all investigated features vary over the pulsation cycle. A consistent reproduction of the derived variations with a set of hydrostatic models is not possible, but several individual phases and spectral features can be reproduced well with the help of specific hydrostatic atmospheric models. In addition, we show that the variations in equivalent width that we found on the basis of the adopted state-of-the-art dynamic model atmospheres agree qualitatively with observational results for the Mira R Cas over its light cycle. Conclusions. The findings of our modelling form a starting point to deal with the problem of abundance determination in strongly dynamic AGB stars (i.e., long-period variables). Our results illustrate that some quantities such as the C/O ratio can probably still be determined to a reasonable accuracy, but the measurement of other quantities will be hampered by the dynamics. The qualitative agreement with observations of R Cas opens promising possibilities for a forthcoming quantitative comparison of our synthetic spectra with observed ones of AGB variables in the globular cluster 47 Tuc.

TI  - Importance of environmental and spatial gradients on patterns and consequences of resource selection
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
SP  - 1021-1039
AB  - Strategies to conserve rare species require identifying resources that function as important habitat elements and that promote high demographic performance. Assessing the relative importance of resources, however, can be confounded by natural variation in resource availability and by the hierarchical spatial structure in which resources are organized. Because availability and relative importance of resources often vary across environmental and spatial gradients, we used gradients together with resource selection functions and variance decomposition to assess the relative importance of resources to nest site selection and reproductive performance of Ferruginous Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium brasilianum). We measured habitat characteristics of 106 nests and paired available sites at five spatial scales across a 220-km gradient of precipitation and vegetation in northwest Mexico, in a region adjacent to the southwestern United States where pygmy-owls have declined to near extinction. Resources explained 76-85% of variation in nest site selection and 21-31% of variation in reproductive performance across all spatial scales combined. Although we found evidence of resource selection at each scale, the magnitude of selection and influence of resources on reproductive performance were greatest where availability of selected resources were low and where temperature extremes and predation risk likely increased the relative importance of these resources. At larger scales, geographic changes in resource use corresponded with changes in availability, whereas at smaller scales, resource use varied little despite changes in availability, suggesting higher specificity and importance of resources at smaller scales. At the smallest scale, owls selected nest cavities with smaller entrances, larger volume, greater height, and orientations that produced cooler microclimates in the hottest regions of the study area; these choices promoted higher reproductive performance. Cavity resources explained more variation in selection and reproductive performance than resources at larger scales, highlighting their importance as conservation targets. High correlation of resource characteristics among spatial scales, however, indicated that selection of resources at small scales depended on characteristics of resources at larger scales. Assessing how resource selection changes in response to underlying variation in resource availability can help prioritize resources most important for conservation and management.

TI  - Habitat selectivity of substrate-spawning fish: modelling requirements for the Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis
VL  - 398
SP  - 235-243
AB  - Substrate spawning fish are believed to be selective in their choice of spawning habitat, yet few studies have shown the relative importance of different characteristics in terms of habitat quality. We used an extensive and detailed dataset to identify the factors that govern both large-scale (10(3) to 10(5) m) and local-scale (10(1) to 10(2) m) selection by a substrate-spawning fish, the Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis L. Distribution of spawning habitat was strongly dependent on habitat characteristics defined by substrate, wave exposure, temperature and depth. The most important predictor was the type of spawning substrate, which generally consisted of different types of vegetation. Substrates providing rigidity and structural complexity were preferred, despite abundant presence of other substrate types. Shallow depth and sheltered areas were also selected habitat characteristics. The response to temperature was scale-dependent, with a stronger selection expressed at the local scale. The specific selectivity suggests that spawning patterns can be successfully modelled with sufficient detail using only a few fundamental environmental variables. Wave exposure and depth are readily available for large-scale spatial predictions, while temperature and substrate require further development in most coastal areas. The high specificity of the characteristics determining habitat quality suggests that it should be possible to apply this modelling approach for identification and conservation of spawning habitats of Eurasian perch and other substrate-spawning fishes in coastal waters.

VL  - 75
IS  - 1
SP  - C49-C54
AB  - In this article, we prepared a novel imprinted polymer by a room temperature ionic liquid-mediated surface molecular imprinting technique in in combination with a sol-gel process. This polymer was characterized by static and kinetic adsorption experiments and exhibited good recognition ability and offered fast kinetics for the adsorption of Para Red. A simple and sensitive analytical method, based on the coupling of molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), had been developed for determination of trace Para Red. With a loading flow, rate of 0.42 mL min(-1) for 25 mL, an enrichment factor of 1061 was achieved. Under the selected experimental condition, the detection limit (S/N = 3) of Para Red was 6.6 ng L-1, and the peak area precision (RSD) for 5 replicate detections of 0.15 mu g L-1 Para Red was 4.1%. The applicability of this method for determination of the blank chili sauce sample, spiked with Para Red at 5 to 25 ng g(-1) levels, was demonstrated, with recoveries ranging from 86% to 95%. Practical Application: In this paper, a simple and sensitive analytical method, based on the coupling of molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction with high performance liquid chromatography, had been developed for determination of trace Para Red. It was applied to the analysis of spiking Para Red in chili sauce sample with satisfactory recovery and repatability. This proposed method has the potential to be used for monitoring the illegal addition of Para Red in foods in the future due to its simple, reliable, rapid, and excellent precision.

TI  - Independent Recruitment of F Box Genes to Regulate Hermaphrodite Development during Nematode Evolution
VL  - 19
IS  - 21
SP  - 1853-1860
AB  - Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that created ancient complex traits like insect wings is difficult. Fortunately, some complex traits have arisen recently. For example, hermaphroditic reproduction evolved independently many times during recent nematode evolution [1-3]. Although C. elegans hermaphrodites require fog-2 [4], which encodes an F box protein that regulates the translation of tra-2 mRNAs [5, 6], the related species C. briggsae lacks fog-2 [7]. We identified a critical regulator of hermaphrodite development in C. briggsae, named she-1. Analysis of double mutants indicates that she-1 acts upstream of tra-2 in C. briggsae, just as fog-2 does in C. elegans. Molecular cloning shows that she-1 encodes a novel F box protein that was created by a recent gene duplication. Whereas FOG-2 acts through GLD-1 in C. elegans, SHE-1 does not bind GLD-1 in C. briggsae. Thus, both species recruited F box genes produced by recent duplication events into the sex-determination pathway to control hermaphrodite development, but these genes have distinct activities. This result implies that some gene families are more likely to give rise to novel regulatory genes than other families. Finally, we note that null mutations of she-1 are temperature sensitive, so C. briggsae might once have been a facultative hermaphrodite.

VL  - 47
IS  - 9
SP  - 769-777
AB  - To modify the level and composition of isoflavones, the important bioactive constituents of soybean seeds, soybean was transformed via co-bombardment of embryogenic cultures with three DNA cassettes containing the CHS6-chalcone synthase and IFS2-isoflavone synthase genes, and a fragment of PAL5-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene, all in sense orientation under the lectin promoter mixed with the selectable marker gene, HPT (hygromycin phosphotransferase) under the 355 promoter. Four of six fertile lines produced integrated all four genes. Isoflavone levels were lower in T1 mature seeds of 5 of the 6 lines compared to the control. Transgene segregation was found in one selected line, with formation of additional sublines with different transgene composition found also in the homozygous plants. Decreased isoflavone concentrations (by about 70%) were found in T4 homozygous seeds of the two lines studied in detail here. The embryo axes accumulated most of the glycitein and contained a higher isoflavone concentration than the cotyledons. Expression of transgenes driven by the lectin promoter reduced the isoflavone concentration only in the cotyledons and not in embryo axes, indicating that this promoter is preferably active in cotyledons.

AB  - The current study investigated the changes in sperm quality (motility, velocity, and chromatin integrity) occurring during storage at room temperature or 5 degrees C for up to 48 hours in spermatozoa after extension or single-layer centrifugation (SLC) throught Androcoll-E. In unselected samples, all parameters of sperm quality deteriorated significantly during storage (P < .01), although the deterioration was faster at room temperature (22-30 degrees C) than for cool storage (P < .01). The SLC-selected spermatozoa had higher motility, velocity, and chromatin integrity than the overall unselected population (motility: selected 85 +/- 10%, unselected 56 +/- 13%; P < .001; velocity: selected 85.1 +/- 13 mu m/second, unselected 63.5 +/- 15 mu m/second; P < .001; and DFI selected 12.2 +/- 4.8 mu m/second; unselected 23.6 +/- 7.4 mu m/second; P < .001). Furthermore, sperm quality did not deteriorate with storage in the SLC-selected samples, either at room temperature (22-30 degrees C for 24 hours) or cooled to 4 degrees C (for at least 48 hours), whereas a significant deterioration in sperm quality was observed in the unselected sperm samples (P < .01). Thus, room temperature storage of SLC-selected spermatozoa may be an option for insemination doses from stallions whose spermatozoa do not tolerate cooling. In addition, a new sperm analyzer, the Qualisperm, showed good correlation with subjective motility assessment (r = 0.8, P < .001), was user-friendly, and provided a reasonable volume of data. This instrument may be a useful adjunct to sperm quality assessment at the study.

SP  - 499-544
AB  - Throughout the Northern Hemisphere, changes in local and regional climate conditions are coupled to the recurring and persistent large-scale patterns of pressure and circulation anomalies spanning vast geographical areas, the so-called teleconnection patterns. Indeed, the atmospheric fluctuations described by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are closely associated with the last four decades of inter-annual variability in local snow and ice conditions observed in the Arctic. Since the NAO has also been connected with changes in the global climate, the behaviour of species, communities and other ecosystem elements at Zackenberg in relation to the NAO enables us to view these in circumpolar and global contexts. Large-scale systems like the NAO constitute the link between the global change and local climate variability to which ecosystem components respond. Here, we place selected ecosystem elements from the monitoring programme Zackenberg Basic presented in previous chapters in a circumpolar context related to NAO-mediated climatic changes. We begin by linking the local variability in winter weather conditions at Zackenberg to fluctuations in the NAO. We then proceed by linking the observed intra- and inter-annual behaviour of selected ecosystem elements to changes in the NAO. The functional ecosystem characteristics in focus are landscape gas exchange dynamics phenological patterns at different trophic levels, consumer-resource dynamics and community stability. The influence of the NAO is presented and discussed in a broader perspective based on information obtained from other arctic localities. The relation between the NAO and the Zackenberg winter weather, is nonlinear, reflecting differential effects of the NAO as the index moves between high and low phases. The inverse hyperbolic relationship found between the NAO and the amount of winter snow was also evident as non-linear response in organisms and systems to inter-annual changes in the NAO. Responses investigated included growth and reproduction in plants and animals, population dynamics and synchrony, inter-trophic interactions and community stability together with system feedback dynamics.

AB  - Regenerable, embryogenic haploid cell suspensions were initiated and established from type II pollen calluses of two selected Chinese maize genotypes (No 592 Y and 592.A2 LY). The induction frequency of friable, embryogenic callus (type II) was highly dependent on three factors: genotype, medium, cold pretreatment, and on their interactions. Repeated callus and cell selection during the culture procedure led to stable haploid suspensions consisting of fine clusters each containing 20-50 cells. The selected cell lines were able to maintain their morphogenic ability during long-term subculture (2 years). Protoplasts were successfully isolated from subcultured, friable, embryogenic pollen calluses and cultured on N6BM and N6K media using a feeder layer, obtained from 2-day-old suspension culture. Healthy plants were regenerated from protoplast-derived calluses.

VL  - 111

SP  - 1271-1277
AB  - The application of genetic male sterility in hybrid rice production has great potential to revolutionize hybrid seed production methodology. The two-line breeding system by using thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) has been discovered and successfully developed as a breeding strategy in rice. One TGMS gene was investigated by a spontaneous rice mutant line, Sokcho-MS, originated from a Korean japonica variety. It was shown that Sokcho-MS is completely sterile at a temperature higher than 27 degrees C and/or lower than 25 degrees C during the development of spikelets, but fertile at the temperature ranging from 25 to 27 degrees C regardless of the levels of day-length. Genetic analysis and molecular mapping based on SSR, STS and EST markers revealed that a single recessive gene locus involved the control of genic male sterility in Sokcho-MS. By using an F-2 mapping population derived from a cross between Sokcho-MS and a fertile indica variety Neda, the new TGMS gene, designated as tms6, was mapped primarily to the long arm of chromosome 5 of Oryza sativa at the interval between markers E60663 (2.0 cM) and RM440 (5.8 cM). Subsequently, tms6 was fine mapped to the interval between markers RM3351 (0.1 cM) and E60663 (1.9 cM). As tms6 appeared to be independent of other mapped TGMS genes in rice, the genetic basis of Sokcho-MS was further discussed.

VL  - 174
IS  - 8
SP  - 641-648
AB  - Sex differences in metabolic rate (MR) can result from dimorphism in the performance of energetically demanding activities. Male crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) engage in costly calling and aggressive activity not performed by females. Consistent with this difference, we found higher maximal MR, factorial scope, and fat content in males than females. T. oceanicus song is also costly because it attracts the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. Parasitized crickets had reduced maximal MR consistent with a metabolic cost to harboring larvae. This cost was greater for females, either because females invest more heavily into reproduction at the expense of metabolic capacity, or because males are under stronger selection to respond to infection. Little is known about O. ochracea outside of its auditory system and parasitic lifestyle. We observed greater resting MR in male flies, possibly reflecting a sex difference in the requirement for metabolic power output, because male flies perform potentially costly mating behavior not seen in females. We found a positive relationship between larval density within a cricket and pupal resting MR, suggesting that crickets in good condition are able to both harbor more larvae and produce larvae with higher resting MR. These results reveal a complex interplay between the metabolism of crickets and their fly parasitoids.

AB  - The rapidly dividing cleavage stages of embryos do not have the typical responses to cell damage, such as induction of the heat shock response, use of mitotic checkpoints, or use of apoptosis to eliminate severely damaged cells. This could create problems with integrity of DNA, but the solution in these embryos appears to be a "be prepared" approach, in which specific adaptations are used to minimize DNA damage during cleavage and the use of apoptosis at the mid-blastula transition to remove any cells that were nevertheless damaged. It has been assumed that this approach has evolved because of the advantage of rapid production of a motile larvae. Alternatively, this particular approach may have the selective advantage of increasing mutation rate when there are greater environmental stresses. This could provide more variants on which selective pressures could act and thus accelerate evolution during environmentally stressful periods.

VL  - 59

SP  - 1235-1244
AB  - Invasive species have been characterized as tolerant of environmental extremes. This hypothesis was evaluated for invasive aquatic species in North America, particularly Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, and zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Both species have rapid growth, early maturity, short life spans, and elevated fecundity, allowing rapid population recovery after reductions by rarefractive, environmental extremes. Extensive resistance capacities offer little adaptive value to invasive, r-selected species, because population reductions occur in their unstable habitats regardless of degree of stress tolerance. Thus, both species have relatively poor physiologic resistance, depending instead on elevated growth and fecundity for rapid population recovery. In contrast, native North American bivalve species are often adapted to stable habitats where perturbation is infrequent (i.e., freshwater unionoidean bivalves). They are characterized by slow growth, extended life spans, and low effective fecundities, slowing population recoveries (K-selected), and have evolved extensive resistance adaptations to avoid extirpation during environmental extremes. Review of resistance adaptations in other North American aquatic invaders revealed poorer or equivalent physiological tolerance relative to taxonomically related native species, suggesting that extensive physiological tolerance is not required for invasive success.

AB  - The elastic property evolution with increasing temperature of dehydrated polyacrylamide (PAAm) gel has been measured with a vibrometer at several frequencies, The elastic stiffness (Young's modulus) showed marked changes (significant decrease in the real part and a clear peak in the imaginary part) around a characteristic temperature, which shifted toward the higher region with increasing applied frequency, similar to the features observed during the glass transition of noncrystalline polymers. The activation energy of the elastic stiffness relaxation was also calculated with the peak temperature of the imaginary part and the applied frequency. The activation energy value of the dehydrated PAAm gel was in the range usually observed for noncrystalline polymers, based on which dehydrated PAAm gel has been confirmed to have the properties usual for noncrystalline polymer glass from an elastic point of view.

AB  - For Cuvier, between "mathematical sciences" and "moral sciences" lies a space "as vast as it is fertile, that of "natural sciences." These include chemistry, the study of heat, light and electricity, and also natural history. The broad sweep of the latter covers metereology, hydrology, mineralogy, geology, anatomy, physiology and likewise botany and zoology. In this wide field, Cuvier often emphasises the importance of the cristallographie work of Hauy and highlights two major revolutions. The first, in experimental science, is the new chemistry attached to the name of Lavoisier. The other, in the empirical sciences, is the natural method of classification systematized by Jussieu in botany and which Cuvier himself, among others, champions in zoology. Technical and medical innovations are not forgotten, but they are considered applications of scientific progress. In his eulogies of scientists and didactic explanations of discoveries, Cuvier makes a point of recognizing contributions from abroad. He manages, however, to reconcile his chauvinistic concerns with universalism by pointing out that imperial France is renowned for her impartiality.

VL  - 5
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-24
AB  - Supercritical extraction (SFE) is a unit operation that exploits the dissolving power of supercritical fluids (SF) under conditions above their critical temperature and pressure. It is possible to obtain solvent-free extracts using SF and the extraction is faster than using conventional organic solvents. These advantages are due to the high volatility of SF (gases under normal environmental conditions) and improved transport properties (i.e., high diffusivity and low viscosity). When using carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular, moderate-temperature processing and high selectivity towards valuable microconstituents in natural products can be achieved. This article presents a review of transport properties and solubilities in SF, particularly CO2, as well as other underlying factors that are responsible for the kinetics and phase equilibrium in SFE processes. It also describes the selective CO2 extraction of essential oils, pungent principles, carotenoid pigments, antioxidants, antimicrobials, and related substances to be used as ingredients for the food, drug and perfume industries, from spices, herbs and other plant materials. These very important applications are discussed from the point of view of the potential applications of SFE in Latin America. The two most: important commercial applications of SFE in the food industry, namely hop extraction and coffee decaffeination, are reviewed to a limited extent. Some other potential applications briefly described include extraction and fractionation of edible fats and oils, purification of solid matrices, and concentration of fermentation broths, fruit juices and other extracts. In most cases CO2 extracts are compared with counterparts obtained using conventional methods.

AB  - Production of diffraction-quality protein crystals mandates nucleation of a moderate number of crystals. Excessive nucleation can lead to many small crystals of poor morphology, making them useless for structural determination via X-ray crystallography. In this work, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and light scattering are utilized to delineate the liquid-liquid binodal in lysozyme solutions at concentrations typically used for crystal growth (10-50 mg/ml). Such cloud point temperatures are determined over a range of protein concentrations and compared to visually observed nucleation temperatures. In all cases, nucleation occurs at temperatures above the cloud point temperature. Thus, measurement of the cloud point temperature gives the crystal grower a bound on the protein crystal growth problem. Nucleation is reproducibly induced within 2 degrees C of the cloud point temperature; while prior work indicates that growth, when carried out near the saturation temperature, yields high quality crystals. The ease of measuring the cloud point via turbidity measurements allows for the rational selection of an initial temperature to induce protein nucleation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

VL  - 30
IS  - 14
SP  - 2023-2030
AB  - A novel approach, at least for laboratory conditions,:for analysis of the dependence of soil C evolution on temperature is presented. A two-component (labile and refractory organic C) parallel first-order model was fitted to CO2 evolution rates from top- and subsoil, incubated at different combinations of temperature (constant -4, 0.3, 5, 15, 25, weekly fluctuating between -4 and +5 degrees C) and moisture (17, 26, 36 and 50% H2O for the topsoil and 16, 23, 31 and 41% for the subsoil) and to the evolution of CO2 after the addition of roots or stubble of Phalaris arundinacea in the topsoil, measured at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O (Lomander et al., 1998). The size of the pools and their respective first-order rate constants were optimized simultaneously by a least-squares method. The optimization was carried out separately for top- and subsoil. Quadratic functions were fitted to the temperature and moisture responses. For topsoil samples in which roots or stubble were added, a three-component model (labile, refractory and stubble or roots) was used. The initial partitioning of the soil C, the decomposition rate constants for each partition and the temperature and moisture responses were all assumed to be identical to those of pure topsoil, while the initial pool sizes of added roots and straw were measured. The calculated temperature at which CO2 evolution ceased (T-min) was -0.83 degrees C, and a recalculation to Q(10)-values resulted in increasing temperature response with decreasing temperature (Q(10)=22 at 25 degrees C and 12.7 at 0.3 degrees C). Simulated CO2 evolution rates agreed well with the measurements (R-adj(2) = 0.96 and 0.81) for top- and subsoil, respectively. The multi-compartment approach was superior to the single-compartment approach, which gave R-adj(2) = 0.88 and 0.76 for top- and subsoil, respectively. In general, CO2 evol ution rates obtained from the laboratory experiment were higher than those measured in the field; even after differences in temperature and moisture were taken into account. After 300 d in the laboratory at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O. 99% and 86% of the added straw and roots, respectively, had disappeared according to the described model. The CO2-evolution rate per unit of soil carbon was about two times higher for topsoil than for subsoil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 63
IS  - 2
SP  - 153-166
AB  - Intramolecular long-range electron transfer (LRET) in hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) accompanying Trp --> TyrO radical transformation was investigated in aqueous solution by pulse radiolysis as a function of pH (5.2-7.4) and temperature (283-328K). The reaction was induced by highly selective oxidation of Trp with N-3(.) radicals under low concentration of the reactants but at a high HEWL/N-3(.) molar ratio, so that more than 99% of the oxidized protein molecules contained only a single tryptophyl radical. Synchronous decay of Trp(.) and build-up of TyrO(.) conformed satisfactorily to first-order kinetics, indicating that LRET involved either one or more Trp(.)/Tyr redox pairs characterized by similar rate constants. The rate constant of LRET, k(5), increased monotonously with decreasing pH showing the following characteristics: (i) in the pH range 7.4-5.2 the plot of k(5) against pH was sigmoidal in shape, reflecting protonation of Glu35 (pK(a) approximate to 6) and pointing to involvement of conformational control of the kinetics of LRET, (ii) below pH5.2 a sharp increase in k(5) was observed due to the protonation of Trp(.) to form TrpH(.+), which is known to oxidize tyrosine faster than does Trp(.). Arrhenius plots of the temperature-dependence of k(5) showed that the activation energy of LRET varies both with temperature and the protonation state of the enzyme. The activation energies are in the range 7.6-56.0 kJ mol(-1) and are similar to those for activation of amide hydrogen exchange in native HEWL below its denaturation temperature. Selective oxidation by ozone of the Trp62 indole side-chain in HEWL to N'-formylkynurenine (NFKyn62-HEWL) caused a large drop in the initial yield of Trp(.) radicals, G(Trp(.))(i). This was accompanied by a relatively small decrease in k(5) but selective oxidation by ozone had a pronounced effect on its temperature-dependence. Taken together these observations indicate that of the six tryptophans present in HEWL Trp62 contributes about 50% to the yield of the observed LRET. In the enzyme-inhibitor complex, HEWL(GlcNAc)(3), where Trp62 and Trp63 are completely shielded from the solvent by the bound triacetylchitotriose, G(Trp(.))(i) was lower than in NFKyn62-HEWL, and both the kinetic and energetic characteristics of LRET, observed at pH5.2, were again somewhat different than in HEWL alone. Considering known solvent accessibilities of tryptophans in the complex, the observed LRET process in HEWL(GlcNAc)(3) was assigned to Trp123. Theoretical evaluation of the electronic coupling for the dominant LRET pathways between all the potential Trp(.)/Tyr redox couples in HEWL, with help of the PATHWAYS model, enabled Trp62/Tyr53, Trp63/Tyr53 and Trp123/Tyr23 to be identified as the pairs involved in the experimentally observed electron transfer.

TI  - The medionigra gene in the moth Panaxia dominula: The case for selection
VL  - 351
IS  - 1347
SP  - 1623-1634
AB  - Analyses of changes in frequency of the gene medionigra in colonies of the moth Panaxia dominula, begun by R. A. Fisher, E. B. Ford and P. M. Sheppard, have long been regarded as a model study of natural selection under field conditions. Recently, their conclusions have been criticized, on the grounds that phenotypes have been improperly scored and that population structure has been misunderstood. The results are re-examined here, including recent unpublished collections. It is argued that the colonies studied are distinct populations, as usually defined, and that the results could not arise as a result of migration. Fluctuation in population size from year to year, large variance in fecundity and some features of mating behaviour probably reduce the effective number to less than half the estimated population size. Variable expressivity and consequent subjective variation in scoring, casts some doubt on earlier claims that selection fluctuates significantly from generation to generation, and on a reported case of increase in frequency from a very low starting point. However, the one natural and thr ee artificial colonies studied are consistent in providing estimates of selection of 7 per cent or more against medionigra, despite the variation introduced by small population size and scoring difficulties. There appears to be an equilibrium at a low frequency, and the rate of approach to it suggests that the selection is frequency dependent. One artificial colony, at West Kirby on the Wirral, Merseyside, U.K., does not show an equivalent decline. Selection cannot be as strong as indicated elsewhere, but since the population size is small some disadvantage to medionigra cannot be rejected.

TI  - Geographical variation in the larval diapause of Chymomyza costata (Diptera; Drosophilidae)
VL  - 124
IS  - 2
SP  - 151-163
AB  - Induction of the larval diapause in Chymomyza costata is controlled by two mechanisms, temperature-dependent induction and a photoperiodic response. Geographical, clinal variation was observed in both mechanisms. Critical photoperiods increased northwards 1 h 9 min per 5 degrees of latitude. The dine relaxes north of 65 degrees N, however. The critical temperature measured under long-day conditions varied little in areas south of 63 degrees N, but increased from 13 degrees C at that latitude to 17 degrees C at 65 degrees N and to 24 degrees C at 68 degrees N. Selection experiments revealed extensive intrapopulation variation in both diapause characteristics. The mean temperature In the middle of the breeding season for C. costata is above the long-day critical temperature in areas south of 63 degrees N, the same or slightly lower than the critical temperature in areas between 63 degrees N and 66 degrees N and well below the critical temperature in areas north of 67 degrees N. The relative importance of temperature and photoperiod in diapause induction changes from south to north, the photoperiod being the main determinant in the south and temperature assuming the main role in the north. The forms and positions of the two dines can be explained when data on the estimated number of generations per year are combined with data on weather and illumination conditions at each locality.

AB  - Physiological clocks have been selected in various eukaryotic organisms in relation to daily, tidal, lunar and annual cycles of the environment. Insect species are appropriate experimental objects for the analysis of biological timing mechanisms and their evolutionary adaptation to the local environment. The most complex periodic environment occurs in the interface between the land and the sea, i.e., in the range of spring and neap tides. By the combination of 'circadian' and 'circalunar' clocks and their reliably perceptible 'zeitgeber' conditions, a few marine insects can temporally program their development to distinct tidal situations that occur only on distinct lunar days and at a distinct time of day every 14-15 days.

VL  - 168
IS  - 2
SP  - 464-478
AB  - Developmentally regulated, tissue-specific patterns of nuclear lamin expression occur during vertebrate embryogenesis, but little is known regarding lamin ontogeny during the early development of other phyla. cDNA clones encoding a lamin from the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus have been identified, and the full coding region from the former has been sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that this echinoderm lamin is more closely related to vertebrate B-type lamins than to dipteran fly and nematode lamins-the only other invertebrate lamins sequenced to date. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to sea urchin lamin demonstrate that nuclei of unfertilized eggs and embryos exhibit relatively faint immunoreactivity until the differentiation of primary mesenchymal cells, the nuclear envelopes of which become strongly and selectively labeled by anti-lamin antibodies. Northern blots reveal stage-specific fluctuations in a single 4-kb lamin message during early development and, together with immunoblotting data, suggest that the increase in mesenchymal cell nuclear envelope immunoreactivity is due to a quantitative increase in a single type of lamin. These observations demonstrate that, similar to vertebrates, cell differentiation in invertebrates can be accompanied by a change in lamin expression patterns. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF NITROUS-OXIDE FROM SOIL .2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND MODEL TESTING
VL  - 156
IS  - 4
SP  - 266-277
AB  - The dynamic processes controlling N2O evolution in the field are complex; therefore, estimates of long-term evolution from periodic measurements are likely to be unreliable. Greater reliability in such estimations may be possible by reproducing these processes mathematically within a dynamic simulation model. A mathematical hypothesis for denitrification and N2O production was used within a larger ecosystem simulation model to study N2O evolution under laboratory and field conditions. Hourly N2O fluxes estimated by the model were compared with fluxes recorded over an inundated soil core during a 10-day laboratory incubation after a 100-g N Mg-1 amendment with N-15-KNO3. Estimated values were within 20% of those recorded for fluxes, ranging from 0 to 4 mg N m-2 h-1. Recovery of both mineral and labeled N from the amendment after 10 days was estimated within 2 g Mg-1 of recorded values. Hourly N2O fluxes estimated by the model were also compared with fluxes recorded during spring thaws during 2 years at a field site in central Alberta. Fluxes ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 mg N m-2 h-1 were reproduced by the model after different fertilizer treatments. Increased rates of N2O evolution followed periods of saturation in the upper profile caused by snowmelt. These increased rates continued for about 1 week in both years before declining as soil drying progressed. In the model, evolution arose from the volatilization, during drainage, of aqueous N2O generated from biological NO3- reduction that occurred during periods of low aqueoUs O2 concentrations caused by water accumulations in the thawing soil profile. The simulated evolution supports the hypothesis that denitrification accompanies soil thawing after snowmelt at this site.

SP  - 233-242
AB  - Lignosulfonate (LS) has been used as a carrier for micronutrients and has the potential to improve macronutrient fertilizer efficiency, but little is known about the behaviour of LS fertilizer mixtures in soil. A laboratory study was conducted using ammonium lignosulfonate (2.67% wt wt-1) in combination with diammoniumphosphate (DAP), urea (U) and U + DAP incubated in a silty clay loam soil. The experiment monitored CO2 evolution and NH3-N volatilization for 69 d and extractable soil N periodically for 38 d. Addition of LS initially increased CO2 evolution, but only a small proportion (10-22%) of the LS-C was evolved as CO2. Lignosulfonate decreased urea hydrolysis slightly and reduced the proportion of added N volatilized from the LS+U treatment. Lignosulfonate treatments accumulated N in the form of NH4+, suggesting that LS may inhibit nitrification. A larger proportion of added inorganic N was recovered in the LS + fertilizer treatments, indicating that LS may increase fertilizer N availability.

VL  - 43
IS  - 4
SP  - 123-136
AB  - The main objective of the research was to examine the changes in circulating gonadotropin (GTH) in response to a superactive analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ([D-Ala6, Pro9-NEt]-GnRH = GnRHa), combined with dopamine antagonists, in order to formulate a procedure for spawning induction in female tilapia. The fish employed in the experiments were female hybrids (Oreochromis niloticus x O. aureus) 50-250 g. Tilapia gonadotropin (taGTH) was determined by radioimmunoassay previously developed in our laboratory. GnRHa was given at 4 graded doses (1-500-mu-g/kg) and blood was sampled before treatment and 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours thereafter. The doses most effective in elevating GTH level were 10 and 100-mu-g/kg. The catecholamine release inhibitor, reserpine, and the specific dopamine receptor antagonists, pimozide, domperidone and metoclopramide, were all effective in augmenting the increase in circulating GTH in response to GnRHa. When compared at an identical molar dose of 12-mu-mol/kg, pimozide showed slightly higher potency 12 or 24 hours after treatment. Pimozide dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was more effective than in an aqueous suspension (acidified saline containing metabisulfite). In one temperature experiment, fish were reared at 16-degrees-C and then exposed for 60 hours to various temperatures. Basal taGTH levels were 10.45 +/- 0.9 ng/ml at 16-degrees-C, 14.47 +/- 2.0 ng/ml at 26-degrees-C and 19.77 +/- 2.6 at 33-degrees-C. The response to GnRHa was also positively correlated with the temperature. However, the effect of dopamine antagonists was more apparent at the low temperature. In a second experiment, in which the lowest temperature was 19-degrees-C, the taGTH level and the response to GnRHa increased two-fold over that of the previous experiment and was positively correlated with the temperature. The study culminated in two spawning experiments. The reproductive stage of the females selected for these experiments was synchronized by removing the spawn from their mouths. In the first experiment the fish were injected with saline or with the combination of GnRHa (100-mu-g/kg) and metoclopramide dissolved in saline (100-mu-g/kg) and kept at 26-degrees-C. None of the saline-injected controls ovulated while 9/13 of the treated fish spawned within 48 hours. In the second experiment, carried out at 29-degrees-C, the fish were injected with a lower dose of GnRHa (10-mu-g/kg) in combination with domperidone dissolved in DMSO (5 mg/kg). In this experiment none of the control fish but 9/11 of the treated fish ovulated within 12 hours. These protocols can be applied in interspecific crosses of tilapia species.

We have investigated the influences that have education and time periodes between the several processing phases for several annealing times at 100-degrees-C. These three parameters have an effect not only on the alloy transformation temperatures but also on the evolution kinetic of these temperatures in the long run. This fact requires an exact characterization of the alloy state in order to master the industrial reproduction of such processings.

AB  - After seven pediatric cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were diagnosed in a farming community in upstate New York, a questionnaire regarding symptoms and potential risk factors of CFS was distributed to all students enrolled in the same school district. Twenty-one students with symptoms of CFS were identified. Two controls per case matched for age and sex were randomly selected from questionnaire respondents. Health status was verified for all subjects by telephone, and diagnosis of CFS was confirmed by a physician. Information was collected on the following factors: symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of allergy/asthma; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping, and appendicitis. Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of allergy/asthma) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P < .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates). These data suggest that a combination of host and environmental factors, including an infectious agent or agents, are involved in the etiology of CFS.

TI  - The Effects of Migration on Evolutionary Dynamics in Natural Populations of Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 115
AB  - Understanding how major mechanisms of evolution, i.e. selection, gene flow, mutations, and genetic drift, shape natural populations is a major goal of evolutionary biology. Due to climate change, the environment and ranges of species are changing rapidly. Through rapid adaptation, populations can potentially respond to rapid environmental changes. Yet, how gene flow and rapid adaptation work together to shape natural populations is still an open question in biology. North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster provide a strong model to investigate this relationship as they exhibit latitudinal clines, low levels of variation, and rapid adaptation to environmental parameters that change rapidly with season.In this dissertation, I investigate the relationship between migration and rapid adaptation using D. melanogaster as a model system. I first demonstrate that migration may facilitate adaptation due to epistatic interactions through highly replicated laboratory and field experiments where evolutionarily realistic populations are manipulated to simulate a single migration event. I exposed populations to different temperature regimes and used parallelism in responses to determine the direction of the adaptive response. By comparing the responses of populations that received migration to controlled gene flow events and simulated expectations, I showed that migration events might facilitate adaptive responses. Finally, to demonstrate the ecological relevance of migration, I used population genetics and Bayesian inference methods to estimate the connectivity between geographically separate natural populations of D. melanogaster and I showed that mid- and long-range connectivity is likely.These results together demonstrate that migration can be an ecologically realistic mechanism that facilitates adaptive response in nature. The adaptive outcome depends on the genetic architecture of the fitness-associated traits that respond to dynamic selection pressures. This work integrates the phenotypes and their genotypic architectures to explain the evolutionary responses through highly replicated experiments in the laboratory and field. Together, this work represents a novel contribution to the analysis of evolutionary impacts of migration and gene flow in natural populations.

TI  - The Dissolution and Recovery of Critical Materials (Li2CO3 and UF6) from Ionic Liquid
SP  - 176
AB  - Lithium and uranium are critical materials in both the energy industry and for national security. Lithium is necessary for the next generation of batteries and 6Li is valuable for the production of tritium necessary for both fusion energy and to maintain our nuclear stockpiles. Uranium is a fuel source or precursor fuel source for commercially operating nuclear fission power. The monitoring of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) enrichment at foreign facilities is important for the monitoring of nuclear safeguards and enforcement of non-proliferation treaties. Recovery methods for lithium at the end of life of batteries are necessary to ensure abundance of the element for commercial use. The ionic liquid (IL), 1-methyl-1-propylpiperidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([MPPi][TFSI]) has an electrochemical window which encompasses the very negative (–3.04 V vs SHE) reduction potential of lithium. Pathways for direct and indirect dissolution of Li2CO3 into [MPPi][TFSI] were developed. The dissolved LiTFSI species was evaluated electrochemically. Two methods for recovery were explored. The first method consisted of holding the working electrode at one potential, and the second method pulsed the potential of the working electrode. Deposition was exhibited on both gold and several carbon electrodes. The recovered lithium was characterized using PXRD and SEM imaging. The f-elements also typically have negative reduction potentials that are difficult to achieve in aqueous systems and the metals are often produced in traditional molten salts. ILs have the potential to achieve recovery of f-elements without the need for molten salt systems which require high quantities of thermal energy and are corrosive. The direct dissolution of UF6 into [MPPi][TFSI] was completed. The characterization and stability of the dissolved species was evaluated. The UF6 was found to be stable in inert atmosphere in the [MPPi][TFSI]. Characterization was done using XAFS, UV-Vis, FT-IR, and Raman. Three routes for recovery of the uranium were completed. Two routes of recovery involved the precipitation of air and water stable uranium fluoride compounds. It was shown that uranium oxides could be obtained by heating the precipitates with available oxygen. The third route of recovery was electrochemically driven. This method achieved deposits of lithium hydride but was a low throughput method. Precipitates and deposits were evaluated through TGA, SEM-EDS, PXRD, UV-Vis, FT-IR, and Raman. Ultimately it was shown ILs could be used to stabilize the volatile UF6 for conversion to stable waste forms. It was also shown that UF6 in an IL could be shipped to another facility for recovery of the uranium for isotopic evaluation.

TI  - Copepods as a Model System for Exploring the Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Ectotherms
SP  - 143
AB  - Marine ecosystems provide essential habitat to ecologically and economically impactful species and provide humans with a wealth of ecosystem services. With climate change, marine ecosystems are increasing in mean temperature and temperature variability. Marine ectotherms are vulnerable to this change and are important sentinels of warming, as their internal physiology is dependent on the external thermal environment.Copepods are marine ectotherms that play a critical role in trophic transfer and nutrient cycling. Importantly, copepods are relatively short-lived, allowing them to track ocean change as it happens. Together, these qualities make copepods a reliable model for understanding the impacts of global change on marine ectotherms. In this dissertation, I assess the impact of climate change on copepods through three strategies, 1) Examining the vulnerability of the nutrient rich copepod Neocalanus plumchrus to ocean warming, 2) Investigating the roles of plasticity and adaptation in copepod response to climate change stressors, 3) Testing the importance of latitude and life history stage in determining copepod thermal tolerance.My results reveal the nutrient rich copepod Neocalanus plumchrus and the numerically dominant copepod Acartia tonsa are potentially vulnerable to continued warming. Integrating ten years of plankton survey data with satellite temperature data, I find that thermal thresholds vary by copepod species and that the most nutrient rich species, Neocalanus plumchrus, has a relatively low upper thermal threshold for occurrence of 11.5°C. Additionally, results demonstrate that N. plumchrus abundance was reduced during the 2014-2016 marine heatwave. With experimental methods, I demonstrate that Acartia tonsa thermal tolerance is reduced after rapid salinity shock, indicating its susceptibility to simultaneous salinity and temperature change. Together these results indicate that copepods are vulnerable to continued climate change.My research also elucidates important determinants of thermal tolerance in the copepod Acartia tonsa. Using experimental evolution, I find that development at ocean warming conditions imparts the same level of thermal tolerance as >50 generations of ocean warming. Additionally, through field collections and two generations of common garden conditions, I find that thermal tolerance varies with latitude, with copepods from Maine having lower thermal tolerances than copepods collected in New York and Florida. Importantly, we also find that juvenile A. tonsa are more thermally tolerant than larvae and adults. These results highlight the importance of plasticity in defining thermal tolerance, emphasizing the importance of the developmental environment for marine ectotherms. Additionally, results reveal that thermal tolerance is specific to life history stage and latitude of collection.

TI  - Evolutionary Responses of Arthropods to the Novel Selective Pressures of Urbanization
SP  - 192
AB  - Contemporary evolutionary change, once thought exceedingly rare, studied in the context of rapid urbanization and the novel selective pressures urbanization entails, provides a fortuitous albeit accidental, global experiment where evolutionary hypotheses can be tested with replication in real time. Cities are excellent venues to explore adaptation and evolution in response to novel selective pressures, and to examine the potential for rapid evolution along different dimensions of the phenotype. Here, I use common garden and reciprocal transplant approaches to examine evolved and plastic responses to urbanization in several focal traits for two arthropod taxa. Additionally, I assess whether evolutionary divergence between adjacent urban and rural populations has led to local adaptation and eco-evolutionary feedbacks. I focus on traits critical to persistence in the city?heat, cold, and desiccation tolerance, running speed, and body size interactions within several of these traits. I begin by examining body size in the acorn ant (<i>Temnothorax curvispinosus</i>) in relation to thermal tolerance, source population, and rearing temperature, finding that the evolution of heat tolerance and body size are decoupled in this system. I then examine the potential for evolution in heat and desiccation tolerance in response to urbanization in a terrestrial isopod (<i>Oniscus asellus</i>), finding support for the evolution of improved heat tolerance in urban populations, but no evidence for evolution in desiccation tolerance. Using this same isopod system, I next examine whether the urban populations? evolution in response to urbanization has conferred benefits in running speed (a trait critical for resource acquisition and predator avoidance) under chronic, stressfully hot rearing conditions. I find that the urban population has evolved higher running speed under stressful rearing temperatures. Lastly, I use a reciprocal transplant with the same isopod system to explore whether the urban populations? evolution is adaptive, and what ecological consequences this may have, finding evidence for local adaptation and countergradient evolution in feeding rate for the urban population. Overall, this work demonstrates the highly variable nature of traits in the face of novel selective pressures; despite strong selection, not all traits will evolve rapidly in response to novel selective pressures.

TI  - Behavioural Ecology and Population Dynamics of Freshwater Turtles in a Semi-Urban Landscape at Their Northern Range Limit
SP  - 173
AB  - Species are faced with a variety of challenges in the environment, including natural challenges, such as variability in ambient temperature, and anthropogenic threats, such as habitat transformation associated with urbanisation. Understanding how animals respond to these kinds of challenges can advance the field of behavioural ecology and guide management decisions for wild species. Yet, we still have limited understanding of the extent of natural and human-caused impacts on animal behaviour and population dynamics, and lack robust assessment of behaviour in free-ranging animals. Using novel miniaturised biologging technologies, I characterised and validated behaviour in two freshwater turtle species: Blanding's turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) and Painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). Further, I investigated how these two ectothermic species navigate a thermally heterogeneous landscape near their northern range limit, by comparing selected and available ambient temperatures. I showed that turtles preferred locations that were, on average, warmer and less variable in temperature than the available environment, and that this thermal sensitivity was greatest early in the year, and at fine spatial scales that likely matched the species' perception of the environment. Lastly, I assessed whether urban development was compatible with long-term viability of a Blanding's turtle population, by monitoring habitat change and turtle survival over one decade of ongoing residential and road development. I found that Blanding's turtle habitat quantity and connectivity declined in the area, which coincided with high road mortality and severe declines in turtle survival and population size, especially in adult females. I concluded that urban development and current road mortality rates are incompatible with the long-term viability of this at-risk turtle population. Overall, my findings demonstrate the importance of variation in the thermal environment and anthropogenic impacts on habitat in shaping the behaviour and population dynamics of this species-at-risk.

TI  - Investigating Interactions between Climate, Host Life History and Viral Diversity Across a Transhemishpheric Range of Marine Ecosystems
SP  - 228
AB  - Marine infectious diseases and pathogens substantially impact the structure and function of marine communities by causing mortalities and altering host behaviors. The interactions between host and pathogen, determining the epidemiological outcomes are affected by many factors including climate, host life history, and human activities. Studies on marine disease epidemiology and ecology, including both natural and anthropogenic transmission pathways, are necessary for better understanding how these factors potentially influence the host-pathogen interactions. A significant proportion of marine pathogens are viruses; they cause severe infectious diseases and mortalities in many marine organisms, including crustaceans. Virus-related diseases and mortalities have been identified and reported in the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, for more than half a century. With a wide geographic distribution across both hemispheres and a temperature-dependent variable life history, blue crab and its pathogenic viruses constitute a well-suited pathosystem for investigating the potential influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on viral disease emergence and spread in marine ecosystems.This dissertation applied the “blue crab-virus” pathosystem, to investigate factors that potentially influence the interactions between blue crab and its viral symbionts. The studies mainly focused on three objectives: 1) Investigate the influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on the prevalence and disease ecology of a virus that is pathogenic to blue crab. 2) Assess the influences of climate, seasonality, and host life history on viral genetic diversity and genetic structures across a wide spatial and temporal range. 3) Characterize genome sequences and biological characteristics of newly identified viruses in blue crabs. The studies encompassed in this dissertation demonstrate, in a single host species, that climate, temperature, and host life history traits drive patterns of virus species diversity and genetic variation across the entire range of the host. One significant revelation was the evidence of long-distance movement of virus pathogen genotypes by human transport of infected blue crabs between states in the United States. The dissertation concludes with a discussion of the potential for next-generation sequencing to discover and study the movement of known and newly discovered viruses in marine hosts.

TI  - The Role of Pre- and Post-Spawning Temperature Stress on Fertilization Dynamics Within Santa Barbara Channel Sea Urchin Species
SP  - 177
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are becoming an increasingly pervasive threat to marine ecosystems. Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of future MHW events highlight the need to assess the adaptive capacity of marine organisms to such extreme events. While the massive mortality caused by MHWs is frequently observed, the sublethal consequences for reproduction and development serve as understudied areas of research. Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to change its physiology and/or morphology without alteration to the genome, presents an avenue in which the effects of MHWs can be transduced across life history stages. In this dissertation, I explored the impact of elevated temperatures associated with MHW events on the fertilization process and early development of two species of sea urchin found in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC).First, I used the purple urchin species, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to measure the effects of male thermal history on fertilization and early development. In the lab, male urchins were acclimated for one month to either non-MHW or MHW-like temperature conditions, as determined by temperature data collected in the SBC during past MHW events. Fertilization trials and offspring rearing were then conducted at both temperatures to assess sperm and developmental performance. While sperm appeared robust to elevated temperatures during fertilization, sperm produced by MHW-acclimated males had overall diminished fertilization capacity as compared to those acclimated to non-MHW temperatures. For early developmental stages, the effects of paternal temperature were masked by the influence of developmental thermal conditions, where elevated temperatures resulted in larger offspring. Alternatively, the thermal physiology of offspring was significantly influenced by the interaction of paternal and developmental temperatures. Here, offspring had a higher thermal tolerance when their developmental temperature matched that experienced by their sire, possibly hinting at an adaptive paternal effect. The influence of fertilization temperature on later developmental success was also explored in the summer-spawning sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus. For this experiment, fertilization trials were performed under one of three temperatures representing: ambient, current MHW, and future MHW temperature. The resulting embryos from each fertilization treatment were then split and raised under the three temperatures. Here, elevated temperatures during fertilization had largely negative effects on fertilization success and the performance of later developmental stages. The number of successfully hatched and gastrulated embryos, representing key stages of development in echinoderms, was significantly lower in embryos produced from fertilizations at both MHW conditions than those from fertilizations under ambient conditions. Overall, the results of this dissertation highlight the importance of the reproductive response to extreme events like MHWs. The carry-over effects within and across generations seen here, show that the stress response of individual life history stages should not be studied in isolation, and that the negative effects of MHW events may persist long after these events have passed.

TI  - Phenotypic Consequences of Adaptive Toxin Production and Resistance in Coevolutionary Partners
SP  - 237
AB  - The effect that ecological interactions between species have on their evolution is an impactful but understudied area of research. The influence species have on each other’s evolution has taken on new relevance as anthropogenic change alters where, when, and how species interact. Partnered species that directly influence selection for traits in one another represent one such interaction where selection may be intense. In this case, evolutionary constraints and consequences are measurable in phenotypic traits that mediate the interaction. Antagonistic coevolution, which can arise between predator and prey, may influence traits directly responsible for survival and may favor the predator who only risks loss of a meal while their prey risk loss of life (e.g. life-dinner principle). When prey are dangerous, selection may be more balanced with both species exerting selective pressure on the other. This reciprocal selection can lead to rapid adaptation as predator and prey evolve to avoid deadly outcomes. However, specialized adaptations require a balance between cost and benefit. Evolutionary changes depend on existing genetic architecture and must maintain the function of essential traits. Thus, tradeoffs may arise, and they may limit the extent to which coevolutionary arms-race dynamics between predator and prey develop, determining which party will best the other. In the western U.S., toxic Pacific newts (Taricha) are defended by a highly potent neurotoxin. This neurotoxin makes them too dangerous for nearly all vertebrates to consume. Taricha are defended by tetrodotoxin (TTX) which blocks voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) and inhibits nerve activation and muscle function, typically leading to death by respiratory failure. Amazingly, multiple species of garter snakes (Thamnophis) have adapted to overcome this defense, harboring mutations that prevent TTX from binding to its target. These mutations, however, also decrease protein and muscle function, which suggests garter snakes may suffer evolutionary tradeoffs. Due to the severity of effects that sodium channel mutations cause in humans, we expect that altering a trait that is highly conserved across vertebrates would have similar costs in snakes. However, many specialized adaptations evolve repeatedly. For example, TTX resistance has evolved independently at least three or four times in Thamnophis, which suggests selection may favor specialization in specific environments. We first measured a key physiological process, standard metabolic rate, to investigate whether specialized adaptations in toxin-resistant garter snakes affect baseline energy expenditure. In snakes, skeletal muscles power ventilation which influences metabolism, so inefficiencies of sodium channels in these muscles might impact whole-animal energy expenditure. Because sodium channels are membrane-bound proteins, suboptimal temperatures may increase membrane rigidity, further altering sodium channel conformation and exacerbating inefficiencies of channel kinetics and performance. We measured standard metabolic rate in two species, Th. atratus and Th. sirtalis. Because these two species independently evolved tetrodotoxin resistance through unique mutations, we can treat them as natural replicates with distinct underlying genetics and potential physiological costs. Despite our expectations, neither resistance phenotype nor sodium channel genotype affected metabolism, and resistant snakes did not perform worse under suboptimal body temperature. Instead, Th. atratus and Th. sirtalis had nearly identical rates of mass-adjusted energy expenditure at both temperatures, despite differing eco-morphologies, life histories, and distant phylogenetic positions. We then examined whether biophysical tradeoffs in a gene of major importance impact whole-animal performance by measuring speed, endurance, and antipredator behavior in three Thamnophis species with an array of Nav genotypes and corresponding resistance phenotypes. We predicted that resistant snakes with weaker underlying skeletal muscles would be slower, with lower endurance, and they would rely on less energetically costly but riskier antipredator defensive behavior rather than attempting to flee. Contrary to our predictions, we found little evidence that protein and muscle costs impact sprint or endurance abilities. However, some TTX-resistant animals differed in time spent in evasive versus defensive behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that TTX-resistant snakes might exhibit compensatory mechanisms to offset the costs of mutations. Finally, we sought to understand how Pacific newts balance the cost of toxin production and maintenance, as well as foraging for carotenoid pigments to produce both TTX and warning coloration. When threatened, Taricha assume a specific defensive posture known as the ‘unken reflex’ in which they display bright orange bellies against a dark dorsal surface. Because newts are defended by TTX, this behavior is assumed to be an aposematic signal to warn predators that an attack would be unprofitable or even fatal. However, there have been no analyses of pacific newt coloration, so it is unknown whether coloration in Taricha is qualitatively honest (signaling toxic defense) or quantitatively honest (signaling toxin level). We measured ventral color and brightness as well as the contrast between ventrum and dorsum for two species (T. granulosa, T. sierrae) within and across populations. We predicted that contrasting body regions exposed during unken reflex would be visible to predators (qualitatively honesty) but would not correlate with toxin level (quantitatively dishonest). Using two color-capture methods (spectrometry and hyper-spectral imaging), we found support for a model of qualitative honesty but did not find quantitative honesty in the form of correlation between any colorimetric and toxin level at either the intra- or interpopulation level for either species. These three projects address if and how tradeoffs impose constraints on the pace and outcomes of adaptive evolution. Despite clear negative protein performance impacts stemming from a beneficial adaptation in toxin producing newts and their resistant garter snake predators, neither showed evidence of whole-animal tradeoffs. The geographic mosaic of coevolution between these species is comprised of populations where snakes are sufficiently resistant that they could survive eating any newt they encounter as well as populations in which newts could incapacitate and escape any garter snake. It may be that the existence of these extreme levels of toxin production and toxin resistance provides enough evidence that newts and snakes are able to compensate for underlying physiological costs before they impose tradeoffs at the whole-animal level, allowing the arms-race to continue.

AB  - In this work, the allotropes of carbon and biologically derived hydrocarbons are utilized as scaffolding for surface functionalization, as electron emitters, as feedstock for fuel production, and as inert anode material. The introduction of this thesis will discuss the relevant properties of carbon and its allotropes as well as the motivation for research into each of these applications. This will be followed by four more chapters, each detailing projects dedicated to exploring these applications in detail. For the first project, a method for grafting an organic spin-tag to diamond at a tunable distance from the surface for the development of spin-based chemical sensors is presented. This method involves the radical-initiated grafting of vinyl-terminated organic acids to hydrogen terminated diamond surfaces, followed by EDC-initiated crosslinking of 4-amino-TEMPO to form a stable amide linker. The diamond surfaces are characterized by dynamic light scattering(DLS) and Zeta-potential measurements, as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The impact of air-annealing nanodiamond surfaces prior to functionalization is also presented, as well as a novel method for characterizing the density of spin-active tethered spin-probes on the nanodiamond surface. For the second project, a method for spectroscopically detecting solvated electrons emitted from a diamond surface is presented. The relevant operating parameters, limit of detection, and theoretical impacts of dissolved aqueous species are discussed. My contribution to this work was designing and fabricating a custom transient absorption spectrometer and sample mount, as well as collecting data on the voltage-dependance of solvated electron emission from diamond. For the third project, computational analysis and literature review is presented detailing a novel method for the generation of H2 and sulfur-enriched biochar from biomass. This process utilizes the unique property of elemental sulfur (Sx where x = 2 – 8) to dehydrogenate hydrocarbons leaving behind unreacted carbon biochar. The sulfur-dehydrogenation reaction of cellulose releases more theoretical energy than is needed to decompose the generated H2S into its elements at STP. The goal of this project is to develop a method that utilizes as much of the energy from the sulfur-dehydrogenation of biomass as possible to decompose H2S. There generated Sx may be recycled to make the process cyclic, while the H2 gas may be used as a carbon-negative source of fuel. The co-produced sulfur-enriched biochar may also be used as a soil amendment and fertilizer. This method starts with the dehydrogenation of woody biomass or municipal solid waste to form sulfur-enriched biochar and H2S, along with some CS2 and CO2depending on reaction conditions and feedstock. The H2S ((g) and CS2 ((g) are decomposed through reaction with SO2 ((g) (Claus process) to form elemental S (l) and H2S ((g). Some of the regenerated Sx is then oxidized into SO2 by refluxing sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The SO2 formed is then electrochemically oxidized to regenerated H2SO4 in a depolarized electrochemical cell for the generation of H2 gas. To the best of our knowledge, this this the first time that these chemical processes have been combined to produce H2 gas from biomass. In the fifth chapter, a novel method for the generation of anhydrous ammonia (NH3) from biomass and elemental nitrogen (N2) is presented. Instead of producing H2 like the last project, this project aims to use biomass derived H2S as a feedstock for NH3 production. This is achieved through a thermochemical looping cycle operating at atmospheric pressure. This cycle starts with the reduction of N2 gas by lithium (Li) to form lithium nitride (Li3N), which in turn reacts withH2S in a flux of molten salt at or above 475 °C to form NH3 and dissolved lithium sulfide (Li2S)ions. The sulfide ions generated by this process are oxidized on an anode of consumable steel or non-consumable graphite to generate Sx gas, which is then removed from the system. The H2Smay be generated through the dehydrogenation of biomass to form sulfur-enriched biochar, a potential soil-amendment and fertilizer. All chemical reactions in this cycle are both exergonic and exothermic except for the electrolysis of Li2S which has a theoretical decomposition voltage of 1.97 V at 475 °C. During electrolysis of Li2S, the formation of soluble polysulfide anions, which are reactive to elemental S, inhibit the removal of S from the melt and act to shuttle charge in the electrochemical cell. Future work will focus on methods to overcome these problems associated with the formation of polysulfides.

TI  - Evolutionary Dynamics of Rapid, Microgeographic Adaptation in an Amphibian Metapopulation
SP  - 228
AB  - Wild organisms can rapidly adapt to changing environments, even at fine spatial scales. This fact prompts hope that contemporary local adaptation may buffer some of the negative anthropogenic impacts to ecosystems. However, there are limits to the pace of adaptation. Understanding the adaptive potential—and limitations—of individual species at fine-resolution is an important task if we hope to accurately predict the repercussions of future climate and landscape change on biodiversity. My dissertation takes advantage of an uncommonly long-observed and closely-studied system to paint a comprehensive picture of evolution over time in association with shifts in ecological contexts.In this dissertation, I show evidence of rapid, microgeographic evolution in response to climate within a metapopulation of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). Critically, I show that populations separated by tens to hundreds of meters—well within the dispersal ability of the species—exhibited considerable shifts in development rates over a period of two decades, or roughly 6-9 generations. Using historical climate data and new methods of assessing landscape change, I show that these changes were mainly a response to warming climates.The ecological contexts experienced by the metapopulation are associated with the evolution of physiological rates. Specifically, I show that climate change seems to have caused a counter-intuitive delay in spring breeding phenology while drought and warming later in the larval development period correspond with a shift toward earlier metamorphosis. The picture that emerges is of a contracting developmental window, which is expected to select for faster intrinsic development rates.Superimposed on the metapopulation-wide shift to faster development was a pattern of counter-gradient variation reflecting a similar pattern seen two decades prior. Furthermore, I empirically demonstrate a trade-off between faster development and a swimming performance trait that strongly contributes to fitness. This trade-off helps to explain why intrinsic development rates vary spatially with pond temperatures, but in the opposite direction of the relationship with temperature over time.Though the evidence for rapid adaptation to climate change presented in this dissertation reveals that evolution can buffer populations from extinction, it also entreats caution. There is a clear trend of demographic decline among wood frog populations that experienced greater magnitudes of environmental change. In fact, the three populations that suffered local extinctions over the 20-year course of observations inhabited ponds characterized by the greatest change in temperature or canopy.

TI  - Distinct Strategies of Temperature Compensation in Pattern Generating Neuronal Networks
SP  - 76
AB  - Rapid temperature fluctuations are a major challenge to neuronal function. Among other effects, temperature changes cause an imbalance of ionic conductances that are key to neuronal and synaptic activity, leading to failure of neuronal function. This is a particular threat for ectothermic species that experience rapid environmental temperature fluctuations due to natural and climate change-induced extreme weather conditions. Thus, possessing physiological mechanisms to mitigate the effects of temperature changes is essential for survival. However, the limits within which neurons can respond adequately to temperature changes and the evolutionary pressures to temperature robustness are not well understood. I investigated temperature responses in the pyloric and gastric mill central pattern generators (CPGs) of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS). These CPGs control aspects of feeding, serving a vital function in survival. Pattern generation in the pyloric CPG is achieved through an escape mechanism, where intrinsic properties allow the pacemaker neurons to escape an inhibited state. The gastric mill CPG activity resembles a release mechanism for pattern generation where network interactions allow the neuron to be released from an inhibited state. It is suggested that networks with different mechanisms for pattern generation are also differentially robust to temperature perturbation. If true, these network types may also have different strategies to mitigate temperature effects on network function. In the pyloric CPG, models predict slow homeostatic and evolutionary processes may provide a way to prevent the imbalance of ion conductances through the regulation of ion channel expression in pyloric neurons to enable temperature robustness when environmental temperatures change. The same line of arguments also predicts that species that live in different habitat temperatures should show a distinct response to temperature changes. This thesis addresses the question if species' habitat temperatures affect neuronal temperature responses and robustness against failure. Using a comparative approach, I recorded the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms across temperatures in three related crab species that live in distinct habitats: Cancer borealis, Cancer magister, and Carcinus maenas. I investigated the temperature effects on cycle frequency, phase relationships, and overall robustness of the pyloric rhythm to temperature in each of the species. The pyloric rhythm of C. maenas, which experiences a larger range of habitat temperatures and higher maximum temperatures than C. borealis and C. magister, showed the smallest rate of increase of cycle frequency with temperature. Its pyloric phase relationships were stable until the rhythm crashed at high temperatures but were unstable at low temperatures. In contrast, in C. borealis and C. magister, the pyloric phase relationships stayed stable even at the lowest temperatures tested but varied at high temperature even before the rhythm crashed. Finally, the pyloric rhythm in C. maenas remained functional up to 33.4 ± 1.3°C (N=10), while in C. borealis the rhythm crashed at 26.9 ± 1.4°C (N=10) and in C. magister at 24.9 ± 3.7°C (N=9). Thus, species experiencing larger ranges and overall warmer habitat temperatures showed reduced responses to temperature and appear more resilient to warm temperatures, but at a cost to resilience at cold temperatures. As the network was perturbated by increasing temperatures, the breakdown of the pyloric rhythms also revealed differences between individuals within a species as well as between species: Each preparation crashed in its own idiosyncratic way, with distinct neuronal crash activities. This supports the hypothesis that the pyloric circuit is "degenerate", i.e., that various combinations of circuit and intrinsic properties exist that produce a functional rhythm. This degeneracy is then revealed by the temperature perturbation. In contrast to the pyloric CPG, the gastric mill CPG is suggested to require extrinsic modulation to achieve temperature robustness. Specifically, previous findings have demonstrated that increased neuropeptide release from the modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) rescues the main gastric mill CPG neuron LG (lateral gastric neuron) from detrimental temperature effects. However, the activity of MCN1 and the role it plays in providing robustness against temperature changes to the gastric mill CPG remains unknown. I recorded LG and MCN1 activities across temperatures and analyzed their firing frequencies. My results show that MCN1 firing frequency increased with increasing temperatures with a particularly strong correlation when the soma of MCN1 was exposed to the temperature changes. I also found that independently of the temperature condition, MCN1 firing frequency and LG firing frequency correlated, i.e., with higher MCN1 firing frequencies, LG showed higher firing frequencies. Since MCN1 excites LG via a neuropeptidergic synapse, this suggests that increases in MCN1 firing frequency modulates LG to increase its activity and maintain the gastric mill rhythm at elevated temperatures. However, my results show that despite higher MCN1 firing frequencies at elevated temperature, there was no clear increase of the maximum temperature at which the gastric mill rhythm can function, contradicting this hypothesis. Ultimately, the results show that the pyloric CPG and gastric mill CPG, two networks with different mechanisms of pattern generation, also have different strategies for mitigating detrimental temperature effects on network function.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is gradually provoking ocean warming and acidification, noticeable even at a small temporal scale. The available literature indicates varying responses of different species to the exposure levels indicated by climate predictions. Thus, perceiving the responses of key species to such climate changes is critical to determining how the marine environment may be affected in the future and develop measures to increase their resilience. This study investigated combined effects of predicted levels of ocean warming and acidification on some fitness-linked species traits and responses such as the mechanical properties of Carcinus maenas shell, crabs’ predatory behaviour, metabolic rates (O2 consumption) and activity of neurotransmission (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) and energy production (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH) enzymes. The crabs were exposed for 30 days to six treatments resulting from the combination of two pH levels (ambient: 8.02; low: 7.88) and three temperatures (18 ºC. 22 ºC and 26 ºC). The experimental pH and temperatures were selected according to the recent predictions of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). During exposure, the mortality, predatory behaviour and metabolic rates were assessed. Metabolic rate measurements focused on two conditions of O2 consumption: when animals were fed and when they were deprived from eating by 48h prior to the measurements. Predatory behaviour trials consisted in investigating the number of feeding attempts of C. maenas on Mytillus sp, from collected nocturnal videos using animals from each treatment, after 12, 18 and 24 days after exposure on the mesocosms. After exposure biological sampling was done: carapace was used to assess possible effects on the calcifying structure and organs and tissues were removed to determine the activities of AChE (ganglion and muscle), LDH (muscle) and IDH (muscle). Different interactions between pH and temperature were observed across measurements. Whereas significant effects of pH were observed in carapace hardness and width, temperature seems to have a preponderant effect on IDH activity and crab survival despite pH treatments. This study suggested synergistic negative effects of these climate change drivers on some of the responses, although on overall the resilience of this species is high probably enough to cope with the stress resulting from near future warming and acidification trends.

A literatura disponível indica respostas variadas de diferentes espécies à exposição aos níveis indicados pelas previsões climáticas. Assim, perceber as respostas de espécies-chave às mudanças climáticas é fundamental para determinar como o ambiente marinho poderá ser afetado no futuro e planear possíveis medidas de proteção que aumentem a sua resiliência a estas alterações. No presente estudo foram investigados os efeitos combinados de níveis aquecimento e acidificação do oceano nas propriedades mecânicas da carapaça de Carcinus maenas e também no comportamento predatório dos caranguejos, na sua taxa metabólica (consumo de O2) e na atividade de enzimas relacionada com a neurotransmissão colinérgica (acetilcolinesterase, AChE) e a produção de energia (lactato desidrogenase, LDH, e isocitrato desidrogenase, IDH). Os caranguejos foram expostos por 30 dias a seis tratamentos resultantes da combinação de dois níveis de pH (ambiente: 8.02; baixo: 7.88) e três temperaturas (18 °C, 22 °C e 26 °C). Os níveis de pH e temperatura foram selecionados a partir das previsões recentes efetuadas pelo Painel Internacional sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC). Durante a exposição, foram analisadas a mortalidade, o comportamento predatório e a taxa metabólica. A avaliação da taxa metabólica focou-se em duas condições de consumo de O2: quando os animais eram alimentados e quando eles eram privados de comer por 48h antes das medições de consumo. A avaliação do comportamento predatório consistiu em investigar o número de tentativas de alimentação de C. maenas sobre Mytillus sp, a partir de vídeos noturnos obtidos com animais de cada tratamento, após 12, 18 e 24 dias de exposição nos mesocosmos. Após a exposição, também foram recolhidas amostras biológicas: a carapaça foi usada para avaliar os efeitos na estrutura calcificante e os órgãos e tecidos foram removidos para determinar a atividade das enzimas AChE (em gânglio e músculo), LDH (músculo) e IDH (músculo). Os resultados obtidos revelaram efeitos significativos de diminuição de pH na dureza e no crescimento da carapaça, e diminuição na atividade da IDH e na sobrevivência do caranguejo. Este estudo revelou efeitos negativos sinergéticos em algumas das respostas devido a estes fatores de mudança climáticas. No entanto, em geral, a resiliência desta espécie será provavelmente alta o suficiente para lidar com o stress resultante de tendências de aquecimento e acidificação num futuro próximo.

TI  - Observed Genetic Diversity of Wild and Hatchery Propagated Chinook Salmon at Critical Genes of the Immune System
SP  - 73
AB  - Genetic diversity plays a vital role in the adaptability of salmon to changing environmental conditions that can introduce new selective pressures on populations. Variability among local subpopulations may increase the chance that certain advantageous genes are passed down to future generations to mitigate susceptibility to novel diseases, warming oceans, loss of genetic stocks, and ocean acidification. Class I and II genes of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are crucial for fitness of Chinook salmon due to the role they play in disease and pathogen resistance. The objective of this study was to assess the DNA sequence variability among wild and hatchery populations of Alaskan Chinook salmon at the class I α1 and class II β1 exons of the MHC. We hypothesized the 96 wild samples taken from the Deshka River would display greater levels of observed heterozygosity (Ho) relative to expected heterozygosity (He) in suggesting that individuals with similar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating patterns. Conversely, since no mate selection occurs in the William Jack Hernandez Sport Fish hatchery, we would not expect to see this discrepancy (He = Ho) in the 96-hatchery fish tested in this study. Alternatively, we hypothesize that post mating selection is driving higher levels of observed heterozygosity as opposed to mate selection. If this is the case, we will observe higher than expected levels of heterozygosity among hatchery salmon. Both populations displayed higher levels of observed heterozygosity than expected heterozygosity at the Class I and II loci but genetic differentiation between the spatially distinct communities was minimal. Class I sequences showed evidence of Balancing selection, despite high rates of non-synonymous substitutions observed, specifically at the peptide binding regions of both MHC genes.

TI  - Climate Change and Health: Implications for Cardiovascular Diseases and Inherently Hot Regions
SP  - 177
AB  - The warming of our planet is unevenly distributed. In inherently hot and hyper-arid countries like Kuwait, temperatures are already soaring to unprecedented record-high levels and not a lot is known about what climate change could mean for populations in similar regions. While population health data from this region is lacking, climate change may push the limits of human adaptability as temperatures get hotter and hotter. Additionally, because of its desert climate, we also see dramatic dust storms very frequently in Kuwait to the point that the small country now ranks among the top countries in the world in terms of annual dust deposition rates. This dissertation generates critical information for local authorities in Kuwait and other similar hyper-arid hot regions that can guide many decisions on dust storms and climate change response by identifying and quantifying major sources of particulate pollution and exploring vulnerabilities to climate change from this part of the world. In the first paper, a comprehensive particulate pollution analysis was carried out in Kuwait. We found that regional pollution was a major contributor to fine particulate matter levels, followed by dust storms and resuspended road dust. We showed that, independent of dust storms, the sizeable regional anthropogenic particulate sources warrant national and regional mitigation strategies to ensure compliance with air quality standards. In the second paper, we showed that by 2060, the average temperature in Kuwait is predicted to increase by 1.80°C (moderate climate change scenario) to 2.57°C (extreme climate change scenario), compared to the first decade of this century (2000-2009). Climate change induced warming, even under more optimistic mitigation scenarios, will markedly increase heat related mortality in Kuwait. Those who are already vulnerable, like migrant workers, could borne a larger impact from climate change. Across all borders, climate change, however, cannot be solely examined in one country. Global mortality burden, in general, is significantly driven by cardiovascular disease. It is the leading cause of death. Despite the abundance of historical mortality-specific data, we still do not know how ambient temperatures in many regions in the world (including inherently hot regions) affect specific causes of cardiovascular deaths. This dissertation examines the relationship between extreme temperatures and specific causes of cardiovascular death such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure and arrythmia, using the largest ever assembled global dataset from 27 countries and 567 cities that include tens of millions of cardiovascular deaths with a wide geographical coverage and a range of climates. In the third paper, we show that extreme heat and cold temperatures were associated with increased risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke and heart failure. We estimate that for every 1,000 cardiovascular deaths, 2 and 9 excess deaths are attributed to extreme hot and cold days, respectively. Across that large, multinational sample, our results warrant public health and clinical attention in the present day and under a changing climate.

TI  - The Nature of Phenotypes: Provoking and Measuring the Dynamic Processes of Swarm Expansion, Predation, and Antibiotic Resistance in Myxococcus xanthus
SP  - 183
AB  - The question of how genotype affects phenotype has fascinated and puzzled scientists for generations. Regardless of organism, the correlation between observation and underlying condition is necessary for scientists to understand the world around us. Myxococcus xanthus, a fascinating organism with a large genome (7,314 genes), is known for complex social behaviors and is an excellent model system for the study of this relationship. Upon starvation, M. xanthus cells condense into large multicellular aggregates to await renewed nutrient availability. M. xanthus cells swarm together on surfaces as a predatory biofilm, lysing and killing prey as a singular unit. During predation, swarms display dynamic multicellular patterns called ripples. Individual cells also retain the ability to move independently, leaving behind a slime trail for other cells to follow. This creates complex flare structures at the edge of multicellular swarms. The first part of this thesis addresses the problem of genotype-to-phenotype accuracy in complex organisms. Using 50 single gene knockout M. xanthus strains, I performed the traditional motility phenotype assay as well as a novel motility phenotype assay under magnification. Comparison of these results demonstrates not only that genes not related to motility machinery can induce a motility phenotype, but also that motility phenotypes are dynamic and can change over time. Additionally, I demonstrate that motility phenotype can change significantly when swarms move over prey, as opposed to simple agar surfaces. This more in-depth analysis allows for phenotypic classification of knockout strains previously thought to be without phenotype. The complexity of the M. xanthus genome is not only responsible for its incredibly complex multicellular phenotype, but for its potential use as a model for the study of antibiotic resistance and production of novel antibiotic compounds. The production of secondary metabolites like antibiotics is not ubiquitous in bacteria. The unique resources or “building blocks” required for their manufacture as well as their complicated molecular scaffolds restricts their production to more complex organisms like M. xanthus. The laboratory-friendly and non-pathogenic nature of M. xanthus adds another category to its list of interesting attributes. By sharing many qualities with pathogenic bacteria while remaining a biosafety level one organism, M. xanthus represents a unique opportunity to study how antibiotic resistance is obtained, maintained, and compensated for in a complex genome. The second part of this thesis studies M. xanthus’ usefulness in the fight against antibiotic resistance. I created strains of M. xanthus resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics. Some were exposed to initially low concentrations slowly building over time while others experienced higher antibiotic concentrations over a shorter period. The creation of these strains, simulating the manner in which pathogenic bacteria may gain resistance to antibiotics in vivo, allowed for a laboratory-friendly study of phenotypes and fitness costs associated with varying levels of resistance. I also supply preliminary proof of antibiotic-resistant M. xanthus’ utility as a general heterologous host for novel antibiotics. Upon introduction of the oxytetracycline gene cluster, resistant strains were significantly more likely to retain the plasmid than WT. These results represent an important step in both understanding how and why antibiotic resistance arises in complex bacteria as well as a potential mechanism for novel antibiotic discovery.

TI  - The Effects of Spontaneous Mutation on the Response of Caenorhabditis elegans to Environmental Stimuli
SP  - 105
AB  - Mutation is the main cause of genetic variation and one of the most important driving factors to evolution. Whether a new mutation is fixed or lost in a population depends on its effect on the organism’s fitness, or fitness related traits. Mutations are mostly deleterious that reduce fitness, neutral with no or very little effect, or beneficial that increases fitness and leads to the adaptation of its carriers. Yet, mutations are of limited interest without knowing about genetic variation in nature. Experimental estimates of changes in trait means and variances in MA lines and comparing them with their wild-type ancestors enable us to better understand mutational effects on these phenotypes and to infer the strength and direction of natural selection. In this dissertation, I investigate the effect of mutation and selection on three phenotypic values in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . The three phenotypic traits I evaluated are 1) The influence of mutation and selection on the temperature-sensitive mortal germline (Mrt) phenotype in the nematode C. elegans, 2) Mutation, selection, and quantitative genetic architecture of susceptibility to bacterial pathogens, and 3) The heterozygous effects of spontaneous mutations on fitness in C. elegans. In addition, I examined a head-to-head comparison of three experimental methods of quantifying competitive fitness in C. elegans. The three methods are (A) "by eye" from a saved image, (B) from the same image using CellProfiler image analysis software, and (C) with a large particle flow cytometer (a "worm sorter").

TI  - Condition Dependent Germline Maintenance in Seed Beetles
AB  - The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate how costly adaptations promoted by sexual selection affect fertility and offspring quality through changes in germline maintenance. Germline maintenance, comprising mechanisms maintaining DNA-integrity and homeostasis within germ cells, is known to be costly and, therefore, may trade-off with other costly reproductive traits that are under sexual selection. However, sexual selection may also act on condition dependent traits that reflect the overall genetic quality of its bearer, in which case sexual selection for high quality mates may lead to improved germline maintenance. Using experimental evolution lines of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, evolving under three different mating regimes that manipulated the opportunity for sexual and natural selection, I show evidence indicating that sexual selection can lead to improved germline maintenance through selection on condition dependent traits. However, I also found evidence for the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that when sexual selection is much stronger than natural selection it may lead to excessive investment into mating traits that trade-off with and reduce germline maintenance. We present an RNA expression analysis suggesting 18 candidate genes responding to DNA-damage and sociosexual interactions that may be involved in trade-offs between sexual selection and germline maintenance. I also found that the fertility of males and females that evolved under intense sexual selection was more sensitive to heat stress, and male sensitivity of fertility to heat stress was genetically correlated to sperm competitive ability. This suggests a trade-off between male postcopulatory reproductive success and the thermal sensitivity of fertility. The increased sensitivity to heat was also reflected in the fertility of females, suggesting that female heat tolerance may have evolved via genetic correlations with sexually selected male reproductive traits. The work presented in this thesis shows that sexual selection indeed affects germline maintenance. Sexual selection can increase germline maintenance through selection on condition dependent traits. But at the same time, traits under sexual selection can trade off with aspects of germline maintenance. If traits evolved under sexual selection and only weak constraints by natural selection, evolved allocation shifts in response to sexual selection can lead to deleterious repercussions when stressful environmental conditions increase demands on germline maintenance. The results presented in this thesis highlight important aspects of how sexual selection affects condition dependent germline maintenance with significant implications for the maintenance of genetic variation, adaptive processes, and mate choice processes in species under sexual selection.

TI  - Snow as Structural Habitat for Wolverines in a Changing Arctic
SP  - 153
AB  - Arctic snowpack provides critical wintertime habitat for animals to facilitate thermoregulation and avoid predators. Wolverines (Gulo gulo) are iconic among such animals, relying on snow burrows for resting sites and reproductive dens. Most of the knowledge regarding this mesocarnivore’s association with snow, however, has so far originated in more southerly latitudes. In this dissertation, I investigated Arctic wolverines’ behaviors associated with snow, focusing on how specific snow properties influence resting, habitat selection, and avoiding predators. Motivated by the paucity of published descriptions of wolverine resting burrows and reproductive dens on tundra, I first described terrain features and architecture of such sites. I found that resting burrows typically consist of a single tunnel leading to a resting chamber, sometimes associated with non-snow structure such as stream cutbanks and river shelf ice. By contrast, reproductive dens typically consist of longer tunnels associated with snowdrift-forming terrain. Second, I used GPS collar data from 21 adult wolverines, coupled with snowpack information at 10 meter pixel resolution, to evaluate wolverine habitat selection and movement response to snow depth, density, and melt status. I found that wolverines select deeper, denser snow, except when snow is melting, likely reflecting resting site use. Third, I developed a machine learning model to classify wolverine behaviors using tri-axial accelerometers based on direct observations of three captive wolverines, and applied this model to free-living wolverines in Arctic Alaska. I found that the model performs better when allowed to predict behaviors as “unknown,” and that it accurately predicts resting, food handling, running, and scanning surroundings. Finally, based in part on this classification model, I evaluated the extent to which wolverines’ use of snow burrows and surface beds for resting sites is influenced by thermoregulatory needs versus predation avoidance. I found evidence in support of both demands driving resting behavior; wolverines trade thermoregulation off against predation avoidance by resting on the snow surface on warm, sunny days, but use snow burrows on cold, dark days to meet both demands simultaneously. Collectively, this dissertation demonstrates the importance of Arctic snowpack to wolverines, a topic of increasing importance as the snow season shortens with climate change, and serves as a model for investigating behavioral processes associated with snow among other species.

TI  - Alternative Reproductive Tactics Associated with Variable Sensory Biology and Thermal Physiology in Male Centris pallida (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Bees
SP  - 166
AB  - Climate change is predicted to cause significant increases in global temperatures that will place many species under temperature-dependent selection. The consequences of climate change may be especially severe for ectothermic species, which rely heavily on their environment to maintain a non-lethal body temperature. Little attention has been paid to the potential effects of climate change on variable morphology, physiology, or behavior within a species. Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) occur when there is categorical variation in the mating-related behavior or morphology of individuals of one sex within a population, and are ideal for investigating the impacts of the thermal environment on behavioral, physiological, or morphological variation. Males of the Sonoran Desert bee Centris pallida use ARTs and are dimorphic in both behavior and morphology. Large-morph males use a fixed strategy that relies on scent to locate mates buried underground. Small-morph males are behaviorally flexible, generally using visual cues to locate females in the sky but sometimes using the scent-based strategy. First, I characterized variation in neuroanatomy between large and small morph C. pallida males, demonstrating that relative investment in visual and olfactory peripheral processing regions support the different mate-location tactics used by the morphs. Next, I demonstrated that small-morph males have increased relative investment in eye size and ommatidia density, but reduced total ommatidia numbers, eye surface areas, and visual acuities compared to large males. These data suggest that both allometric constraints associated with body size and mate location behaviors correlate with external visual investment. Finally, I investigated physiology and morphological adaptations to the microclimates used by the morphs: large-morph males use a hotter microclimate near the ground while small-morph males hover several feet above the surface. Small-morph males have increased thermal tolerance compared to large-morph males, despite a cooler microclimate, suggesting they use a physiological thermal adaptation to survive high environmental temperatures. Large-morph males have increased reflectance of solar radiation on their dorsal, but not ventral, surface as compared to small-morph males, representing a morphological thermal adaptation to the high solar radiation and ambient temperatures experienced in their microclimate. Together, these data suggest that individuals within a species may vary significantly in their adaptive potential under climate change. Variation in morphological/neuroanatomical systems may support different behaviors for individuals within the same species, sex, and population. Unique thermal adaptations, physiological or morphological, may cause differentiation in the intraspecific selective effects of climate change with important implications for range shifts, intraspecific behavioral diversity, and species’ survival.

TI  - Using Genetic Approaches to Study Local Adaptation and Reproductive Success in Snow Buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis)
SP  - 178
AB  - Genetic analyses can facilitate effective and timely conservation and management actions. Arctic-migratory species in particular are in need of conservation genetic insights as they are experiencing substantial population pressures due to the impact of climate change (and other anthropogenic effects) on processes that affect their survival and reproduction. Therefore, identification of genetic mechanisms driving population divergence and variation in reproductive fitness in such species is critical. The goal of this thesis is to examine reproductive isolation among breeding populations of an Arctic-migratory passerine, the snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis) and determine factors that drive local adaptation and variation in reproductive success in this species. Using neutral and functional genetic markers, I show substantial population isolation among six globally distributed snow bunting breeding populations that is primarily driven by high levels of genetic drift and stabilizing selection, but with divergent selection acting at key functional loci. While there were no significant predictors of within-pair reproductive success, I identify key male quality traits such as body mass, testosterone levels, and breast plumage as important drivers of extra-pair reproductive success, which ultimately contribute to realized fitness in snow buntings. My work highlights the population-specific responses that reinforce the importance of genetic variability of individuals and their subsequent reproductive outcomes. The information contained in this thesis, combined with the methodological approaches, will help direct conservation efforts at the among- and within-population levels to maintain genetic diversity and adaptive potential as rapid environmental change continues to threaten Arctic-migratory species.

TI  - Changing Environmental Conditions and the Response and Potential Adaptability of Freshwater Whitefishes
SP  - 218
AB  - Changes in winter conditions, such as increased temperatures and decreased ice coverage, have been observed worldwide. The responses of many lake fish populations to changing winters are projected to be inadequate to counter the speed and magnitude of climate change. Such environmental changes have been hypothesized to explain the low recruitment observed in freshwater whitefishes (Salmonidae Coregoninae). My research focused on measuring the impact changing winter conditions may have on coregonine reproductive phenology and developmental and morphological traits to better predict changes in coregonine populations as a result of climate change.I used experimental incubation methods and modeling to explore how climate-induced changes in water temperature and ice coverage may impact coregonine adults during spawning and early-life stages within and among species. First, I experimentally evaluated the response of embryonic development to increasing water temperature for cisco (Coregonus artedi) from lakes Superior and Ontario, and vendace (C. albula) and European whitefish (C. lavaretus) from Lake Southern Konnevesi, Finland. Embryo survival, incubation duration, and length-at-hatch were inversely related to temperature whereas yolk-sac volume increased with temperature within study groups. However, responses varied in magnitude among study groups suggesting differential levels of developmental plasticity. Next, I quantified how cisco embryos from lakes Superior and Ontario responded to simulated changes in incubation light conditions representing 0–10 (high light), 40–60 (medium light), and 90–100% (low light) ice coverage. Embryo survival was highest under medium light, and light intensity had no effect on incubation duration. Increasing light intensity decreased length-at-hatch in Lake Superior but had no effect in Lake Ontario. Yolk-sac volume was positively correlated with increasing light in Lake Superior and negatively correlated in Lake Ontario. Contrasting responses between lakes suggest populations’ response to light is flexible. Furthermore, I analyzed different embryo incubation temperatures on post-hatching survival, growth, and critical thermal maximum of larval cisco from lakes Superior and Ontario. Larval survival and critical thermal maximum were negatively related to temperature, and larval growth was positively related to temperature. The magnitude of change was greater in Lake Superior than Lake Ontario for all traits examined, suggesting Lake Superior larvae may possess a more limited ability to acclimate to and cope with environmental change. Lastly, I used simulation modeling to investigate changes in reproductive phenology under climatic-warming scenarios for coregonine populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes and Europe. Models predicted that climate-induced increases in water temperatures may cause delayed spawning, shorter embryo incubation lengths, and earlier larval hatching.I quantified how climate change could affect coregonine populations, including changes in embryo development traits, reduced physiological condition of larvae, and shifts in reproductive phenology. Climate-induced responses of coregonines to changing environmental conditions are likely to vary within and among species and with the magnitude of climate warming. Management strategies that maximize phenotypic variability could improve the ability of coregonines to cope with environmental change.

TI  - Determining the Effects of Exogenous Human Chorionic Gonadotropin and Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin on Plasma Testosterone, Testicular Volume, and Semen Production in Leopard Geckos (Eublepharis Macularius)
SP  - 108
AB  - Planet earth has now entered into its sixth mass extinction as a result of expanding human populations, posing an unprecedented threat to biologic diversity. Climate change, habitat fragmentation, wildlife trade, pollution, and biological invasions are just a few consequences of human activities that have directly contributed to unprecedented species extinctions. While widespread amphibian declines have gained more recent attention, it has been proposed that reptiles may be in even greater danger of extinction worldwide. Unfortunately, many reptiles are destined to go extinct before many of their basic biologic traits, including reproductive methods, have even been determined. In order to mitigate the substantial loss to biodiversity that the impending decline of reptiles represents, development and employing additional methods of in-situ and ex-situ conservation strategies will be paramount. Although assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have been developed and successfully utilized in a handful of wildlife and domestic species, these techniques have been historically underutilized in reptiles. ART will not only enhance our understanding of reptile reproductive biology and physiology, but will facilitate conservation efforts in these species to overcome reproductive barriers and by preserving genetic material to protect biodiversity in the future. The goal of this research was to use exogenous hormones in the male leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) as a model for the development of ART in geckos and other endangered lizard species. The study was conducted from September-December in the Northern Hemisphere. Single injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at 50 IU or 100 IU were ineffective at increasing plasma testosterone concentrations within 24 hours of injection. Electrostimulation was successfully used to collect serial semen samples. Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (20 IU, 50 IU) effectively increased testicular volume, spermatozoa concentration, motility, and the prevalence of morphologically normal sperm. Unilateral orchidectomies were successfully completed and allowed for histologic assessment of the testicles and epididymides without necropsy. PMSG was not successful at increasing circulating plasma testosterone concentrations. Ultimately, there is still time to prepare and slow the rate of global reptile declines. The development and refinement of ART in reptiles can aid in this mission to preserve biodiversity for future generations.

TI  - Environmental Tolerance, Spread, and Diversification of the Sea Anemone Genus Metridium
SP  - 210
AB  - Members of the sea anemone genus Metridium are widespread through the circumboreal waters of the northern hemisphere. Multiple populations of Metridium senile have been introduced to South America and also South Africa, but these populations and the ability of M. senile to be transported long-distances is not well understood. As marine species commonly exhibit minimal morphological variation, molecular studies have been instrumental in identifying divergence and relationships. My research seeks to describe and understand the processes driving the current distribution of the species within Metridium.Beginning with Chapter 1, I give an in-depth introduction to Metridium. In Chapter 2, I test the temperature and salinity tolerance of M. senile in Japan. I find that the tolerance of M. senile is very broad, particularly for a cold-water sea anemone, but that asexual reproduction only takes place within the comfortable temperature and salinity range. The ability of M. senile to withstand temperature and salinity fluctuations as it applies to being a successful invader is further examined in Chapter 3 through broadly looking at several species of sea anemones. In this chapter, I review and consolidate information on the ten most well-known species of sea anemones that have been introduced outside of their native range, and elucidate specific characteristics that are common among these species. I pair these characteristics with vector potential and suggest how conditions both at the new location and in transit facilitate the introduction of each these species.In Chapters 4 & 5, I move into examining relationships both at the species and population level within Metridium to answer questions directly related to their current distribution. Genetic data has not recently been used to elucidate relationships within Metridium; thus, with the rapid evolution of genomic scale data as applied to biogeographic questions, we can now apply these data to worldwide datasets. In Chapter 4, I test multiple types of genetic data on small test datasets of Metridium to determine which method would be most efficient to use to answer my remaining questions, and I find that sequence capture data provides high resolution at both the species level and at the population level. I apply this knowledge in Chapter 5 to a scaled-up dataset of Metridium (n=236) that encompasses both the native range and several introduced populations in the southern hemisphere to confirm species boundaries, explore the dispersal history, and assess the influence of anthropogenic activities on the current distribution and genetic structure. I identify that there are multiple introductions to the southern hemisphere oceans, and that the introduced populations are spreading to new areas. Within the native range, there is admixture between oceans due to transport of the species, and hybridization between Metridium farcimen and M. senile occurs in human-disturbed habitat.

TI  - Dry Reforming of Methane Using Microwave Irradiated Metal Oxide/Coal Char Catalysts
SP  - 179
AB  - This research focuses on the synthesis of both shaped and amorphous powder materials, the combination of these materials with dried Powder River Basin (PRB) coal char, and their reactionary properties with methane and carbon dioxide gasses with conventional and microwave (MW) heating. The first goal of this project was to synthesize shaped micro and nano sized particles with ideal dielectric properties for converting electromagnetic energy into heat and proven capabilities of activating methane. These particles were synthesized via solvothermal, hydrothermal, and co-preceptory treatments alone and onto the surface of dried PRB coal char. PRB is a sub-bituminous, low-ranking coal (LRC) containing impurities processing ideal properties for heating using microwave radiation. MW irradiation of metal oxides and char improved conversion of reforming gasses (CH4 and CO2), reacting at lower temperatures than typically used with conventional heating methods. Lower DRM temperature parameters translate into diminished energy requirements, optimizing cost minimalization for a manufacturer. Outlet stream gases were monitored to examine effects of altering a particle’s morphology, size, and shape, and the products that evolve from these reactor experiments. Additionally, varying the wt% of the catalysts on the dried PRB coal char were tested. Characterizations were completed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-controlled desorption (TPD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gas chromatography (GC), and transmission line and free space method dielectric testing on all the materials synthesized. The purpose of this research was to improve understandings and the development of low-rank coal char to fuel synthesis, evaluate solid/gas interactions between Mo-based metal oxides, PRB coal char, and reforming gases, analyze the effects of MW irradiation use in these reactions compared to conventional heating methods, observe the effects of metal oxide particle sizes/morphologies and their effects on reforming reactions, and increase future viability and applicability of these processes.

TI  - Effects of Maternal Stress on Physiology and Morphology
SP  - 67
AB  - Environmental perturbations, such as the introduction of invasive species, can impose novel selective pressures on a variety of taxa. This can result in changes in fitness-relevant traits within an individual’s lifetime or across multiple generations that allow the species to better cope with the stressor. One important physiological response to the presence of a stressor is the release of hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT). CORT can trigger adaptive behavioral and physiological responses to a stressor, but prolonged exposure to CORT can have negative effects on the organism. Elevated levels of CORT in gravid females can also affect their offspring. Such maternal stress effects are becoming an increasingly important topic in the biomedical and ecological fields. Since maternal CORT can modify offspring traits, this could prepare offspring for high stress environments or, as is typically assumed in humans, could have detrimental effects on their health and survival. In our ever-changing world, understanding within- and cross-generational effects of exposure to novel stressors is critical to predicting and managing their consequences. My dissertation research tested the effects of CORT on various life stages and across generations using a system of native fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) and invasive fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). This is a useful system for testing this as fire ants are a newly introduced predator and prey of the lizards and represent a natural stressor that varies across populations, maternal CORT concentrations can be manipulated non-invasively, and fitness-relevant (i.e., health and survival) outcomes for mothers and offspring can be quantified. The endocrine-axis is highly conserved across all vertebrates, so the results of my research are applicable to other vertebrates, including humans. By manipulating CORT of gravid females, mimicking a naturally stressful encounter (e.g., with predators or heat stress), daily until they laid eggs, I was able to test the effects of this physiological response on traits of mothers and their offspring. The results of my dissertation research have contributed to our understanding of the effects of maternal CORT in three main ways. First, I reveal that maternal CORT impacts the physiology of offspring both within the egg and at 1 week old but does not impact the mother’s physiology. Second, I found that maternal CORT can alter offspring traits and allocation of resources from mother to offspring in sex-specific ways. Third, I show that the influence of stress within an organism’s lifetime is not as important as stress experienced across multiple generations. Overall, my dissertation addresses a number of important gaps in our understanding of the effects of maternal stress. The results of my work reveal that CORT produced in response to a stressor can affect how mothers allocate resources to their offspring, prioritizing daughters over sons, and can affect physiology (i.e., heart rate) of offspring even while still in the egg, which can affect survival relevant traits after hatching. I show that stress experienced by an individual’s ancestors trumps the stress experienced within its own lifetime with respect to the individual’s health and survival. Together, my research furthers our understanding of the factors that influence the health and survival outcomes of stress, which may also prepare offspring for the stressful environments they will be born into.

TI  - Effect of Genetic Diversity on The Response to Temperatures Stress of Populations And Individuals of Mastrus ridens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae)
SP  - 40
AB  - Genetic variability can affect the response of insects to variable and stressful environmental conditions. In this work we study the effect of genetic variability on population growth and fitness of populations and individuals of endogamic and exogamic lines of M. ridens (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), an important parasitoid of the apple moth (Cydia pomonella), when exposed to optimum constant temperatures (OT = 25ºC) or variable extreme temperatures (VT = 1 h at 33ºC, 20 min at 25ºC, 1 h at 6ºC and the rest at 25ºC) throughout their life. The population experiments were observed for three generations, while those individual female experiments were one generation and the L39 line for two generations.In the results we found that genetic variability does affect in part the capacity of populations and individual females to respond to variable and stressful environmental conditions. The associated parameters were: the total number of individuals generated and the number of sons. On the other hand, the lack of effects on the sexual radius suggests that the sex determination mechanism would not be a relevant factor in the adequacy in conditions of variable and extreme temperatures. These results highlight the need to carry out more biological suitability studies against natural enemies in stressful environments due to the contingency of climate change.Alternate abstract:El control biológico clásico tiene como objetivo disminuir las plagas invasoras por medio de la introducción de enemigos naturales desde la zona de origen de estas (Wanget al., 2019) y es común que en su desarrollo las poblaciones de enemigos naturales pasen por cuellos de botella (Hufbauer, et al., 2004; Retamal et al., 2016). Esto tiene un efecto negativo al disminuir el tamaño poblacional y la variabilidad genética, lo que puede resultar en una disminución de la adecuación biológica de los organismos en esas poblaciones (Szucs et al., 2017). Adicionalmente, debido al tamaño limitado de las poblaciones mantenidas en laboratorio, es probable que en muchas ocasiones ocurra la endogamia (Pray et al., 1994), causando deriva genética y la posibilidad de fijación de alelos perjudiciales (Hedrick y Kalinowski, 2000; Frankham, 1995), reduciendo la aptitud de la descendencia producto del apareamiento consanguíneo (Armbruster y Reed, 2005).La endogamia puede tener un efecto negativo en el establecimiento, crecimiento y en la persistencia a largo plazo de las poblaciones, aumentando así la probabilidad de extinción local de la especie, a diferencia de los cruzamientos exogámicos, que generalmente aumentan la probabilidad de establecimiento y persistencia de las poblaciones en el tiempo (Szucs et al., 2017). La pérdida en adecuación biológica producto de la endogamia se denomina “depresión por endogamia” (Hildner et al., 2003; Lande, 1988; Plough, 2012), y se ha documentado por más de un siglo en diferentes especies de plantas y animales (Hedrick y Kalinowski, 2000; Armbruster y Reed, 2005; Charlesworth y Willis, 2009). Diferentes autores han afirmado que la depresión por endogamia aumenta en ambientes estresantes (Cheptou et al., 2001; Kristensen et al., 2003; Hayes et al., 2005; Fox y Reed, 2011), ya que la expresión génica cambia (Armbruster y Reed, 2005) y es en estas condiciones donde los genes que permiten sobrellevar las condiciones de estrés deben expresarse.La endogamia ilustra la sinergia entre: genética, demografía y comportamiento. Esto implica la reproducción entre individuos genéticamente relacionados, conduciendo así a una disminución de la heterocigosidad (Hansson y Westerberg, 2002). Cuando las poblaciones son sometidas a ambientes variables, existen dos posibles mecanismos de respuesta; el primero es la plasticidad fenotípica y el segundo es la respuesta evolutiva. La plasticidad fenotípica permite a un organismo responder rápidamente a nuevas condiciones, manteniendo su adecuación biológica y se refiere a cuánto es capaz el entorno de modificar a la expresión fenotípica de una especie, dependiendo si se aplica a individuos o a genotipos (Sgró, et al., 2016; Auld, et al., 2009). La respuesta evolutiva poblacional se expresa en un plazo mayor, ya que implica un cambio en la constitución genética de la población debido a la selección a través de las generaciones (Sgró, et al., 2016).Debido a que los insectos son ectotermos, la temperatura (Tº) del ambiente es un factor importante, influyendo en muchos aspectos de la ecología y el desarrollo de los insectos (Easterling et al., 2000; Hansen et al., 2000). Las temperaturas extremas son estresantes y tienen efectos perjudiciales en la sobrevivencia y reproducción de los insectos (Rinehart et al., 2000; Malmendal et al., 2006; Hance et al., 2007; Terblanche et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2012). Los cambios de Tº también pueden influir en la biología de especies interactuantes, provocando una desestabilización en las dinámicas poblacionales (Van der Putten et al., 2004).

TI  - Improving the Urban Resource Nexus Through Urban Agriculture Systems with Biowaste Utilisation and Renewable Energy
AB  - The food systems in developed societies face a host of challenges in the early 21st century; increasing urbanisation, supply chain shocks due to extreme climate events and pandemics, high impacts of air freight, nutrient run-off and animal farming, and tremendous amounts of wasted food and nutrients. A transformation to a more sustainable and resilient food system includes, among other pathways, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, a localisation of food production and the recovery of nutrients in urban organic waste. Urban agriculture thus receives emerging research interest, ranging from community gardens to high-tech indoor farming. Efforts so far have focused on socio-economic aspects and life-cycle assessments of individual case studies or have described the qualitative potential of integrating urban waste streams into urban farming. Significant gaps remain in the literature about the carbon and land intensity of different growing methods when scaled-up and the quantification of productivity and nutrient recovery potentials. On the city and regional level, the design of productive food systems integrated with biowaste management and renewable energy systems has found little attention so far. These gaps are addressed in this thesis through mathematical modelling and geospatial analysis at multiple scales, including the facility, the urban area, a metropolitan area, and the regional level. The match of supply and demand of a scaled-up urban food production system and their organic waste flow utilisation potential was assessed and compared for two urban areas, Glasgow and Lyon. Potentially convertible land and rooftop space were determined with geospatial processing, and monthly biowaste utilisation in those new farms was optimised based on nutrient requirements and CO2 emission savings. The results showed that high self-sufficiency came with significantly increased CO2 emissions for the productive urban food system in the colder climate due to high demand and carbon intensity of electricity for greenhouses, which also negated the benefits of utilising a large share of the biowaste. The next project thus investigated the interplay and logistics of local composting treatment combined with low-input local farming for 76 districts in Porto from waste system perspective. Existing fields, convertible greenspaces, and compost island requirements were obtained from geospatial analysis and waste collection pilots and distance scripts informed collection and transport requirements to central facilities. The results showed that more remote districts could benefit both in cost and climate impacts from having their own decentralised biowaste systems, although mainly from collection route reduction rather than a conversion of greenspaces. Focusing more on the contextual sustainability of high-intensive growing methods, the energy consumption of electrified greenhouses and vertical farm facilities was assessed for ten regions across the globe. A rigorous thermodynamic model for lighting and air conditioning requirements was optimised for minimum specific energy in relation to the outside climate on an hourly basis. The outcomes showed that significant energy reductions can be achieved in greenhouses with optimised climate control, while local climate conditions and design choices still have a strong impact. Vertical farms, or plant factories, had significantly higher energy consumptions, even in extreme climates. The final project applied the learnings from the energy optimisation to a land-use based assessment of regionalised vegetable supply with renewable energy generation for nine city-regions. Potentially available land for energy generation was assessed, and the selection and sizing of solar PV and wind farms were economically optimised for the required electrical load. The results show that although greenhouse production requires oversized renewable energy systems due to higher load fluctuations, its land footprint is lower than that of open-field and vertical farming. The land use relative to existing and available land contextualised this finding, but a full regionalised vegetable supply was feasible and desirable for most of the regions. The implications from the work are that to achieve increased food self-sufficiency and climate change mitigation, energy-efficient and low-carbon urban agriculture approaches are indispensable. Recommendations for specific urban growing systems are strongly context-dependent and many transferable aspects of relevance to decision-makers have been quantified in this work. Further, the integration of biowaste mainly provides benefits from a holistic waste management perspective and thus a multi-stakeholder approach and commitments will always be required.

TI  - Radio-Frequency Atomic Magnetometry with a Rubidium Bose-Einstein Condensate
AB  - This thesis details progress in radio-frequency atomic magnetometry with ultracold rubidium atoms. Motivations and context are first covered, before an introduction of the main concepts required to understand the underlying physics is given. At first, a cold atom magnetometer is designed, built and characterised. Consistent 20 µK atoms are produced. Radio-frequency (RF) atomic magnetometry (AM) is performed by placing the atoms in a bias magnetic field and generating coherent precession with an external AC field. A noise floor at 330 pT/√Hz defines the sensor's sensitivity, with a range of applications. RF-AM is then performed with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The 20 µK atoms are loaded into a magnetic trap, where RF evaporation increases their phase space density (PSD = nλ^3dB, n is the density and λdB is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the atoms). Next, atoms are transferred into a hybrid dipole trap, collecting in a dimple created at the intersect of two high power laser beams. Production and stabilisation of these beams is described, which are focused down to a 75 µm beam waist at the trap position with a total power of 7 W. Optimisation of the evaporation process in both traps leads to consistent BEC production. A pure condensate with 4x10^4 atoms at 25 nK is reported. Radio-frequency magnetometry is performed at various probe volumes. With systematic optimisation a best AC sensitivity of 24 pT/√Hz with 3.4 × 10^8 atoms in the magnetic trap before evaporation is achieved. This is extended to the BEC with 4 × 10^4 atoms, where an AC sensitivity of 84 nT/√Hz and DC sensitivity of 14 nT/√Hz is reported, bringing previously achieved atomic magnetometry into the micrometer regime. A trade-off must be considered due to reduction in sensitivity at lower probe volumes. Volumes between 1.4×10−7 m^3 and 1.6×10−14 m^3 can be accessed, highlighting the sensors adaptability and tunability for different applications. The results are contextualised in the background of previously achieved magnetometers of various types. Finally, proof-of-concept electromagnetic induction imaging (EMI) measurements are made to confirm the sensor's viability for high resolution imaging.

TI  - The Mechanisms Underlying Sigh Generation in the PreBötzinger Complex Are Dependent on Neuroglial Interactions
SP  - 215
AB  - Rhythm generation is a vital component of life. Rhythmic activity regulates the circadian clock, which controls hormonal cycles, sleep wake states, blood pressure, body temperature, and reaction times. Rhythmogenesis underlies breathing and produces several behaviors -such as eupnea, sighs, and gasps- that are critical to everyday life. Moreover, rhythmic oscillations have emerged throughout the brain that link these coordinated activities together. Gaining a better understanding of rhythm generation and the underlying cell activities that make up these behaviors can help to provide a better understanding of many diseases which originate from the disruption of these cycles. The breathing networks in the medulla are a fantastic model system for studying rhythm generation. These areas maintain their intrinsic rhythm generating properties in vitro for extended periods of time, providing valuable insight into how individual cells and ion channels contribute to producing complex breathing behaviors. The preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) in the ventral-lateral medulla is one of these rhythmogenic circuits. Within this circuit, three behaviors necessary for normal breathing arise- normal breathing ‘eupnea’, sighing, and gasping. This thesis primarily focuses on the generation of the sigh rhythm. Sighing is a critical element of normal breathing that has vital physiological functions. Sighs are deep augmented breaths that are critical for survival as they prevent collapse of the lungs, clinically referred to as atelectasis, by re-inflating collapsed alveoli. Furthermore, during sleep, sighs trigger arousal to hypoxic conditions and are more common during REM sleep and transitions between different sleep states. Indeed, reduced sighing has been reported in infants who have died from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Sighing is also linked to higher-order brain function and emotions such as love, stress, exasperation, and is clinically tied to several anxiety disorders. These ‘augmented breaths’ occur at a rate of ~12 per hour in adults and much more frequently in infants. Sighs often occur as a superimposed burst overlaying the ongoing eupneic burst, giving the sigh its characteristic biphasic shape. Eupnea consists of three primary phases: inspiration, postinspiration, and active expiration, each hypothesized to be generated by an excitatory rhythmogenic microcircuit in the ventral lateral medulla. Evidence suggests that eupneic inspiration, gasping, and sighing are generated by the same breathing circuit, the preBötC. Yet, how the same neural circuit gives rise to two distinct rhythmic activities with separate timing characteristics remains unknown. The primary directive of this thesis is to provide a novel hypothesis for sigh generation.

TI  - Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Based Photoelectrochemical Systems for Efficient Solar Hydrogen Generation
SP  - 166
AB  - Direct solar hydrogen generation (DSTH) is a promising method for renewable hydrogen generation, where solar energy drives the generation of hydrogen and oxygen by molecular dissociation of water on a catalytic or semiconductor surface. Despite an enormous amount of work over the last few decades, DSTH has not yet been implemented on large scale due to low efficiency and high costs. Techno-economic analysis of different solar hydrogen generation systems has identified the solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency as an important parameter for cost reduction. The US Department of Energy has set a target of 20% STH efficiency by 2020, and an ultimate goal of 25% using low-cost materials to ensure the economic viability of direct solar hydrogen generation for large scale hydrogen production.This thesis investigates perovskite-silicon tandem photovoltaic (PV) and earth abundant catalysts-based systems for low-cost, high efficiency direct solar hydrogen generation. The thesis starts by developing a photoelectrochemical system based on perovskite PV and Si photocathodes in a tandem configuration. We demonstrate a high-performance Si photocathode, incorporating state-of-the-art charge selective passivation and earth abundant catalysts, with an applied bias to photon efficiency (ABPE) of over 10%. Earth abundant catalysts are fabricated by sputter deposition for direct integration with the silicon photocathode. Using a physical deposition method allows catalyst fabrication to be integrated easily with current PV manufacturing and allows the possibility of scaling up the system. Charge selective passivation layers improve the Si photocathode performance by roughly 70% compared to Si photocathode without any passivation, highlighting the importance of the efficiency loss due to recombination at the Si/catalyst interface. An overall water splitting efficiency of 17% is achieved for the photoelectrochemical system when combined with a previously reported Earth abundant OER catalyst and a wide bandgap perovskite solar cell in tandem.Next, we identify performance limitations and conceptualise practical device designs to improve the STH efficiency towards 20%, by developing a new theoretical framework to quantify and compare different loss mechanisms in PV based solar hydrogen generation systems and evaluate the potential of different loss mitigation techniques to improve the solar to hydrogen generation efficiency. Our analysis shows that the two largest losses in an ideal system are energy lost as heat in the photovoltaic component, and current and voltage mismatch between the PV and electrochemical (EC) components due to sub-optimal system configuration. Two different loss mitigation techniques are considered: decoupling the PV and EC system by introducing a power management unit, and thermal integration to improve the water splitting reaction kinetics by utilizing the heat losses from the PV component to increase the electrolyte temperature. Employing loss mitigation techniques targeting the two major efficiency losses results in predicted STH efficiencies above 20% for realistic perovskitesilicon tandem-based systems, without the need for further improvement of the photovoltaic devices or catalyst. These results identify where best to target interventions to mitigate losses and ensure maximum improvement in the performance.Next, we develop a system with perovskite-Si tandem PV and Ni based earth abundant catalysts with a record STH efficiency of 20%.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Fisheries Management; Addressing Evidence-Gaps in Baited-Pot Fisheries in the Irish Sea
SP  - 158
AB  - Static-gear fisheries using baited pots are an increasingly valuable component of the fishing industry in the Irish Sea. Target species include Common whelk (Buccinum undatum), Edible crab (Cancer pagurus), European lobster (Homarus gammarus), and Common prawn (Palaemon serratus). Together, the harvest of these four species from the Irish Sea area (ICES division VIIa) by British vessels totalled 7,938 t in 2019 and were valued at £14.67 million at the point of first sale. However, there is an absence of evidence-based management applied to the fisheries as a consequence of data-poor status in key areas including biological and ecological understanding of life-histories, fisheries-dependent information on catch and effort, and scientific assessment methodologies for stock assessments. This thesis aims to address specific knowledge-gaps important for the sustainable management of baited pot fisheries in the Irish Sea.Despite its relatively small size, the common prawn fishery is an economically important seasonal fishery in areas such as Cardigan Bay, Wales. The stock is prosecuted by a regulated open access fishery with no biologically referenced harvest control rules. In response to fluctuations in landings the fishing industry have adopted a size-selective harvesting regime of 10 mm carapace length (CL). This thesis presents a baseline of evidence for this fishery, and pays particular attention to the biological implications of size-selective harvesting and reproductive biology. Peak spawning occurred during the spring, whilst functional maturity of females was estimated at a CL of 9.9 mm. The species is sexually dimorphic, with females attaining a greater size than males. Size-selective harvesting results in a sex bias in landings as even large mature males often fail to recruit into the fishery.Whilst whelk fishing activity covers large geographical areas of the Irish Sea, whelk populations are known to be vulnerable to localised overexploitation, and despite the prominence of common whelk fisheries in the Irish Sea, they remain relatively unrestricted. This thesis evaluates fundamental biological parameters within an environmental context, focussing in particular on reproductive biology and growth. Analyses highlight that, at the time of sampling, the majority of populations were not adequately protected by technical measures with size-at-maturity estimates being greater than the applicable minimum conservation reference size. Using previously validated ageing techniques, size-at-age relationships are presented for Irish Sea populations. L∞ showed a significant negative linear relationship with sea temperature. Other parameters, including maximum growth rates and the age at which growth rate begins to decrease, showed clear trends with sea-bottom temperature but linear modelling failed to detect significant relationships.Despite the growing call to utilise fishery-dependent data in lieu of scientific stock assessments for data-poor fisheries, the resolution of these data are often insufficient for accurate catch and effort analysis. By trialling an Enhanced Electronic Reporting System (EERS) in the ‘mixed’ edible crab and European lobster fisheries in the Irish Sea, which integrates gear-in gear-out and mobile technologies, fisheries-dependent data has been shown to be a viable method of assessment. Using generalised additive models to investigate a dataset of environmental and fishing activity data, non-linear predictors of commercial landings-per-unit-effort (LPUE) data are estimated, which can be used to ‘standardise’ data.

TI  - Insect Size and Shape Responses to Temperature : a Case Study of British Odonata and Chironomidae (Diptera)
AB  - This PhD project investigated the response of wing length (as a proxy of body size) of Odonata and Chironomidae, and wing shape of Odonata to temperature and latitude. Three complementary data sources were used: natural history collections, field data, and mesocosm experiments. While natural history collections are valuable resources of specimens collected over long historical time scales, field data provides a modern perspective and mesocosm experiments provide a window on the future, under a predicted climate warming scenario. This PhD project used 5,331 museum specimens of 14 British Odonata species representing different life cycle types to examine the potential drivers of body size and wing shape responses to latitude and temperature (Chapter II and V). To control for latitude a field survey was performed during the summer of 2018 at Edington, Somerset to compare modern wing length of three species with historical data based on museum specimens of the same species collected at the same locality (Chapter III).Furthermore, to investigate body size responses of chironomids under a future temperature scenario, 1,976 adult specimens of six chironomid species were collected from mesocosm experiments which comprised ponds at ambient temperature and ponds maintained at 4℃ higher than ambient (Chapter IV). The results of Chapters II, III and IV showed that species and suborder (within Odonata) were significant factors affecting the magnitude of the temperature-size responses in Odonata and Chironomidae. Wing lengths of Zygoptera (Odonata) and Chironomidae are more sensitive to temperature and collection date than Anisoptera (Odonata). Zygoptera and Chironomidae tend to get smaller with increasingt emperature, likely due to higher temperatures disproportionately increasing developmental rate, resulting in smaller adults. Anisoptera showed no significant correlation with temperature, possibly due to selection for larger individuals in Anisoptera which are strongly territorial species. Adults of Zygoptera and Chironomidae emerging towards the end of the summer tend to be smaller than those emerging earlier in the season, likely due to larval development being time-constrainedlater in the season and as a result, larvae accelerate their developmental rate which comes at the cost of a smaller adult body size. The results of Chapter V indicated non-significant correlations between environment and wing shape in Anisoptera, while there were significant influences of latitude and mean seasonal temperature on wing shape in Zygoptera species, with broader and shorter wings found at lower latitudes with warmer temperatures. This finding corresponds well with a result of Chapter II which found shorter wing length with increasing temperature in all zygopteran species in the study. Overall, the results of this PhD project show that there are different factors influencing the temperature-size responses of insects, including phylogenetic relationships, sex, behaviour and life cycle types. Although this study found no universal temperature size responses in the focal taxa, Zygoptera and Chironomidae tend to have stronger negative body size responses to warming temperature and emergence date than Anisoptera. In addition, the study shows that wing shape variation in Zygoptera is more sensitive and adaptive to latitude and temperature than in Anisoptera.

TI  - Cellular and Organismal Strategies for Heat Acclimation in a Thermally Variable Environment
SP  - 253
AB  - Using mussels as an experimental system, I have challenged previous beliefs concerning how quickly animals gain and lose heat tolerance, and how this heat-adaptive strategy fits into the larger ecological context of animals' responses to climate change. I explore how the California mussel, Mytilus californianus, heat acclimates—physiologically adjusts to hotter temperatures—to a thermally variable environment. In the eight chapters that comprise my dissertation, I explore how mussels gain and lose heat acclimation (i.e., heat acclimation kinetics) to better understand how these heat-tolerant animals adjust to, and survive, in the intertidal zone—an environment where extreme and intermittent heat events frequently occur. Until now, it was unknown how quickly mussels could heat acclimate and then maintain this heat-acclimated state in the absence of further heat stress. Moreover, it was unclear whether the heat-acclimation temperature affected the rates of gain and loss of heat acclimation. To a large extent, it was also unknown what physiological mechanisms play a role in both the gain and loss of heat acclimation. Here, I address these important and closely interrelated questions by exploring how quickly mussels gain and lose heat acclimation, the various environmental components that shape this heat-adaptive strategy, and the cellular and organismal responses responsible for the heat-acclimation phenotype.In my first studies, which focused on whole-organism thermal responses, I show that the rate at which mussels are heated affects their thermal performance. I demonstrate that heating rate is a key component of heat acclimation that was previously not considered and therefore should be a part of predictive models that estimate animal survival with heat stress. On the converse side, I show that the absence of heat stress leads to a very slow decline in thermal performance, but only in mussels that experienced large temperature variability in the field. I thus reveal that heating rate is an important component of heat acclimation for animals living higher on the shore that experience large daily fluctuations in body temperature and fast heating rates.Next, I explore the kinetics of the heat acclimation response: the gain and loss of heat acclimation after a single heat-stress bout. I demonstrate that mussels can quickly heat acclimate (within 24-48 h) after a single heat-stress bout, and then maintain this improved heat tolerance for 2-3 weeks in the absence of additional heat stress. Importantly, the kinetics of the heat acclimation response are dependent on the heat-acclimation temperature, such that exposure to a hotter temperature leads to slower gain and loss of the heat-acclimation phenotype. I show that this adaptive strategy in the lab mirrors what animals experience in the field, where the majority of heat events are separated by 1-2 days, but up to one-third of heat events are still separated by up to 22 days. Thus, it is likely that mussels have evolved the heat-adaptive strategy in which they rapidly gain, and slowly lose, the heat-acclimation phenotype as a result of the frequency of extreme- and intermittent-heat events typical of their habitat.Next, I explored responses at the organ level, using performance of the heart—an extremely temperature-sensitive organ—to examine additional details of heat stress and acclimation.

TI  - Identification, Characterization, and Gene Expression Analysis of Thioester-Containing Proteins (TEPs), and the Host Response to Environmentally Evolved Bacteria in the Squid Euprymna scolopes
SP  - 134
AB  - The squid Euprymna scolopes forms a mutualistic symbiotic association with the bioluminescent marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Various host and microbial factors regulate symbiotic associations and host immune components and are believed to play a crucial role in the establishment and maintenance of these symbiotic associations. E. scolopes is an invertebrate animal and does not contain a classical antibody dependent adaptive immune system. Thus, it relies only on its innate immune system, which has two major types of components: humoral and cellular. Among these components, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are a large group of first-line sensors that allow the host to recognize and distinguish foreign agents from self-molecules and are involved in both humoral and cellular immune responses. Thioester containing proteins (TEPs), are one of the most phylogenetically ancient innate immune PRRs molecules and found in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. However, many of these molecules have not been well characterized and immune functions of these molecules in the animal-beneficial bacteria associations have not been well studied. The first objective of this study was to investigate the presence and diversity of TEP molecules in E. scolopes and their possible role in symbiosis. It was hypothesized that E. scolopes contains diverse TEP molecules and that these molecules are modulated in the presence of symbiotic bacteria to allow for efficient colonization and maintenance in the dynamics of symbiosis. In silico methods were used to identify and initially characterize the TEP molecules in E. scolopes. Transcriptome analysis resulted in the identification of eight different TEP molecules (A2M-1, A2M-2, C3-1, C3-2, TEP-1, TEP-2, TEP-3, and MCR-1) in E. scolopes that were categorized into four subfamilies. In this study, E. scolopes A2M and MCR molecules were identified for the first time. To verify the expression of TEP molecules, end point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify TEP transcripts in uncolonized and colonized juveniles, and in one adult tissue. Six out of the eight TEPs (A2M-1, A2M-2, C3-1, C3-2, TEP-1, TEP-2, and MCR-1) were successfully amplified in all three types of samples tested: whole body of uncolonized and colonized juveniles, and adult gill tissue. TEP-2 was not able to be amplified in any of the three samples, while TEP-3 was amplified only in 24 h-colonized juveniles and in adult gills. Real time-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that three genes (C3-1, C3-2, and MCR-1) were downregulated, with statistical significance, in 48 h-colonized juveniles, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to V. fischeri bacteria results in the modulation of the squid host’s immune genes to allow for the symbiont colonization and persistence. The next phase of this research study focused on investigating the effects of environmentally evolved symbiotic V. fischeri on the development, survival, and health of the squid. The highly specific squid-Vibrio symbiotic association provides an experimental model to investigate the role of symbionts on the development of animal host tissues. In nature, E. scolopes acquires its symbiont V. fischeri horizontally from the surrounding seawater within few hours of hatching. Then, the bacteria will colonize the crypt spaces, a specialized region in the squid’s light organ (LO). Following colonization by V. fischeri, the juvenile LO undergoes multiple developmental changes, including the regression and apoptosis of the ciliated epithelial appendages (CEA). It was hypothesized that environmentally evolved V. fischeri strains that respond to environmental stressors such as temperature changes will adapt and have a better ability to colonize the squid’s LO compared to the ancestral strains. To test this hypothesis, two objectives were formulated: (1) to examine the timeline progression of morphological changes in the juvenile squid LO following colonization with temperature-evolved V. fischeri strains, and compare to that of their ancestral strains; and (2) to assess squid’s health and survival upon exposure to temperature evolved strains and compare to that of their ancestral strains. Analysis of regression of the appendages surface epithelium indicated that the temperature evolved strains of V. fischeri ES114 and EM17 showed faster morphological changes in the LO, suggesting that these temperature evolved strains could be more efficient in initiating the developmental process in the squid than their corresponding ancestral strains. Survival and health of juvenile squid were not affected by the colonization by temperature evolved strains. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the squid-Vibrio symbiosis can be adapted and sustained despite abiotic changes in their environment and provide a framework for future studies on the symbiosis between animals and environmentally adapted bacteria.

TI  - Adaptation and Plasticity Within and Across Generations
AB  - The environment is seldom stable but often changes from one state to another and in order to survive and reproduce organisms need to respond to those changes. If the change is fast, genetic adaptations may not evolve quickly enough and organisms must adopt other strategies, such as phenotypic plasticity. As there are different types of environmental variations, the optimal type of plasticity also differs. However, plasticity is not always adaptive but can sometimes result in phenotype further away from the optimum. In the thesis I investigate how different types of environmental variation influence adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. I used experimental evolution approaches (Paper I, II) and RNA interference, (Paper III) in Caenorhabditis remanei (Paper I, II) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Paper III). In Paper IV I tested whether trade-offs with lifespan are caused by energy allocation, and if there are trans-generational fitness effects. In Paper I I show that the evolution of life histories, indeed, depends on whether organisms evolve in stable, fluctuating or variable temperatures. I also show, that the plastic response to temperature is in line with the temperature-size rule and that this response is adaptive. In Paper II I look closer on the evolutionary response to highly variable environments. I show that worms respond to fast changes in temperature by increasing the degree of phenotypic plasticity, rather than using bet-hedging. I again confirmed that plasticity in size follows the temperature size rule and that it is adaptive. In Paper III I examine how organisms respond to temperature changes that occur within their lifetime. I found that after initial decrease in growth rate as a response to cold temperatures, once temperature increases worms exhibit increased growth rate, which corresponds to the compensatory growth plasticity. Interestingly, the worms didn’t pay any cost in longevity or reproduction but had higher fitness. In addition, I show that temperature-induced compensatory growth is regulated by TRPA-1 ion channel (trpa-1gene). Finally, in Paper IV, I show that optimization of gene expression by down-regulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling via daf-2 RNAi from sexual maturity in C. elegans can more than double longevity without imposing any cost on reproduction. This is not expected if investment in lifespan and reproduction compete for the same energy pool. Importantly, I also showed that the positive effects for the parents did not come at a trans-generational cost for the offspring, since they exhibited increased reproduction and fitness.

TI  - Coral Reefs in the Anthropocene Ocean: Novel Insights from Skeletal Proxies of Climate Change, Impacts, and Resilience
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are driving rapid changes in ocean conditions. Shallow-water coral reefs are experiencing the brunt of these changes, including intensifying marine heatwaves (MHWs) and rapid ocean acidification (OA). Consequently, coral reefs are in broad-scale decline, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. Ensuring survival of coral reefs in the 21st century will thus require a new management approach that incorporates robust understanding of reef-scale climate change, the mechanisms by which these changes impact corals, and their potential for adaptation. In this thesis, I extract information from within coral skeletons to 1) Quantify the climate changes occurring on coral reefs and the effects on coral growth, 2) Identify differences in the sensitivity of coral reefs to these changes, and 3) Evaluate the adaptation potential of the keystone reef-building coral, Porites. First, I develop a mechanistic Porites growth model and reveal the physicochemical link between OA and skeletal formation. I show that the thickening (densification) of coral skeletal framework is most vulnerable to OA and that, under 21st century climate model projections, OA will reduce Porites skeletal density globally, with greatest impact in the Coral Triangle. Second, I develop an improved metric of thermal stress, and use a skeletal bleaching proxy to quantify coral responses to intensifying heatwaves in the central equatorial Pacific (CEP) since 1982. My work reveals a long history of bleaching in the CEP, and reef-specific differences in thermal tolerance linked to past heatwave exposure implying that, over time, reef communities have adapted to tolerate their unique thermal regimes. Third, I refine the Sr-U paleo-thermometer to enable monthly-resolved sea surface temperatures (SST) generation using laser ablation ICPMS. I show that laser Sr-U accurately captures CEP SST, including the frequency and amplitude of MHWs. Finally, I apply laser Sr-U to reconstruct the past 100 years of SST at Jarvis Island in the CEP, and evaluate my proxy record of bleaching severity in this context. I determine that Porites coral populations on Jarvis Island have not yet adapted to the pace of anthropogenic climate change.

TI  - Musculoskeletal Pain and Postural Discomfort Experienced by the Marble Cutting Workers in the Marble Industry
SP  - 327
AB  - The marble industry in Kishangarh comprises of more than 500 marble industries. The area has employed a large number of direct and indirect labourers. It has more than thousand persons employed in marble cutting units. The marble industry is emerging as an important industry for the construction agencies. The marble cutting in tiles is done on marble cutting workstation. For better functioning of the industry health of the worker is important because it affects the efficiency and the production of the industry worker but at the same time affects the total production of the industry. The loss of human resource is the loss to the economy of the nation.While performing the marble cutting activity, body segments are manipulated in the space available resulting in changes to posture. The industrial working environment, the environmental factors like illumination, noise, humidity, temperature affect the productivity of the worker.Stone quarrying, cutting and masonry is one of the many industries which involve moderate to heavy manual work. Due to the nature of manual work and use of tools, stonecutting job may potentially cause work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders.The anthropometric data of the marble cutters involved in marble industry, their working environment, physiological cost of work, their posture analysis and occupational related disorders experienced by them is yet to be explored. Thus, the present study is conceptualized. The present research aims to assess the musculoskeletal pain and postural discomfort experienced by the marble cutting workers in the marble industry.The research design of the study was descriptive because information regarding the musculoskeletal pain experienced by the marble cutting workers, physiological cost of work and fatigue experienced by the respondents was also collected. The sample comprised of 220 marble cutting workers working on the marble tile cutting workstation in the marble industry. Purposive sampling design was utilized for selecting the sample. An interview schedule cum observation sheet was resorted to gather the data. The interview schedule cum observation sheet comprised of five sections. The interview schedule cum observation sheet contained six sections namely Demographic profile, Anthropometric data and Workstation Dimensions of the respondents, Perceived Musculoskeletal Information on Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain, Postural Discomfort for which The Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) checklist was used Environment of the Workplace, Physiological Cost of Work and Perceived Fatigue which was measured by the researcher through prevalidated FACIT Scale. The content validity was established. An ergonomic intervention programme for the selected owners and marble cutting workers to improve the environment of the workplace and maintaining appropriate work postures during the work was designed. Brochures and posters were prepared in English and Hindi Language and distributed among the industrial owners. The posters were displayed at the workstation for the respondents to remember the information.The mean age of the respondents was 36.77 years. Less than one half of the respondents belonged to the age group of 35- 40 years. More than one-third of the respondents had educational qualification up to Primary Education (up to 5th standard). The mean years of experience was 12.26 years. Slightly less than on half of the respondents had experience of working since 11-15 years in the marble industry. Slightly more than two-third of the respondents had a less than or equal to 5 years of working experience in the present industry. Majority of the respondents were right handed. More than one-half of the respondents were found to be feeling “Very Good” regarding their physical wellness before the start of their work as compared to during work and after work.The mean anthropometric measurements of the respondents were calculated in the present study. The mean height of the respondents was logged as 67.09 inches. The height of the workstation was measured 34.5 inches. The width of the workstation was 43 inches. The length of the workstation was 77 inches. Shoulder was ranked first followed by elbows and back in perceived musculoskeletal pain since past 7 days. The perceived musculoskeletal pain in the past 12 months revealed that back was ranked highest followed by palms and shoulder. Majority of the respondents were at ‘high risk’ of Musculoskeletal Disorder requiring further investigation and changes on an immediate basis. Less than two third of the industries had light below recommended levels (1000 lux). The analysis of the perceived comfort level of the respondents revealed that slightly more than one half respondents perceived that the lighting was “comfortable”. Slightly less than one-half of the industries had Very High noise level 107- 112 dB. The lowest humidity recorded was 33% and highest humidity recorded while the respondents were working was 46%. Slightly less than two third of industries were having temperature ranging from 36-38 °C. The vibration produced by the marble cutting workstation was 46.67 Hertz.Majority of the respondents were not provided any training for vibration and posture. It was also observed that slightly less than on-half of the respondents were provided training for avoiding repetition of work. Majority of the respondents were not provided any rest breaks to relieve stress from repetitive motions. The use of any protection of hands was not found to be a practice by majority of the respondents. Majority of the respondents were not found to be using ear plugs for protection from excessive noise. Almost half of the respondents were found to be severely fatigued and slightly less than one half of the respondents experienced “Less Fatigue”. Slightly less than two third of the respondents had “Moderately Heavy” physiological workload of the task performed by them.A significant variation was found in the Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain of the marble cutting workers in various parts of the body with their Perceived Health Status during work. The F values were not found to be significant for the Physiological Cost of Work of the respondents with their Age, Years of Working Experience and Perceived Health Status (during work) and (after work). The results showed a significant relationship with the physiological cost of work and the Noise level. The results showed a significant variation in the Perceived Fatigue experienced by the respondents with their Health Status before and after work. The results revealed there was a significant positive relationship between the Perceived Fatigue and Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain experienced by the respondents.An ergonomic intervention programme was organized for the selected marble industry respondents and marble cutting workers. A brochure was prepared with detailed description on the use, benefits and availability of the protective aids. The owners were sensitized by the researcher by giving brochures which included the benefits of providing protective aids to the workers. Posters were also developed and designed for the workers in Hindi language as they did not have a command on English. The intervention programme was packed with knowledge and a discussion was conducted with the owners and the marble cutting workers.The study reflected clear implications for the need to educate the stakeholders regarding Ergonomic Practices in Marble Industry. An ergonomic intervention programme can be used to create awareness and promote training to the employees and using protective aids while working in the industry. The Kishangarh Marble Industry, labour laws need to meet the challenges faced by the daily wage workers in unorganized sector.

TI  - Rising Oxygen Concentrations as a Driver of Macroevolutionary Trends in Marine Communities
SP  - 110
AB  - The onset of the Phanerozoic (541 Ma to present) marks a transition point in the evolution of life on Earth. The evolutionary dynamics of this period and its linkages to the physical environment have long been the focus of paleontologists. In this dissertation, I investigate the role of changing oxygen concentrations on the long-term evolutionary trends in Phanerozoic oceans. In particular, I focus on the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, a period of rapid evolutionary transition towards increasingly active communities. In contrast to canonical model reconstructions of atmospheric oxygen during Phanerozoic which show little correlation to evolutionary trends in the marine fossil record, the data presented here suggest an important role for oxygen. I first construct a record of carbonate sediment color to track redox state at the sediment-water interface through time and demonstrate that, despite persistently high levels of atmospheric oxygen, benthic environments may have been poorly oxygenated until 200 million years ago. This record opens up the possibility that shallow marine communities faced selective pressures from oxygen-limited environments until about the time of the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Building on the sedimentary evidence for a Mesozoic rise in ocean oxygenation, my second chapter builds a quantitative record of metabolic rates in marine communities using modern metabolic rates combined with molecular clock and fossil record ages. This record illustrates that pronounced shifts in metabolic demand occurred during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution from increasing body size and oxygen availability in shallow marine environments. I expand upon this finding by quantifying temperature and oxygen state spaces of living organisms to show that taxa from clades with Paleozoic origins occupy a lower temperature and dissolved oxygen space than clades evolved in the Mesozoic or later. This suggests temperature and oxygen conditions of the deep-sea may act as a barrier against Mesozoic clades and provide refugia for formerly shallow marine Paleozoic communities. In summary, the data presented from this thesis suggest that low oxygen concentrations acted as a limiting variable in the evolution of metabolically active fauna. The data also suggest Paleozoic deep-water communities experienced dissolved oxygen concentrations that varied significantly from equilibrium with the atmosphere.

TI  - How Eco-Evolutionary Interactions Mitigate Climate Risk: A Theoretical Perspective
SP  - 169
AB  - Accelerated rates of climate change are expected to either lead to adaptation and persistence, or extinction. Traditionally, ecological models predict extinction risk based on how environmental change alters a population’s intrinsic growth rate (r). However, these predictions often ignore the potential for evolutionary rescue, whereby populations avoid extinction via adaptive evolution. This dissertation sets out to address what allows rapid evolution to rescue natural populations in the face of environmental change. Our current lack of understanding of the role of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and their combined effect on population responses to climate change, demands further theoretical and experimental work to investigate these processes. I utilize theoretical modeling approaches to investigate the dynamics of small populations that have been reduced due to environmental change, and what allows them to rebound and avoid extinction.(1) Successful evolutionary tracking depends on how selection acts on key life history traits. The environment may impose selective pressure on specific demographic rates (birth and death) rather than directly on r (the difference between the birth and death rates). Therefore, when considering the potential for evolutionary rescue, populations with the same r can have different abilities to persist amidst environmental change. We cannot adequately understand evolutionary rescue without accounting for demography, and interactions between density dependence and environmental change. Using stochastic birth-death population models, I found evolutionary rescue to be more likely when environmental change alters the birth rather than death rate. Furthermore, species that evolve via density-dependent selection are less vulnerable to extinction than species that undergo selection independent of population density. Resolving the key demographic factors affected by environmental change can lead to an understanding of how populations evolve to avoid extinction. By incorporating these considerations into our models we can better predict how species will respond to climate change.(2) Propensity for evolutionary rescue varies in complex environments. Natural populations may experience a diversity of selection pressures across space and time due to differences in spatial and temporal environments, as well as in the competition they are subject to. I develop a spatially explicit individual based model to determine how the slope, spatial heterogeneity and patchiness of an environmental gradient as well as the dispersal ability of individuals will alter population extinction risk across a landscape due to environmental change. We find that as expected, the larger the magnitude of environmental change, the more likely a population will go extinct. Furthermore, there is a complex interplay between the spatial scenarios of gradient steepness, patchiness, and heterogeneity. Components that tend to encourage genetic diversity via local adaption to spatially diverse landscapes tended to allow for persistence. But, there are notable exceptions to this general rule. Too much heterogeneity leads populations to being maladapted to their local environment. In this case, landscape patchiness can serve to allow for environmental refugia. Thus we show that the spatial landscape significantly alters probability of evolutionary rescue, highlighting the importance of spatial realism in predictive models.(3) Resource scarcity plays a vital role in thermal performance amidst changing temperatures. Consumers and resources both have characteristic responses to temperature change, but how these temperature responses interact in the context of consumer-resource dynamics and adaptive evolution has not been well established. We utilize a consumer resource model to assess how communities will respond to temperature change. Our models demonstrate that within the consumer thermal niche, performance and equilibrium biomass differ. This implies that estimates of thermal stress and extinction risk based solely upon the individual thermal performance is problematic. We find that as consumers reduce a resource, there is adaptive pressure for that resource to grow successfully at lower temperatures where the consumer uptake rate is lower. Lastly we assess the importance of thermal asymmetry of the consumer and resource. If the resource’s thermal performance shifts to warmer temperatures, the consumer’s persistence in low temperatures decreases to reflect the effect of resource limitation at low temperatures. Likewise if the resource’s thermal performance shifts to colder temperatures, the consumer’s ability to persist in the hottest temperatures also decreases. Thus we must consider the dynamic interplay between temperature and interacting species as this can determine species response to temperature.Overall, we find that the assumptions we make when modeling environmental change in the life history of individuals, species interactions, and their spatial landscape have significant effects on species ability to survive environmental change. We provide generalizable frameworks to improve our ability to understand and predict how natural populations will respond to climate change.

TI  - The Coincidental Evolution Hypothesis: Examining the Factors that Affect Virulence in an Opportunistic Pathogen
SP  - 60
AB  - The coincidental evolution hypothesis proposes that virulence in an opportunistic bacterial pathogen arises in response to selection from predators in the outside-host environment. Opportunistic pathogens, unlike obligate pathogens, do not need a host for survival, and exist in multiple environments where they face selective pressure from eukaryotic predators. This results in a population of bacteria with the best defenses against predation—mechanisms which “coincidentally” cause harm during host infection. Few studies have examined the coincidental evolution hypothesis, and those that have present conflicting results.Here, we investigated the validity of the coincidental evolution hypothesis by subjecting the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens to three different scenarios: (1) co-culture with the ciliate predator Tetrahymena thermophila, (2) growth in the absence of predators alone in media, and (3) growth within the guts of germ-free honey bees. We hypothesized that strains evolved in the presence of a predator would display increased virulence and strains evolved in the absence of predators or within a host would exhibit decreased virulence.Our study revealed that evolution in the presence of a predator resulted in increased virulence of S. marcescens. When compared to the media-evolved isolate, all predator-evolved lines exhibited increased pathogenicity in honey bees. However, when investigating how within-host evolution impacts virulence, we observed little to no change in virulence in host-evolved lines. We hypothesize that the lack of attenuated virulence in within-host-evolved strains is due to lack of selective pressure due to S. marcescens already being found at low levels in the bee gut.Overall, our findings indicate that predation plays a role in the evolution of virulence in opportunistic pathogens and thus support the coincidental evolution hypothesis. We were also able to identify mutations and genes potentially associated with virulence. This study sheds light of the factors that impact virulence and drive the evolution of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  - Nanoparticle Treatment Modalities for Mitigating Pathogenic Bacteria and Biofilms
SP  - 144
AB  - Biofilms pose a significant clinical problem in skin and soft tissue infections. Despite clinical standards for treating these virulent microbial structures, biofilms remain extremely common and difficult to eradicate. Their inherent resistance to treatment (like antibiotic exposure) has spurred investigations into alternative treatment modalities. Nanoparticle-mediated photothermal ablation has become a novel modality for application in fighting pathogenic biofilms. Organic donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNP) may be more efficient and stable than metal and more biocompatiblethan carbon. Here, we present a formulation of D-A CPNPs called PolyDOTS for rapid, near-infrared photothermal ablation (NIR-PTA) and combined antibiotic treatment against pathogenic bacteria and biofilms. We show that PolyDOTS absorb in the near-infrared range (NIR) for heat generation and fluorescence under visible light stimulation. Herein, we demonstrate how PolyDOTS have good photothermal conversion efficiency and exhibit exceptional heat generation. We show that PolyDOTS NIR-PTA can eradicate bacterial populations and reduce biofilm bacterial viability by more than 4- log (> 99.99%), after exposure to 60 seconds of focal hyperthermia, between 50.6 and 57.3°C.Reductions were confirmed via LIVE/DEAD confocal analysis, which suggested that the treatment may have caused bacterial inactivation within the biofilms. COMSTAT analysis indicated that PolyDOTS PTA resulted in reductions in biofilm biomass, while confocal analysis of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) suggested that the treatment did not significantly reduce polysaccharides. SEM imaging revealed increasingly pronounced aggregation, and previously unobserved structural changes to the ECM after PolyDOTS PTA. S. aureus biofilms challenged with 100 µg/mL of PolyDOTS (PD-100) and theminimal biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of clindamycin, resulted in up to ~ 3-log decrease in bacterial viability compared to untreated biofilms and those administered PD-100 PTA only, and up to ~ 2- log compared to biofilms administered only MBEC treatment. SEM imaging of the treatments indicated that morphological and structural changes induced by PolyDOTS PTA might be reversible, but regrowth is limited after treatment. This study provides evidence that polymer nanoparticle PTA can successfully mitigate biofilm infection and improve existing treatment by enhancing antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  - Evolution of Development and Gene Expression in Drosophila
SP  - 147
AB  - Evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) is the study of trait evolution through variation in development. As early as the modern synthesis, it was recognized that to an understanding of the function of genes during development was critical to understanding evolution as a whole. To that end, modern evo-devo leverages advances in next-generation sequencing to study both the molecular changes that produce interspecific differences in development, as well as the molecular changes associated with evolution in life-history. In this thesis, I use lab-adapted populations selected for early (Fast) and late-life (Slow) fertility to better understand how life-history selection has led to changes in development and gene expression. These replicated selection lines provide a microevolutionary lens of development time and associated changes in gene expression, both at the transcriptome and the individual gene level. I found development time to be highly diverged between Fast and Slow selection treatments, though the differences are not proportionate throughout ontogeny. Furthermore, development was highly convergent, with replicate Fast/Slow lines exhibiting highly similar development time. Preliminary transcriptome analysis through RNA-seq suggests the difference in development could be at least partially due to differential ecdysone regulation. Overall, differences in the developmental transcriptome between Fast and Slow were driven by trans-regulatory divergence – a result consistent with strong selection on a microevolutionary timescale. Lastly, I found no clear evidence that Fast and Slow flies differ greatly in their molecular response to stress, suggesting the heat-shock stress response does not trade-off with divergent life-history in this system. In this thesis, I have shown that the developmental transcriptome can change dramatically on a microevolutionary time-scale. Furthermore, I showed some evidence that developmental evolution can be highly convergent at the phenotypic and global transcriptome level. However, this is not necessarily the case when looking at specific pathways. Overall, my research adds to the growing body of literature on gene expression evolution and provides a foundation for further research into the molecular dynamics of evo-devo changes on microevolutionary time-scales.

TI  - Between a Hot and a Hypoxic Place: Does Reduced Oxygen Limit Lizard Thermal Limits and Performance as Predicted by the Hierarchical Mechanisms of Thermal Limitation Hypothesis?
SP  - 88
AB  - Although the effect of temperature on organismal performance is well characterized for ectotherms like lizards, how temperature interacts with other abiotic factors to impact fitness is relatively poorly understood. One such abiotic factor is oxygen, which is increasingly recognized for its effect on organisms’ aerobic scope – the capacity for aerobically powered work like growth, reproduction, and movement. The Hierarchical Mechanisms of Thermal Limitation (HMTL) hypothesis proposes that the interaction between temperature and oxygen shapes ectotherm performance and drive thermal limits. I tested a prediction of HMTL that thermal limits become oxygendependent when an organism’s metabolic demand for oxygen exceeds the oxygen available. Sceloporus occidentalis selected lower body temperatures under hypoxia and high metabolic demand, supporting the mechanistic prediction of HMTL. To further test predictions of HMTL, I measured the aerobic scope of Elgaria multicarinata under various oxygen-by-temperature treatments and used a novel framework to directly quantify the interactive effect of temperature and oxygen on performance. Elgaria thermal optima and peak performances were sensitive to oxygen. This sensitivity did not differ among recently-diverged clades, suggesting oxygen sensitivity is somewhat evolutionarily constrained. However, Elgaria oxygen sensitivity differed from preliminary Podarcis muralis data, suggesting oxygen sensitivities may be more evolutionarily labile on longer timescales.

TI  - Environmental Drivers and Evolutionary Consequences of Horizontal Gene Transfer in Soil Bacteria
SP  - 107
AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a driving force in bacterial evolution and could drive rapid adaptation in bacterial communities. Natural transformation is one mechanism of HGT that allows bacteria to pick up extracellular DNA (eDNA) from the environment and integrate it into their genome. But the rate of HGT in natural environments, and the role this process plays in facilitating rapid adaptation remains unknown. As climate change threatens the stability of environments worldwide, understanding how quickly bacteria can adapt to novel environments is essential. My dissertation research characterizes the environmental drivers and evolutionary consequences of natural transformation in a highly transformable model soil bacterium Pseudomonas stutzeri.Despite decades of research on understanding HGT at the molecular level, less is known about the ecological drivers of HGT. To understand the soil conditions relevant for transformation, I first measured eDNA in the field over a short-term drying rewetting disturbance (Ch. 2). I found that eDNA increased in response to the rewetting disturbance but quickly disappeared from soil, suggesting a small portion of this eDNA could be transformed by bacterial cells recovering from the disturbance. To test the efficiency of transformation under the conditions in which eDNA disappeared, I created a novel microcosm system for quantifying transformation in soil (Ch. 3). Here, I inoculated soil with live antibiotic-susceptible, and dead antibiotic-resistant P. stutzeri. I then tracked the evolution of antibiotic resistance over a range of soil conditions and eDNA concentrations. Transformation drove the evolution of antibiotic resistance across a wide range of soil moistures and increased in response to larger inputs of dead cells (eDNA source), with antibiotic resistance repeatedly appearing in antibiotic free soil. Despite the prevalence of transformation across bacterial species, the evolutionary origins and consequences of transformation are still largely unknown. Transformation presumably provides a fitness benefit in stressful or continuously changing environments, but few studies have quantified changes in transformation in response to adaptive evolution. Here, I evolved P. stutzeri at different salinities and tested how the growth rate and transformation efficiency changed in response to salt adaptation (Ch. 4). Overall, the growth rate increased in response to adaptation, but the transformation efficiency declined, with only ~50% of the evolved populations transforming eDNA at the end of experiment – as opposed to 100% of ancestral populations transforming eDNA. Overall, my dissertation research elucidates the factors driving transformation in soil, setting the stage for future experiments to scale up estimates of transformation to the whole community level. I find that transformation occurs under most soil conditions and allows genetic variants to arise at low frequencies in the absence of selection. I also report novel experimental evidence that transformation efficiency can change dramatically, and in a highly variable manner, over just ~330 generations. Taken together, this body of research highlights a role for transformation in many natural systems of ecological significance, and points to dead cells as an important but often overlooked source of genetic diversity.

TI  - Energetic Drivers of Behavior and Body Size in Bats
SP  - 122
AB  - Body temperatures outside narrow ranges can disrupt physiological processes, so animals frequently alter their behavior and other aspects of their ecology to avoid suboptimal thermal environments. During my dissertation research, I conducted three studies on how thermal environments shape the behavior and ecology of bats. In Chapter 1, I demonstrated that male northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) selected roost trees that were larger in diameter, more decayed, and under denser canopy than other trees available on the landscape—characteristics that might influence roosts’ thermal properties were unimportant. This research will inform forest management in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. In Chapter 2, I showed that male fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes) did not select roosts with specific thermal characteristics, nor did ambient temperature alter patterns of roost selection. Bats can likely modulate use of torpor to maintain a consistent level of energy expenditure over the course of a day, irrespective of ambient temperature, a finding that can inform studies of the influence of temperature on habitat selection by other heterotherms. In Chapter 3, I tested four competing hypotheses for spatio-temporal variation in body size within bat species. Spatial variation in body mass was most correlated with mean annual temperature (the mechanism historically believed to underlie Bergmann’s Rule), while temporal variation in body mass was most correlated with net primary productivity. Climate change is believed to be causing reductions in body size for animals, but reductions in body size will likely be more complex than has been appreciated.

TI  - Evolutionary Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection
AB  - Sex-specific selection is widespread, evident by the evolution of sexual dimorphism in many traits in sexually reproducing taxa. The reason why the sexes may experience selection that differs in direction or magnitude is often linked to the reproductive strategies associated with the sex-specific reproductive physiology. Competition for mates or fertilisations creates conditions where selection is sex-specific and may overall be stronger on the sex experiencing more competition. However, the sexes share a majority of their genome and consequently many traits may be genetically correlated between the sexes, constraining sex-specific adaptation. In paper I, II and III, I investigate the consequences of exposure to altered strength of sex-specific selection in the laboratory through 30 generations of experimental evolution with skewed sex ratios, using the sexually reproducing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei as a model organism. I created female-biased (FB) and male-biased (MB) treatments. In paper I, I investigated the phenotypic response to selection in three life history traits (body size, fitness and heat shock resistance as a proxy for somatic maintenance). I found a sex-specific response to the evolutionary treatments for body size and fitness, while somatic maintenance was similarly affected by the treatments in the sexes. Subsequently, in paper II, I examined sex-specific patterns of additive genetic variance (VA) for reproductive fitness, and estimated the intersexual genetic correlation (rmf) of fitness. Results show low levels of VA for fitness, and no changes in response to treatments. Values of rmf are associated with large uncertainties, highlighting the difficulties in estimating and interpreting rmf for fitness. In paper III, I used a multivariate approach to investigate the sex-specific genetic variance-covariance matrices (GF and GM), and the between-sex genetic covariance matrix (B) in the three life history traits. Results show no genetic covariances between the traits, and no covariances between the sexes in these traits. The sex-specific G-matrices also remained stable in response to the treatments. These results therefore suggest that the genetic architecture of the traits studied here does not constrain the independent evolution in the sexes. In paper IV, using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus as the model, I find that experimentally induced mutations have stronger negative effects on male than female fitness, suggesting overall stronger selection on males. The results support the theory that strong sexual selection on males have the potential to purge deleterious mutations from a population.

TI  - Development of a Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic and Heat Pump System for Domestic Heating and Electricity Generation
AB  - This research investigates a hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system that uses an indirect expansion method. It combines multiple solar photovoltaic thermal panels that convert solar energy to heat and electricity with a water-to-water heat pump. This allows for the generation of heat and electricity on the domestic level from sunlight. The technical feasibility of the system is examined through experimental and mathematical analyses whilst the economic viability of the system is assessed through techno-economic analysis in the UK. The research also studies the effect of short cycling phenomenon on the performance of a hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system in partial load. The system's response to variations in solar irradiance, water tank volume and the water flow rate through the PVT are analysed. The system is modelled deploying quasi-steady state heat transfer and thermodynamic equations and validated by the experimental data. The analysis takes incremental time steps to solve for the fluid's temperature changes from the heat pump and the solar PVT panels. The model is used to conduct a parametric study of the system with changes in solar irradiance, size of the water tank and the water flow rate in the PVT pipes (laminar and turbulent) on the performance of the system are analysed. The techno-economic analysis of the hybrid system is studied, taking into account the effect of government policy on renewable energy such as the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) and Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI). The thesis concludes that the hybrid photovoltaic thermal heat pump system works and is both technically and economically viable in the UK. The research demonstrates that the system is cost competitive with gas and electrical systems both independently and under UK renewable energy policy.

TI  - The Population History of Drosophila melanogaster and the Evolution of Ethanol Tolerance and Body Size, Adaptive Traits
SP  - 144
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster is a great model to use in untangling the evolutionary process of a novel trait. There are abundant molecular techniques, extensive genomic data, they have short generation time, and stocks can be maintained in the lab with relative ease. This dissertation uses these advantages to investigate the population history of D. melanogaster and the genetic basis of adaptive traits. First, I create a robust demographic model of D. melanogaster expansion throughout Africa and into Europe. Estimates from this analysis has this expansion throughout Africa starting ~13,000 years ago and crossing the Sahara relatively soon after and into Europe ~1,800 years ago. Second, I explore the genetic architecture of ethanol resistance found in multiple populations of D. melanogaster. Findings from this study include elevated ethanol resistance in three different populations and that ethanol and cold resistance may have a partially shared genetic basis. We also find that the genetic architecture of ethanol resistance evolution differs substantially not only between our three resistant populations, but also between two crosses involving the same European population. Finally, I investigate the evolution of two adaptive traits, thorax and wing size, found in a highland Ethiopia population. The results from this study show that genes with moderate to large and small effect contribute to both phenotypes and standing variation may have helped this population adapt to the novel habitat. We have also found there to variability in the genetic architecture within this population.

TI  - Using Quantitative Approaches to Estimate Space-Use, Population Dynamics, Behavior, and Climate Change Adaptive Potential for the Red-Backed Salamander Plethodon cinereus
SP  - 105
AB  - The red-backed salamander, Plethodon cinereus, is a common woodland amphibian that is found throughout much of eastern North America. The species is important to forest ecological processes, and changes in their population density are often used to measure the impacts of forest management, pollution, and environmental change. Therefore, consistent methods of density estimation are required. In the first chapter, I review spatial capture-recapture, a modern modeling tool that incorporates spatial information to reliably estimate population density without the need for the ad-hoc methods that render other density estimates incomparable. It can also be used to make inferences on space-use, population dynamics, and connectivity. I then demonstrate the versatility of spatial capture-recapture using P. cinereus mark-recapture data collected from my study sites in central Pennsylvania. For the second chapter of this thesis, I use spatial capture-recapture and other modeling approaches to test hypotheses about P. cinereus climate change adaptive capacity. This salamander is a convenient model for understanding dispersal-limited species, so I tested eight hypotheses to see how behavioral plasticity and fitness were affected by climate variability. Based on previous evidence, I also tested whether a common color polymorphism is a useful visual cue for predicting within-population variation in climate tolerances. Using four years of mark-recapture information from Maryland, I found the color morph is not a useful indicator, but overall, the population did show strong climate preferences, indicating that population persistence could be threatened by warmer and drier conditions predicted in the future.

TI  - Epigenetics of Marine Stickleback: Gene Expression Across a Latitudinal Gradient
SP  - 111
AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity can be an important factor in the survival of a fish species through a changing climate or in migrating to a new habitat. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is found throughout the northern hemisphere and can adapt via genetic change in relatively few generations to new environments. Epigenetic mechanisms work faster than genetic change, and have the potential to be passed on to future generations, possibly leading to population-wide changes in gene expression and phenotypic variation. To study genes involved in epigenetic mechanisms in stickleback, populations were selected for sampling between Northern Germany and northern Norway. Eleven populations of stickleback were successfully sampled across this latitudinal gradient, and four evenly distributed populations were selected for gene expression analyses in this research. Collected samples were dissected for gonads and pectoral fin muscle (in addition to other organs) and brought to the Alfred Wegener Institute where RNA was extracted. After converting RNA into cDNA, a targeted qPCR approach was performed to test for expression levels of a number of epigenetic actors; DNMT1, DNMT3ab, TET1, TET3, MacroH2A, and Sirtuin2. DNMTs are involved in promoting methylation, TETs actively demethylate cytosine, and MacroH2A and Sirtuin2 are actively involved in cold acclimation.Results from the fieldwork sampling found that stickleback body size (measured as standard length) decreased as latitude increased, in opposition to Bergmann’s rule of species increasing in size toward the poles. Additionally, there was evidence for slight sexual dimorphism in which males were significantly smaller than females across all populations. Furthermore, gravid females were found to be significantly larger than non-gravid females. Results from the target gene qPCR testing found Sirtuin2 to be more expressed in female gonads of northern populations than in southern populations. This is in line with Sirtuin´s role in cold acclimation which would be more beneficial to northern than southern populations. Male gonads showed higher expression of DNMTs and TETs, possibly indicating greater plasticity of epigenetic actors capable of change. This thesis project is the first to study epigenetic differences in fish populations across a latitudinal gradient. Future research could benefit from increasing the sample size (number of individuals and populations) and/or investigating alternative organs that may also show differential gene expression of epigenetic actors.Overall, epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be differentially expressed depending on factors of organ, sex, population, and local environmental factors, all of which can potentially allow greater adaptive potential under climate change.Alternate abstract:O stickleback de três espinhos é um peixe teleósteo encontrado circunglobalmente e é uma espécie modelo em ecologia evolutiva, pois é conhecido por se adaptar em poucas gerações em relação a outras espécies de peixes. Um dos mecanismos usados para se adaptar a ambientes em mudança é através da plasticidade fenotípica por mecanismos epigenéticos. A adição de um grupo metilo à citosina é conhecida como metilação do ADN, e tem o potencial de causar mudanças rápidas em resposta a estímulos ambientais, tais como mudanças na temperatura ou salinidade. A metilação pode ser transmitida aos descendentes, dando a este mecanismo o potencial para produzir mudanças em toda a população de gerações sucessivas. A metilação pode ser criada por metiltransferases de DNA como DNMT1 e DNMT3ab, e removida por proteínas de translocação Ten-eleven como TET1 e TET3. A aclimatação a frio é a capacidade de um organismo de se adaptar a baixas temperaturas, uma característica particularmente útil na sobrevivência em altas latitudes, caracterizadas por temperaturas de água mais baixas. Os genes potencialmente envolvidos na aclimatação a frio incluem MacroH2A e Sirtuin2 que, além desta função, desempenham outras como a modificação da histona e o metabolismo regulador. A aclimatação térmica e a capacidade de um organismo de regular a temperatura é interessante porque cenários futuros de mudança climática prevêem aquecimento, e a capacidade de um organismo para se adaptar a esta mudança pode determinar a sobrevivência de uma população.Para estudar o papel potencial dos mecanismos epigenéticos na adaptação local das populações de três espinhos de stickleback, foi realizado um trabalho de campo para recolher amostras de tecido de stickleback em 11 locais diferentes ao longo das costas do Mar do Norte e da Noruega. A primeira metade do trabalho de campo foi um "loop sul" que ocorreu entre 6 e 28 de Maio de 2019, partindo e regressando ao Instituto Alfred Wegener em List auf Sylt, Alemanha. A rota seguida foi, sucessivamente: de List auf Sylt, Alemanha para Marianger, Dinamarca; Oslofjord, Haugesund, Bergen, Ålesund, Trondheim, Noruega; e finalmente de volta para List auf Sylt, Alemanha. O Stickleback foi capturado com sucesso por rede de cerco em Oslofjord, Haugesund, Bergen e Trondheim na Noruega, por armadilhas do tipo covo em Mariangerfjord, Dinamarca, e por puça em List auf Sylt, Alemanha. A segunda metade do trabalho de campo foi o "loop norte" que ocorreu entre 3 e 20 de junho de 2019, saindo e retornando da Universidade Nord em Bodø, Noruega. A rota geral seguida foi: de Bodø para Vesterålen, Tromsø, Alta, Mo i Rana (NO), e de volta para Bodø. O Stickleback foi capturado com sucesso por armadilhas do tipo covo em Bodø e Vesterålen, e por puça em Alta e Mo i Rana. Por último, foi feita uma curta viagem até Limfjord, Dinamarca, para amostragem de uma população de stickleback com rede de cerco. Finalmente, 305 indivíduos foram capturados, em 11 populações separadas, com cerca de 30 indivíduos capturados em cada local. O stickleback mostrou ser abundante no Atlântico nordeste e apenas dois dos locais, Ålesund e Tromsø, não computaram stickleback. Os resultados da amostragem de stickleback apresentaram uma tendência de diminuição do comprimento padrão com o aumento da latitude. Esta situação é contrária à regra de Bergmann, que afirma que os organismos aumentam de tamanho em altas latitudes.

TI  - Investigation into the Viability of Using Pervious Pavements in Storm Water Management to Reduce Flooding in Townships
SP  - 128
AB  - South Africa like many other countries worldwide has been facing a growing problem of urbanization; increasing the population living in urban areas. One immediate implication is the need for increase in impervious pavements/surfaces being built to have good un-interrupted road transport network among other things. Traditionally, the roads are designed and constructed with impervious material to withstand untimely failure due to fatigue and extreme weather conditions. However, these impervious surfaced pavements cause damages to the environment through storm water runoff which cause peak flow flooding. This is because their surfaces are constructed to be water tight to prevent ingress of water into the road pavement structure. This practice is not environmentally sustainable, causes heat island effect and causes peak flow flooding which is detrimental to the municipal infrastructure and human life. To prevent these detrimental effects, there is a need to use more environmentally friendly and sustainable pavements/surfaces which are pervious in nature. The aim of this study was to address the above challenge through scientific investigation of the suitability of pervious pavements in storm water management to reduce peak flow flooding in townships. The investigation was to establish what type of pervious pavement is more suitable for township development to effectively reduce storm water runoff and peak flow flooding. Three types of pervious pavements were investigated namely, Interlocking pavers, concrete and asphalt. Diepsloot Township which is situated in the Western Region of Johannesburg was used as the study area. Field research to determine critical factors in pervious pavement installation were conducted. The critical factors researched in this study are; topography/terrain of the area, existing street sizes, houses proximity to the streets, available open space & land use and contamination potentials of storm water run-off. After the field research had been completed, a total of 30 streets randomly selected were measured. Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the filtration rates of each of the three pervious pavement samples collected from commercial suppliers. A total of 16 replicate filtration rate laboratory experiments using clean water for each pervious pavement sample were conducted under same laboratory conditions. Furthermore, clogging tests for each pervious pavement sample was conducted using sand and silt contaminated water. A total of 12 replicate tests were conducted. The laboratory test results obtained for each type of pervious pavement sample were compared in order to determine the most effective pervious pavement in terms of filtration rate with clean water and contaminated water (clogging test). The infiltration rate results using clean water indicate that pervious asphalt was most effective with an average infiltration rate of 0.282 l/s followed by pervious interlocking pavers with 0.265 l/s. Pervious concrete was last with 0.145 l/s. The clogging test results indicate that pervious asphalt still was more effective. It recorded less infiltration rate reduction having reduced by 17.38% followed by pervious interlocking pavers having reduced by 36.73%. Pervious concrete was the worst with 45.52% reduction in infiltration rate. In order to establish which pervious pavement type was more suitable for township development to mitigate peak flow flooding and social economic challenges experienced, field research results were taken into account. Asphalt was favourable in terms of infiltration rate while interlocking pavers were favourable in terms of addressing some of social economic challenges of the township communities such as un-employment. It was concluded that interlocking pavers are more suitable in this regard to address peak flow flooding and social economic challenges in township development.

TI  - Estimating the Heritability of Plasticity of Thermal Tolerance and Its Application in the Restoration of Endangered Caribbean Coral
SP  - 59
AB  - Rising surface temperature poses a threat to the world’s coral reefs and has been the cause of many mass bleaching events. Since coral colonies are sessile, survival of individual colonies may require them to acclimate to elevated water temperatures. Phenotypic plasticity, or the ability of an individual to express different phenotypes to survive in different environments, has been suggested as a critical first step that can buy a population time to evolve important adaptations. This chapter investigated two questions related to plasticity in high temperature tolerance in the endangered Caribbean coral, Acropora cervicornis: 1) Are coral colonies capable of acclimating to elevated water temperatures? 2) Do coral genotypes differ in their ability to acclimate to thermal stress (phenotypic plasticity of thermal tolerance)? We subjected A. cervicornis clones to different acclimation temperatures to identify the presence of plasticity in thermal tolerance, and estimated the broad (H 2 ) and narrow-sense (h 2 ) heritability of both thermal tolerance and plasticity of thermal tolerance. The study found that colonies exposed to a previous, short-term heat stress survived a long-term heat stress significantly longer (141 hours) than those that were acclimated at ambient temperatures. The amount of plasticity was found to depend on genotype, but not necessarily to additive effects of genotype, with H 2 = 0.19 and h 2 = 0. This suggests A. cervicornis lacks the capacity to evolve greater plasticity in thermal tolerance over a short period of time. However, our estimates may underrepresent the true h 2 in this population, and there are other factors such as epigenetic response and holobiont composition that may play a significant role in plasticity of thermal tolerance.

TI  - Thermal Adaptation in a Model Pest Insect
AB  - Climate change is one of the key issues of our time, causing rapid changes to habitats worldwide and exerting novel pressures on natural populations. Central to understanding species responses to climate change is the process of thermal adaptation, whereby populations adapt to increased or changing temperatures. However, we do not understand how important thermal adaptation is in nature, nor the phenotypes that underpin it. Understanding thermal adaptation in insect species is of particular interest, as they provide many ecosystem services (e.g. pollination, pest control and recycling of organic matter), and are particularly vulnerable to temperature changes due to their inability to thermoregulate. Additionally, several pervasive pest species are insects, so understanding how they will respond to climate change will have major impacts on food security. Here, I investigate thermal adaptation using Tribolium castaneum, which is the model beetle and a globally important pest of stored products. I use experimentally evolved populations exposed to control temperature (30°C) or stressful high temperature (38°C) for over 50 generations, to investigate how thermal adaptation occurs and the effects of population demographics and life history on this. I found that high temperature lines had lower overall reproductive output compared to control lines, even when reproduction occurred at high temperatures. I then experimentally increased population size and induced migration into the high temperature lines for 10 generations, to increase levels of genetic diversity, but found that this did not result in increased reproductive output or survival. However, when the experimental populations underwent development at high temperature, I found markedly reduced reproductive output in the control lines, but not the high temperature lines. Development at high temperature affected the fecundity of adult females and the fertility of adult males, and I identified morphological differences in the ovaries and testes of beetles following development at 38°C or 30°C. Furthermore, this adaptation appears to occur rapidly, with observable signals of change in reproductive morphology and increased reproductive output within just five generations. This thesis highlights that there is potential for rapid adaptation in insects, which suggests that there is a chance they may cope with climate change. However, it also demonstrated the complexity of thermal adaptation, and more in-depth understanding is required to accurately predict the outcomes of changes in temperature.

TI  - The Implications of Prezygotic Isolation, Variable Performance, and Competition for Secondary Contact Between Alewife Life History Forms
SP  - 174
AB  - Secondary contact occurs when two previously isolated lineages come back into contact after generations of independent selection and evolution. The processes that occur at the onset of secondary contact determine whether populations fuse, form a stable hybrid zone, or undergo speciation. Research on secondary contact has been restricted to studying gene flow in long-standing stable hybrid zones, providing little insight into the ecological processes that occur at the very onset of secondary contact or how these processes interact with gene flow to shape the evolutionary trajectory of a species. The degree of morphological and ecological divergence between populations prior to contact likely determines the strength of their interactions and probability of experiencing introgression during secondary contact.Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) is a species of river herring consisting of two life history forms, an ancestral migratory (anadromous) form and a recently diverged freshwater resident (landlocked) form. Fish passage projects aimed at restoring habitat connectivity and access to spawning sites for anadromous alewife are also bringing them into contact with landlocked alewife for the first time in centuries. Anadromous and landlocked alewife have divergent morphology, physiology, life cycles, and behavior, which has resulted in cascading ecological and evolutionary effects on lake communities. The degree of divergence between alewife life history forms has the potential to generate complex ecological interactions during secondary contact. I examined the implications of spawning time variability, intraspecific variation in growth and resource allocation, asymmetric competition, and changes in anadromous alewife migratory timing for secondary contact between anadromous and landlocked alewife.I found that anadromous and landlocked alewife would experience low, but variable levels of hybridization during secondary contact due to differences in spawning time. Anadromous alewife spawned earlier and over a shorter duration than landlocked alewife, and spawning time was consistent from year to year. Landlocked alewife spawned later and over a longer duration than anadromous alewife. I found considerable interannual and interpopulation variation in the timing of the initiation of spawning by landlocked alewife, which would likely be the primary cause of interannual variation in hybridization between forms during secondary contact.Anadromous and landlocked alewife exhibited interform variation in their growth patterns, resource allocation, and foraging behavior, which resulted in asymmetric competition between forms during secondary contact. I found that anadromous alewife were very sensitive to prey availability, growing rapidly when prey were abundant and losing weight when prey were scarce. Landlocked alewife were less reactive to changes in prey availability and maintained their weight, or grew slowly, regardless of prey availability. Landlocked alewife also invested more in lipid than anadromous alewife, an adaptation to surviving periods of prey scarcity and extreme winter temperatures in lakes.The adaptations of landlocked alewife to forage on small prey and survive periods of food scarcity may have provided them with an advantage when competing with anadromous alewife for pelagic prey. However, I found that anadromous alewife increased their individual diet specialization and utilized a private resource, littoral prey, in ways that buffered them from competition with landlocked alewife. In anadromous alewife, the timing of juvenile migration to the ocean was sensitive to pelagic zooplankton abundance. The low density of pelagic zooplankton in lakes containing landlocked alewife and competition for zooplankton between life history forms may cause anadromous alewife to migrate earlier and at a smaller size than anadromous alewife in lakes without landlocked alewife. Changes in anadromous alewife migratory behavior may have implications for the long-term outcome of secondary contact between life history forms. Variation in prezygotic isolation through time, asymmetric competition, and the uncertainty of hybrid fitness in this system make predicting the long-term outcome of secondary contact between alewife life history forms difficult. The results I present here demonstrate that secondary contact has the potential to generate complex ecological interactions at the initiation of contact, and it can provide the opportunity to test fundamental ecological theories related to the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.

TI  - Understanding Sources of Variation in Advertisement Call Attributes in Spring Peepers (Pseudacris crucifer)
SP  - 105
AB  - The mate recognition system is the foundation of biological speciation in frogs and toads. Sexual selection has been suggested to cause male call evolution, population divergence, and ultimately reproductive isolation. It is generally assumed that a significant fraction of variation in male call has an underlying genetic basis and that there is a link between call attributes and fitness. Yet these are largely unproved assertions in anurans, with many other factors contributing to diversity of calls within a male chorus. Anuran advertisement calls are important in studies of sexual selection, speciation, community acoustic partitioning, as well as phenological studies. In all of these, understanding heritability of calls is prerequisite to understanding evolutionary patterns and potential responses to selection. However, few studies have examined the heritability of advertisement calls in anurans. In general, we know that key aspects of anuran calls, including both temporal and spatial attributes, vary with body size, age, abiotic factors such as temperature and habitat type, and social context, including inter-male competition. In my thesis, I attempt to estimate the heritability of call attributes within a calling assemblage of a temperate treefrog, Pseudacris crucifer, and to quantify the relative contributions of different factors: body size, age, calling temperature and genetics. I used sonographic analysis to assess call variation, skeletochronology to estimate age, and a dataset comprising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate the relatedness of calling males. I used the animal model to evaluate those factors that may affect call variation. I found that body temperature to be the most important factor, influencing all six call attributes, and that body size predicted variation in some call attributes. I had insufficient power to derive robust estimates of heritability. By investigating the genetic basis as well as environmental components of variation in advertisement calls, I gained insights on within-population variation and how selection might impact the evolution of anuran calls.

TI  - Post-Combustion Carbon Capture for Combined Cycle Gas Turbines
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have conveyed in their fifth assessment report that anthropogenic emissions and endeavours are responsible for approximately 100 % of global warming since 1950 [1] and electricity and heat generation account for 41 % of the 32.8 billion tons of global CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion in 2017 [2]. There is thus a sense of urgency to capture CO2 from large point sources of fossil fuel combustion to limit global temperature rise. Natural gas combustion is envisaged to play a fundamental role towards a zero-carbon economy as opposed to coal and oil due to its low carbon content. However, capturing CO2 from natural gas combustion, which emits about 6.7 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2017 is challenging as it, bestows a parasitic energy penalty on Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plants. This is due to the low partial pressure of CO2 in the flue gas of gas turbines, which necessitate that substantial reboiler heat duty is employed for solvent regeneration. To address the aforementioned impasse, pertinent experimental campaigns at the UKCCSRC- PACT National Core Facility were carried out to simulate Selective-Exhaust Gas Recirculation (S- EGR) under the influence of 40 wt(%) of Monoethanolamine (MEA). This was to enhance the driving force behind CO2 capture and to reduce the Specific Reboiler Duty (SRD), consequently counterweigh against the forfeit on the power plant’s productivity. Furthermore, the impact of varying Pressurized Hot Water (PHW) temperature at the inlet of reboiler was studied. The influence of oxidative degradation of the amine solvent at 15 vol(%) of O2 and 5 vol(%) of CO2 has been experimentally investigated. Results from these studies have demonstrated that Selective Exhaust Gas Recirculation (S-EGR) is favourable in reducing the solvent regeneration energy requirement by about 25 % at CO2 concentration of 6.6 vol(%) prior to flue gas introduction in the Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) system. PHW temperature at 125 °C was identified to give the lowest SRD by 6 % against the baseline SRD. Detection of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) peaks was observed as water from the water-wash column was transferred to the absorber column which may have a possible impact on the oxidative degradation of the amine solvent in the PCC system. The concentration of the Iron in the amine solvent, which is a key indicator of the solvent decay increased by approximately 10 times from 3.68 to 36.20 mg/l over a course of 545 hours of experimental operation. Results and recommendations from these studies will potentially reduce the solvent regeneration energy requirement of the next generation PCC technologies and facilitate the global deployment of such technologies towards decarbonisation of the fossil fuel combustion industries and strengthening the efforts of limiting global temperature increase.

TI  - Charge-Carrier Dynamics in Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskites for Next-Generation Solar Cells
AB  - Hybrid metal halide perovskites have emerged over the last decade as highly promising materials for use in solar cells. Their advantages include low production costs, and rapidly increasing efficiencies to compete with those of commercially dominant silicon cells. Recently, increasing attention has been devoted to the use of perovskites in next-generation photovoltaic devices in order to overcome the efficiency limit for conventional single-junction cells. Work is still needed to identify the most promising perovskite materials for these applications, and to fully understand their relevant properties. This thesis contributes to both goals. The challenge of identifying the true timescale of charge-carrier cooling in metal halide perovskites, and whether certain compositions in fact show exceptionally slow cooling, is addressed. This is central to assessing the viability of hot-carrier extraction in perovskite solar cells. Key sources of error in previous approaches to determine charge-carrier temperature, which have produced an orders-of-magnitude range of reported cooling times, are identified. An improved model, which accounts for the full photoluminescence lineshape and enables a consistent approach that can be applied to studies across different perovskite compositions, is then described. Applying this improved model, charge-carrier cooling in FASnI3 is studied, revealing that observations of a secondary regime of slow charge-carrier cooling are in fact attributable to electronic relaxation, state-filling and recombination in this energetically disordered material. This result highlights that careful analysis of charge-carrier cooling dynamics is vital to assessing the realistic prospects for hot-carrier solar cells. Photoluminescence polarisation memory in FASnI3 is also examined, finding no persistent polarisation anisotropy within 270 fs. This points to a need for further study to identify the factors that lead such memory to arise from structural changes in certain perovskite compositions. Finally, the effects of the SnF2 additive commonly used to improve material quality of tin-containing perovskites are explored for FA0.83Cs0.17SnxPb1-xI3 across the lead-tin range. Significant beneficial effects from the suppression of tin oxidation and associated background hole doping, including reduced energetic disorder and increased charge-carrier mobilities and lifetimes, are found with as little as 1 mol% SnF2 added. The larger amounts of additive that have commonly been used are found to contribute to detrimental non-radiative recombination. These results, unravelling the impacts of SnF2 on both structural and optoelectronic properties, provide a foundation for control over the properties of mixed tin-lead perovskites for use as low-bandgap absorbers in all-perovskite tandem cells.

TI  - Transcriptional Dynamics of a Large Family of Surface Protein Genes in Toxoplasma gondii
SP  - 196
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a eukaryotic intracellular parasite that has evolved numerous large, paralogous gene families. These families are critical for supporting Toxoplasma's unparalleled host range which consists of nearly any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. The SRS (SAG1-related sequence) gene family encodes over 100 surface proteins, some of which are involved in parasite attachment and evading the immune response of a host. For most SRS genes, however, little is understood about their function and expression profile. Additionally, Toxoplasma undergoes a complex and poorly understood developmental process that is critical for establishing a chronic infection in its intermediate hosts. In chapter 1, I review the current literature on the SRS family and present novel analyses on how SRS gene expression changes across the life stages of Toxoplasma. In chapter 2, I describe efforts to apply single-cell RNA-sequencing to Toxoplasma parasites to create a comprehensive atlas of cell cycle and asexual development based on data from over 5,400 parasites. This data reveals unexpected heterogeneity in SRS gene expression among individual parasites: in a population of the rapidly growing tachyzoite stage nearly all > 100+ SRS genes are detected despite only an average of 7 SRS genes being "on" in any individual tachyzoite at a given time. From this dataset, AP2IX-1 is identified as a parasite transcription factor that triggers downregulation of SAG1, a ubiquitous surface antigen and SRS, and upregulation of transcripts typically only expressed in the sexual stages of Toxoplasma's lifecycle. In chapter 3, I describe efforts to determine whether heterogeneous SRS expression signatures are inherited over generations of parasite replication by comparing transcriptomics from clonally derived parasites. Preliminary data from these studies suggests that SRS expression patterns are not strongly inherited by progeny and that heterogeneity of SRS expression arises within 10 generations between subcloned parasites. In chapter 4, I present work that identified new parasite factors involved in the secretion of Toxoplasma effector proteins into the host cell during infection. In chapter 5, I conclude with remarks on future directions for the study of the SRS gene family and understanding heterogeneity in expression patterns in Toxoplasma.

TI  - Resilience and Sensitivity to Changing Environments in North American River Otters (Lontra canadensis)
SP  - 114
AB  - The North American river otter is a semiaquatic carnivore that occupies freshwater habitats across most of North America, and is a conservation symbol across most of its range. It is used as an indicator species, a keystone species, an umbrella species, and an example of conservation success. The broad distribution of river otters suggests a broad range of habitat tolerances, but they appear to be highly sensitive to anthropogenic habitat alterations. This apparently conflicting robustness across habitat types and sensitivity to habitat change has baffled researchers for decades. Using morphometric, modeling, and synthetic approaches I explored how otters relate to their environment on a broad scale to gain a better understanding of the conditions to which they are robust, the conditions to which they are sensitive, and the mechanisms by which they adapt to varying environments. Using Maximum Entropy species distribution models I determined that river otter distributions are not strongly affected by climate or macro-environmental variables. Using geometric morphometric methods to examine how cranial shape varies across geographic and ecological space, I determined that morphological variation which may affect feeding and locomotion occurs more intensely at local than broad scales, indicating local morphological adaptation is not strong in this species. Finally, a review of the phylogeography and ecology of river otters and related species indicated that this species evolved from a low-speciation lineage that tends to produce species that can occupy a wide variety of environments without undergoing evolutionary change. Overall I determined that river otters do indeed have a broad ecological niche, and do not respond strongly to climatic or environmental differences or changes across their habitats through altering their distributions or locally adapting. Evidence suggests that river otters may respond strongly to anthropogenic alterations of their habitats because anthropogenically-induced habitat alterations tend to have strong consequences for aquatic food chains, and otters may be more reliant on robust food webs than they are on other aspects of their habitats. These findings have implications for how we think of otter conservation and the conservation of species and ecosystems that are strongly affected by otter presence, as well as what otters indicate about their habitat quality. Additionally, these results may shed light on the ecologies of other mustelid carnivores.In the first chapter of my dissertation I conducted a review of the phylogenetics and biogeography of North and South American river otters to investigate how geography and environmental change have driven river otter evolution in the Americas, and how this informs the ecology of the modern species. I focused first on reviewing the biogeography and evolutionary history of Lontra and Pteronura, and then on the modern ecology, threats, and conservations status of each of the four modern species of Lontra and the single extant species of Pteronura. I chose to review these species because they overlap in geographic and environmental space, and because their shared history provides means for an evolutionarily-grounded examination of relative rarity, specialization, and level of conservation concern. I found that speciation between American otters primarily occurs allopatrically, and there is little functional differentiation in response to allopatric speciation, though they do appear to have the ability to adapt in response to extreme conditions when necessary. Additionally, allopatric speciation primarily occurs in response to changes in waterway connectivity, which is also responsible for changes in population connectivity within the modern species. Most otters have less specific habitat requirements than previously thought, as all species of Lontra persist across a wide variety of climates and semi-aquatic environments, and most of them do so without exhibiting a strong evolutionary response. All American river otters exhibit a strong sensitivity to anthropogenic habitat destruction, though several of them have also shown some ability to coexist with humans. Evidence from this study provides strong indication that this has to do with how human activities near waterways affect food webs, and more generally that on closer examination many habitat components previously thought to be requirements for otters may be better interpreted as indicators of food availability.In the second chapter of my dissertation I use species distribution modeling to examine river otter associations with climate and environment across their range to explore their apparently conflicting robustness to habitat change and sensitivity to human presence. Specifically, I examined the climate and landcover variables that constrain the geographic distribution of otters. I obtained otter occurrences from GBIF and BISON biodiversity databases, climate variables from BIOCLIM, and environmental layers from NASA’s SEDAC program. I built Maximum Entropy species distribution models at 80 and 150 km spatial thinning and varying numbers of background points. The combined model at 80 km spatial thinning and default number of background points produced the highest quality models. Six climatic and landcover variables explained over 10% of otter distributions each: open shrubland, net primary productivity, urban/built, water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter. Of these variables I determined that water, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of coldest quarter likely have biological significance. However, the predicted range map generated by these models do not match river otter distributions generated by the IUCN and NatureServe. This is likely due to incomplete occurrence data because of low reporting in parts of the species range. I conclude based on these data that river otters have broad climatic and habitat tolerances (as there are six weakly predictive variables as opposed to 1–2 strongly controlling variables) and that local habitat factors, such as intact-ness of riverine food webs, may have greater impact on otter distributions than broad regional variables. Additionally, I call for improved monitoring and reporting of this and other broadly-distributed species to ensure we can adequately track their habitat requirements and conservation status.In the third chapter of my dissertation I use geometric morphometrics to explore the role of cranial morphological variation in otter persistence across the array of otter habitats. I address two research questions: 1. Is there morphological variation and structure in river otters across subspecies? 2. Is morphological variation in river otters best explained by a pattern of isolation by distance or isolation by ecology? I obtained 100 river otter crania from across the species range from museums. I 3-D scanned them using a Geomagic 3-D scanner and landmarked them using the IDAV Landmark program. To answer Q1 I conducted discriminant function analyses Procrustes ANOVAs and a Principal Components Analysis. None of these tests revealed strong morphological patterning, indicating there is not morphological differentiation across subspecies in cranial shape. T address Q2 I conducted Mantel tests and a Multiple Matrix Regression with Randomization (MMRR) on the relationship between morphological distance and geographic, climatic, and environmental distance. Both the Mantel test and the MMRR results indicated no significant relationship between morphological distance and climatic or environmental distance in otter crania. Both indicated a weak but negative relationship between morphological distance and geographic distance, indicating morphological variation is greater at short geographic distances and lower at broad geographic distances. I conclude that there is significant cranial variation between individuals, but little definable structure in this variation. The weak but significant (and potentially complex) relationship between geographic and morphological distance indicates the possibility that diversifying selection across smaller spatial scales may be more important than differentiation across broader populations, possibly indicating individual specialization within a generalist population.

TI  - Adaptability and Composition of Natural Regeneration in Pinus resinosa (Red Pine)-Dominated Forests following Climate Adaptation Treatments
SP  - 69
AB  - As climate changes around the globe, forest ecosystem management must change as well. Future climate in north central Minnesota is expected to include higher seasonal temperatures, longer growing seasons, decreases in growing season precipitation and increases in frequency and severity of drought. Additionally, altered disturbance regimes, the introduction of exotic pests and pathogens, habitat fragmentation, and landscape homogenization have left forest stands vulnerable to undesirable state shifts in which an ecosystem transitions from a desirable state with high ecosystem productivity and service provision to a less desirable and less productive condition. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was first established in a Pinus resinosa Ait. (red pine)-dominated forest, which is an economically and ecologically important forest type in the region in order to examine the impacts and effectiveness of three climate adaptation strategies (resistance, resilience, and transition) in an experimental, operational-scale setting. Designed around resisting the effects of climate change, resistance treatments aim to improve the health and defenses of forest stands, while resilience treatments were intended to create conditions that allow for change to occur but ensure an eventual return to a desired reference state. Transition treatments were designed to actively assist stands in transitioning to future climate and encouraging greater adaptive capacity within them. Using data collected during the fifth growing season since the site was treated, this study explores the short-term effects of adaptation strategies on biodiversity in the understory woody community as well as predicted future adaptability of historically P. resinosa-dominated forests based on the natural regeneration that has established up to five years post-treatment.Field data, consisting largely of shrub and tree identification, density, and diameter measurements, were collected between May and August of 2019. Following field sampling, aboveground woody stem biomass estimates were calculated using species-specific allometric equations. The relative importance of each species was then calculated based on biomass estimates, stem densities, and frequency of observation across each stand, providing a measure of abundance which then enabled calculation of species biodiversity and future relative adaptability. Species diversity and richness of woody stems was highest within the resilience treatments and lowest within unharvested control treatments. Species richness of natural tree regeneration was also highest within the resilience treatments. Importance of Prunus serotina Ehrh (black cherry), a species considered better suited to anticipated future climate, was highest within transition treatments. An analysis of the community-weighted mean for future adaptability (based on published species adaptability scores) indicates that the change in adaptability of natural regeneration relative to untreated controls is greater within transition treatments than within resistance and resilience treatments. These results demonstrate early success in improving and increasing stand-scale species biodiversity and, potentially, future adaptability through silvicultural treatments. Silvicultural manipulation also shows promise for increasing the density and relative importance of individual species considered better suited for future climate. While these are only short-term results, they demonstrate the ability to influence ecosystem diversity and adaptability through harvest and provide insight to managing forests in a time of changing climatic conditions and uncertainty.

TI  - Morphology and Physiology of Larval Color Variation in the White-Lined Sphinx Moth, Hyles lineata
SP  - 76
AB  - Animal color patterns occur for a variety of reasons and can have a broad impact on fitness. Additionally, the presence of multiple color phenotypes in a species can be ecologically advantageous. One must first understand the physiological mechanism behind color patterning and variable morphs to understand how this variation affects fitness or provides an ecological advantage. Multiple phenotypes produced by one genotype, including multiple color morphs, can be genetic or plastic and may evolve very quickly as an adaptive response to changing environments. Phenotypes that are genetically based, called polymorphisms, can be controlled by one to many genes, are heritable and may have genetic links to other traits. Multiple color morphs may also be determined by environmental conditions, such as temperature and photoperiod, or phenotypic plasticity. Here, I sought to determine the physiological mechanisms underlying the multiple color phenotypes of an abundant and widespread lepidopteran larva. Hyles lineata has a primary, basal coloration of yellow and green that can be observed throughout the larval body, most noticeably during the final instar. Also, this larva may have dark lateral dorsal stripes that vary in thickness during the juvenile stage. These stripes can be as minimal as a thin dotted line or so thick that the entire larval body appears black. The variation in both basal coloration and dorsal striping can be observed in the field and in the laboratory and seem to be independent of each other. I designed a series of experiments to determine which, if any, of these color patterns is genetically controlled and which, if any, is phenotypically plastic. To do so, I conducted several single-pair inheritance crosses to document the yellow to green larval color ratios expressed by their offspring. From these crosses, I was able to determine that the yellow and green coloration observed in larval H. lineata is, indeed, genetically based. Further, this trait is controlled by a single two-allele gene, green allele dominant, with contributions from modifier genes. A series of experiments testing variations in environments was also conducted. This included conditions of variable temperatures, photoperiod and combinations of the two. Larvae were exposed to these conditions from the second instar and the appearance of the dark dorsal patterning was noted upon the fifth instar. This patterning was found to be phenotypically plastic. While there was no variation in this trait observed under varying temperature conditions, there was an increase in stripe thickness with decreased photoperiod as well as with combinations of photoperiod and temperature. To identify and measure this variation in pigmentation, various methods were employed, from visual scoring and histological observation to chemical extraction. These methods were described and reviewed. The dark, plastic patterning observed as dorsal stripes in H. lineata was determined to be produced by the pigment melanin. Further, larvae that visually appeared to have greater dark patterning also had a higher percentage darkness when quantified with image analysis as well as a higher volume of extracted melanin, identified and quantified with the use of spectrophotometry. The mechanisms of the color variation observed in H. lineata are now better understood; this organism has a basal yellow/green coloration genetic polymorphism as well as a phenotypically plastic melanic dorsal lateral patterning. As it is known that both of these forms of phenotype variation can be linked to fitness and/or be advantageous, future research can focus on the potential adaptive consequences of these traits.

TI  - Population Dynamics in the Rocky Intertidal Zone: Acclimation and Adaptation to Extreme Abiotic Conditions in the Copepod Tigriopus californicus
SP  - 206
AB  - Understanding how organisms endure abiotic challenges across scales, in both space and time, is a major goal of ecologists. Rocky intertidal zones, where terrestrial and marine ecosystems meet, are among the most harsh and dynamic habitats on Earth. The goal of my dissertation was to characterize how evolutionary and ecological forces shape population dynamics in intertidal zones, using the splashpool copepod Tigriopus californicus as a model system. Multiple lines of evidence (laboratory experiments, field surveys, population genomics) were compiled and analyzed to test whether populations have distinct capacities to acclimate and adapt to multiple environmental stressors. In two long-term studies, I exposed four populations to a range of pH treatments across three generations and quantified fecundity, development, and survivorship. Copepod cultures had lower survivorship and delayed development after extended exposure to higher pH treatments (pH 7.5 and 8.0), whereas cultures maintained in lower pH (7.0) displayed stable population growth over time. Reciprocal transplants among treatments demonstrated that these effects were reversible. All populations had higher fitness in lower average pH conditions than those that occur in the open ocean, which has rarely been observed in other marine invertebrates. To test for local adaptation among populations, I exposed common garden-reared copepods to factorial combinations of salinity and temperature treatments with different amplitudes of diel variability. This experiment revealed strong effects of temperature on life history responses, but these effects and their interactions with salinity treatments were not the same among populations. Differences in abiotic variability among field sites did not seem to explain population differences observed in the lab. Therefore, differentiation of these isolated populations might be more strongly driven by genetic drift, rather than divergent selective pressures. Using a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing approach, I found that populations with the most divergent phenotypes also displayed the highest genomic differentiation from other populations. Across experiments, I characterized copepod morphology and found sex-specific body size responses to environmental stressors. Together my results contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary capacity and vulnerability of marine invertebrate populations in the context of global environmental change.

TI  - Estudio de la actividad del plasma frío a presiónatmosférica sobre el biofilm y células planctónicasde Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosay Candida albicans
SP  - 207
AB  - El objeto de esta tesis es estudiar la actividad del plasma frío a presión atmosférica o ANTP (Atmospheric Non Thermal Plasma) sobre el biofilm y las células planctónicas de Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa y Candida albicans.El plasma constituye el cuarto estado de agregación de la materia, tras los sólidos, líquidos y gases. Se produce al ionizar total o parcialmente un gas, pudiendo utilizar cualquier fuente de energía para su generación (eléctrica, térmica, óptica o radiación electromagnética ionizante). Al producirse cargas eléctricas libres (electrones e iones) el plasma es un buen conductor de la electricidad.El estado de plasma se alcanza cuando buena parte de las partículas que componen el gas alcanzan tanta energía como para que sea posible su ionización liberando una alta densidad de electrones. Los electrones producidos y sus colisiones posteriores con los átomos y moléculas del gas generan las especies reactivas que interaccionarán con el entorno.El plasma se puede clasificar según los niveles energéticos relativos de los electrones y partículas pesadas (iones y neutras) en plasma térmico y en plasma no térmico, también llamado plasma de no equilibrio o plasma frío.En el plasma térmico la alta temperatura implica que todas las especies químicas se encuentran en estado de equilibrio termodinámico (Te ≈ Ti ≈ Tg). En los plasmas no térmicos, el enfriamiento de los iones y las moléculas sin carga es más efectivo que la transferencia de energía de los electrones en las colisiones, no alcanzándose el equilibrio térmico y permaneciendo el gas a baja temperatura (Te>>Ti≈Tg ) por lo que es conocido como plasma frío. Los plasmas fríos son capaces de destruir, a temperatura ambiente, microorganismos con un mínimo o nulo daño al entorno por calor. Los plasmas fríos se pueden generar en cámaras de vacío, denominándose plasmas de baja presión, o a presión atmosférica denominándose plasmas a presión atmosférica. En los generados a bajas presiones de gas, la frecuencia de colisión de los electrones es baja por lo que las energías de los electrones seguirán siendo altas en comparación con las energías de las partículas pesadas (iones y neutras) representando un estado de no equilibrio térmico.A presiones atmosféricas la frecuencia de las colisiones de los electrones es más alta, por lo que disminuirá la diferencia entre la Te y la temperatura de las partículas pesadas y, por lo tanto, el estado del plasma estará más cerca del estado de equilibrio térmico. Esta condición se puede evitar suministrando una baja densidad de potencia de alimentación o una potencia pulsada, lo que lleva a la formación de plasma frío o de no equilibrio.La necesidad de descontaminar biológicamente material sensible o de esterilizar material en quirófanos, ha hecho que durante años se estudien diversas técnicas de descontaminación. Existen diversas técnicas empleadas en la actualidad como son el calor seco, calor húmedo, radiación ultravioleta, peróxido de hidrógeno o líquidos con diversas composiciones químicas, pero ninguna se puede aplicar sobre tejidos vivos o materiales especialmente sensibles.El uso del plasma frío a presión atmosférica surge como una técnica relativamente nueva que permite descontaminar a temperatura ambiente y presión atmosférica, tejidos vivos o materiales especialmente sensibles. Parece ser un buen candidato para la inactivación microbiana en el biofilm o la destrucción de la estructura de una manera ecológica y rentable. El estrés oxidativo producido por los reactivos de la química del plasma es el responsable de los efectos que se producen.Dado que mi actividad profesional está dedicada al tratamiento de la infección protésica articular y de la osteomielitis crónica del adulto, donde el biofilm es la causa de la cronicidad y dificultad de curación de estas enfermedades, la posible aplicación del plasma frío para descontaminar o esterilizar tejidos vivos y material protésico motivó mi interés por el tema y el desarrollo de esta tesis doctoral. Para el desarrollo del trabajo experimental empleamos un prototipo denominado cámara de plasma a presión atmosférica - plasma no térmico que se caracteriza por usar aire como gas, trabajar a temperatura ambiente y a presión atmosférica para la producción de plasma, convirtiéndola en un posible candidato para poder ser utilizada de forma económica en multitud de situaciones, entre ellas en el campo de la cirugía séptica del aparato locomotor. La calibración del equipo ya fue realizada por el Dr. Guillermo Baeza Oliete en su tesis “Contribución a la generación de plasma frío mediante electrodos SMD y JET”.Para poder demostrar la capacidad antimicrobiana de la cámara de generación de plasma sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans formada en discos de titanio comercialmente puro (grado 3) y politetrafluoroetileno (PTFE/Teflón) y sobre sus respectivas células planctónicas, desarrollamos cuatro diseños experimentales.En los dos primeros diseños experimentales se valora la actividad del plasma frío sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans formado sobre discos de titanio comercialmente puro y PTFE y sobre sus respectivas células planctónicas. En el tercer diseño experimental se analiza la capacidad del plasma frío para actuar sobre el medio de cultivo e impedir el crecimiento posterior de microorganismos. En el último diseño experimental se evalúa cualitativamente, mediante microscopía confocal laser, la viabilidad del biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans tras su exposición al plasma frío.La letalidad media producida sobre el biofilm de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans, formadas durante 48 horas sobre discos de titanio, después de 60 minutos de exposición al plasma frío fue del 99,7%, 99,9% y 99,6%, respectivamente. En el caso de los discos de PTFE fue del 99,1%, 95,9% y 94,4%, respectivamente.La letalidad global media de las células planctónicas de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans después de la exposición del plasma frío durante 90 minutos fue del 99,87%. La exposición del medio de cultivo BHI al plasma frío durante 90 minutos generó un medio de cultivo activado por plasma (PAM) que impidió el posterior crecimiento de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans.Mediante microscopía confocal de exploración láser se constató, que la exposición al plasma frío durante 60 minutos de discos de cristal, sobre los que previamente se había formado un biofilm de 48 horas de S. aureus, P. aeruginosa y C. albicans se produjo una destrucción completa del biofilm.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this thesis is to study the activity of cold plasma or Atmospheric No thermal plasma (ANTP) on biofilm and the planktonic forms of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans.Plasma constitutes the fourth state of aggregation of matter, after solids, liquids and gases. It is produced by completely or partially ionizing a gas, being able to use any source of energy for its generation (electrical, thermal, optical or ionizing electromagnetic radiation). When free electrical charges (electrons and positive ions) occur, plasma is a good conductor of electricity.The plasma state is reached when a large part of the particles that make up the gas reach enough energy to allow its ionization to release a high electron density. The produced electrons and their subsequent collisions with the atoms and molecules of the gas generate the reactive species that will interact with the environment.Plasma can be classified according to the relative energy levels of electrons and heavy particles (ions and neutrals) in thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma also called non-equilibrium plasma or cold plasma.In thermal plasma, high temperature implies that all chemical species (Te≈Ti≈Tg ) are in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In non-thermal plasma, the cooling of ions and molecules without charge, is more effective than the transfer of energy of electrons in collisions, the thermal equilibrium is not achieved and the gas remains at low temperature (Te>>Ti≈Tg ) so is known as cold plasma. Cold plasmas are capable of destroying, at room temperature, microorganisms with minimal or no heat damage.Cold plasmas can be generated in vacuum chambers, called low pressure plasmas, or at atmospheric pressure called atmospheric pressure plasmas. In those generated at low gas pressures, the frequency of collision of the electrons is low, so that the energies of the electrons will remain high compared to the energies of the heavy particles (ions and neutrals) representing a state of non-equilibrium plasma.At atmospheric pressures the frequency of collisions of electrons is higher, so the difference between Te and the temperature of the heavy particles will decrease and therefore, the state of the plasma will be closer to the state of thermal equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by providing a low power supply density or a pulsed power, which leads to the formation of cold or non-equilibrium plasma.The need to biologically decontaminate sensitive material or to sterilize material in operating rooms has made for years that various decontamination techniques are studied. There are various techniques used today such as dry heat, wet heat, ultraviolet radiation, hydrogen peroxide or liquids with various chemical compositions, but none can be applied to living tissues or especially sensitive materials.The use of cold plasma at atmospheric pressure emerges as a relatively new technique that allows decontamination at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, living tissues or especially sensitive materials. It seems to be a good candidate for microbial inactivation in biofilms or the destruction of the structure in an ecological and cost-effective manner. The oxidative stress produced by plasma chemistry reagents is responsible for the effects that occur.Since my professional activity is dedicated to the treatment of prosthetic joint infection and chronic osteomyelitis in adults, where biofilm is the cause of chronicity and difficulty in curing these diseases, the possible application of cold plasma to decontaminate or sterilize living tissues and prosthetic material motivated my interest in the subject and the development of this doctoral thesis.For the development of the of the experimental work we used a device called the Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Chamber - Non-Thermal Plasma (APPC-NTP) characterized by using air as a gas, working at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for plasma production, making it a possible candidate to be used economically in a multitude of situations, including in the field of septic surgery of the musculoskeletal system. The calibration of the equipment was already carried out by PhD. Guillermo Baeza Oliete in his thesis “Contribution to the generation of cold plasma using SMD and JET electrodes”.In order to demonstrate the antimicrobial capacity of the plasma generation chamber on biofilms from S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans formed on commercially pure titanium (grade 3) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE / Teflon) discs and on their respective cells planktonic, we developed four experimental designs.In the first two experimental designs, we evaluated the activity of cold plasma on the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans formed on commercially pure titanium disks and PTFE and on their respective plankton cells. In the third experimental design, the ability of cold plasma to act on the culture medium and prevent the subsequent growth of microorganisms is analyzed. In the last experimental design, the viability of the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans was evaluated qualitatively using laser confocal microscopy after exposure to cold plasma.The average lethality produced on the biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans, formed during 48 hours on titanium discs, after 60 minutes of exposure to cold plasma was 99.7%, 99.9% and 99.6%, respectively. In the case of PTFE discs, it was 99.1%, 95.9% and 94.4%, respectively.The mean lethality of the planktonic cells of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans after exposure of cold plasma for 90 minutes was 99.87%.Exposure of the BHI culture medium to cold plasma for 90 minutes generates a plasma activated culture medium (PAM) that prevents subsequent growth of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.We verified, by confocal microscopy of laser exploration, that after exposure to cold plasma for 60 minutes of glass disks on which a 48-hour biofilm of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans had previously formed, produced a complete destruction of the biofilm.

TI  - The Adaptive Potential of Lifetime Fitness Increases Under a Future Climate Change Scenario in a Population of Brassica Rapa
SP  - 84
AB  - The persistence of any declining population in the face of an environmental perturbation may depend on how fast natural selection restores fitness, a process called “evolutionary rescue”. Evolutionary rescue depends on the adaptive potential for fitness: the additive genetic variance for fitness (VA(W)) divided by mean fitness (W ̅). I conducted an outdoor warming experiment to estimate the change in VA(W) and W ̅ in the annual Brassica rapa using a predicted 2100 temperature regime. Surprisingly, plants exposed to a warmer climate exhibited greater W ̅, suggesting plasticity may enable population persistence to climate change, but could also hinder the adaptive potential by increasing denominator W ̅. Nevertheless, the magnitude of VA(W) expressed under heated conditions was considerably higher, thereby a greater adaptive potential was observed. My findings suggest that standing genetic variation in B. rapa may be sufficient to buffer and facilitate rapid adaptive evolution to warmer temperatures imposed by climate change.

TI  - Growth and Transgenerational Acclimatization of Juvenile Pocillopora damicornis
SP  - 19
AB  - Global carbon emissions and associated increase in ocean temperatures are understood to be the main driving force in the degradation of coral reefs. Elevated temperatures impact various life stages of scleractinian corals, from the free-floating planulae of brooding corals to older, sexually viable individuals. With global warming, questions have arisen over whether organismal adaptation will be enough to keep up with the pace of environmental change. Researchers have pursued investigations of whether or not rapid acclimatization, through transgenerational plasticity, can help protect populations until genetic adaptation occurs. Acclimatization in corals has been widely studied in all life stages of corals, with the important exception of recently settled juveniles. In this study, I built upon past research by exposing adult Pocillopora damicornis colonies to elevated (28.5ºC) or ambient (25.5ºC) temperatures and examining the settlement ability and growth of their planulae ex situ. Juveniles from preconditioned parents fared better in higher temperatures compared to their naïve counterparts. Lunar timing of planula release between treatments peaked at different times in the lunar cycle. Peak planula release occurred on lunar day 23 for prestressed corals and on lunar day 7 for corals from ambient temperature seawaters. While future projects should follow up on these preliminary trials with in situ experiments to assess this phenomenon in the field, this study represents an important step in understanding how corals may be able to acclimatize and eventually adapt to climate change.

TI  - Fostering Climate Change Resilience: A Socio-Ecological Forest Systems Approach
SP  - 252
AB  - As climate change continues to impact socio-ecological systems, those that rely on natural resources are highly sensitive to climatic changes. Maine’s forest industry provides for the economic and social well-being of many residents and is especially vulnerable to climate change impacts. Changes in growing season length and timing, forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens, extreme weather events, shifting forest composition, and changes in natural disturbance severity and frequency have already begun, and are projected to continue, to impact forest systems in the Northeastern U.S. While climate change presents a threat to forest systems, opportunities also arise due to longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures. Socioeconomic pressures and biophysical impacts necessitate the implementation of adaptation strategies among forest managers to maintain and enhance healthy and resilient forest systems in Maine, as well as overcome threats and take advantage of opportunities. Identifying impacts, assessing vulnerabilities, and determining appropriate adaptation strategies are critical first steps in implementing effective adaptive management across the state. The goal of this study was to develop and implement an integrated framework to assess the vulnerability and enhance the resilience, via increased climate change adaptation, of Maine’s forest socio-ecological systems to climate change. The thesis uses a sequential mixed-methods approach to combine qualitative and quantitative data, to (1) understand stakeholder perceptions of climate change impacts and adaptation, and (2) to map biophysical and social vulnerability of Maine’s forest industry to climate change. Forest stakeholders in Maine generally have high perceptions of risk regarding climate change impacts, and identified and prioritized the following climate change impacts as having the greatest and most likely impact on the forest industry: forest health threats imposed by insects and pathogens, extreme precipitation events, shifts in forest composition, invasive species, and changes in forest productivity. The results of the vulnerability assessment also highlight the unique combinations of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate change among Maine counties. Management strategies that address prioritized and experienced impacts are widely accepted among stakeholders; however, stakeholders are less willing to formally incorporate climate change into the forest management planning process given barriers and limited access to incentives. Integration of research results indicate the persistence of uncertainty and complexity involved in climate change adaptation and present a challenge to increasing implementation of adaptation strategies among forest stakeholders. However, promoting opportunities for learning and enhancing management flexibility via communications that appeal to stakeholders’ perceptions, social norms, experiences, and values can increase the ability of Maine’s forest socio-ecological system to respond to change. The framework presented in this thesis can have widespread application elsewhere, given its theoretical and methodological groundings and its novel multi-method approach to study forest industry vulnerability and the potential for adaptation.

TI  - Epigenetic Contributions to Early Life History Variation in Chinook Salmon
SP  - 194
AB  - DNA methylation has been proposed as an epigenetic, evolutionary mechanism for acclimation, transgenerational plasticity, and local adaptation without changes in DNA sequence. In this thesis, I assess the highly targeted evolutionary nature of DNA methylation in Chinook salmon from the tissue to the population level, with important implications for organism survival and evolution. First, I developed a PCR-based bisulfite assay for Next-Generation sequencing for genes involved in growth, development, immune function, stress response, and metabolism (Chapter 2). Locus- and tissue-specific methylation was assessed in inbred and outbred Chinook salmon at two developmental stages (fry and yearling). This chapter established DNA methylation as a mechanism targeted to specific loci, tissues, levels of inbreeding, and developmental stages/environmental contexts. I assessed the role of DNA methylation in the propagation of maternal effects at three early developmental stages (egg, alevin, and fry; Chapter 3). Two 6x6 fully factorial Chinook salmon breeding crosses were used to estimate maternal effects. DNA methylation was assessed using bisulfite sequencing and both locus-specific and CpG-specific maternal effects were identified. This chapter established DNA methylation as a potential mechanism for the transmission of maternal effects, which can have important influences on offspring development and fitness. I quantified the effects of early environment on the genetic architecture of DNA methylation using 6x6 factorial crosses reared in two environments: a hatchery and a semi-natural channel (Chapter 4). Additive, non-additive, and maternal variance components, combined with environmental and GxE effects for DNA methylation were calculated. Rearing environment caused gene-specific plasticity in methylation, as well as differences in the genetic architecture of methylation. This chapter identified the importance of both genetic and environmental variation in controlling methylation, with important implications for methylation as an acclimation or adaptive mechanism. Finally, I characterized differences in locus-specific methylation among eight populations of Chinook salmon (Chapter 5). The significant population differences in locus-specific methylation were tested for correlation with environmental variables from natal streams, and pairwise FST estimates (microsatellite and SNP data). I identified no effects of rearing environment, but a weak among-population correlation between methylation and microsatellite FST indicating that genetic drift is influencing methylation. Population-level differences in DNA methylation suggest methylation may contribute to local adaptation and is certainly an important additional source of phenotypic variation. In conclusion, my doctoral research evaluated the role of DNA methylation from the tissue to the population level. My results support DNA methylation as a novel, potentially adaptive mechanism, contributing to normal organism function, transgenerational plasticity through maternal effects, plasticity, and population-level acclimation or adaptation.

TI  - Inter-Individual Variation Within Social Groups: How Metabolic Rate Shapes the Pace of Life
SP  - 76
AB  - Metabolic rate (MR) is often cited as the fundamental rate which determines the rate of all biological processes by shaping energetic availability for the various physiological, behavioral, and life-history traits that contribute to performance. Furthermore, the metabolic theory of ecology posits that performance at any level of biological organization is a function of the MR of its constituent units. It has therefore been suggested that MR drives the widely observed covariance among these different levels of phenotypic traits. However, much of the work on this topic has relied on pairwise correlational analysis on a handful of traits at a time, leaving an important gap in our understanding regarding the functional links that shape this phenotypic covariance, often referred to as pace-of-life. Furthermore, at a collective level, this has led to significant attention regarding how MR scales across group size, but considerably less attention has been paid to how heterogeneity in MR among constituent units shapes collective outputs. Using honeybees as a model, we measured a large number of behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits in individual bees and used a path analysis to demonstrate that variation in metabolic rate plays a fundamental proximate role in driving the covariance among these traits. We combined this with a factor analysis in a structural equation model framework to characterize the overall phenotypic covariance or the pace-of-life axis in honeybees. We discuss the importance of these findings in the context of how interindividual variation in terms of slow–fast phenotypes may drive the phenotype of a group and the functional role metabolic rate might play in shaping division of labor and social evolution. Building on this work, we leveraged the well-characterized differences in MR associated with ‘F’ (‘fast’) and ‘S’ (‘slow’) malate dehydrogenase (MDH) alleles to breed homozygous genotypes of bees expressing high (FF) and low (SS) MR in addition to heterozygotes (SF), thought to express an intermediate phenotype. We then mixed progeny from these lines to create experimental groups with four different phenotype compositions: monomorphic FF, monomorphic SS, monomorphic SF, and a polymorphic group type at a 1 FF: 1 SS ratio. We then measured MR, energetic intake, thermoregulation in cold and heat stress, and survival of these groups in a high and low resource environment. Monomorphic fast groups outperformed monomorphic slow and polymorphic groups, which performed worse than expected on most traits. We quantified the effect of heterogeneity on polymorphic group performance using the ‘diversity effect,’ an analytical technique often used in ecosystem ecology to compare the productivity of diverse ecosystem assemblages to null expectations set by the constituent species when living alone. Diversity effects can be partitioned selection and complementarity effects and understand the mechanisms through which biodiversity acts on ecosystem productivity. We applied this technique in a novel way to show how each group-level performance trait is influenced by MR morph diversity through different processes. We also found that MR was strongly correlated to the other traits, especially in the low resource environment. We discuss these results in the context of how MR plays an important role in shaping division of labor and social evolution. These studies provide empirical support for the theoretical idea that metabolic rate acts as a proximate driver of phenotypic covariance among a number of physiological, behavioral, and life-history traits at the individual level, and that behavior acts as a mediator for how metabolic rate affects life history. In addition, using honeybees as an experimental model for these studies establishes a framework for asking questions regarding how these individual-level phenotypic covariance patterns lead to observed phenotypic covariance patterns at the colony level that have functional consequences for division of labor and social evolution. The results of these studies therefore contribute toward a better understanding of the rules of life that shape processes across different levels of biological organization. Our use of different structural equation modeling approaches for inferring heuristics and proximate causal relationships among multiple phenotypic traits also informs future research efforts on this topic. We also present a novel approach to experiments that explore functional group level performance traits through partitioning the effects of inter-individual heterogeneity.

TI  - From Molecules to Whole Organisms: Insect Responses to Climate Change
SP  - 159
AB  - Global atmospheric temperatures are rising at accelerated rates, exposing organisms to novel and potentially unsuitable changes in their environment. In order to survive changes in their thermal environments, organisms can employ physiological plasticity on short time scales or species can adapt over evolutionary time. Species may utilize one or both of these strategies to ensure survival; however, if they are incapable of responding to change, they may face extinction. Insect species may be some of the most vulnerable organisms experiencing climate change-induced alterations in their thermal environments because, as ectotherms, temperature influences nearly all of their physiological processes. By characterizing physiological responses to global change, we can begin to understand how organisms are currently responding to climate change and predict how organisms may respond in the future. My research aims to elucidate how insects respond to changes in their thermal environment by examining multiple physiological responses to winter warming in diapausing Pieris rapae butterflies, and the evolution of transcriptomic responses to heat shock in early Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Winter warming caused P. rapae butterflies to have compromised supercooling points, lowered cryoprotectant abundances, shifted metabolomes, more variable metabolic rates, and switches in energy fuel usage. While heat shock caused thermally sensitive early D. melanogaster embryos to exhibit changes in the abundance of thousands of gene transcripts, regardless of the region of origin. But, D. melanogaster embryos with higher thermal tolerance from tropical populations had higher abundance of key transcripts that encode proteins involved in the oxidative stress response. My results suggest that insects endure a broad suite of physiological consequences when the temperature increases. Will these species survive climate change? My work suggests that diapausing P. rapae may be threatened by winter warming, but also shows that some individuals can recover from winter warming. My work also demonstrates that the evolutionary genetic basis of heat tolerance in early D. melanogaster embryos is mediated at the level of the transcriptome, and suggests that D. melanogaster has the potential for adaptation to heat shock temperatures. However, to what extent these species will be challenged by future warming patterns, and if they will continue to evolve and adapt at a rate suitable for survival, needs to be further studied.

TI  - Extrinsic Incubation Temperature Impacts on Zika Virus Evolution and Vector Competence During Systemic Aedes Infection
SP  - 148
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are distinctive in that they are required to constantly replicate in different hosts and in a wide range of temperatures for their perpetuation in nature. Vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37°C - 40°C, but arthropods hosts are poikilotherms and subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily temperature fluctuation of > 10°C.Invertebrate host genus, species, and strain in combination with arbovirus strain and preparation methods are known to have large impacts on vector competence and vectorial capacity. Seemingly small differences in host geographic isolation, virus strain, and preparation methods can have significant impacts on vector competence studies. The role of temperature on the ability of an arthropod vector to acquire, maintain, and transmit a pathogen has been investigated for numerous arboviruses. Changing the extrinsic incubation temperature between distinct constant temperatures has been shown to alter arbovirus vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival, in which moderate temperatures of 28°C-32°C are optimal and temperatures higher and lower have deleterious effects. The mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations (diurnal temperature) have likewise been shown to influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence, in which large daily temperature fluctuations negatively affect mosquito development, survival, and vector competence. However, little is known as to how temperature alters arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection or how differences in arbovirus hosts and viral strains impact arbovirus genetic diversity in relationship to temperature.Therefore in the study completed in chapter two, we characterized the impact that constant temperatures of 25°C, 28°C, 32°C, and 35°C, and the diurnal fluctuation from 25°C to 35°C during extrinsic incubation periods have on the Puerto Rican isolate of Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti (Poza Rica) and Aedes albopictus (Florida) mosquitoes. To characterize the impact that temperature has on ZIKV population diversity in different host species and viral isolates, in the study completed in chapter three, we used a Tapachula, Mexico Aedes aegypti line and a Chiapas, Mexico ZIKV isolate to assess ZIKV population dynamics during 20°C, 24°C, 28°C, 32°C, 34°C, and 36°C constant extrinsic incubation temperatures.We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28°C and 32°C for both Aedes species, while transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days post-infection in Aedes albopictus. The diurnal temperature group is not predicted by the constant temperature distribution. Instead, when using the mean daily temperature of the diurnal group as a predicter, its VC lies between the moderate (28°C and 32°C) and extreme (25°C and 35°C) temperature group VCs. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the ZIKV selective environment during infection. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas diurnal temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species.These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology within mosquitoes and has distinct effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes. Additionally, the selective pressures induced by temperature are consistent across host species and viral strain and have similar impacts on shaping the viral population structure. However, input viral populations are still a driving factor of diversity and expansion during systemic mosquito infection. While our findings and those of others suggest that vector competence is impacted unimodally regardless of temperature, this is only applicable for constant temperatures. Future work assessing daily temperature fluctuation range and mean are needed to have a clear understanding of the role extrinsic incubation temperature plays on vector competence.

TI  - Investigations into Effects of Environmental Stressors on Lake Sturgeon Physiology, Behavior, and Survival During Early Ontogeny
SP  - 175
AB  - Environmental stressors experienced by wildlife can have profound impacts on behavior and physiology that may have consequences for survival. My dissertation investigates how early life stress influences physiology, behavior, and survival in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), an ancient chondrostean fish species. Lake sturgeon are regionally threatened, and therefore exploring the mechanisms by which stressors influence fitness is important in informing conservation efforts. My dissertation examines behavioral and physiological outcomes of four potential stressors encountered by lake sturgeon larvae: high temperature, maternal-offspring environmental mismatch, captive rearing, and predator interaction. In Chapter 1, I examined effects of temperature by comparing lake sturgeon reared at 10℃ (low stress) and 18℃ (high stress). During the free embryo stage, individuals reared at 18C exhibited a smaller cortisol elevation in response to an acute stressor, indicating lower physiological reactivity to stress. At the larval stage, individuals reared at 18C had higher levels of swimming activity and higher survival rates when exposed to a crayfish predator. Findings suggest that physiological and behavioral phenotypes induced by early life stress may be adaptive during subsequent life stages in high-stress contexts such as exposure to predators In Chapter 2, I further explored the adaptive potential of stress-related phenotypes. Since stressed females can provision eggs with elevated cortisol that potentially prepares offspring for high-stress conditions, I investigated outcomes of a match or mismatch between egg cortisol and offspring stress levels. Individuals that experienced both high egg cortisol and high stress had reduced cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor, but only in one of two families. Results suggest that family (genetic) effects may mediate the interaction of maternal and offspring stress experiences. The largest differences in swimming activity occurred between the “mismatch” treatments, indicating that the combination of egg cortisol and offspring stress is more important in determining offspring behavior than is egg cortisol or offspring stress alone. In Chapter 3, I evaluated the role of stress in conservation programs by comparing stress levels, behavior, and predation rates for hatchery-produced and wild-caught lake sturgeon larvae. Cortisol levels did not indicate that hatchery-produced individuals were more stressed, but cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor disappeared for both hatchery-produced and wild-caught larvae after 9 days in the hatchery. Predation rates increased over time for larvae from both treatments, suggesting that the hatchery environment may inhibit survival even though individuals do not exhibit high stress. Results highlight that effects of captive rearing become evident after only a short duration spent in captivity during early ontogeny. In Chapter 4, I investigated stress-related effects of encounters with aquatic insects commonly found in stream substrate during the free embryo stage. Lake sturgeon experienced stress proportional to the amount of predation risk experienced. Individuals that encountered Perlidae (obligate predators) had high mortality as well as elevated cortisol and cortisol reactivity to an acute stressor. Individuals that encountered Isonychiidae (facultative predators) had slightly elevated mortality compared to individuals that encountered no insects, and had slightly elevated cortisol levels and cortisol reactivity. Results indicate early life stress as a mechanism by which nonlethal predator interactions impact lake sturgeon, indicating the importance of community-level ecological context in predicting outcomes for species of conservation concern.

TI  - Search for Selection: Genomic, Transcriptomic, and Phenotypic Investigations of Spotted Seatrout (Cynoscion Nebulosus)
SP  - 224
AB  - Climate change has resulted in both increased mean water temperature and higher frequencies of extreme water temperatures in coastal areas. These new thermal regimes exert strong selective pressure on the thermal physiology of coastal aquatic species. Phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to display multiple phenotypes) and local adaptation (increased fitness to local environment due to natural selection) dictate both short-term (from hours to days to weeks) and long-term (from years to decades) resilience of a species. To better predict how a species will respond to the negative impacts of climate change, one first needs to know the current levels of variation in plasticity and local adaptation. Marginal populations are especially critical for the persistence of a species, as those populations can harbor unique genetic variation and the interaction between plasticity and local adaptation determines the boundaries of future distributional ranges. This dissertation focuses on the northern marginal population of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), an estuarine-dependent fish, and compares them with those from the core region of the distribution to elucidate the physiological, transcriptomic and genetic mechanisms of plasticity and adaptation. I discovered significant differences between fish from different areas at all three levels of biological organization: Chapter 1 shows different whole-organism metabolic physiology of fish sampled from distinct populations and the northern population is consistent with cold-adaptation, given the pressure of natural selection from more severe and frequent winter kills in the region. Chapter 2 presents functional genetic evidence that the cold-adapted northern spotted seatrout are more vulnerable to heat stress than the warm-adapted southern spotted seatrout, suggesting that differential gene expression is contributing to observed differences in thermal tolerance. A liver transcriptome is de novo assembled and serves as a valuable resource for future genetic studies of spotted seatrout. Chapter 3 discovers signatures of selection based on over 15,000 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The pattern of genetic variation is consistent with thermal adaptation along the US east coast. Genes involved in metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation are the main targets of natural selection. In summary, spotted seatrout are relatively resilient to the thermal effects of climate change due to a wide range of metabolic plasticity and adaptive potential in climate-related genetic variation. Range expansion at the leading edge, however, is largely constrained by the species’ cold tolerance limit. The northern and southern population will likely respond to climate change differently and this should be taken into consideration in future conservation management of this species.

TI  - Larval Transport on Windy Coasts
SP  - 140
AB  - Most marine animals reproduce via a dispersing planktonic larval phase. Tiny, poorly swimming larvae develop at sea as they are transported by ocean currents. Whether they reach suitable habitat for settlement and adulthood and which population of their conspecifics they might join depends on their ability to exploit variation in currents to control their trajectories. Larvae exhibit swimming behaviors that affect their vertical position in the water, which alters the currents to which they are exposed. These behaviors can vary across taxa, larval developmental stages, and diel or tidal cycles.The interaction between large-scale mean currents and the seafloor generates a multitude of circulation mechanisms on the inner continental shelf, where larvae are produced. The strength and direction of flow varies with time and space, including with depth, so larvae may interact with a variety of transport mechanism whose impact on their travel depends on their depth position. Indeed numerous such mechanisms have been documented in recent decades, including surface waves, internal waves, fronts, and eddies. Enumerating these flow mechanisms in space and time, paired with broadening our understanding of larval behavior and phenology, are key to understanding the role of the larval phase in marine population and community dynamics, genetic exchange, adaptive potential, and fisheries management.I sought to elucidate in new detail the operation of two nearshore circulation mechanisms and their role in larval transport. In Chapter 1, I describe internal wave generation at Bahia Todos Santos, Mexico, where they are known to bring larvae and nutrient pulses shoreward. Internal waves are vertical excursions of the density field, as opposed to surface waves, which are vertical excursions of sea-level height. They occur during stratified conditions in all major bodies of water and can be major contributors to the movement of water, nutrients, and particles. Internal waves themselves are variable, though, and their capacity to transport larvae depends on their physical characteristics. Using an array of instruments to measure temperature and currents, I showed that internal wave characteristics may be modified by other concurrent processes, specifically wind-driven currents.Wind-driven coastal upwelling brings dense bottom waters toward the surface and, as long as the water column remains stratified, this results in modified conditions through which internal waves propagate. The water that is transported shoreward by internal waves is cooler and holds less oxygen and more nutrients than in the absence of recent wind. Additionally, wind-driven currents in the direction of wave propagation enhance the particle transport potential of the waves, increasing the likelihood of particles being entrained and the distance that they travel.Chapters 2 and 3 focus on wind-driven currents in the persistent coastal upwelling system around Bodega Bay in central California. In Chapter 2, I explore the physics of flow separation and eddy formation around the headland that comprises the northern and windward promontory delineating the downstream bay. Using an array of current profilers and thermistors, I found that headland wake dynamics in this system were atypical because wind was not fully blocked by the headland. This resulted in strong wind-driven surface currents in the bay itself that moved in opposition to the flow separation eddy that would be expected in similar systems with well-protected bays. While vertically sheared flow and eddy recirculation occurred, they were transient and confined to a bottom layer. Under the strongest of coastal upwelling conditions, eddy recirculation in the bay was undetectable. It was replaced by a local, within-bay upwelling cell fed by return flow in a bottom layer and at the windward margin of the bay. This circulation mode and the complex dynamics in response to strengthening wind forcing in this system present novel considerations in the nearshore processes that affect transport.Chapter 3 examines the impact of the circulation modes discovered in Bodega Bay on the local taxa by enumerating larval abundance and settlement around the headland and bay system. I collected larval abundance samples at two depths in each of six locations on a bi-weekly basis, giving a snapshot of larval concentrations inside of the bay, at the seaward margin of the bay, and outside of the bay. Simultaneously, I conducted bi-weekly censuses of larval settlement using ceramic tiles and plastic scrubbers placed in high and low depth strata at six mooring and four intertidal locations.Larval abundance varied greatly with depth, location, and environmental conditions. In the deeper layer, upwelling conditions had little effect on total larval abundance at most location, but drove higher abundance at the location behind the headland most protected from wind. In the shallow layer, most locations at the bay margin or inside the bay showed a weak negative relationship between coastal upwelling conditions and larval abundance. At the farthest location inside the bay, however, the strongest wind forcing caused an increase in larvae as the local bay upwelling cell forced larvae up from depth.A taxon-specific analysis showed that indeed many taxa peaked in abundance inside the bay under moderate coastal upwelling or relaxation conditions. Some responded positively to these conditions throughout the system, though, and others responded negatively throughout the system. All taxa responded in the reverse in one depth stratum compared with the other in at least one location. Taxa fit into one of five response categories. The four categories that contained multiple taxa had representatives from three phyla and multiple ecological guilds.The similarities in the response of larval abundance to oceanographic conditions were driven by the co-occurrence of larvae across taxa at similar depths and times, highlighting the importance of larval swimming behaviors and the phenology of larval production for determining transport trajectories. Additionally, hindcasts of larval abundance using historical wind data demonstrated the importance of environmental variability, as some years favored certain taxa while other years were broadly positive or negative across groups. I found that settlement was often positively correlated with larval abundance at mooring sites and in the depth strata where a given taxa was more common. The two were often uncorrelated or even negatively correlated at intertidal sites, though these relationships varied by taxa and location. Additional time or circulation mechanisms may be required to couple the two processes more closely or else post-settlement mortality and sampling bias may have affected intertidal sites more strongly than mooring sites.This work demonstrated both the complexity and the tractability of nearshore circulation and transport dynamics. Internal waves were modified by coastal upwelling and wind-driven circulation in a predictable interaction with quantifiable effect on transport. Similarly, while headland wake dynamics were made more complex by local wind stress, coherent circulation scenarios emerged with patterned effects on larval abundance in the system. Despite the great deal of complexity involved in larval transport, it is possible to downscale from regional conditions to local dynamics with enough understanding of nearshore circulation mechanisms and larval behavior. An improved ability to predict these dynamics will aid our ability to effectively manage sensitive and exploited species as well as better understand the population and evolutionary dynamics of life in the sea.

AB  - Habitat selection by pond breeding amphibians and insects is often critical for larval survival, performance, and resulting parental fitness, since there is typically little parental care beyond oviposition site choice. Numerous axes of patch quality have been identified and quantified, but species with varied life histories may differently shift perception of habitat quality as changes in global climate increase water temperatures and rates of eutrophication. Three outdoor mesocosm experiments were conducted using two species with complex life cycles and very different life histories; Hyla chrysoscelis, or Cope’s Gray tree frog, and the mosquito (Culex restuans). Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to test the oviposition preference of each species by establishing gradients of temperature and nutrients in a completely crossed design. Additionally, a third mesocosm experiment testing larval performance of H. chrysoscelis was conducted by measuring frog metamorph body metrics of individuals reared in each temperature and nutrient combination. The temperature and nutrient treatments showed no significant effect in any of the three experiments, but each experiment had significant covariate predictors. The temperature difference from control pools in each block had a significant positive linear relationship with the number of H. chrysoscelis eggs laid per mesocosm, and metamorph mass increased with higher nitrate levels. C. restuans laid more egg rafts in mesocosms with higher levels of nitrate, and nitrate was driven significantly by temperature. Both species choose to oviposit in treatments that may ultimately benefit their offspring through increase rate of development and survival. The environmental variables that influence oviposition choice and offspring performance are crucial to understanding species distributions, abundances, and community structure as global warming and eutrophication affect the quality of freshwater systems.

TI  - The Effect of Temperature Throughout Intracapsular Development and Adult Life of the European Sting Winkle, Ocenebra Erinaceus (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Global Warming Contex
AB  - Climate change is shifting temperature regimes across Earth, which will result in impacts on the physiology, ecology and distribution patterns of organisms, especially for ectotherms species were nearly all-physiological and behavioural traits are sensitive to temperature. Many predictions assume that each population of a particular species has the same environmental niche; however, these predictions do not consider that across species’ geographic distributions, species exhibit intraspecific differences among populations. This could be more pronounced for species that undergo direct development, with restricted connectivity and low gene flow, which increase the potential for individuals to evolve local adaptations to native environmental conditions. This thesis aimed to understand the effect of temperature during the early and adult stages in two populations with different thermal histories of the European winkle Ocenebra erinaceus (Linnaeus, 1758). The results showed that O. erinaceus exhibits intraspecific differences during early development in terms of its thermal tolerance and physiological response. Embryos from the warm water population showed a wide, eurythermal tolerance range, exhibiting metabolic adjustment to increased temperatures. On the contrary, embryos from the cold water population showed narrow thermal tolerance windows, showing limited metabolic compensation to high temperatures. The thermal tolerance variation among populations of O. erinaceus might be a result of physiological adaptations to local thermal conditions. Moreover, local adaptation during early stages can persists in later ontogenetic stages. Adults from the thermal sensitive population (i.e. cold water) exposed to future ocean conditions showed a partial acclimation and cessation of reproductive investment. This study demonstrated that the impact of global warming will depend on the physiological adaptation of embryos as well as adults to local environmental conditions. O. erinaceus exhibits intraspecific differences at population-scale in its optimal temperatures and thermal limits. In warming scenarios, local extinctions will be expected in northern populations with the potential of the expansion of the distribution range of southern populations to fill the niche space left empty by northern populations.

TI  - Selection and Plasticity: Novel Phenotypic Trajectories in the Era of Climate Change
SP  - 126
AB  - Rising temperatures across the planet are exposing populations to environmental conditions previously unexperienced by these lineages, and the responses to these changes are myriad. Depending on the species and population, responses to changing climates can encompass shifts in geographic ranges, rapid genetic adaptation, or new phenotypic distributions caused by plasticity. In the case where populations are unable to exhibit one of the aforementioned responses, extinction is the inevitable outcome. Scientists have recognized this issue and have worked tirelessly over the last 30 years to determine which species are vulnerable, how populations are responding to rapid environmental changes, and how to best conserve the most at-risk lineages. However, the efforts to predict how populations and species will persist after a century of consistent and strong climate change tend to ignore how these changes affect contemporary populations, and thus we risk missing the critical phenotypic trajectories that lead to rapid adaptation, range shifts, or extinction, which could provide both a platform for informing species conservation, but also enhance our knowledge of biodiversity. This dissertation explores how environmental variation over a variety of spatial and temporal scales impacts the selective environment in which species live, as well as the multiple plastic responses populations can exhibit in response to changing environmental conditions. First, the relationship between declining food availability and rising environmental temperatures is quantified. Food availability exacerbates organismal performance and reduces the availability of populations to mount adaptive phenotypic changes in response to changing environments. Second, the relationship between thermoregulatory behavior and individual fitness is quantified. Fitness is increased when lizards exhibit warmer preferred temperatures and can sprint faster to enhance their thermoregulatory ability. Third, the efficacy of short-term plasticity in response to heat waves is quantified. Heat waves induce “hardening responses” which are stress-induced physiological mechanisms of surviving short-term and deleterious environmental fluctuations. Indeed, when these responses are elicited, other phenotypic traits suffer which trade-off with an individual’s ability to exploit the adaptive nature of plasticity. Last, population-level variation is quantified in climate-relevant traits for populations across an elevational gradient. Breaking from other studies, I find strong local adaptation consistent with the environmental differences across populations. Together, these findings provide new insights on the co-evolution of behavior and physiology, how traits respond to environmental variability, and the efficacy of different phenotypic response options that species can use to buffer the effects of climate warming.

TI  - Essays in Macroeconomics
SP  - 137
AB  - This dissertation consists of three chapters, each of them containing an essay in macroeconomics, inequality, and/or labor markets.The first chapter, "Sources of Lifetime Inequality Revisited", develops a theory to assess the importance of differences in early stages in life, before entering the labor market, in lifetime earnings, wealth and welfare. Factors established early in life can be key determinants of the lifetime value of earnings, consumption, and wealth. Furthermore, some of these variables are determined by parental background (ability, human capital) or passed on directly from parents (wealth). In this paper, I study a life cycle - overlapping generations economy with borrowing constraints and costly human capital acquisition, in which initial conditions are determined by parental background. The cost of human capital may prevent constrained agents to optimally acquire human capital and intergenerational transmission of wealth may alleviate this effect for wealthy households. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), I document statistics of the evolution of cohort inequality and the importance of parental transfer to attend college. I find that initial conditions can explain about 10% of the variation in lifetime income and wealth. Relaxing borrowing increases college enrollment and decreases inequality. The intergenerational correlation of abilities explains more than half of the intergenerational income elasticity, suggesting an important role for the parental background.The second chapter, "Avoiding Layoffs: On-the-job Search and Partial Insurance'', coauthored with Benjamin Villena, is motivated by two important facts: (i) A sizable amount of the employment-employment are done by workers who accept wage cuts, and (ii) conditional on doing on-the-job search, the probability of experiencing an employment-unemployment transition is higher. We interpret these pieces of evidence as if workers search on-the-job to prevent a layoff in the near future. We conceptualize this behavior as a self-insurance mechanism obtained by exerting effort. We formalize these intuitions by constructing an economy with idiosyncratic dismissal shocks and costly on-the-job search. Workers may use on-the-job search not only as a mechanism to climb the wage ladder, but also to avoid future bad shocks and hence, on-the-job search acts as an insurance mechanism. We show that consumption evolves according to a standard Euler equation in which current effort impacts the income distribution tomorrow. Using data from the Sources of Consumer Expectations, we estimate an idiosyncratic process of layoff probability. We also show that agents exert more effort when they face higher risk and that they are willing to accept lower wages. We solve and calibrate the model to account for these facts. We measure the insurance that this mechanism provides by computing the extra consumption that an agent has to receive to be indifferent with respect to an economy where they do not have the extensive margin of effort. Our calculations suggest that there is on average an increase in 15% in consumption due to the presence of this mechanism.In the third chapter, "Taxes, wealth inequality and mobility'', I develop a theory to study the impact of taxation on wealth inequality and wealth mobility across generations. I propose a model in which agents are heterogeneous in their labor productivity and entrepreneurship ability, and agents have warm glow-bequest functions. Wealth inequality and mobility are determined by heterogeneous returns to entrepreneurship and bequests. The government changes the incentives to wealth accumulation and transmission with the tax schedule. I consider progressive income taxes, corporate taxes, and estate taxes. The model is calibrated to replicate empirical social mobility observed in the data, as well as wealth inequality. I use the model to estimate the impact of taxes on wealth inequality and wealth mobility. The counterfactual exercise suggests that rising estate taxes and corporate taxes can have a large effect in reducing inequality with a minimum cost in terms of output.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Ecology of the Bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo: Migration, Parturition and Magnetic-Based Navigation
SP  - 111
AB  - Elasmobranch fishes are a highly vagile group that often cross state, regional or international boundaries. Delineating migratory patterns that cross jurisdictional boundaries is essential for effective management, especially when confronted with fishing pressures and regulations that vary over space and time. In addition to migrating individuals, studying critical life stages, such as neonates, is important for fisheries management. The broad goal of this dissertation was to develop a robust understanding of the spatiotemporal ecology of the bonnethead, Sphyrna tiburo. Our objectives were to quantify migration metrics (duration, distance, etc.) and assess the effects of ocean temperature on these metrics, to delineate the species’ pupping grounds and to determine if the bonnethead uses magnetic-based navigation.We used passive acoustic telemetry to track the migrations of 44 bonnetheads for up to 1506 days across ~ 1070 km of Southeastern United States Atlantic coastline. Bonnetheads are a widely distributed small coastal shark in the western hemisphere. The majority of these sharks exhibited strong site fidelity to the North Edisto River in South Carolina and returned annually, residing in the estuary from April to November. Climatic migrations then occurred and overwintering habitats were located throughout Georgia and mid-Florida waters. We present the interannual effects of varying ocean temperature on the seasonal migrations of individual sharks. We found that interannual variations in sea surface temperature had significant effects on the migration distance, duration, and date of arrival to overwintering habitats of individual sharks. An electivity analysis suggested that overwintering locations are selected based upon ocean temperature and not physical location. Given the significant effects of sea surface temperature on migration, future migrations may be altered due to climate change and warming seas. Given the degree of site fidelity observed, our work also has robust implications for the management of this species, as animals with strong ties to specific locations are put at high risks of localized extirpation. The data generated from this study can be used to generate predictive models that can estimate overwintering areas based upon sea surface temperature. These areas can then be protected during migration should the stock become imperiled.While monitoring the residency of S. tiburo in the North Edisto River (NER) we noticed a repeated absence of acoustic detections that aligned with the temporal span when parturition occurs. This absence from the NER suggested they may be giving birth outside of the estuarine waters. We used acoustic telemetry to track pregnant females and found they left the NER for ~2 weeks every year. During this time, they underwent a migration down the coast of the United States into the coastal waters of southern South Carolina and Georgia. We also analyzed fishery-independent surveys and found neonates began to appear in nearshore trawls during this same time period. The mature females caught in these surveys also lost ~1 kg of total body weight from summer to early fall, which we suspect indicates a birthing event. Additionally, an independent study from the same region demonstrated that bonnetheads were post-partum in September. Collectively these data illustrate that bonnetheads emigrate from the NER while pregnant, migrate down the coast, give birth and return to the NER. These data are important for the management of the bonnethead because their primary source of mortality is as bycatch in the shrimp fishery, which has spatiotemporal overlap in these nearshore waters.In our first two research chapters, we highlighted the migratory behavior of the bonnethead and demonstrated that they are capable of migrating over 1,000 km and successfully returning to a target location. In order for these movements to be possible, having a map sense may be important, and the earth’s magnetic field appears to be an important component of this behavior for other taxa. Whilst sharks have been at the forefront of sensory physiology research on sensitivity to electromagnetic fields, whether they use Earth's magnetic field for navigation is unresolved. Here we use a “magnetic displacement” experiment to show that sharks can use the map-like information from earth’s magnetic field to orient. Bonnethead sharks captured along the panhandle of Florida and exposed to a magnetic field mimicking a southern latitude within their range in the Gulf of Mexico oriented homeward, whereas orientation was random when exposed to a field that mimicked a northern latitude outside of their range (in the continental U.S.A.). Likewise, orientation was random when sharks were exposed to a field that controlled for nonspecific effects of the testing procedure. Given that sharks have prior experience of more southern magnetic fields than the control site, but never of more northern fields, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that sharks learn magnetic features for navigational tasks. The apparent ability of sharks to discriminate position using magnetic cues may also explain the sensory basis by which genetic structure of shark populations are maintained and how cryptic speciation can occur - despite no geographic barriers among reproductive locations.

TI  - A Survey of Different Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts for Ammonia Synthesis
AB  - The Haber–Bosch Process which was developed in the early 1900’s, was a landmark achievement of the 20th Century. Today the process produces over 174 million tonnes of ammonia annually, establishing an accessible route to produce over 450 million tonnes of synthetic fertilizer which maintains food production for 40 % of the global population. The Haber–Bosch Process involves combining pure H2 and N2 feed streams directly over a promoted iron catalyst at temperatures of around 400–500°C and reaction pressures of over 100 atmospheres. The reaction is exothermic and is equilibrium limited, thus it is thermodynamically favoured at lower reaction temperatures. Despite this, the temperature of operation is dictated by the requirement to achieve acceptable process kinetics. The Haber–Bosch Process is generally conducted at large scale and the process and the generation of feedstock for the reaction are energy intensive using 1–2 % of the world’s manmade energy and contributing 1.6 % of manmade CO2 emissions. The development of small-scale ammonia plants that function using renewable feed stock and sustainable electricity, can lessen such disadvantages towards the environment and can further offer financial benefits. As a result, the development of catalysts suitable for small-scale ammonia plants using less harsh reaction conditions are of interest. Supported catalysts have been extensively studied and are well known for catalysing a wide variety of reactions. There are some low surface area catalysts that have been reported to be highly active in ammonia synthesis and using a suitable support, the catalytic phase can be dispersed, thus possibly further improving ammonia synthesis activity. In this work, a series of supported molybdenum, cobalt and cobalt-rhenium based catalysts were synthesised and tested for ammonia synthesis. Oxide supports with contrasting properties such as SiO2, α–Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, CaO and MgO were applied and the active phases were added to the supports via a wetness impregnation based procedure. A comparison of the ammonia synthesis activities of the catalysts with their respective supports are surveyed in this thesis. The different catalyst systems possessed different characteristics that influenced ammonia synthesis activities. Supported molybdenum catalysts were mainly influenced by the presence of different molybdenum species, while the supported cobalt and cobalt-rhenium catalysts were influenced by the support used. The CoRe/MgO catalyst was found to possess the highest activity in this work under the reaction conditions applied.

TI  - Design of High-Performance Triboelectric Nanogenerators (Tengs) for Energy Harvesting Applications
AB  - The growing concerns around the long-term viability of the fossil fuel-based energy and its associated environmental cost are necessitating new research paradigms for energy generation and harvesting. An attractive and effective way to respond to the current energy crisis is through the harvesting of ambient mechanical energy from our environment. The conventional mechanical energy harvesting technologies are highly dependent on either the use of rare earth magnetic materials, high precision microfabrication techniques or composed of brittle materials, which are required to be driven at very high resonant frequencies, not frequently encountered beyond an industrial setting. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), based on the triboelectrification and electrostatic induction effects, have been demonstrated as a novel harvesting technique to collect and transform ambient mechanical energy into electric power. Unlike the other mechanical energy harvesters, the low-cost TENGs fabricated using commodity polymers and facile fabrication techniques, operate at low frequencies (1-10 Hz) with a high energy conversion efficiency. One of the key areas in TENG research is the enhancement of their electrical output to make them suitable for either making a self-powered system viable or powering small portable electronics directly. Except for the judicious use of tribo-materials or the tribo-layer architecture optimisation, the rest of the methods for enhancing the TENG output are reliant on expensive equipment and complicated processing, that undermine the advantages of TENGs and may not provide the required stability and reliability. This PhD study aims to establish novel strategies to enhance output performance of TENG by developing new tribo-materials and phenomena such as coupling of tribo-piezoelectric effects to showcase potential applications of the TENG devices. The research work conducted and the achievements are summarized as follows. Firstly, a novel output performance improvement strategy of utilising stress-induced polarization effect of the piezoelectric materials was proposed. An interfacial layer of piezoelectric zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheets was deposited to generate additional piezoelectric charge induced by the vertical contact-separate generation cycle. This extra piezoelectric charge is injected into the upper polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tribo-negative layer for the enhancement of the surface charge density from ~110 μC.m-2 to ~225.7 μC.m-2. The introduction of the ZnO and Zn-Al:Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH), as charge injection layer and anionic clay, enhanced the instantaneous power output from ~11 W.m-2 to 47 W.m-2. Subsequently, based on a similar principle, a novel composite of lead-free perovskite, zinc stannate (ZnSnO3), and a fluoropolymer, poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, was proposed for the stress-polarisation tribo-negative behaviour with a simplified structure. The PVDF-ZnSnO3 composite membranes were realised through a facile phase-inversion technique leading to higher piezoelectric constant (76.3 pm.V-1) and β-phase (72%) for the composites. When applied to the TENG devices, the PVDF-ZnSnO3 membranes allowed spontaneous polarisation effects which led to significant enhancement of the electrical outputs, with maximum peak-to-peak voltage and effective transferred current density of ~600 V and ~206 μC.m-2, respectively. The surface charge enhancement and distribution of the composite membrane were also probed and demonstrated through the electrostatic force (EFM) and piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM). To overcome the difficulty in processing of the currently known most tribo-negative material, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), an emulsion electrospinning technique incorporating polyethene oxide (PEO) was introduced. It was observed that the subsequent thermal removal of PEO led to a significant degradation in the surface charge density of the obtained PTFE nanofibrous membranes, which was overcome using a facile negative ion-injection process. The measured electrical outputs, with a maximum peak-to-peak voltage output of ~900 V and charge density of ∼149 μC.m−2, demonstrated the excellent effect of the enhanced contact area to the improvement of the outputs. The work eliminates the demonstrated need for surface micro structuring using reactive ion etching of PTFE surfaces by introducing a relatively simple, costeffective, and environmentally friendly technique for fabricating fibrous fluoropolymers tribonegative layer for the energy harvesting applications. Finally, a unique mouldable material, aniline formaldehyde resin (AFR) was synthesised and characterised. The synthesised AFR, as a resinous polymer with significant amine (-NH2) groups acquires the most surface positive charge, is applied as a tribo-positive material. The heatpressed AFR thin-film based TENG was subsequently tested to demonstrate its outstanding performance serving as a tribo-positive layer compared to the Polyamide 6 (PA6) and polyethene oxide (PEO), as one of the most common used tribo-positive materials. In addition, a Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) was subsequently employed to study the surface potential of the produced AFR layer and the surface potential change of the contact layers during the energy generation cycles. All of the produced high-performance TENGs (power output ranging from 9 - 47 W.m-2) have the potential to be utilised further in enabling self-powered systems and can serve as a new alternative energy harvesting source of great significance.

TI  - Identifying Opportunities for Resilience in Reef-Building Corals as Ocean Warming Continues
SP  - 120
AB  - Identifying and harnessing processes that promote coral recovery and resilience is crucial. The declining status of coral-reef ecosystems has led to proposed interventions to selectively propagate thermally resistant corals, aiming to increase coral resilience under ocean warming and intensified bleaching events. Using a combination of field and laboratory studies, this research assesses fundamental biological traits, with an emphasis on reproduction, of Porites astreoides along the Florida Keys Reef Tract (FRT) and Montipora capitata within Kāneʻohe Bay, Hawaiʻi during and after the 2015 global coral bleaching event. By assessing two coral species considered ecological “winners” in U.S. coral reef ecosystems, I highlight limitations and potential challenges associated with coral restoration efforts considering “exceptional” reef selection, selective breeding, and thermal conditioning. First, I compared seasonal and spatial patterns in the biological function of P. astreoides at sites located along the FRT to determine trade-offs during and after bleaching. Second, I assessed the impacts of differential bleaching susceptibility (bleached and recovered vs. nonbleached) of Montipora capitata on sexual reproduction and selectively bred offspring in subsequent spawning seasons. Third, I examined the parental effects of M. capitata associated with bleaching history and thermal conditioning on sexual reproduction and offspring performance. My results demonstrate that despite a severe bleaching event, (i) there is an exceptional site in the FRT where corals are not limited by trade-offs but the environmental and biological drivers remain unknown, (ii) sexual reproduction in Hawaiʻi appears to be robust regardless of bleaching response; however, there were delayed beneficial maternal effects in bleaching resistant colonies on offspring survivorship, and (iii) high thermal conditioning reduces reproductive output regardless of parental bleaching susceptibility and parental effects did not elicit lasting thermal resistance. Further research is required to determine the risks, benefits, efficacy, and scalability of human interventions to preserve resilient reefs in conjunction with action to reduce the use of fossil fuels that significantly contribute to ocean warming.

TI  - Captive Rearing and Semiochemcial Ecology of Trichogramma papilionis (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)
SP  - 159
AB  - This study addressed aspects of mass rearing of Trichogramma papilionis (Hymenoptera; Trichogrammatidae), including the effects of varied colony founder size on wasp fitness, and the exploitation of the wasps to locate egg hosts in which to deposit thereof progeny. Effects of initial founder female number of T. papilionis were investigated using fitness parameters (emergency rate, sex ratio and fecundity) to quantify the effects of a severe bottleneck (single founder female) on 10 subsequent generations. Results showed that no significant difference for eggs laid per female over ten generations, suggesting that the imposed bottleneck did not result in reduced female fecundity for any founder population size. However, founder numbers did affect both the emergence rate and sex ratio of T. papilionis. Further investigation of the impacts of inbreeding on field performance of the wasps was discontinued as extremely limited host finding ability of the wasps was observed in some habitats. The emphasis of the work was thus shifted to elucidating the searching behaviors of T. papilionis in relation to chemical cues. The hypothesis that T. papilionis are attracted to host habitat by host plant or egg-associated volatile chemicals was tested.The response of T. papilionis females to olfactory cues from host eggs, host plants and induced plant volatiles were studied. The response of T. papilionis females to different info-chemical cues was tested in Y-tube olfactory assays. Wasps made a positive response to odors from corn earworm (CEW) eggs Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) compared with blank air, while there was a negative response to Ephestia kuehniella eggs (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) compared blank air: T. papilionis females thus preferred odors from corn earworm eggs over the Mediterranean flour moth eggs. Further, the wasps were attracted to volatile emissions from sunn hemp Crotalaria juncea (L.) over maize Zea mays (L.), despite both plants infested with H. zea eggs. No preference was observed for plants not infested with H. zea eggs, suggesting T. papilionis showed a positive response to stimuli from sunn hemp plants that might be induced by H. zea oviposition. Chemical volatile collection and headspace analysis was conducted. Headspace analysis and thermal desorption and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GCMS) was used to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively determine the difference in plant volatile organic components (VOCs) from Helicoverpa zea egg infested sunn hemp plants compared with intact sunn hemp plants and H. zea eggs only. TD is used as a preconcentration technique of VOCs for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS), making it useful to detect low-concentration analytes that would otherwise be undetectable. Results demonstrated that sunn hemp plants released 55 chemical volatiles with five compounds that were unique, or were emitted in higher concentrations, for plants infested with CEW eggs. These volatile compounds were consistent with linear alkanes, aldehydes, aromatics, polyterpene-related compounds, naphthalene derivatives, and ester-related compounds. High concentrations of anisole, β-myrcene, cis-butyric acid, trans-isoeugenol, and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were found in infested sunn hemp. The majority of GCMS peaks detected from H. zea eggs were consistent with phosphates, pheromone-related compounds, various natural products, a series of glycol-related compounds, and a series of fatty acid ester-related compounds. Several compounds were shared in sunn hemp samples and corn earworm eggs: anisole, β-myrcene, and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, but were detected in higher concentrations from the plants with H. zea eggs.Evaluation of the response and the performance of T. papilionis females in y-tube olfactory bioassays to single compounds, and blends of synthetic chemical showed that the wasps were significantly attracted to only two of the assayed chemical volatiles (anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate). Some concentrations of anisole and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were attractant to the wasps, whereas some concentrations of the other tested chemical compounds repelled the wasps. Wasps were attracted to a blend of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (25μL /100μL ratio) which is similar to the ratio of anisole to bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate detected in the (GC-DMS) chromatograph for C. juncea plants infested with H. zea eggs. No significant attraction to any other blend ratios of anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was observed.Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to determine whether the patterns observed in the y-olfactometer were consistent under less constrained conditions. The optimal blend identified above was initially tested in a greenhouse, and later in closed-canopy environments (under trees) and open habitat with no trees. The parasitism rate by T. papilionis wasps was significantly increased when the wasps were exposed to anisole and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate blend in both greenhouse and outdoor trials (covered habitat), at least over short distance (up to 2m from the volatile sources).The findings presented in this dissertation underscore the importance of improving our understanding of how tri-trophic interactions (natural enemies- herbivores and host plants) interact to influence insect behavior, as well as the impact of variable environments, impact parasitoid wasps. The results may also contribute to finding a way to improve natural enemy efficacy in augmentative and conservation biocontrol efforts. Semiochemical cues can positively or negatively affect the response of parasitic wasps. This may provide an understanding of ecology that could facilitate achieving successful field parasitism and thus enhanced pest management.

AB  - The Maximum Entropy Principle (Max Ent) was introduced by E.T. Jaynes in 1957 as a method to infer the most likely probability distribution given some known partial information about data. This principle was given a theoretical grounding by Shore and Johnson in 1980, who framed it in terms of self-consistency conditions on the laws of probability themselves. They showed how the concept of entropy and its maximization is not limited to equilibrium thermal systems. More recently, it has been extended to non-thermal systems at equilibrium as well as dynamical systems. After a brief overview of the principle itself, and its dynamical form (known as Maximum Caliber principle, or Max Cal) I will discuss some applications of it to systems of physical and biological relevance. In the first part of the dissertation I will show how it is possible to apply Max Ent to the protein’s sequence space, in order to determine the features of the time scales of protein evolution, adaptation to different environment and the action of other protein machinery known as chaperones. Making use of the largely accepted idea that proteins physical features are what determines the fitness of a cell, I will show how it is possible to relate the speed of adaptation and evolution to features like a proteins stability and its tendency to aggregate, as well as the concentration of chaperones. In the second part, I will show an application of Max Cal to non-equilibrium, steady state systems, which is of pivotal importance since it represents a class of systems which is among the most studied in the field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. I will show how the proper set of constraints resolves some doubts regarding the application of Max Cal to systems which exhibit specific symmetries under space reflection and time reversal. I will conclude the dissertation by showing that Max Cal can be used in a more systematic fashion when some conservation law applies to dynamical quantities, like linear and angular momentum; in such cases the choice of constraints is less arbitrary than in others.

TI  - Summer Temperature and Photoperiod Induce Physiological, Life History, and Gene Expression Changes in Drosophila mojavensis
SP  - 158
AB  - Seasonal environmental changes act as a selective force. Across insects, there are many adaptations to unfavorable seasons. Aestivation is one such adaptation that allows insects to survive hot and dry periods experienced in summer seasons. Drosophila mojavensis is a cactophilic Drosophila species that inhabits the Sonoran Desert. Much work has been done on understanding their ecology, and their taxonomic closeness to the model system Drosophila melanogaster allows us to easily use established molecular tools. In this study, a laboratory-generated population of D. mojavensis was established and raised for four generations in conditions mimicking the field conditions of spring and summer in its natural habitat. Currently, it is unknown what physiological, behavioral and/or metabolic mechanisms allow D. mojavensis to over-summer in this hot desert environment. Collecting individuals in this region during the summer months is rare. Generating a lab raised population allowed me to manipulate temperature and photoperiod and observe changes over multiple generations in a controlled setting. Physiological changes over the generations approaching summer showed increases in heat and desiccation resistance, and overall lower activity levels. Drosophila mojavensis continued to lay eggs during the summer generations, but died much earlier than individuals from spring generations. mRNA expression data revealed sets of genes that were overrepresented in categories such as chaperones, heat response, metabolic processes, and protein synthesis/degradation. Genes that control high energy costing processes were highlighted in this study. This is the first study that systematically attempted to investigate the physiological, life history, behavioral and molecular basis of summer survival in D. mojavensis, and although the mechanism of survival appears complex, it has provided a better understanding of seasonal responses, such as continued egg production and lowered longevity, in this Sonoran Desert endemic species.

TI  - Study of Neutron Induced Reaction Cross Sections Up to 18 MeV for Advanced Reactor Design
SP  - 150
AB  - There is current interest worldwide to develop new concepts of nuclear power generation and major efforts are on to realize this. Among them, accelerator driven subcritical system (ADSs), fast reactor, compact and high temperature reactors and advanced heavy water reactor (AHWR) are the most important for power production. Besides power production, ADSs is important for incineration of the long-lived actinides and transmutation of the long-lived fission products. For the design of such reactors nuclear data such as reaction and fission cross-section of structural and cladding material and fuel elements with medium to fast neutron energies are important. The nuclear waste disposal is certainly an urgent and important challenge to be tackled to ensure future sustainable growth of nuclear power. The fuel cycle based on Thorium (Th) can address both these issues owing to a number of favorable neutronics and material characteristics which makes thorium a better fertile host.Accelerator driven sub-critical reactor system (ADSs) demonstrated that a commercial nuclear power plant of adequate power can also be built around a sub critical reactor, provided it can be fed externally with required intensity of accelerator produced neutrons. The ADSs have attractive features for the elimination of troublesome long lived minor actinides and fission products of the spent fuel as well as for nuclear energy generation utilizing thorium as fuel. From India’s perspective, which has abundant reserves of thorium, ADSs is relevant because one can also exploit its potential to design hybrid reactor systems that can produce nuclear power with the use of thorium as the main fuel. ADSs based thorium burners may need only small and limited quantities of thorium and AHWR needs small amount of uranium and plutonium to serve as starter seeds. In general, the additional degree of freedom provided by the external source in ADSs can enable one to design reactor system which primarily burn thorium fuel as well as make a more efficient use of natural uranium fuel. Therefore, ADSs seems to have the potential to provide an additional route, an efficient and economic nuclear power generation with the available thorium resources. In ADSs, the high energy neutrons were produced from the spallation reaction by bombarding the GeV energy of proton from accelerator on heavy metal target like Pb and Bi. Structural Materials used in reactors, need to fulfill two objectives. 1. They should retain their mechanical properties even after irradiation with intense neutron fluxes. 2. Neutron-induced activation should not lead to the production of long- lived radioactive waste.In view of this, it is important to study the fast neutron induced reaction/fission crosssections of long-lived minor actinides (Th and U), spallation target (Pb, Bi), structural and cladding materials (e.g. Zr, Nb, Fe, Cr, Mn, Ni, Y and Ag) and neutron flux monitors (e.g. Au). Because of their very low absorption cross-sections for thermal neutrons and resistance to corrosion, these materials are frequently used as cladding of fuel rods and pipe lines of secondary coolant circuit in nuclear reactors. But its cross-sections database especially for neutron threshold reactions is rather scarce. Neutron cross-section data is required for design of different components of advanced reactor. i.e., shielding design, waste estimation, estimation of radiation damage, nuclear heating, transmutation effects, radiation dose.

TI  - Macroevolution of Microhabitat, Climate, and Morphology in Lungless Salamanders (Family: Plethodontidae)
SP  - 141
AB  - Biologists have long sought to understand how ecological selective pressures drive evolutionary responses. Defining how morphology, life history, and abiotic conditions interact across deep time can reveal the selective pressures responsible for shaping various axes of biodiversity. I used this three-pronged framework to investigate the macroevolution of the family of lungless salamanders (Plethodontidae), well-known for its impressive ecological and geographic diversity while exhibiting little apparent morphological diversity. Employing ancestral state estimation methods, geometric morphometrics, and various phylogenetic comparative approaches, I first investigated the macroevolutionary responses of functional morphology to microhabitat-use across the clade’s history. From these analyses, I estimated at least five independent transitions towards arboreality and over 60 transitions away from arboreality across the plethodontid tree of life. This suggests that arboreality may represent an evolutionarily transitory state for lungless salamanders, with a high tendency to abandon arboreal habitats to return to the ancestral terrestrial habitat. I also found no evidence of morphologically distinct body shapes or foot shapes in arboreal species, suggesting that it is unlikely that the tendency to occupy or abandon arboreal microhabitats is driven by biomechanical constraints. I next explored the relationship between microhabitat use and abiotic conditions, revealing that arboreal species occupy warmer, wetter climates than terrestrial species as measured by coarse environmental data summarized across entire species’ ranges. This pattern was explicated using phylogenetic comparative methods and corroborated with a novel implementation of ecological niche modeling. From this analysis, I concluded that the availability of arboreal microhabitats is largely determined by the abiotic conditions of the species range. Finally, following our discovery of the importance of climate in determining these species’ ecological patterns, I investigated the macroevolution of the morphological trait, surface area to volume ratios (SA:V), across the family with respect to climatic variation. SA:V is particularly relevant for climatic conditions as lungless salamanders display little cutaneous resistance to water-loss and are thus prone to environmentally-induced desiccation. I developed a method to estimate SA:V which strongly outperformed traditional estimates of SA:V and revealed that salamanders in less-desiccation prone climates exhibit higher and more disparate SA:Vs. This is consistent with our hypothesis that drier climates restrict the evolution of body forms conferring high SA:Vs. Altogether, these results reveal that broad climatic patterns may be the most important ecological selective pressure in shaping the macroevolution of morphology and microhabitat use for plethodontids.

TI  - “Is Garlic a Promising Dietary Agent against Cancer? Results from Experimental Studies, an Observational Study, and a Clinical Trial”
SP  - 193
AB  - Background and Aims: It is estimated that approximately one-third of all cancer deaths in the United States could be avoided through appropriate dietary modification. In the last few decades, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown anti-cancer properties of garlic (Allium sativum), in organs including stomach, liver, colon, prostate, skin, bladder, breast, and lung. Although results are inconsistent and far from conclusive, epidemiologic studies have shown an association between dietary garlic intake and reduced risk of cancers including stomach, colon, breast, lung, and esophagus. Very few or no studies exist for other types of cancers. Most studies have been conducted in Europe and Asia and not in the U.S. Garlic consumption patterns vary greatly in different areas of the world. The potential benefits of garlic could also differ by the form consumed. Not all forms of garlic contain the same crucial elements and garlic consumption (both form and quantity) varies by region. Therefore, the current study aimed to address these gaps in knowledge by pursuing three specific aims: 1) determine the association between garlic consumption and supplement use and risk of total cancer incidence and mortality in general and at specific cancer sites using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Trial (PLCO); 2) quantify and compare the effective antioxidant components and anti-proliferative properties for several forms of garlic (raw crushed, garlic powder, cooked, black garlic and two garlic supplements) in two different solutions (alcohol and water); and 3) explore garlic supplement effects on biomarkers of antioxidant activity in a pilot randomized control crossover trial.Methods: Aim 1: Using data from the PLCO trial we prospectively assessed the association between garlic intake and risk of cancer incidence and mortality in the US population. Participants were followed for a median for 12.4 years with information on cancer diagnoses and death up until December 31, 2009. Data on garlic consumption was collected at baseline from the participants in the intervention arm only using a dietary health questionnaire (DQX) (n = 57,997). Data on garlic supplement use was introduced in 1998 and collected from the participants in both arms using the diet history questionnaire (DHQ) (n = 88,973). Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard risks and 95% confidence intervals [HR (95% CI)] after controlling for age, gender, smoking and other relevant covariates. Follow-up time was calculated from the participant age when the dietary questionnaire was completed until the occurrence of either: cancer diagnosis event, death, or end of the follow-up.Aim 2: The different types of garlic were purchased in Buffalo, NY. Aqueous and methanol extracts of seven garlic forms were investigated for their antioxidant and antiproliferative activity: raw garlic, raw garlic set aside for 10 minutes, garlic powder, cooked garlic, black garlic, and two garlic supplements (Garlicin and Kyolic). Antioxidant activity was evaluated utilizing the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) assay, superoxide assay, and hydroxyl assay. Antioxidant activity was calculated in terms of gram equivalents of ascorbic acid per gram of sample. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays were conducted to assess the antiproliferative effects of treatment for 48 hours with the extracts in cell lines selected to represent common cancer histologic and molecular lung cancer subtypes. Two-fold dilution concentrations of garlic extract were used ranging from 0.08% to 2.5% and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated from dose-response curves. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used at P < 0.05 to compare the means. Post-hoc tests were used to compare pairwise differences.Aim 3: We investigated the effects of garlic supplementation on serum antioxidant parameters in a pilot, randomized, single-blinded, crossover study. Participants were recruited from the University at Buffalo and randomized into either the intervention group, who received two Garlicin pills every day for 14 days, or the control group, who received placebo pills. This treatment was followed by a two-week washout period before crossing over into the other arm for another two weeks. Blood, urine, and anthropometric measures were taken at baseline and at three follow-up visits every two weeks. For between group comparisons, linear mixed-effects models of variance were used to estimate the overall mean, the treatment effects, the period effects, and carryover effects.Results: Aim 1 study: Garlic intake ≥ 3 times/week compared with never < 1 month was not associated with total cancer incidence nor cancer mortality after adjustment for age, gender, pack-years of cigarettes, and smoking status (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.02 and HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.03, respectively). Garlic supplement use for 3+ years was associated with an 8% decrease in total cancer incidence (HR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.98), after adjustment for age, gender, pack-years, smoking status, and study arm compared to never users. Garlic supplement use was not related to total cancer mortality even after adjustment for potential confounders (HR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.85, 1.11). No associations were found for garlic and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality.Aim 2 study: Across all radical scavenging assays, Garlicin, which contains mainly allicin, showed high antioxidative activity in water and alcohol extracts across the DPPH (2.02 g AAE/g garlic and 3.53 mg AAE/g garlic, respectively) and superoxide assays (6.73 mg AAE/g garlic and 7.13 mg AAE/g garlic, respectively). Garlicin inhibited proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cells (H1975 and A549) and lung squamous cells (H520) more strongly compared to other garlic forms including raw garlic, heated garlic, black garlic garlic powder, and Kyolic supplement.Aim 3 study: Mean glutathione-S-transferase (GST) levels for the 40 subjects increased significantly by 0.90 U/L from baseline to follow-up within the Garlicin group (within the period change) (p = 0.01). Compared to the placebo group, the change in GST enzyme levels was 0.84 U/L higher when participants took Garlicin supplements (change between periods) for 2 weeks (p = 0.04). There were no significant differences in changes in GPx, GR, DBP, and DBP between Garlicin and placebo groups (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Our findings suggest that garlic supplement use might be protective against cancer. The various garlic forms tested differed in anticancer activity; the Garlicin supplements showed the highest antioxidant and potent antiproliferative activity. Furthermore, these data suggest that garlic, used as an oral dietary supplementation, may be tolerated and beneficial in increasing the antioxidant biomarkers in the body, at least in the short run. Garlic, a major source of organosulfur compounds, represents a promising source for a number of anti-cancer agents with potential pharmacological applications in larger clinical trials.

TI  - Transgenerational Effects on the Microbiome of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
SP  - 133
AB  - A critical emerging factor in the fitness of individuals is their microbiome, defined as the community of microorganisms found in and on the body of an individual. Despite the rapidly accumulating evidence of the significant role of the microbiome to host health and disease, there is a lack of studies partitioning microbiome variation into explanatory source components in fish, especially those relating to host genetics. To address this knowledge gap, this thesis made several contributions to estimate the transgenerational effects on the microbiome of an ecologically, economically and culturally important salmonid – Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). To achieve this goal, breeding designs were utilized to estimate various genetic architecture components, including additive among- population variance, additive genetic variance and maternal effects. DNA was extracted from hindgut contents of saltwater juveniles, the surface of eyed eggs, and maternally sourced gut content and ovarian fluids. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted to amplify and metabarcode the 16S rRNA encoding gene, and high throughput sequencing was then used to generate millions of sequences based on amplified PCR products. Taxonomic operational units (OTUs) were generated to measure microbiome diversity and allow for microbial community profiling. Using a combination of parametric and non-parametric modelling, significant hybrid-cross and sire were found on the gut microbiome at the juvenile saltwater stage, respectively indicative of population and additive genetic effects. Further, significant maternal effects were found on the surface of eyed eggs. Although no correlations were found between the ovarian fluid and the eyed eggs, a surprising and significant similarity was found between the microbiomes of the dam-sourced ovarian fluid and hindgut samples. Together, the findings presented in this thesis contribute to the characterization of the genetic architecture underlying microbiome variation in Chinook salmon and to its adaptive potential. The results presented in this thesis will have critical consequences for fisheries and conservation efforts and lead the way to exciting microbiome research with the ultimate goal of selecting for microbiomes associated with improved survivability and performance.

TI  - Soybean Response to Water: Trait Identification and Prediction
SP  - 237
AB  - The rising demand for soybean [Glycine Max (L.) Merrill] taken in consideration with current climatic trends accentuates the importance of improving soybean seed yield response per unit water (WP). To further our understanding of the quantitative WP trait, a multi-omic approach was implemented for improved trait identification and predictive modeling opportunities. Through the evaluation of two recombinant inbred line populations jointly totaling 439 lines subjected to contrasting irrigation treatments, informative agronomic, phenomic, and genomic associations were identified. Across both populations, relationships were identified between lodging at maturity (r = -0.58, H = 0.86), canopy to air temperature differential at the V5 growth stage (r = -0.31, H = 0.39), the SR680 spectral index collected at the R5 growth stage, (r = 0.62, H = 0.39), and a quantitative trait loci at approximately 30 centimorgans on chromosome 19 (r = 0.27) to WP. Through the integration of significant agronomic, phenomic, and genomic traits, predictive models of WP were developed across environments on an entry mean basis (r = 0.72, RMSE = 0.67 kg ha-1 mm-1) and on a per plot basis (r = 0.95, RMSE = 0.39 kg ha-1 mm-1) using machine learning algorithms. Our results highlight the value of integrating multiple dataset types to study and model quantitative traits. Through the application of our findings, soybean breeders can potentially deploy multi-omic selection models in early generation screening stages to increase the rate of genetic gain in relation to soybean WP.

TI  - Daphnia pulicaria Responses to Temperature and Nutrients Stress: What Happens when the Heat Is On?
SP  - 70
AB  - Warming climates have had various consequences on terrestrial and aquatic food webs that are expected to persist. There is evidence suggesting that certain organisms are better equipped to handle changing climates compared to others. Therefore, the purpose of my thesis was to study the adaptability of Daphnia under temperature stress and nutrient limitation. First, to examine the effects of dietary phosphorus limitation and temperature on daphniid life-history and population growth, a series of experiments were conducted in the laboratory. In general, I found that Daphnia body growth rates and life-history traits to food carbon to phosphorus (C:P) ratios change with temperature. Next, I identified a protocol to limit the genomic DNA (gDNA) from ribonucleic acid (RNA) extractions. I found that using a modified phenol-chloroform extraction protocol was the most effective way to remove gDNA from extracted Daphnia RNA samples. Overall, results from this study show that temperature and food quality interactions are more complicated than previously thought. Furthermore, the RNA extraction protocol developed will be useful in future studies examining gene expression responses in Daphnia.

TI  - Establishing a Novel Beneficial Association Using a Nematode-Bacterium Model Through Experimental Evolution
SP  - 156
AB  - Microbes confer many benefits to their hosts, from nutrient provisioning to protection from enemies. These microbial symbioses are ubiquitous in nature, many of which evolved millions of years ago. However, it is unclear how these associations arise. My dissertation explores the roles of environmental and evolutionary contexts in the evolution of novel beneficial associations. I use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the bacterium Bacillus subtilis as a model system to investigate these questions by experimentally evolving them under different conditions. Before experimental evolution, I find that B. subtilis protects C. elegans from heat shock by increasing host fecundity compared to the C. elegans standard diet, E. coli. To examine how B. subtilis influence C. elegans adaptation, I evolve nematodes in the presence or absence of ancestral B. subtilis with or without heat stress. Hosts evolving with ancestral B. subtilis under stress evolve the greatest fitness gain compared to in the absence of heat stress or in the absence of B. subtilis. These results show that association with novel beneficial microbes can help hosts adapt to stress under the right context. To determine how microbial evolutionary history affects host fitness, I passage B. subtilis through ancestral nematodes, in the absence of nematodes, or through co-passaged nematodes. I find that B. subtilis passaged through ancestral hosts evolve to benefit these hosts, but host adaptation is not necessary since bacteria passaged in the absence of hosts also increase host fitness. Finally, because co-passaged bacteria do not improve ancestral host fitness to the same level as bacteria passaged through ancestral hosts, I further investigate co-passaging by examining the fitness of co-passaged hosts. Co-passaged bacteria reduce fitness of their co-passaged hosts but not hosts that evolved with ancestral B. subtilis, suggesting that coevolution may impede the establishment of novel symbioses. By leveraging experimental evolution and a tractable model system, this work illuminates how environmental and evolutionary contexts shape the evolution of host-microbe associations.

TI  - Genetic Adaptation and Speciation in Darwin's Finches and Atlantic Herring
AB  - Natural selection acts on existing genetic variation to drive genetic adaptation of organisms to various ecological niches. Interaction between closely related populations, through processes such as competition and hybridization, may either lead to their divergence or population fusion, which has consequences for adaptation and the formation of species. This thesis aims to use two natural populations, Darwin’s finches and Atlantic herring, as models to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying ecological adaptation and speciation. The ecological adaptation of Darwin’s finches across the Galápagos Islands is primarily reflected by variation in beak morphology. Using whole-genome re-sequencing of all Darwin’s finch species, we discover that a locus, HMGA2, is highly associated with variation in beak size. Data collected before and after a severe drought show that this locus plays a critical role for ecological character displacement in large ground finches Geospiza magnirostris and medium ground finches G. fortis. Genomic islands of divergence refer to genomic regions of elevated divergence when comparing the genomes of closely related taxa. Establishment of these genomic islands can reflect a role in reproductive isolation or be related to ecological adaptation or background selection. Investigating their properties can shed light on how new species evolve. We study the landscape of genomic islands in Darwin’s finches, and find that the most pronounced genomic islands are likely ancient balanced polymorphisms, which govern adaptive variation in beak morphology. Hybridization is increasingly recognized as an important evolutionary process which may lead to speciation. We study two cases of hybridization in Darwin’s finches. In the first case, a new lineage of Darwin’s finches was founded through hybridization between a resident medium ground finch G. fortis and an immigrant Española cactus finch G. conirostris. In the second case, female-biased introgression occurred predominantly from medium ground finches G. fortis to common cactus finches G. scandens. Our genetic analysis on the mosaic genomes of hybrid finches show that non-random mating and natural selection primarily determine the outcome of hybridization. We generate a chromosome-level assembly of the Atlantic herring with a total size of 726 Mb, which coincides with a high-resolution linkage map and an LD-based recombination map. This facilitates the identification of an ~8Mb inversion, which is likely to be associated with ecological adaptation in herring to differences in water temperature. The contiguity of the assembly sorts placement of loci under selection that were identified based on a previous, highly fragmented draft assembly of the herring genome.

TI  - Evolution of a Specialized Herbivore Community: Biogeography, Speciation, and Balancing Selection in North American Deserts
SP  - 106
AB  - The many facets of diversity are an enduring source of fascination for biologists. In my dissertation, I present three case studies exploring how species interactions affect the generation, distribution, and maintenance of biological diversity.My work centers on a guild of specialized herbivores that consume creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) in the warm deserts of North America. The nominal species L. tridentata comprises three insipient species that arose through autopolyploidy (whole genome duplication without hybridization). Speciation by polyploidy can have manifold consequences for plants. One common outcome is that cytotypes (plants of different ploidy level) geographically segregate. Indeed, the diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid cytotypes of creosote bush are parapatrically distributed in the Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mojave Deserts, respectively. A second outcome is that the phenotypic changes accompanying polyploidy alter interactions with other species, including mutualists, competitors, and consumers. My first two chapters consider how the consequences of polyploidy affect the biogeography and genetic divergence of specialized herbivores.In Chapter 1, I surveyed the diversity of gall midges in the genus Asphondylia across the full distribution of creosote bush (>2,300 km extent). I found that many gall species (6/17, including two new species) are specialized on either diploid or polyploid host plants. These species preferentially attack just one host cytotype even where diploid and tetraploid creosote bush commingle. The contact zone between creosote bush cytotypes is thus a biotically-mediated dispersal barrier, irrespective of abiotic factors or physical distance. Because more gall midges species specialize on polyploid host plants than on diploids, the distribution of creosote bush cytotypes structures a gradient in gall midge richness across the North American deserts.I next addressed the hypothesis that adaptation to alternative host plant cytotypes drives reproductive isolation between herbivore populations. In Chapter 2, my investigation focused on two ecologically similar herbivores, the creosote bush grasshopper (Bootettix argentatus) and the creosote bush katydid (Insara covilleae). I first used RADcap sequencing to genotype hundreds of individuals from across the full distribution of each species. I then inferred range-wide population structure and modeled spatial variation in gene flow across the species’ range. To discern the relative role of ecology vs. geography in structuring insect populations, I then compared regions of reduced gene flow to physical barriers as well as creosote bush contact zones. My findings differed markedly between species. Bootettix comprises three major lineages, each associated with a different creosote bush cytotype. Two Bootettix lineages meet in a short hybrid zone that is coincident with the contact zone between tetraploid and hexaploid creosote bush, and gene flow was more restricted at this contact zone that across any physical barriers (e.g., mountain ranges, rivers). In contrast, Insara shows minimal population structure across most of its distribution. Although I found moderate subdivision across the Madrean Archipelago, evidence for host-associated genetic divergence was weak. This work shows that there are not necessarily uniform effects of host plant polyploidy even on ecologically similar herbivores.In Chapter 3, I consider the forces that maintain adaptive genetic and phenotypic variation within populations. Two discrete color morphs of the desert clicker grasshopper (Ligurotettix coquilletti) coexist across the species’ range: a uniform morph with homogeneous color, and a banded morph with strong light-dark contrast. This patterning likely affects the efficacy of crypsis to avoid predation, raising the question of why polymorphism persists, and why the proportion of each morph varies across sites. One possibility lies in life history differences between sexes: while territorial males are exposed to predation only on creosote bush stems, females are most vulnerable while laying eggs on the ground. I hypothesized that selection may thus favor different cryptic phenotypes in each sex (sexually antagonistic selection), thereby maintaining crypsis polymorphism within populations. With quantitative analysis of crypsis and the visual environments used by male and female grasshoppers, I found that different phenotypes are favored in each sex. I then used RADcap sequencing and association mapping to identify a single autosomal locus strongly associated with pattern polymorphism. Surprisingly, the divergent alleles at this locus are also found in a sister species, suggesting that sexually antagonistic selection may preserve ancient genetic variation.

TI  - Assessing Migrations and Habitat Connectivity for Two Anadromous Species Following a Major Restoration Effort in the Penobscot River, Maine
SP  - 149
AB  - The construction of industrial dams across major rivers in New England began in the early 1800s with textile mills in Massachusetts. Because of its legacy of mill dams and log driving dams, New England has the highest density of dams anywhere in North America, averaging one dam for every 44 km2 of drainage area. By the early 1900s, these dams drastically limited migrations by diadromous fishes, resulting in declines in populations of migratory fishes, including Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and American shad Alosa sapidissima. Since that time, different fishway designs and river management plans have been tried around the region in an attempt to balance hydropower generation, water storage, flood control, and fish passage.The Penobscot River, in Maine, USA, is the second largest river in New England, with a drainage area of 22,000 km2 , and presents an ideal opportunity for understanding fish passage and migratory movements in a heavily-modified river system. Historically, the river contained runs of eleven species of diadromous fishes including alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, American shad, blueback herring A. aestivalis, Atlantic salmon, sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, American eel Anguilla rostrata, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, Atlantic tomcod Microgadus tomcod, striped bass Morone saxatilis, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus, and Shortnose Sturgeon A. brevirostrum, many of which supported subsistence and commercial fisheries prior to dam construction. The Penobscot River Restoration project (initiated in 2004), decommissioned three hydroelectric dams, upgraded fish passage at four dams, and increased generation capacity at three dams, theoretically opening much of the watershed to migratory fishes. We used a combination of telemetry methods, historic data, and modeling to assess the potential for fishways to select for certain traits with enough power to cause evolutionary change in migratory fish populations and evaluate the ability of migratory fish to use newly available habitat in the Penobscot River watershed.The primary fishway design used in New England for many years was the Denil fishway, which uses angled baffles to reduce water velocity while maintaining high volume and thus, high attraction flow. In order to reach their spawning grounds in the headwaters of the Penobscot River watershed, in-migrating Atlantic salmon have had to navigate between five and seven (mostly Denil) fishways at different dams. Six years of PIT telemetry data were used to evaluate passage success at fishways on the second, third, and fourth dams in the system (Great Works Dam, Milford Dam, and either Howland Dam or West Enfield Dam, depending on path choice) as a function of water temperature, flow, migratory timing, and fish length. At the lower two fishways (Great Works and Milford Dams), fish length was a significant predictor of passage success, with a 91‐cm salmon 21%–27% and 12%–16% less likely to pass than a 45‐cm salmon, at Great Works and Milford Dams, respectively. Additionally, we analyzed thirty-four years of escapement data and found that the slow-maturing and iteroparous individuals that represented the largest salmon size classes were essentially lost from the population during that time, and that Penobscot River fish have shorter fork lengths at maturity (45 – 91 cm) than Atlantic salmon in undammed systems (45 – 110 cm).

TI  - Effects of Temperature on Ecology, Behavior, and Physiology in Desert-Dwelling Jumping Spiders
SP  - 83
AB  - Temperature affects ectotherms in a variety of ways that are critical to fitness. This work focuses on how temperature impacts the behavior, physiology, species distribution, and ecology of jumping spiders to better understand their evolution and natural history. As my study system, I used spiders in the genus Habronattus, mostly H. clypeatus. I chose to study these animals because they live in the desert, an extremely thermally-variable habitat. Habronattus are also ecologically-important mid-level predators and have striking complex courtship signals.My first chapter assessed how temperature influences sexual behavior. Temperature has been known to affect behavior in different ectotherm species. The effects on sexual behavior can be especially complex, as different sexes may be affected differently by temperature. I examined this in Habronattus clypeatus. In this species, males court females using visual and vibratory signals. I tested whether key intersexual behaviors would change with temperature in similar, predictable ways across males and females. I first measured temperature and apparent activity of individuals in H. clypeatus habitat across the day. I found that H. clypeatus are active across a wide range of temperatures (11-56 °C) and are most active at times of day when temperature ranges from 13-46 °C. Next, I performed mating experiments across behaviorally relevant temperatures. Females were more likely to allow males to progress to later stages of courtship and had higher mating rates at higher temperatures. Male visual and vibratory courtship behaviors generally became faster, higher-pitched and lower in amplitude at higher temperatures. This relationship between temperature and signal aspects generally attained a roughly curvilinear shape, with an asymptote around 40 °C. Intriguingly, mating rates in the lab were highest at temperatures potentially above those during peak spider activity in the field. My results suggest that temperature’s effects on behavior are complex and can affect males and females differently. This work emphasizes that understanding temperature effects on mating is critical to understanding sexual selection patterns particularly in species which use complex signals.There is evidence of environmental temperature influencing species distributions. However, despite the importance of a broad understanding of an animal’s thermal biology, few studies incorporate more than one of these metrics of thermal biology. I explored how temperature influences species distributions in six different species of Habronattus distributed along an elevational cline. I measured several different aspects of their thermal biology including thermal limits (CTmin, CTmax), thermal preference, V̇CO2 as proxy for metabolic rate, locomotor behavior, and warming tolerance. I used these data to test whether thermal biology helped explain how species were distributed across elevation. Habronattus had very high CTmax values (~ 52°C), which did not differ among species across the elevational gradient. The highest-elevation species had a lower CTmin than any other species. All species had a strong thermal preference around 37°C. With respect to performance, one of the middle elevation species was significantly less temperature-sensitive in metabolic rate. Differences between species with respect to locomotion (jump distance) were likely driven by differences in mass, with no differences in thermal performance across elevation. I suggest that Habronattus distributions follow Brett’s Rule, a macrophysiological principle that predicts more geographical variation in cold tolerance than heat. Additionally, I suggest that physiological tolerances interact with biotic factors, particularly those related to courtship and mate choice to influence species distributions. Habronattus also had very high warming tolerance values (<20°C, on average). Taken together, these data suggest that Habronattus are resilient in the face of climate-change related shifts in temperature.The most common studies of thermal biology are undertaken with lab experiments. Far less work has been done to understand natural thermal environments, particularly on the spatial and temporal scales relevant to the animal in question. In my final chapter, I sought to put into context the various laboratory measurements I had taken in the previous two chapters, specifically for H. clypeatus. I conducted a study to assess (1) the variability of thermal environments, (2) the ability of animals to thermoregulate and (3) substrate usage. I used a number of thermal ecology methods, including focal observations and a variety of different habitat temperature measurements (thermal cameras, ambient temperature loggers, and operative temperature models). I first found that males and females differed in their thermal preferences in the lab. Although spiders were able to thermoregulate remarkably well in the field, the differences between males and females disappeared. I suggest that this is primarily because males search for and follow females through the habitat, and females therefore decide where courtship occurs. This was corroborated by data that showed that adult makes move farther than any other age-sex class. Spider thermal habitats are also extremely thermally variable. This is mostly due to variability in substrates, rather than air temperature. Spiders also used these substrates in non-random ways. This could have important implications for thermoregulation and mate choice. Behavioral differences between the sexes hint at additional potential for conflict between the sexes. Females are active earlier in the day than males. These earlier times correspond to habitat temperatures at which females are less receptive. We also found that males spent more time hiding, which possibly relates to tradeoffs associated with greater activity and exposure to predators. Overall, this chapter study suggests that habitat temperature interacts with animals in complex ways, providing the potential for tradeoffs that could be under selection. Understanding thermal biology in the context of natural environments is therefore key to gaining a wholistic view of how animals interact with temperature.Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of an integrative view of thermal biology. Temperature affects animals on many different levels, and one must reach across disciplines to gain the full picture. These studies also suggest that temperatures’ effects can be subtle. Attention to detail is key, and one must have a thorough understanding of the habitats in which animals live in order to understand how selection acts. In this way, we can make predictions about how individuals, populations, and species might respond in response to changes in climate.

TI  - The Influence of Incubation Temperature on Development, Morphology, and Behavior in the Wolf Spider, Hogna antelucana
SP  - 111
AB  - Temperature is a major environmental factor shaping offspring phenotype in ectotherms. The temperatures experienced during development can influence a suite of life history and behavioral traits, including developmental time, size, growth rate, locomotor performance and survival. Consequently, phenotypic variation caused by the thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development may have a direct impact on fitness. This dissertation investigates how incubation temperature impacts life history and behavior in the wolf spider, Hogna antelucana. Female wolf spiders carry their egg sacs throughout the incubation period, which allows them to move developing embryos between different thermal conditions. First, I investigate temperature preference and movement behavior of brooding and non-brooding females to determine whether reproductive state influences thermoregulatory behavior. I find that brooding females thermoregulate with greater precision and at lower average temperatures than non-brooding females. Brooding females also move more and have longer movement bouts compared to non-brooding females. Second, I examine whether incubation temperature affects offspring survival and developmental rate. I find that spiders incubated at cooler temperatures had high survival rates through the egg stage but lower survival rates across all other stages examined. Spiders incubated at cooler temperatures also took longer to complete the egg and post-embryonic stages, but survivors subsequently took the same amount of time to reach maturity as those incubated at warm temperatures. Upon reaching maturity, female spiders incubated at cooler temperatures survived fewer days after reaching maturity. Third, I explore whether incubation temperature affects morphology and sprint performance in H. antelucana. I find that spiders incubated at warmer temperatures are larger, and larger spiders are faster than smaller conspecifics at the fifth instar. However, females that survived to adulthood did not exhibit any size differences at maturity, and those incubated at cooler temperatures were faster than those incubated at warm temperatures. I conclude that incubation temperature impacts both life history and behavioral traits throughout the life of H. antelucana. My observations suggest that cooler incubation temperatures negatively impact survival, growth rate, longevity, size, and behavior. My findings support the hypothesis that wolf spiders carry egg sacs to preferentially select temperatures for optimal egg development.

TI  - Long-Term Evolution of the Complex Eukaryote Tetrahymena Thermophila
SP  - 95
AB  - Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand what factors affect the rate and repeatability of adaptive outcomes. To better understand the role of temperature in determining adaptive trajectories, we evolved populations of different genotypes, including populations that just had sex and populations that hadn’t, of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila at two temperatures and followed changes in growth rate over 1000s of generations. As expected, growth rate increased with a decelerating rate for all populations; however, there were differences in the patterns of evolution at warmer and colder temperatures. Initial differences in growth rates between the genotypes decreased as evolution proceeded at both temperatures, but this convergence was quicker at the higher temperature. Likewise, we found greater repeatability of evolution among replicate populations of the same genotype at the higher temperature. We also found no evidence of trade-offs in fitness between temperatures, but did observe asymmetry in the correlated responses, whereby evolution in a warmer temperature increases growth rate at the lower temperature significantly more than the reverse. We also find the populations founded from a single newly produced sexual progeny are more evolvable than their parents who have not had sex in many generations. These results demonstrate the importance of genotype and the environment in determining evolutionary trajectories.

TI  - The Evolution of Sex Determination Mechanisms and Sex Chromosomes in House Fly, Musca domestica L
SP  - 123
AB  - Sex determination (SD) evolves fast, often due to changes in master regulatory SD genes. SD genes are found on sex chromosomes, and evolution of SD can also drive evolutionary turnover of sex chromosomes. As a consequence, young (proto) sex chromosomes are generated, in which the X and Y are minimally diverged from each other. Multiple young sex chromosomes can coexist in species with multiple (polygenic) SD master regulators. Species with polygenic SD are informative of the factors driving the early evolution of sex chromosomes. The house fly, Musca domestica, is a well-suited model to those ends because natural populations have polygenic SD and young sex chromosomes. Natural selection appears to maintain polygenic SD, but the targets of selection are elusive. To address this, I examined the effects of two house fly proto-Y chromosomes (YM and IIIM) on gene expression. I find that the proto-Y chromosomes have minor effects on gene expression, which is paradoxical given that natural selection likely maintains polygenic SD in house fly. I identified evidence for disproportionate effects of the proto-Y chromosomes on sex-biased expression. These few expression differences could be targets upon which natural selection acts to maintain polygenic SD. The frequencies of YM and IIIM vary along latitudinal clines, and I tested whether temperature could explain these clines by examining the expression of SD pathway genes at different developmental temperatures. I did not find differences in expression of the sex-determining genes between YM and IIIM males consistent with the clines. I also found that one house fly proto-Y chromosome is differentiated from its homologous proto-X in the sequences of many genes, but gene expression divergence between the proto-X and proto-Y is limited to a subset of genes. This suggests that subtle gene expression differentiation constitutes the earliest stages of X-Y differentiation. Lastly, I tried constructing a stable line that has females carrying the dominant female-determining Md-traD allele. In this line, all females and males would carry two copies of IIIM. However, I could not create a stable line because males homozygous for IIIM could have low fitness or deleterious effects.

TI  - Development and Application of Coupled K-Feldspar Pb Isotopic and 40Ar/39Ar Methods to Reconstruct Late Cretaceous/Cenozoic Deformation of the California Margin
SP  - 479
AB  - The evolving plate boundary along the California margin over the last 100 m.y. has dramatically impacted the geologic evolution of the western United States. Laramide flat-slab subduction extinguished Sierra Nevada arc magmatism as trench-derived sediments (i.e., Rand and related schists) were underthrust and accreted at 25-30 km depth beneath the southernmost Sierra Nevada and NW Mojave Desert (SSN/MD) during the Late Cretaceous. During this time, the southern California forearc margin was severely disrupted. Breachment of the mid-Cretaceous batholith in the southern California region ultimately permitted depositional systems to extend eastward and permit extraregional sediment from the continental interior to reach the margin during the Eocene. Subsequently, between 30-25 Ma, the North American and Pacific plate boundary was established. The resulting development of a northwest-propagating transform margin produced "slab gaps" beneath the SSN/MD that triggered mantle upwelling, volcanism, and extension of the crust.Each of these significant changes has imprinted a thermal history record in the SSN/MD crust that can be interrogated through integrated detrital and basement thermochronology. Modal detrital phases such as K-feldspar can yield significant thermal history and provenance information but have been under-utilized. The beneﬁts of using K-feldspar in detrital studies are twofold: K-feldspar 40Ar/39Ar has shown promise as both a basement and detrital thermochronometer. Moreover, its propensity to incorporate common Pb into its crystal structure allows its Pb isotope composition to be used as a provenance tool. The well-established extreme variation in Pb isotopic values and thermal fingerprints of tectonic processes across the western United States can be exploited to reconstructing the southern California margin.In this dissertation, I develop and apply basement and detrital K-feldspar coupled 40Ar/39Ar and Pb isotopic analysis to evaluate the Late Cretaceous/Cenozoic evolution of the California margin. In Chapter 1, I demonstrate viability of K-feldspar coupled 40Ar/39Ar and Pb isotopic analysis by quantitatively investigating the eﬀects of laser fusion during 40Ar/39Ar analyses of K-feldspar upon subsequent LA-ICP-MS measurement of Pb isotopic ratios. I also show the feasibility of using LA-ICP-MS to generate statistically significant datasets. In Chapter 2, I describe how I have developed a regionally extensive database of new Pb isotopic values in K-feldspar for the southwestern United States basement. I furthermore evaluate the utility of this database by demonstrating how it can be applied to evaluate paleodrainage evolution during the early Eocene to early Miocene along the SSN/MD margin. In Chapter 3, I develop a database of new 40Ar/39Ar thermal history results from mid-Cretaceous plutonic rocks throughout the SSN/MD region. I also develop single-crystal incremental heating methods to detrital K-feldspar from derivative Eocene-Miocene strata. Coupled interpretation of the basement and detrital results is used to assess the Late Cretaceous thermal evolution of the SSN/MD region. Collectively, these results constrain the magnitude and timing of Laramide subduction refrigeration of the southern California margin. Unimodal and identical detrital K-feldspar age distributions and thermal histories from the forearc strata confirm subduction refrigeration extended into the shallow crust and affected a broad region of the Mojave Desert province. Final exhumation of the deepest rocks in the western Mojave in the early Miocene was ultimately due to northwestward migration of the Mendocino triple junction along the California margin.Collectively, these case studies demonstrate how these new analytical and interpretative methods can be profitably applied to future regional deformation and tectonically driven re-organization of drainage patterns.

TI  - Interactions among Life History, Physiology, and Temperature in Zooplankton
SP  - 222
AB  - Life history traits determine the growth, reproduction, and persistence of populations via changes in organismal fitness. How life history trait evolution and plasticity will respond to global change, specifically to increases in temperature, is an emerging area of research that involves scaling individual organismal physiology to the population level. However, changes in populations also affect species interactions at community and ecosystem levels. Integrating across these scales of biological organization reveals important connections for the generation, maintenance, and consequences of biodiversity. In this dissertation, I explored how interactions among life history, physiology, and temperature affect two dominant zooplankton groups, Daphnia and Epischura and the subsequent effects they have for population, community, and ecosystem ecology.First, I examined the evolution of life history traits and their thermal plasticity in Daphnia by taking a phylogenetic approach to separate the respective contributions of lineage-specific (phylogeny) and latitudinal (climate) constraints. The mode of evolution among life history traits varied but the thermal response in life history traits most often followed a random walk model of evolution (Brownian motion). I compared species-level to population-level data to further understand the effects of local environment. Daphnia life history traits did not exhibit a strong species-specific signal but are ecogeographically distinct, underscoring that Daphnia life history evolution should be understood at the population-level rather than the species-level.Second, I tested the ability of RNA:DNA ratios to predict juvenile and population growth rates in Daphnia. I used common gardens in the laboratory to explore the predictive power of RNA:DNA ratios to explain the variation in growth rates across temperature and resource availability gradients. I then tested for correlations between RNA:DNA ratios and ecosystem metabolism in situ. RNA:DNA ratio has limited utility as a life history proxy for Daphnia and its usefulness for capturing ecological phenomena needs further exploration.Third, I combined empirical and theoretical approaches to examine the interactions between invasive species and climate change in Lake Baikal. I collected current species assemblage and abiotic data from Chivyrkuy Bay where nonnative Daphnia longispina has established yet remained locally-contained. D. longispina potentially poses a hazard to Lake Baikal’s fragile ecosystem of endemics, particularly Epischura baikalensis, a critically threatened dominant zooplankter. I parameterized and tested several models with combinations of temperature, dispersal, and competition estimates from Lake Baikal. Temperature and dispersal currently constrain D. longispina to Chivyrkuy Bay. I then used water temperature increase projections to predict future species assemblages and critical thermal points that allow D. longispina to invade Lake Baikal’s main basin. In the next century, D. longispina will invade Lake Baikal’s main basin and, if temperature increases by 8 °C, may completely supplant E. baikalensis.Fourth, I combined molecular genetics and continuous, quantitative morphological data to reveal the evolutionary history of the Epischura (Copepoda: Calanoida), a species-depauperate lineage of conservation concern. I generated the first time-calibrated, molecular phylogeny for Epischura by sequencing three ribosomal DNA loci for the entire genus. I combined the molecular data with in-depth measurements of the mandibles of each species to aid in the placement of a recently extinct species, Epischura massachusettsensis. Epischura is a paraphyletic group; the North American species diverged from the Eastern Siberian species around the late-Miocene cooling events. I proposed the resurrection of Epischurella (Smirnov 1936) to describe the Eastern Siberian copepod species.

TI  - Efeito das Altas Temperaturas de Verão Observadas no pólo de Conservação da Videira de Pegões Sobre a Concentração do Vírus do Enrolamento Foliar da Videira Tipo 3 (GLRaV3) em seis Castas
SP  - 58
AB  - A vinha pode ser alvo de várias pragas e doenças parasitárias, entre elas diversas viroses. Atualmente, estão identificados vários vírus responsáveis por algumas dessas patologias da videira embora apenas alguns afetem a sua produtividade, maturação e longevidade. A doença do enrolamento foliar da videira é a virose que está mais expandida pelas vinhas portuguesas, sendo Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV3) o mais difundido.Em Pegões está o Pólo de Conservação da Diversidade da Videira da Associação Portuguesa para a Diversidade da Videira (PORVID), associação esta responsável pela seleção clonal das videiras em Portugal. Alguns clones localizados nesse Pólo Experimental foram testados por ELISA em 2013 para o GLRaV-3 tendo resultados positivos. Nos anos seguintes os mesmos clones não manifestaram sintomas, pelo que com este estudo pretende-se analisar se essas videiras continuam infetadas por GLRaV3 de modo a verificar se as elevadas temperaturas de verão na região influenciam a presença do vírus na planta e respetiva manifestação dos sintomas da doença.No verão de 2017 fez-se acompanhamento visual dos sintomas das plantas de vários clones em seis castas e, em Setembro, fez-se a recolha das amostras e os testes ELISA de modo a analisar a concentração de GLRaV-3. Após a análise dos resultados mostrou-se conveniente fazer uma nova visita ao campo experimental em Pegões e tiraram-se novas fotografias a alguns clones estudados. Foi feito um estudo comparativo entre os resultados obtidos nos testes ELISA realizados em 2013 e em 2017, bem como entre os resultados de 2017 e a situação sintomática observada.Os resultados evidenciaram a existência de plantas isentas de GLRaV-3 em 2017 que, no entanto, estavam infetadas por este vírus em 2013. Nas plantas que continuaram positivas também houve várias situações em que os sintomas não se manifestaram, apesar da infeção pelo GLRaV-3 permanecer. Estes parâmetros sugerem que as temperaturas elevadas durante o verão em Pegões possam inativar ou até eliminar o vírus.Alternate abstract:Vineyards are the target to many pests and parasitic diseases, among them several viruses. There are currently identified several viruses responsible for some of these grapevine pathologies, although only a few affect their productivity, maturation, and longevity. The grapevine leafroll disease is the most expanded virus in the portuguese vines, being Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) the most widespread.In Pegões is located the Pole of Conservation of the Vineyard of the “Associação Portuguesa para a Diversidade da Videira” (PORVID), which is responsible for the clonal selection of grapevine in Portugal. Some of the clones in this experimental pole were submitted to ELISA in 2013 for the GLRaV-3 with positive results for the virus. During the following years the same clones showed no symptoms, so this study intends to analyze if these vines are still infected with GLRaV-3 in order to verify if the high summer temperatures in the region influence the presence of the virus in the plant and the manifestation of the disease symptoms.In the summer of 2017, plant symptoms were visually monitored in several clones from six grapevine varieties and, in September, the samples collected and ELISA tests for GLRaV-3 were carried out. After the analysis of the results, it was convenient to make a new visit to the experimental field in Pegões and new photos were taken to some studied clones. A comparative study was carried out between the results obtained in ELISA tests performed in 2013 and in 2017, as well as, between the results of 2017 and the symptomatic situation observed.The results showed the existence of GLRaV-3-free plants in 2017 that, however, were infected by this virus in 2013. In the plants that remained positive there were also several cases in which the symptoms were not present, although the GLRaV-3 infection still remains. These parameters suggest that summer temperatures in Pegões can inactivate or even eliminate the virus.

TI  - Energy Storage in Wind Farms
SP  - 97
AB  - In wind farms, due to the intermittency of the resource and to the fact that most wind parks have an installed power superior to the maximum power injectable into the grid, there is the need of curtailment, leading to resource and economic losses. Allied to these factors, in the future, wind generation should participate in the wholesale electricity market, being crucial the capacity to limit the generation in periods of low market price and to concentrate it in periods of higher price. In order to solve these issues, the use of energy storage systems is essential to store the power that otherwise would be wasted and to obtain a higher income to the wind farm. In this way, there is a need to develop algorithms able to correctly manage the energy storage system and also the wind resource.The main objective of this dissertation was to analyze the impact of an energy storage system, based on batteries, in wind farms. For such purpose, a management system for a wind farm with energy storage was designed. In order to ensure it, two management algorithms developed in MatLab environment were implemented, one with the objective of reducing wind power curtailment and the other, maintaining the curtailment as a priority, but also with the objective of maximizing the economic income of the wind park.The algorithms were tested and simulated for different scenarios and generation profiles and through the developed technical and economic analysis it was possible to verify the system viability. With the developed algorithms it was possible to reduce wind power curtailment and to increase the economic impacts of wind farms.Alternate abstract:Nos parques eólicos, devido à intermitência do recurso e ao facto de que, na sua maioria, possuem uma potência instalada superior à máxima potência injetável na rede, surge a necessidade de curtailment, resultando assim em desperdícios de geração e em perdas económicas. Para além de estes fatores, futuramente os parques eólicos serão renumerados em regime de mercado, sendo então crucial limitar a geração em períodos de preço baixo e concentrar a geração em períodos de preço elevado. De forma a resolver estes problemas, o uso de sistemas de armazenamento é essencial, para assim, armazenar a geração, que de outra forma seria desperdiçada e ao mesmo tempo aumentar o lucro do parque. Surge então a necessidade de desenvolver algoritmos capazes de fazerem a gestão correta, não só do sistema de armazenamento, mas também do recurso eólico.O principal objetivo desta dissertação foi analisar o impacto de um sistema de armazenamento de energia elétrica composto por baterias em parques eólicos. Para tal, foi desenvolvido um sistema de gestão de um parque eólico com armazenamento de energia. Com esse intuito, foram desenvolvidos dois algoritmos em ambiente MatLab, um com o objetivo de reduzir curtailment e outro, mantendo a redução do curtailment como prioridade, com o objetivo de maximizar o lucro do parque eólico.Ambos os algoritmos foram simulados e analisados em diferentes cenários e para diferentes níveis de geração, através da análise técnico-económica realizada foi possível verificar a viabilidade do sistema. Com os algoritmos desenvolvidos foi possível reduzir o curtailment assim como aumentar o impacto económico em parques eólicos.

TI  - Salinization of Freshwater Coastal Ecosystems: Possible Impacts on the Genetic Diversity of Zooplankton Populations
SP  - 56
AB  - As previsões feitas no âmbito das alterações climáticas, apontam para a ocorrência do aumento do nível médio da água do mar e o aumento da frequência de eventos extremos (ex. secas prolongadas). Associado a estes eventos é expectável que ocorram intrusões de água do mar em regiões costeiras, nomeadamente sistemas aquáticos costeiros dulçaquícolas, provocando a sua salinização. Este aumento de salinidade pode comprometer a resiliência do biota que habita estas regiões. De facto, já foram publicados vários estudos que reportam os efeitos provocados por aumentos na salinidade quer a nível sub-individual que individual. No entanto, poucos são os trabalhos que avaliaram os efeitos de salinização na diversidade genética de populações de organismos dulçaquícolas. Sabe-se que a diversidade genética é um componente chave para as populações poderem lidar com perturbações ambientais. Deste modo, se uma exposição a salinização provocar um decréscimo na diversidade genética (por exemplo, através do morte dos gentótipos mais sensíveis) irá também causar uma diminuição na plasticidade evolutiva e resiliência dessa população a perturbação ambientais futuras. De acordo com o exposto, o presente trabalhado pretendeu compreender os efeitos de salinização na diversidade genética de populações do cladócero Daphnia lonhispinae do rotífero Brachionus calyciflorus, sob a influência de diferentes temperaturas. Para atingir este objectivo foram selecionadas seis linhagens clonais de D. longispina e seis linhagens clonais de,B. calyciflorus com diferentes sensibilidades letais a salinização. Cada linhagem clonal foi exposta a um controlo (ASTM) e ao valor de conductividade correspondente ao LC70,48h para D. longispina e ao LC70,24h para B. calyciflorus. A exposição e cada um destes dois tratamentos decorreu 17, 20 e 23ºC. A densidade populacional foi monitorizada diariamente durante todo o período de exposição. Baixos níveis de salinidade (4.8 to 9.7 mS/cm, comparativamente a valores de conductividade da água do mar de aprox. 35 mS/cm) provoracam reduções significativas na densidade populacional das diferentes linhagens clonais após curtos períodos de exposição, provocando a extinção de algumas das linhagens após longos períodos de exposição. As temperaturas extremas de 17ºC e 23ºC induziram efeitos mais intensos na densidade populacional que a temperatura de 20ºC. Verificou-se ainda uma alteração na ordem de sensibilidade entre as linhagens clonais quando comparando respostas a períodos de curta ou longa duração de exposição. Estes resultados e as suas consequências a nível populacional são discutidos no âmbito da hipótese de erosão devida a selecção natural.Alternate abstract:Under the context of climate changes, it is forsee a global sea level rise and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Associated with such events (namely sea level rise and periods of intense drought) it is expected to occur the intrusion of seawater into coastal lowlying freshwater ecosystems, causing its salinization. Such salinization may compromise the resilience of natural populations inhabiting these coastal regions. Actually, several studies already reported adverse effects at sub-individual and individual level caused by exposure to increased salinity, but, only a few addressed the effects that salinization may cause in the genetic diversity of freshwater biota. Genetic diversity is a key for populations to be able to cope with environmental changes. Thus, if exposure to salinization leads to a decrease of a population’s genetic diversity (e.g. through the death of the most sensitive genotypes), it will as well reduce the population’s evolutionary plasticity and resilience under future perturbations. Accordingly with the mentioned previously, this work intended to understand the effects of salinization on the genetic diversity of populations of the cladoceran Daphnia longispina and rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, under different temperature regimes. For this, six lineages of D. longispina and six lineages of B. calciflorus, differing in their lethal sensitivity to salinity were selected. Lab-populations of each clonal lineage were maintained under optimal conditions until reaching a steady state. At this point, they were exposed to low salinity levels (corresponding to the LC70,48h and LC70,24h, respectively for the most toleranbt clonal lineage of D. longispina and B. calyciflorus) at 17, 20 or 23ºC, for at least 30 days. The population densities were monitored every day until the end of the experiment. Low levels of salinization (4.8 to 9.7 mS/cm, when comparing with conductivities of seawater approx. 35 mS/cm) affected survival and reproduction of the two tested species, leading to the extirpation of some genotypes after long-term exposures. Different ranks of sensitivity were observed for clonal lineages when comparing short-term and long-term responses,most probably due to acclimation-driven population recovery. Extreme temperatures (17oC and 23oC) induce negetive effct of salinity on genetic diversity of zooplankton.These results and its consequences at the population level are discussed in light of the genetic erosion hypothesis, through natural selection (due to small within genotype variability).

TI  - Preparation and Performance of Novel CaO-Based Sorbents for High-Temperature CO2 Removal
AB  - Sorption-Enhanced Steam Reforming process (SESR) is an auspicious technology for hydrogen (H2) production with simultaneous capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) derived from design modifications performed on the conventional Steam Reforming Process (SRP). Enhancing the reforming reaction in terms of kinetics, yield and purity through capturing in situ CO2 using high temperature solid sorbents brings advantages including reduction in energy requirements and lower investment capital. Even though SESR is a cost-effective route for energy generation based on organic volatile and gaseous feedstock including natural gas, its implementation implies overcoming challenges. Diminishing the sintering in CaO-based CO2 sorbents has become one of these challenges since the reactivity of these captors decreases significantly as the number of carbonation/calcination cycles proceeds. This research work centres its efforts in the development of novel sintering resistant CaO-based CO2 sorbents enhanced by means of the incorporation of a refractory, high surface area, polycrystalline fibrous support (Saffil), with high-Al2O3 content, acting as structural stabilizer of CaO. Four families of CaO-based CO2 sorbents were prepared using wet impregnation and precipitation methods. Different variants such as CaO precursor, precipitant agents, pH, stirring, aging time, etc. were tested to optimize the synthesis parameters. The best preparation conditions were aimed at achieving a homogeneous deposition of CaO over the Saffil support as well as a morphology in CaO that might improve the durability of CO2 acceptors. In particular, the formation of nanoflakes, and particles with an octahedral shape were found to be two of the most promising morphologies. Upon the determination of optimal synthesis parameters, the as-prepared CO2 sorbents were characterized in order to determine their physicochemical properties such as textural features (surface area and pore size distribution - N2 physisorption), real CaO content (XRF), dispersion of CaO over Saffil supports (SEM-EDX), phase identification (XRD), etc. Carrying capacities and durability of CaO-based CO2 sorbents were assessed through multicycle carbonation/decarbonation tests under controlled conditions such as temperature and atmosphere. The dynamic/isothermal experiments conducted in a TGA system confirm an enhancement in reactivity when CaO grows over the periphery of the Saffil support. In addition to the use of a support, achieving a 'clamping effect' (to diminish lateral mobility of CaO, thus avoiding particle densification), in conjunction with the morphology adopted by CaO, is shown to provide thermal stability. SEM-EDX techniques applied on used CaO-based sorbents (30 carbonation-calcination cycles) corroborate that the enhancement in durability is due to the outstanding sintering resistance exhibited when CaO adopted the nanoflake or octahedral structure. The viability of the as-prepared sorbents was also confirmed through a kinetic study in which kinetic parameters and mechanisms associated with both carbonation and calcination reactions were estimated. Concerning the CO2 uptake kinetics, the isothermal method was used to collect mass change data whilst model-based equations were employed to elucidate the kinetic triplet. For the calcination reaction, the kinetic study was performed using both isothermal and non-isothermal methods. Activation energies assessed for the carbonation and calcination reactions were compared among them and also in relation with other CaO-based sorbents available in the literature for reliability purposes.

TI  - The North Atlantic Ocean : a Force for Change at Earth's Greenhouse-Icehouse Transition
AB  - Earth’s landmark greenhouse-icehouse transition at the Eocene Oligocene Transition (EOT) is arguably one of the most important climatic events in geological history. The dominant global geochemical signature of this dramatic shift in Earth’s climate (approximately 33.7 million years ago), a 1.2 - 1.5%o increase in the stable oxygen isotope ratio (d18O) of benthic foraminifera, represents a significant period of global cooling that occurred contemporaneously with the initiation of widespread Antarctic glaciation. The EOT represents the first establishment of a widespread, continental-scale, somewhat stable ice sheet on Antarctica and yet significant debate remains as to the forcing mechanism responsible for this substantial perturbation marking the end of the Eocene greenhouse world. Initiation of the step-wise shift in d18O occurred during an interval of low eccentricity and low-amplitude change in obliquity; an orbital configuration considered the ultimate trigger for glaciation at the EOT and the pacemaker for subsequent ice sheet growth. However, some other forcing mechanism(s) must have been important in conditioning the climate leading up to the EOT as these orbital configurations are found at other points in geological history where such large-scale changes in climate are absent. The overall aim of this thesis is to explore the evolution of temperature, ice volume and ocean circulation, the interactions between these key climatic parameters and the relative importance of different forcing and feedback mechanisms across the EOT. This thesis will place particular emphasis on paleoceanographic changes that occurred in the Atlantic Ocean region across this interval and their subsequent impacts. To this end, multiple records of foraminiferal stable isotopes and trace elements, and fish teeth neodymium isotopes are presented from sediment cores largely within the Atlantic Ocean or subject to its influence at the EOT. Findings of this thesis suggest a fascinating link between deep water formation in the North Atlantic Ocean and Antarctic ice sheet dynamics at the EOT. A new highresolution eNd record derived from fossil fish teeth at ODP Site 1263 (Walvis Ridge) in the South Atlantic provides evidence for a significant strengthening of Northern Component Water (NCW), a paleo pre-cursor to North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), at 34.7 Ma one million years prior to the onset of the EOT. The increasing influence of northern-sourced deep waters, and associated cross-hemisphere heat piracy, provided optimal conditions for landmark climate change prior to the occurrence of the orbital parameters considered to be the ultimate trigger of the EOT. From this point on, NCW played a significant role in the distribution of heat and salinity within the Atlantic Ocean basin and is likely partly responsible, along with enhanced production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) due to Antarctic glaciation, for the interhemispheric temperature asymmetry documented within this thesis. Benthic foraminiferal Mg/Ca-derived bottom water temperatures from IODP Site U1406 (Newfoundland Sediment Drifts) in the North Atlantic show a much lesser degree of cooling in the high northern latitudes when compared to their southern counterparts; in line with previous evidence from records of sea surface temperature (SST). Benthic foraminiferal trace element data from IODP Site U1406, along with ODP Site 925 (Ceara Rise) in the Equatorial Atlantic, demonstrate a regional, transient excursion in primary productivity that begins coeval with Antarctic glaciation at the EOT. Arctic Ocean continental shelves served as a nutrient-rich source fuelling the III Cardiff University Amy Sparkes productivity pulse in the Atlantic at the EOT when glaciation-induced sea level fall exposed organic-rich shelf sediment nutrients to weathering. This new source of bioavailable nutrients was efficiently distributed through the North Atlantic region by surface water overflows between the Greenland and Norwegian Seas and the North Atlantic causing increased primary productivity and associated export production leading to a steepening of the overall decline in pCO2 and hence acting as a positive feedback on Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) growth. Overall this thesis makes significant strides in clarifying the timeline of key climatic events in the Atlantic Ocean in the lead up to and across the EOT and highlights the importance of the influence of the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic in modulating climate and ocean chemistry at the EOT.

TI  - Competition of Staphylococci as Probe for Novel Antibiotics
SP  - 285
AB  - Staphylococci are frequent members of the human skin microbiome. It was previously determined that Staphylococcus aureus meets widespread antagonism from coagulase-negative staphylococci. Furthermore, cumulative antagonisms by species in the niche correlate with the absence of S. aureus nasal colonisation, supporting collective antagonism trait expression as a barrier. However, genetics factors and adaptive pathways of bacterial interactions remain uncharacterised.Using a two species system, strongly antagonistic inhibitor-producing S. epidermidis B155 was co-cultured with S. aureus SH1000 to identify determinants of competition and resistance using an experimental evolution approach. In the presence of S. epidermidis B155, S. aureus evolved a high relative fitness due to inhibitor resistance after several days of S. epidermidis co-culture. Unexpectedly, rather than known two-component system TCS loci associated with antimicrobial resistance, Illumina platform genome resequencing of S. aureus identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in both sensor kinase (desK) and response regulator (desR) genes that comprise the poorly described DesKR homologous TCS. The DesKR-like TCS system is located in an operon with two genes encoding an ABC transporter with homology to ABC polyketide efflux transporters. Genetic analysis identified that allelic replacement of desK or in-frame deletion of the SAOUHSC_01312 ABC efflux transporter gene decreased survival of S. aureus in competition with S. epidermidis, supporting the transporter as a resistance module. The desK gene mutant revealed reduced growth rate at both low (25°C) and high (42°C) temperatures compared with its parent strain. Gene inactivation of the desKR locus reduced pigment production with both desK and SAOUHSC_01312 mutants expressing less staphyloxanthin.PacBio genome sequencing of S. epidermidis B155 and antiSMASH identified a 55 kb plasmid with a unique polyketide/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster likely encoding the inhibitor of S. aureus growth. This cluster shares considerable sequence homology with a gene cluster encoding a polyketide/NRPS of Streptococcus mutans. Due to the production of this unique antimicrobial, further skin-isolated bacteria were screened for those that inhibit S. aureus SH1000 WT strain but not a desR SNP variant, thereby identifying Bacillus flexus B003. PacBio genome sequencing and antiSMASH identified genome-encoded polyketide synthase and linear azol(in)econtaining peptides (LAP) genes that might have the same mode of action as S. epidermidis B155 or DesKR resistance mechanism.RNAseq was performed to probe the regulon of the S. aureus DesKR-like TCS using WT to compare with the desR SNP variant, plus desK allelic replacement and SAOUHSC_01312 mutants. From this analysis, it was identified that the five genes SAOUHSC_01311-01312-desKR operon and SAOUHSC_01315 were very highly expressed in the desR SNP variant and these five genes are likely to comprise the DesKR-like regulon. Moreover, these data support the central role of this TCS in S. aureus resistance to the S. epidermidis B155 and B. flexus B003 antimicrobials. In contrast, transcriptome analysis of desK and transporter SAOUHSC_01312 mutant strains revealed hundreds of genes were differentially expressed in pathways associated with metabolism, virulence and regulations.The DesKR-like regulon has undefined roles that could be linked to membrane homeostasis and these findings provide significant insights into pathways that impact bacterial growth, resistance and microbial interaction. Ultimately, the TCS and its functions identified here might represent a future target for novel therapeutics targeting S. aureus.

TI  - Sustainable Metal Organic Framework Thin-Films for Medical Sensing Applications
AB  - We spend more and more time indoors, and the monitoring of the concentration of CO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is important to maintain comfort, productivity and health. Furthermore, can the long-time exposure to these compounds lead to medical issues like cancer and nerve damage. The accumulation of CO2 and VOC takes place automatically indoors. CO2 is produced by cellular respiration, while VOCs are often outgassed from e.g. paint or furniture. In order to maintain a comfortable indoor atmosphere without wasting energy by wrong heating or ventilation the real-time monitoring of CO2 and VOC concentrations is needed. Long period grating fibres (LPG) are known to be lightweight and low-cost sensors with extreme short response times, possibly in the microsecond scale, but the non-selective response to various stimuli like strain, temperature and refractive index change is problematic for the creation of a reliable real-time sensor system. The use of metal-organic frameworks(MOFs), a new class of hybrid porous materials with tuneable pore size and chemical properties, might be here able to provide selectivity and sensitivity towards specific target compounds as a thin-film coating on the LPG surface. However, MOFs are in general first prepared as powders, often at elevated temperatures and long reaction times. Furthermore is the transformation of a powder synthesis to a thin-film synthesis not trivial. For this work, two promising MOFs, MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni, have been identified and the possible coating of LPGs was separated into three steps. These are the optimisation of the powder synthesis regarding more sustainable conditions (e.g. shorter reaction times, lower reaction temperature and easier purification of the product), devolving of a thin-film synthesis for glass as support and the application of the most-promising thin-film coating techniques on LPGs. The real-time sensor performance of the MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni coated LPGs towards CO2 and selected VOCs was tested afterwards. In summary, could be especially the powder synthesis for MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni in comparison with the literature protocols be improved. It was possible to greatly reduce the reaction time of MIL-53(Al) from 220°C and 72 h to 150°C and 5 h using the low-weight alcohol methanol as solvent. Furthermore, does the MIL-53(Al) derivate prepared in methanol show porosity directly after the synthesis. A common disadvantage of MIL-53(Al) is that normally a time and energy consuming activation process is needed in order to access the internal porosity. For TIFSIX-3-Ni, the yield could be improved and the reaction time reduced in comparison with the literature protocol using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. For both MIL-53(Al) and TIFSIX-3-Ni new thin-film protocols could be developed for the successful coating of glass surfaces with homogenous and uniform thin-films, but still more research is needed in order to create a reliable and repeatable sensor response of these MOF-coated LPGs.

TI  - Predicting Response of Potato and Barley to Climate Change in Maine Using the Crop Model DSSAT
SP  - 68
AB  - Climate change has the potential to impact yield and yield stability, and thus, sustainability in agriculture. Farmers are confronted seasonally with the challenges and unpredictability weather can bring. Current climate change projections anticipate an overall rise in temperature, precipitation and CO2 for the Northeast with weather increasing in variability in the forms of heatwaves, drought and heavy rain events. Using the computer simulation model DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology), we aimed to assess the vulnerability and potential climate adaptation strategies for potato and barley in Maine. Chapter 1, “Assessing the Vulnerability of Potato and Barley to Climate Change using the Crop Model DSSAT”, encompasses the calibration and evaluation of the crop model DSSAT for two varieties each of potato (an early-season and late-season) and barley (a 2-row variety and 6-row variety) in Maine. The growth and development of each variety was assessed across numerous planting dates under a baseline weather scenario (1989-2018) and four future weather scenarios for 2050-2079, varying by emissions scenario and CO2 concentration. An additional assessment was conducted looking at yield stability under less variable and more variable weather. Following any necessary adjustments, model evaluations found the calibrated model to adequately simulate all four varieties under various management and growing conditions in the state. Subsequent simulations revealed that the late-season variety of potato and the 6-row barley variety may be more stable with climate change in Maine, while the early-season variety of potato may be more vulnerable, particularly with increased weather variability. The late-season variety of potato and both varieties of barley performed best with the earliest possible planting, while the early-season variety of potato performed better with late planting. Crop growth and development improved with climate change and projected elevated CO2 for all four varieties in terms of biomass and final yield. Crop quality could not be evaluated.Chapter 2, “Investigating Soil Health as a Climate Resilience Strategy for Potato and Barley in Maine Using the DSSAT Crop Model”, evaluates adaptive management strategies for potato and barley in Maine. Adaptive management strategies included improved soil health in a manure-based system (amended) and irrigation in a fertilizer-based system, both compared to a conventional fertilizer-based system (nonamended). Here, the model was evaluated for a set of data containing many rotations of potato and barley in a nonamended fertilizer-based system and an amended manure-based system. Following minor changes and a successful evaluation, simulations were conducted using a feasible planting date and the five weather scenarios from Chapter 1. Results found the irrigated system to perform best under all five weather scenarios for potato with the amended system a close second in production performance, while the performance of barley in the amended system was equal to that of the irrigated system. While irrigation may not be the most viable option for all Maine farmers, this study illustrated the importance soil health both now and in the future in improving or maintaining current crop production.

TI  - Genetically Stable Poliovirus Vectors Activate Dendritic Cells and Prime Antitumor CD8 T Cell Immunity
SP  - 136
AB  - Viruses naturally engage innate immunity, induce antigen presentation, and mediate CD8 T cell priming against foreign antigens. Polioviruses can provide a context optimal for generating antigen-specific CD8 T cells, as they have natural tropism for dendritic cells, preeminent inducers of CD8 T cell immunity; elicit Th1-promoting inflammation; and lack interference with innate or adaptive immunity. However, notorious genetic instability and underlying neuropathogenicity has hampered poliovirus-based vector applications. We devised a strategy based on the polio:rhinovirus chimera PVSRIPO, devoid of viral neuropathogenicity after intracerebral inoculation in human subjects, for stable expression of exogenous antigens. PVSRIPO vectors infect, activate, and induce epitope presentation in DCs in vitro; recruit and activate DCs with Th1-dominant cytokine profiles at the injection site in vivo. They efficiently prime tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo, induce CD8 T cell migration to the tumor site, delay tumor growth and enhance survival in murine tumor models.

TI  - Effects of Habitat Restoration and Thermal Environments on Site Use by Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus)
SP  - 152
AB  - Non-native grasses, particularly buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) and Old World bluestems (Bothriochloa and Dicanthium spp.), have invaded native plant communities in southern Texas, resulting in loss of habitat for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite). These grasses form dense monotypic stands, resulting in reductions in bare ground as well as reducing food sources provided by native vegetation and invertebrates. I examined bobwhite site use in response to a large-scale grassland restoration, in which a nearly 120-ha area was converted from a monoculture of non-native grasses to a native grassland savannah. Bobwhites used the restoration site to a lesser degree during the 2 years post-planting than before the treatments were conducted, which may be attributed to the removal of woody vegetation on the site. As a result, managers must place emphasis on the preservation and enhancement of woody vegetation in future habitat restoration plans. However, the precise vegetation structural characteristics creating microclimates conducive to bobwhite survival during extreme heating periods are unclear. I sought to determine which vegetation characteristics (canopy density, vegetation height, and vegetation overlap) were important drivers of operative and ground surface temperatures as well as important in creating shade. I also quantified whether bobwhites would select variables associated with temperature (shade and thermal index) as an indication of selecting locations solely for thermoregulation. No single vegetation characteristic was more effective than others in reducing both operative and ground surface temperatures (R2≤0.16) and in casting shade (R2≤0.13) over others. Bobwhites selected for cooler temperatures and shade but also canopy density and overlapping woody vegetation during the midday (R2=0.67), indicating that temperature and, secondarily, other factors such as predator avoidance influence selection of microsites during summer. Additionally, bobwhites sought locations consisting of multiple woody plant species instead of 1 species individually. Therefore, managers must prioritize the preservation of mixed-brush clusters in order to provide shade, dense canopies, and overlapping woody vegetation. Moreover, current methods to quantify fine-scale thermal heterogeneity are often time and energy-intensive as well as insufficient to account for fine-scale variation in thermal conditions across temporal scales. Remote sensing techniques such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may provide a more practical alternative as they cover more ground and collect high resolution imagery. I sought to assess the feasibility of utilizing a UAV to quantify thermal heterogeneity and to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of thermally suitable space for bobwhites using UAV-derived imagery. During the 1400 hr flight, about 7.5% of a 16-ha pasture in which the UAV was flown contained operative temperatures below the lower hyperthermic limit of 39º C. This increased to 27% and 98% during the 1600 and 1800 hr flights, respectively. Utilizing UAV imagery combined with black globe temperature data can be an effective means towards assessing thermal heterogeneity at a landscape scale. An understanding of the specific vegetation structural attributes providing thermal refugia for bobwhites will benefit managers seeking to increase thermal cover on the landscape. This is especially paramount as bobwhites may become exposed to more extreme thermal conditions as daytime temperatures increase and heating periods lengthen in duration as predicted by climate change models.

TI  - Functional Traits in Desert Winter Annual Plants: Community Structure, Landscape Genomics and Genetic Basis
SP  - 185
AB  - Rapid climate change results in natural selection on key functional traits of species, not only influencing microevolution within species, but also potentially inducing macroevolution in the future via hierarchical interactions within and among species. The question of how rapidly species adapt to the changing world has long been at the center of ecological and evolutionary studies. To connect the dots and answer this fundamental question, we need to understand what genetic variation exists for key traits, how trait variation influences individual performance and fitness across populations, how trait variation influencing community structure, and how all this feeds back to natural selection on the genes that regulates the key traits. The Sonoran Desert winter annual plants provide a long-term study system where detailed demographic information for populations as well as communities has been collected. Functional traits and shifts in population sizes and community structure have been investigated for the dominant species in this community. Despite this abundant information there is still a poor understanding of genetic variation and microevolutionary modification of these traits which such important roles in population and community processes.This dissertation tackles this gap in knowledge from three angles: 1) examining the degree of trait variation and covariation of all species in the entire annual community, 2) determining degree of trait variation of many populations of one dominant species and its genetic correlation with climate, 3) determining the genetic regions that are associated with traits. Firstly, I expanded the scale of examination of a previously identified community-organizing functional trade-off: relative growth rate and water use efficiency, to include the entire desert annual community. I found that dominant species hold the strongest negative correlation between the two critical functional traits and that the trade-off weakens as rarer species were included. However, the trade-off pattern is significant with all species included in the analysis and has been constantly expressed for the past three decades in spite of turnovers in species composition. This critical trade-off serves as a potential rule determining which species become dominant in the community. Secondly, I examine functional trait variation and covariation across the regional landscape for one dominant Sonoran Desert winter annual species, Pectocarya recurvata for signatures of trait heritability, climate association with traits and genetic associations. Despite low heritability across functional traits that may be results of low standing genetic variation, there is still a significant trade-off pattern between relative growth rate and water use efficiency among populations across the landscape. Climate associated loci were identified and loci that were under selection were discovered. Precipitation and temperature may function on different sets of genetic components to regulate plant adaptation. Lastly, genetic variation and covariation of key functional traits were examined. Quantitative trait loci that associate with trait variation were identified. No apparent loci colocation between relative growth rate and water use efficiency was detected. Moreover, trait genetic correlation analysis revealed new sets of previously overlooked functional traits that covary. Interacting loci underlie trait variation indicating that the complex functional traits may be regulated by a number of minor loci that will require a higher resolution investigation to properly characterize.By dissecting genetic components of functional trait variation, we provide direct evidence that can be used to infer desert annual plants’ adaptive responses to climate change not only at population level, but also at the community level. Though we didn’t observe a direct locus colocation of the key pair of functional traits that trade-off at the population and community levels, unobserved minor effect loci may be important in regulating complex functional trait responses in the annual plant community.

TI  - Identifying Rare Somatic Mutations as a Means of Understanding Tissue Clonal Evolution
SP  - 233
AB  - Many general principles governing the development and evolution of cancers have been discovered by measuring how cells within tumors evolve with time. It is however still largely unclear what first steps a cell population must take in order to form a mature malignant cancer. In part, the technical difficulties of measuring and following extremely rare cell populations makes the task of understanding the earliest dynamics in cancer formation a formidable one. One common approach of following the early development of cancer is through next-generation deep sequencing as it facilitates measurements of rare cell populations.Despite numerous advances in deep sequencing methods and technologies, measuring the rarest mutations within a tissue's somatic cells has remained challenging. In part, next-generation sequencers make sufficient errors that they themselves create a background noise greater than the true mutation signal that often exists within tissues. As with sequencing, library-preparation has improved with time, however, as oxygen, heat, and water are still involved in the process, ex-vivo nucleotide changes are relatively common. It is therefore advantageous if these ex-vivo errors can be controlled for, understood, and predicted. Here, a barcoding system is combined with with a targeted capture method in a method termed FERMI in order to systematically eliminate much of the false-positive signal that originates from library preparation. This combination allows for accurate detection of mutations that occur at least as rare as 1/10,000 DNA molecules, and provides a quantitative understanding of the allele frequencies of these mutations.With accurate enough sequencing methods, it may be possible to create sufficiently detailed genetic maps of tissue landscapes as they age and evolve towards a malignant state. An understanding of the earliest steps involved in a tissue evolving towards a malignant state may start to show how many oncogenic clones precede the development of cancer, and the factors that determine which and how many of those clones ever progress to a malignant state. Here, FERMI is employed to sequence blood samples from people with Down Syndrome as they develop leukemia at elevated rates over the general population. This deep sequencing reveals a significant selection for oncogenic changes within the TET2 and JAK2 genes, suggesting that differences in the hematopoietic microenvironment may be particularly permissive to the survival and expansion of cells carrying these mutations. Furthermore, the oncogenic mutations observed within the youngest people with Down Syndrome together resemble the patterns observed in the aging-related hematopoietic phenomenon of Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential. These similarities may be indicative of environmental perturbations that are similar between aged hematopoietic tissue, and blood that contains three copies of chromosome 21.Similar to the motivation to understand leukemogenesis in Down Syndrome, lung cancer development in chronic smokers may also follow predictable evolutionary paths. Deep sequencing with FERMI of lung biopsies isolated from the lungs of chronic smokers reveals that cells containing similar mutations within the EGFR and PI3K genes are present multiple clonal expansions even in relatively healthy tissue. These clonal expansions suggest that the insult of chronic tobacco smoke exposure creates a tissue environment that is permissive to the expansion of particularly malignant cell phenotypes.Overall, the research presented herein has describes a method of accurate and quantitative deep sequencing. This method is employed to better understand the clonal dynamics in stressed and perturbed tissues in a manner that reveals predictable patterns of clonal evolution.

TI  - Monitoring the microstructural evolution of solid oxide fuel cell anodes
AB  - As the global energy landscape evolves in the face of climate change, the uptake of intermittent renewables is gaining ground. Electrochemical devices for energy generation and storage are therefore becoming increasingly prevalent. Solid oxide fuel cells represent an energy conversion device with high efficiency and fuel versatility but continue to suffer from cost and durability issues, hindering commercial viability. Establishing electrode microstructure-property relationships provides insight into both initial and long term performance and thus far, full comprehension of degradation phenomena has remained elusive. Building on 2D stereological approaches, recent advances in tomographic techniques such as focused-ion beam-scanning electron microscopy and X-ray nano computed tomography have allowed for 3D investigations of electrode microstructures. However, the former methodology is inherently destructive and with the latter, reliable contrast for typical SOFC electrode materials has not been easily accessible. In this thesis, an examination of these tomographic modalities is conducted, with focused-ion beam scanning electron microscropy slice and view applied to both virgin and aged Ni-YSZ anodes to virtually reconstruct their microstructures. A laser-preparation technique for the fabrication of geometrically optimised samples for X ray nano-computed tomography is developed, and facilitates access to a larger sampled volume, thus providing more representative characterisation of the entire anode. Prepared samples are exposed to ex-situ annealing in a lab-based furnace wherein 900 °C is identified as the appropriate temperature for monitoring appreciable microstructual evolution within the first 12 hours of annealing. An in-situ¬ laser heating set-up at a synchrotron beamline illustrates the very early-stage microstructural reorganisation inherent to high-temperature operation. Significant attention is directed throughout towards the extraction of reliable metrics, sampling a representative volume element and capturing evolution by digital volume correlation techniques. The expectation is that the developed methodology will provide insight into the necessary fabrication and operational parameters for maximising solid oxide fuel cell performance and durability.

TI  - Subsurface deformation micromechanisms induced during machining of titanium alloys at low temperatures, and a novel testing methodology to examine their machining behaviour
AB  - The aerospace industry's drive towards higher productivity has led manufacturers to strive for higher surface speeds in metal cutting. Machining of titanium alloys leads to high temperatures attributed to their low thermal properties, resulting in high tool wear rates. To counter this, large amounts of coolants are used. These contain toxic chemicals, which are harmful to both people and the environment. To reduce these hazards, near-dry strategies such as cryogenic cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are investigated in this thesis. A fundamental knowledge gap in the literature was identified, which is the characterisation of the subsurface microstructural evolution during plastic deformation in the machining of titanium alloys. Besides, its impact on surface integrity needs to be investigated in detail. The aims of this PhD research were (1) To determine the "machinability" of titanium alloys by designing a novel and straightforward cutting test. (2) To determine the effect of low temperatures (LTs) on the underlying deformation mechanisms during plastic deformation in the machining of aero-structural Ti-6Al-4V. In particular, during the application of a cryogen media such as LN2 and CO2. (3) To build a constitutive model to predict the experimental flow behaviour. (4) To analyse the imparted subsurface deformation and relate to its subsurface integrity. A material's inherent mechanical, physical and thermal properties strongly influence its machining behaviour. In the uniaxial compression test, it was determined that β annealed Ti-6Al-4V ELI: undergoes shear localisation even at quasi-static strain rates, has a high sensitivity to temperature and a lower sensitivity to strain rate. The higher the temperature, the higher the strain rate sensitivity. Plastic deformation at LTs exhibited higher flow stresses vs ambient temperature. The true strain at the onset of thermal instability (softening) and at fracture was identified, it was c30% smaller at LTs vs room temperature, leading to a reduction in c20% energy for cutting at LTs. The strain-hardening rate during plastic deformation decreases linearly with further imparted strain and decreases faster at LTs. Machining generates a graded subsurface microstructure. Four different regions were identified in this investigation. (1) Severe plastic deformation region (SPD), where a nanocrystalline grain structure was observed through electron microscopy from cryogenic machining under CO2, resulting in a significant increase in strength. (2) Gross plastic deformation region. (3) Twinned region. (4) Undeformed bulk. In conclusion, machining of titanium alloys at cryogenic temperatures is easier as a lower strain is required for shearing, leading to lower energy spent for chip generation. Nevertheless, a larger microstructural damage depth is introduced into the subsurface, leading to more potential sites for crack nucleation. The main challenges that lie ahead are: (1) to determine the extent of the effect the microstructural damage has on the fatigue life during dynamic loading, and (2) to determine whether easy diffusion is allowed to occur under thermal exposure, which would negatively affect their mechanical properties.

TI  - Development of novel disposable metal/coliform biosensor device for simultaneous monitoring of chemical and microbial quality of drinking water and urine
AB  - The main sources of human exposure to heavy metals are water and food. Metals play significant roles in the growth and development of living organisms. However, they can be lethal at elevated concentrations due to their interference with normal biological processes, although some metal species are toxic even at low concentrations (e.g. Hg, Pb). The traditional laboratory-based analytical investigations for environmental contaminants are expensive and usually require trained staff and sophisticated facilities. This study sought to develop a sensitive, specific, accurate, rapid, cheap and portable novel disposable biosensor device for the detection of arsenic and other heavy metals in drinking water and investigate its biomedical potential for testing arsenic in urine samples. A pre-existing arsenic biosensor consisting of the E. coli chromosomal ars promoter, arsR repressor gene and lacZ'α gene was tested. The expression of lacZʹα allows the fermentation of lactose with production of acid, changing the coloured pH indicator bromothymol blue from blue to yellow. Our results showed that the biosensor responded reliably to arsenate concentrations in water and urine samples below the recommended World Health Organisation limit of 10 ppb arsenic. Novel zinc and copper biosensors were developed using promoter elements regulated by endogenous zinc-binding and copper-binding transcription factors, ZntR and CueR respectively, fused to lacZʹα, and a suitable test medium, ZBM3, was developed. Initial designs showed high background activity. The constructs were redesigned using either weaker ribosome binding sites (RBS), low copy number plasmids or promoters with lower activity. The redesigned Zn biosensor accurately detected zinc, cadmium, lead and mercury concentrations (3 mg/L, 0.003 mg/L, 0.01 mg/L and 0.001 mg/L respectively) below the recommended WHO limits. Similarly, copper, silver and gold levels (2 mg/L, no guidelines for silver and gold respectively) were detected by the novel copper biosensor, below the limits recommended by the WHO. The stability of the sensor cells was independently tested by; air drying, freeze drying, or immobilised on paper, each within a re-sealable system that can then be stored and distributed, hence eliminating the need for routine culture and minimizing variation between different batches of cells. Sensor bacteria were successfully revived after 120 days storage at room temperature or 370C. Data obtained showed approximately 0.2% viable cells at the aforementioned conditions after initial inoculations of 1.3 x 108 CFU / mL of cells, an indication of reduced viability as a result of rigorous cell preparations and incomplete drying particularly air dried cells. However, data also obtained showed that dried cells with such survival rate were still effective in the assay. These growth-based biosensors supported growth on lactose medium which allows use of the same format for detection of both metals and biological contaminants (coliforms) in a single unit. Coliforms were readily detected based on lactose fermentation using a variant of the same growth medium used for biosensor organisms, allowing for easy generation of a combined coliform/metal sensor device. In conclusion, metal contaminants in environmental samples can be reliably and accurately detected at the safe limits set by the regulatory authorities by the use of biological methods of testing. These testing techniques, together with the simultaneous testing of biological contaminants, have the potential of reducing the high costs of physico-chemical methods, save time as well as make sample testing available to areas lacking modern testing facilities. However, the systems need to be improved to allow for a reduction in time needed to obtain reliable results.

TI  - Genetic Connectivity, Adaptation, and Phenotypic Plasticity of Corals and Anemones Under Thermal Stress
AB  - Under global climate change, our oceans are warming at an unprecedented rate. Increased temperatures represent a severe source of stress for many marine organisms. This thesis aims to understand how corals and anemones respond to changing temperatures across different timescales and investigates mechanisms that can facilitate persistence in light of environmental change, from selection and adaptation across generations to phenotypic plasticity within a single individual's lifespan. In this context, I explore three case studies of thermal stress in corals and anemones. I begin with massive Pontes lobata corals from the central Pacific. Here, reefs that are most affected by El Nino, such as Jarvis and the northeast Phoenix Islands maintain genetic diversity indicating recruitment from nearby reefs may occur. Yet, they show significant genetic differentiation (FsT) from farther areas, suggesting this dispersal may be limited. Thermal variability in this region may also favor plasticity over adaptation, as we do not find differences in bleaching histories among genetic groups. Next, I investigate genetic connectivity and adaptation to chronically elevated temperatures across a natural temperature gradient within the Palauan archipelago. Combining genetic data and historical growth measurements from coral cores, I find that Palau's warmest reefs harbor unique genetic subpopulations of Pontes lobata and find evidence for a genetic basis of their higher thermal tolerance. Lastly, I explore if parents can modulate parental effects to increase the thermal tolerance of their offspring over short time scales, using the estuarine anemone Nematostella vectensis. Indeed, I find parents exposed to increased temperatures quickly produce more thermally tolerant larvae. In fact, offspring from these Massachusetts parents show thermal thresholds that are indistinguishable from more southern populations. This thesis highlights the ability and potential of corals and anemones to persist under variable conditions over different timescales. Nevertheless, a compelling effort to reduce rates of warming worldwide will be imperative to the survival and integrity of key marine ecosystems such as coral reefs.

TI  - Information-Based Analysis of Environmental Factors Adaptive Force and Potential of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Variants Associated with Human Diseases
SP  - 64
AB  - Populations genomic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributions, represent the populations’ adaptation to different environments. Thus, examining the relationships between the single SNP or linked SNP (Haploblock) distributions and environmental agitations should help in understanding the optimization of populations’ survival. Biophysical formulations are utilized to characterize genomic potentials (occurrence) of the alleles and SNPs in genomic energy units (GEU) reflected through the information content of the whole genome. Mathematical functions were then autonomously fitted to blindly flag significant correlations between these potentials and quantified ancestral environmental parameters, and the rate of change in the genomic distributions due to environmental factors were determined. In this study, a likely relationship was found between the average temperature as an environmental force to favor increased conservation of the T form of the rs9310709 SNP alleles in areas with increasing temperature, to demonstrate the viability of the formalism. Other SNPs were also flagged for future study.

TI  - Managing the Risk of Rapid Vessel Capsize: An Exploratory Study of Sensemaking among Oregon Dungeness Crab Commercial Fishing Captains
SP  - 185
AB  - Dungeness crab commercial fishing is a tough, dangerous business. Oregon Dungeness crab fishermen face some of the most hazardous working conditions in the United States, contributing to a fatality rate several times higher than the national average for the commercial fishing industry. Vessel disasters, including rapid capsize events, account for over half of these fatalities. Beyond the harsh and often unpredictable marine environment characterized by cold temperatures, strong winds, and large waves, there are many complexities associated with managing commercial fishing operations in the Oregon Dungeness crab fishery. Current descriptive reports and statistical analyses have documented causal and contributing factors for capsize incidents; however, these factors alone do not consider occupational culture, including the ongoing communicative and social interaction that may critically influence the environment through which action is or is not undertaken, decisions are considered, and outcomes are determined. In the high-risk world of commercial fishing, captains face a wide array of complex and uncertain situations related to fishing operations, crisis, and safety. Weick’s model of organizing maps a three-stage process through which organizational members engage in interconnected communication practices to make sense of complex risk (enactment), select strategies for preventing and responding to crisis events (selection), and incorporate what was learned from these communication cycles for guiding future prevention and response as a form of organizational intelligence (retention). This study employed a qualitative approach to explore the perspectives of the master of the vessel and key cultural influence, Oregon Dungeness crab commercial fishing captains. Specifically, I examined the equivocality, or multiple possible interpretations, of vessel safety issues (occupational culture, unpredictability, complexity, and precedent) to understand how captains understand the risks (enactment) and determine how to avoid and respond to potential capsize events (selection). Finally, I explored how this information may be stored as rules for future application (retention, as organizational intelligence). Fieldwork included document review, participant observation in a commercial fishing safety course, observation of fishing operations at sea, and site visits to commercial fishing ports along the Oregon coast, followed by sixteen semi-structured, in-depth interviews with Oregon Dungeness crab commercial fishing captains at two sites. Interviews were analyzed using a modified constant comparison method. To determine how to prevent rapid vessel capsize, captains employed a combination of rules (use of early warning systems, such as alarms) to manage the known risks, and communication cycles (e.g., talk to crew, U.S. Coast Guard) to manage unexpected or emerging risks. Many captains saw constant teaching of the crew about safety and encouraging communication “up”; that is, telling the captain when something is wrong, were essential for safety, though a few relied on more one-way, authoritarian approaches to communication with crew. As there is often little time to respond in capsize events, captains described response efforts largely driven by emergency procedure-based rules learned through on-the-job and drill conductor training opportunities. However, if time allowed, captains engaged in communication cycles, or repeated communicative interactions to investigate and solve highly equivocal problems. Future work should examine challenges of enactment (learning of vessel safety issues) and selection (determining strategies for prevention and response). Specifically, one might consider whether training and experience help captains and crew to see when reliance on a rule is the best way to manage imminent danger and when use of communication cycles to consider multiple sources of danger and the best way to address them is most appropriate. Additionally, opportunities to enhance and expand organizational intelligence (e.g., harnessing the power of storytelling and adaptive training approaches) should be explored. Further analysis of possible gaps between how safety and risk are perceived and communicated and what quantitative assessments say about causes of mortality and morbidity in Dungeness crab fishing are warranted.

TI  - Realizing and Probing Driven Quantum Systems with Ultracold Gases
SP  - 345
AB  - Ultracold quantum gases offer a versatile platform to study a wide range of open questions in condensed matter physics and beyond. In particular, their controllability, isolation from noisy thermal environments, and evolution on experimentally-accessible timescales make them a natural choice to probe the effects of driving on time evolution and energy. This thesis details the construction of two cold-atom apparatuses, a lithium machine and a strontium machine, for quantum emulation experiments studying driven systems. Initial numerical simulations along two experimental lines are briefly discussed, and results from the first two experiments on the strontium machine are then presented. In the first, a strontium Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical trap is strongly driven to emulate ultrafast photoionization processes; in a series of proof-of-principle experiments measuring the momenta and energy of particles ejected from the trap, we demonstrate the viability of this technique to study open questions in strong-field physics. The second experiment realizes a tunable quasicrystal, the energy structure for which is described by the multifractal Hofstadter butterfly. Quasiperiodic structures host not only phonons, but also a higher-dimension analogue called phasons. In the experiment, we demonstrate phasonic spectroscopy for the first time by directly driving one of these modes; we characterize the coupling to the resulting excitations, and directly map a slice of the Hofstadter energy spectrum.

TI  - Thermal Acclimation and Adaptation of Key Phytoplankton Groups and Interactions with Other Global Change Variables
SP  - 178
AB  - Several functional groups of marine phytoplankton groups play especially critical roles in global primary productivity, carbon export and biogeochemistry. In particular, diatoms substantially contribute to primary production, carbon sequestration and the food web. Diazotrophic cyanobacteria are equally important as a source of new nitrogen (N) through nitrogen fixation. The relationship between environmental forcing and these key marine phytoplankton groups needs more attention, especially in the context of future global change.Elevated atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) are bringing about ocean acidification and giving rise to sea surface warming. By the end of this century, atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to rise from current levels of ~415 parts per million (ppm) to 800-1150 ppm, while average surface seawater temperatures will increase by 2-4°C. Global warming will also result in indirect changes, such as intensified stratification of seawater, increased temperature variability and decreased nutrient inputs from the interior of oceans. Phytoplankton communities in the euphotic zone will be forced to accommodate to all of these concurrent climate change trends.The three research chapters of this dissertation aim to increase our understanding of the possible responses of marine diatoms and diazotrophic cyanobacteria to this changing ocean environment. The first project investigated the physiological responses of the widespread centric diatom Coscinodiscus sp. to interactions between elevated CO2, warming, and nitrogen availability. The growth and physiology of Coscinodiscus were found to be regulated by both individual and interactive effects of these three variables. Growth stimulation by warming was coupled with a decreased growth affinity for nitrate, indicating increased vulnerability to nitrate-limitation. Rising CO2 promoted carbon fixation rates, which may provide a negative feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2. Cellular phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) contents declined and consequently N: P and C: Si ratios were elevated at high temperature, especially at ambient CO2 level. Moreover, numerous mutual interactions among the three climate change variables were observed for growth rates, carbon fixation rates, cellular Chl a content and elemental stoichiometry, suggesting that more attention should be paid to the overall effects of multiple climate change variables rather than only to their independent impacts.The second chapter examined how short-term thermal variability affected the growth and physiology of Trichodesmium erythraeum GBRTRLI101 in two seasons (winter / summer), as well as the interaction between temperature variation and phosphate availability. P limitation played a bigger role in stressing the growth of Trichodesmium than temperature variability. The responses of Trichodesmium to thermal variability varied with the seasonal temperature regimes and ambient nutrient availability. In particular, thermal variability significantly decreased the growth and nitrogen and carbon fixation rates of Trichodesmium cells under P-replete conditions in wintertime. Increases in cellular phosphorus use efficiencies of Trichodesmium were observed at high temperature, suggested a lower P requirement in the future warming ocean. This chapter incidentally illustrated that a nonlinear averaging model commonly used to predict growth rates under fluctuating temperatures is not appropriate to apply to nutrient-limited cells. Future warming and greater thermal variability could significantly interact with projected reduced P supplies, and thus impact the growth and physiology of marine diazotrophic cyanobacteria.The third chapter explored the short-term physiological responses and potential for evolutionary adaptation of Trichodesmium erythraeum IMS101 and Crocosphaera WH0005 after long-term exposure to different temperatures. Long-term thermally-selected Trichodesmium IMS101 showed a quick re-acclimation to temperature shifts from 20-34°C, while a true thermal adaptation or possibly a much slower plastic acclimation occurred in Crocosphaera WH0005. A remarkable finding was that 32°C-selected Crocosphaera cells can survive and fix nitrogen at a normally lethal temperature of 34°C, suggesting that Crocosphaera can adaptively extend its upper thermal limit if warming occurs gradually. These distinct responses of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera may stem from their different genetic backgrounds and lifestyles. These results provide insights into evolutionary versus plastic responses, competitive interactions, niche partitioning, and changes in new nitrogen supplies from these two keystone diazotrophs in the future tropical and subtropical ocean.The three studies in this dissertation help us to better understand the synergistic effects of multiple climate change variables on marine diatom growth, elemental stoichiometry and the silicification process. They also provide unique information on the interactions of thermal variability and nutrient limitation on the growth and physiology of an important marine diazotroph, and allow better predictions of short-term acclimation and possible evolutionary adaptation to future warming conditions in two representative nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. Together, this dissertation research provides novel insights into the potential trends of marine primary productivity and biogeochemistry under future ocean global change scenarios.

TI  - Shrimp Production Environment and the Gut Microbiome: Effects of Aquaculture Practices and Selective Breeding on the Gut Microbiome of Pacific Whiteleg Shrimp, Litopenaeus Vannamei
SP  - 123
AB  - Knowledge of the functional role of the gut microbiome in animal health and nutrition may provide solutions to shrimp aquaculture challenges, such as improving disease resistance and optimizing growth particularly with low cost feeds. Successful manipulation of bacteria found in the gut requires a deeper understanding of shrimp microbial communities and how their compositional structure is influenced by environmental conditions, and inherent host factors such as genetics.The initial research investigated the intestinal bacterial communities of the Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) reared in pond systems and indoor aquaculture facilities as an exploration of the effects of aquaculture practices on the acquired gut microbiome. Indoor production shrimp were maintained at 28 ± 1 °C in temperature-controlled tanks. Water management was carried out using separate indoor recirculating aquaculture systems, one for each tank, utilizing fresh water processed by reverse osmosis then mixed at 28 g Marinemix (Marine Enterprises International, LLC., Baltimore, MD, USA) per 1 liter of production water. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) levels were maintained at less than 3.0 mg/mL (NH3 ≤ 0.2), nitrite levels below 4.5 mg/mL, and nitrate levels never exceeded 100 mg/mL. Evaporated water was replaced with fresh water as needed to maintain salinity at 28 ppt. Samples from that experiment showed consistent intestinal bacterial community profiles within each production system, as major differences were uncovered between the two culture practices. Bacteria affiliated with Rhodobacteraceae (Proteobacteria) and Actinobacteria were significantly more abundant in indoor samples (84.4% vs. 5.1%; 3.0% vs. 0.06%, respectively), while Vibrionaceae (Proteobacteria) (0.03% vs. 44.8%), Firmicutes (0.7% vs. 36.0%), Fusobacteria (0.0% vs. 7.9%), and Cyanobacteria (0.001% vs. 1.6%) were predominant in pond samples. The results indicate that aquaculture practices greatly influence the intestinal bacterial profile of whiteleg shrimp, and further suggest the bacterial communities of this economically important crustacean could in the future be effectively manipulated using diet composition or environmental factors such as water chemistries.A subsequent trial containing two experiments focused on two genetic families of Pacific whiteleg shrimp. As one family was selected for its’ specific pathogen resistance (Shrimp Improvement Systems, SIS), while the other genetic line was selected for growth (Oceanic Institute, OI). Both stocks of postlarvae juvenile shrimp were reared in a biosecure / indoor aquaculture facility under the same indoor aquaculture practices used in the initial trial comparing the pond vs indoor culture, with the added variable of daily probiotic additions to the water column. Stocking densities were maintained in the standard range of intensive production systems at 30–60 shrimp per cubic meter, with feed offered continuously. Production tanks (2,921L) were maintained for 72 days with six tanks for each genetic family, three replicate tanks receiving probiotic infusions and three without. A commercial product, BioWish 3P, was obtained from BioWish Technologies (Cincinnati, Ohio). BioWish 3P contains Pediococcus acidilactici ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Pediococcus pentosaceus ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Lactobacillus plantarum ≥ 1 x 108 cfu/g, Bacillus subtilis ≥ 1 x 107 cfu/g. The freeze-dried bacterial cultures are delivered in an inert carrier, cereal food fines. BioWish 3P was added a rate of 0.73 ± 0.05g per trial tank daily and was dosed (0.7g) with the feed offered over 24h. Microbiome sampling occurred on day 43 (prior to probiotic additions), day 57, and day 71 (28 days following initial probiotic introduction). Water management was maintained at 28 ± 1 °C and 28ppt salinity utilizing artificial seawater. Total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite, and nitrate levels were maintained at less than 3.0 mg/mL (NH3 ≤ 0.2), below 4.5 mg/mL, below 100 mg/mL respectively.Considering that the gut microbiome of shrimp begins to develop immediately after hatching and is dependent on the initial diets and environmental conditions, it was not surprising to discover the initial phylum abundance between groups on day 43 differed, with a range of 72.3- 82.5% being Proteobacteria in the SIS shrimp compared to 61.1-65.1% in OI shrimp. The two genetic lines of shrimp revealed significant differences in gut microbiome by family and sampling time points following the inclusion of probiotics into the diet. After 28 days of treatment on tenure day 71, significant variation became evident in the second most abundant phylum in the SIS shrimp with Bacteroidetes increasing from 4.0% on day 43 to 8.6% on day 71 with probiotics, and from 5.6% on day 43 to 30.6% on day 71 without probiotics. By comparison, the second most abundant phylum in the OI shrimp was Firmicutes, increasing from 0.5% on day 43 to 22.1% on day 71 with probiotics, and from 2.8% to 36.7% without probiotics. As Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacillus-affiliated OTUs were found in only very low abundance or were undetectable in the gut of probiotic supplemented shrimp, bacterial species from the commercial probiotic formulation did not appear to efficiently colonize the shrimp gut in this study. However, their presence or absence did impact the development of gut bacterial communities through abundances. While future investigations will be necessary to uncover the mechanisms involved, it could be hypothesized that, even if probiotic bacterial species do not become established in high density in the gut of exposed shrimp, they produce metabolites that favor the establishment of certain bacterial species or OTUs over others.These results suggest that bacterial communities of this economically important crustacean can be effectively manipulated utilizing environmental conditions. They further indicate that development of direct fed microbial strategies to effectively manipulate the microbiome of this important seafood will likely need to take into serious consideration the genetic background of the various current and future shrimp genetic lines used in aquaculture production.

TI  - Conservation Ecology of Freshwater Turtles in Saline Environments
SP  - 131
AB  - Despite their ecological value and relative importance to humans, tidal marsh wetlands and their native biota are constantly at risk to land conversion, water-diversion systems, patterns of water consumption, and water-intensive management practices. While tidal marsh wetlands have several direct threats, they are also indirectly affected by climate change and sea level rise, which is currently occurring at an unprecedented rate and geographic scale. The synergistic effect of these hydrological impacts places many tidal marsh vertebrates at risk, most notably species that are rather intolerant of increases in water salinity variation and complex hydrological regimes–freshwater turtles. Freshwater turtles are disproportionately more threatened than any other taxa, thus, understanding their interaction with sea level rise, salinity, and direct anthropogenic impacts should be a research priority. To address this conservation issue, I investigated freshwater turtles and their present and predicted vulnerability to sea level rise along coastlines, experimentally tested their response to elevated salinities, assessed their interactions with tidal marsh management practices and local hydrological regimes, and developed a framework for their conservation. First, I completed an exhaustive review of the literature on freshwater turtles of the world that occur in brackish water ecosystems. I synthesized current knowledge of physiological, homeostatic, and behavioral mechanisms of freshwater turtles that use coastal brackish water systems. I also used end of century sea level rise projections to estimate spatial impact on coastal occurring turtle species. I then integrated results from my literature assessment, sea level rise impact analysis, and a novel turtle phylogeny to generate a spatially and phylogenetically informed conservation prioritization framework. My literature review suggested that observations of freshwater turtles in brackish water do not imply long-term salinity tolerance. Rather, experiments show that some species exhibit potential for adaptation and plasticity in physiological, behavioral, and life history traits that enable them to endure short periods and levels of saltwater exposure. In addition, my analysis suggested that approximately 90% of coastal freshwater turtle species will be impacted by a 1-m increase in global mean SLR by 2100. Most at-risk are freshwater turtles in southeast Asia, Australia, New Guinea, and North America that may lose greater than 10% of their present geographic range. Next, I conducted an experimental physiological study to determine osmoregulatory response of the Western Pond Turtle (Actinemys marmorata)–a declining freshwater turtle native to California, USA–to elevated salinities. My experimental study revealed that freshwater turtles from a coastal tidal marsh population regulate their plasma osmolality more efficiently than their conspecifics from a freshwater creek population. However, rapid mass loss in both populations suggested that these responses may only be effective for short-term exposures to elevated salinities and are unlikely to be effective under salinities expected from projected sea level rise. Finally, I conducted a multi-year field study on Western Pond Turtle basking activity, abundance, and survivorship in a tidal marsh wetland via monthly mark-recapture and motion-sensor camera monitoring. Our results suggested that Western Pond Turtle basking activity and population dynamics are highly correlated with local environmental attributes, some which are directly tied to area-specific habitat management strategies–water temperature and salinity. In sum, these studies highlight the importance of improving coastal freshwater turtle management strategies in the face of increased anthropogenic hydrological modification, wetland management, and sea level rise. These studies also move us closer towards understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that have prolonged the existence of freshwater turtles in coastal brackish water habitats and may prove useful in predicting their response to a changing world.

TI  - The Adaptive Arsenal of Crustacean Larvae Against Predatory and Environmental Stresses of the Plankton
SP  - 213
AB  - Most benthic marine animals have larval stages that temporarily occupy the plankton during migrations between larval and adult habitats. These larvae are subject to drastically different selective pressures than adults imposed by the unique predatory and environmental challenges of the plankton. This often results in larval stages with radically different morphologies and behaviors than adults. Understanding the adaptations of marine larvae will be instrumental in developing more accurate mechanistic models of larval survival and dispersal in current and future ocean conditions. Crustacean larvae express a variety of behavioral and morphological defenses from predators, but these defenses may be costly by increasing susceptibility to other stressors such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR), resulting in trade-offs. Zooplankton are largely transparent to reduce visibility to visual predators, but this transparency increases susceptibility to UVR, which can be blocked by pigmentation. In this dissertation, I examine the morphological anti-predator defenses of crustacean (primarily crab) larvae, trade-offs with morphological pigmentation defenses from UVR, and compensatory behavioral and morphological responses to circumvent this trade-off. Overall, my results suggest that crustacean larvae are subject to a diverse set of predation threats that they counter with behavioral and morphological defenses and UVR may be a stronger driver of the evolution of crab larval pigmentation and behaviors than visual predation.Chapter one reviews the diversity of predators that consume crustacean larval, the behavioral and morphological defenses these larvae employ to defend themselves, and the importance of competition among larvae. Crustacean larvae are consumed by a vast diversity of predators of all feeding types and are an important component of many predators’ diets. Crustacean larvae can defend themselves with long spines, hard carapaces, vertical and horizontal migrations, rapid darting behaviors, and strong swimming. Future research on chemical defenses and phenotypic plasticity are needed to fill gaps in our knowledge. These results have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of larval forms in Crustacea and the factors determining crustacean abundances and distributions.Chapter two examines the photoprotective benefits of pigmentation in the plankton. In the first quantitative and phylogenetically controlled test of the hypothesis that planktonic pigments protect from UVR, I examined inter- and intraspecific relationships between larval pigmentation and survival under UVR in 12 species of tropical crabs. I found a strong interspecific relationship between larval pigmentation and susceptibility to UVR such that more pigmented species were better defended from natural levels of UVA and UVA + UVB. However, intraspecific results were equivocal. These results suggest the evolution of pigmentation in larval crabs (and possibly other zooplankton) was driven by UVR, despite potentially increasing visibility to visual predators. This chapter improves our understanding of the selective forces acting on animal coloration and the factors determining planktonic distributions, survival, and dispersal.Chapter three investigates the cost of pigmentation in increasing susceptibility to visual predators and the compensatory behavioral responses of tropical crab larvae to UVR and predation. I measured the preferences of silverside fish for pigmented crab larvae in 3 UVR treatments (visible light, visible + UVA, visible + UVA + UVB), the color change behaviors of crab larvae in response to UVR and predatory fish cues, and the vertical swimming behaviors of crab larvae to UVR and sun intensity. Fish preferred pigmented larvae on sunnier days in visible light lacking UVR. Three of 5 species consistently expanded chromatophores in UVR or visible light but responses to fish cues were inconsistent. One species avoided surface waters after exposure to sunlight with UVR. The more consistent larval responses to UVR than to predator cues and the lack of predator preferences in natural light conditions suggest that UVR may have a stronger influence on pigmentation than predation.Chapter four explores the compensatory behavioral color change and vertical swimming responses of temperate crab larvae to UVR and visual predation. I investigated color change in larvae of the crab Pachygrapsus crassipes in response to 4 UVR treatments (shade, visible light, visible + UVA, visible + UVA +UVB), predator cues, and background color, as well as their swimming behavior in 4 UVR treatments compared with the more lightly pigmented crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis. P. crassipes expanded chromatophores in UVR and intense sunlight but did not respond to predator cues or background. While both species swam least on the sunniest days, lightly pigmented H. oregonensis swam most in shade while darkly pigmented P. crassipes swam most in UVR, perhaps to avoid competition or predation by less UVR-tolerant species. These results improve our understanding of compensatory behavioral responses to the conflicting threats of UVR and predation, as well as the drivers of larval vertical swimming behaviors that determine larval distributions, survival, and dispersal.Chapter five examines the correlates and constraints of pigmentation and defensive spines in larval crabs. I examined 1) the relationship between spine lengths and pigmentation, 2) the allometric scaling of spine lengths with body size, and 3) phylogenetic constraint in spine lengths, pigmentation, and body size, among and within 21 species of laboratory-hatched crab larvae and 23 species types of field-collected crab larvae from Panama and California. We found a negative relationship between spine length and pigmentation that was significant interspecifically and marginally significant intraspecifically. This may suggest that species are specializing in defending from UVR or predation depending on the dominant threats encountered in their larval habitats. Furthermore, spine lengths exhibited positive allometric scaling with carapace length, which may result in reduced predator defenses as larval body sizes decrease with climate change due to negative effects of warming temperatures on offspring size. Lastly, spine and carapace lengths, but not pigmentation, had significant phylogenetic signals. Our results improve understanding of the evolution of the larval morphology of crabs, morphological defenses in the plankton, and evolutionary responses of morphology to multiple spatially-segregated selective forces.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Niche Patterns and Thermal Environmental Cues: Implications for the Persistence of Nicrophorine Burying Beetles
SP  - 79
AB  - The persistence of burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus) depends on the successful acquisition of a highly competitive resource. Breeding pairs of the Nicrophorine genus work together to bury and prepare a suitable carcass as food for their developing larvae. To understand the mechanisms allowing for the persistence of multiple burying beetle species in Nicrophorine-rich communities, this thesis explores how sympatric burying beetles utilize space and time to partition the carrion resource. Further, to explore how thermal environments influence the reproductive biology of burying beetles, the response of Nicrophorus marginatus, both within and across generations is measured by monitoring rearing behaviors, movement activity, and brood characteristics with exposure to varying temperature regimes. The results of these studies present an important interplay between space use and temporal activity patterns that may serve to mediate negative interactions among sympatric buying beetle species. Generally, where species exhibit high temporal or spatial overlap, they are segregated along the alternative niche dimension. Future work on this community of burying beetles should examine the trophic ecology of species that appear to overlap spatially and temporally. The findings of these studies also indicate that increasing temperatures may impose direct fitness consequences on populations of N. marginatus. While this species appears to exhibit higher activity in elevated temperatures, they also exhibited extended burial timing and significantly reduced reproductive success rates. Efforts should be made to increase our understanding of the thermal capacity of the Nicrophorine genus as a whole.

TI  - Prenatal Stress As a Potential Adaptive Modulator of Offspring Survival, Phenotype, and Performance in Response to Elevated Temperatures
SP  - 128
AB  - Climate change is increasing global water temperatures, and by altering temperatures, is subsequently impacting aquatic life, particularly ectothermic fish. When mothers encounter environmental stressors such as elevated temperatures during follicular recruitment (maternal stress), resultant offspring often have altered phenotypes. Recent studies suggest that this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). I applied the environmental match hypothesis to investigate whether a maternal stress signal can prepare offspring to cope in a stressful environment. Specifically, I exposed Lake Ontario Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs to a biologically relevant maternal stress signal (1000ng/mL cortisol or control). We split and reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current and future temperature conditions (+3°C). Then we investigated the interactive effects of thermal and maternal stress on offspring early survival, early morphology, and thermal tolerance (i.e., CTMax and energetic responses to temperature spikes). Overall I found that rearing temperature was an overriding modulator of offspring phenotype and performance. Offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower early survival, were smaller and had a higher acute tolerance. Prenatal cortisol did not definitively modulate offspring phenotype or performance under elevated rearing temperatures. My thesis provides evidence for the role of predictive adaptive responses, as offspring who were reared in elevated temperatures had higher thermal tolerance at parr stage. Applying the environmental context of intergenerational plastic mechanism such as maternal stress remains imperative as the world continues to rapidly change under the effects of human-mediated climate change.

TI  - Endothelial Cell Adhesion on Acrylate-Based Shape Memory Polymers for Use in Cardiovascular Stents
SP  - 195
AB  - Although cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, current treatment methods continue to be limited. Balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents (BMS) and drug eluting stents (DES) provide minimally invasive methods for opening and supporting narrowed vessels, but complications such as restenosis and thrombosis from reduced biocompatibility resulted in vessel re-occlusion, limiting this approach. Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have shown promise as polymer stents due to their self-deployment capabilities and vascular biocompatibility. Prior research on SMPs for stent use has focused on the mechanical properties for stent deployment and implantation and to confirm low cytotoxicity. However, both in vitro studies and in vivo studies using animal models, have demonstrated that endothelialization of a device surface soon after implantation enhances the likelihood of device integration, leading to device success. Thus, to make SMPs a more viable option for cardiovascular stents, verifying the endothelial cell recruitment ability of the surface is an important step. This work aims to optimize the surface of a shape memory polymer previously developed in our group to encourage endothelialization for future use in cardiovascular stents. First, we optimized the SMP formulation to retain its shape memory properties while also encouraging endothelial cell adhesion and survival. The 80:20 weight percent ratio tBA:PEGDMA SMP was selected for further experiments, based on previous thermomechanical data as well as acquired endothelialization data. In vivo, healthy vascular ECs are typically elongated and aligned in the direction of flow; as a result, many studies involving implanted blood-contacting devices contain topographical cues that direct cells to adhere in an organized fashion. Topographical surface modifications provide a less resistive regulatory path compared to those of the biological or chemical variety. Grooved surfaces have demonstrated cell adhesion, alignment, and improved cell function on a variety of surfaces, including metal and polymer; as a result, microgrooves were introduced to the surface of the SMPs using metal printed molds. Metal printing offers a simple, cost-effective, reproducible, and robust method for mold fabrication that can be used to fabricate molds with surface features on the order of tens of microns. Microgrooved SMPs demonstrated increased cell adhesion, survival and alignment compared to their unpatterned analogues. To further optimize rapid cell adhesion, groove depth was increased, and shape memory was extended to the surface features. Through initial compression of the grooved SMP surface and subsequent surface recovery at physiological temperature after cell introduction, cells attach to seemingly flat surfaces prior to feature recovery. which increases cell adhesion. The microgrooves also continue to encourage cell alignment. These studies provide some preliminary data that may aid in the future use of these materials for cardiovascular stents.

TI  - The Roles of Adaptation and Plasticity in Populations Persistence in the Face of Multiple Stressors
SP  - 141
AB  - Global environmental changes are rapidly transforming ecosystems. As a result, populations will face changes in environmental conditions over short timescales that can threaten their persistence. When dispersal to more suitable habitats is not possible, the threat of extinction can be ameliorated through distinct, but non-exclusive biological mechanisms, including phenotypic plasticity, which refers to changes in traits mostly common due to shifts in gene expression, and genetic adaptation by rapid evolutionary shifts in gene frequencies. In my dissertation research, I studied the phenotypic and molecular population responses of a freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia) from Sierra Nevada mountain lakes of California to anthropogenic environmental variation caused by climate change and introduced predators. Hence, populations with different environmental histories may diverge in response to changing selective pressures, such as those caused by such as warming and introduced predators, because they might differ on the level of plasticity and adaptation they show to current environmental conditions. In Chapter 1, I show that different Daphnia populations were equally able to evolve plasticity in response to selection by different temperature regimes for two years in field experiment. This results highlights the importance of evolution of plasticity in response to temperature regime, thus in Chapter 2, I explore whether or not a population of Daphnia exhibits genetic variation that confers shifting plasticity in response to temperature throughout the annual cycle, since there is strong seasonal variability in temperature in most lakes located in temperate climates Studying Daphnia population from Blue Lake I found a marked distinction in plastic responses between Daphnia collected in the beginning and end of the growing season, indicating that seasonal temperature variability has distinct effects on plasticity for different traits. In Chapter 3 I studied the possible molecular mechanisms behind phenotypic response to temperature and how it is affected by predation. I studied two Daphnia genotypes collected from Blue and Gardisky Lakes. Overall our results suggest that both genotypes can reach similar fitness through distinct underlying molecular mechanisms, but also that they have distinct environmental sensitivities to stressors. Together these findings illustrate the variation and the importance of plasticity in addition to the potential for its evolution in maintaining Daphnia populations as key species in freshwater ecosystems, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change on food webs and ecosystem processes.

TI  - Contemporary Adaptive Shifts in the Physiology and Life History of Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) Introduced into a Warm Climate
SP  - 189
AB  - Contemporary evolution has the potential to help limit the biological impact of rapidly changing climates, however it remains unclear whether wild populations can respond quickly enough for such adaptations to be effective. In this thesis, I used the introduction of native North American Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) into the milder climate of Europe over 140 years ago, as a 'natural' experiment to test for contemporary evolution to a change in climate in wild populations. In 2008, four outdoor pond colonies were established in central Ontario using adult Pumpkinseed from two native Canadian populations, and two non-native populations from northeastern Spain. By raising native and non-native Pumpkinseed within a common environment, this design minimized the impact of phenotypic plasticity on differential trait expression, and allowed me to interpret differences in the phenotype among pond-reared Pumpkinseed as evidence of genetic differences among populations. I demonstrated that Canadian and Spanish Pumpkinseed have similar thermal physiology except when acclimated to seasonally warm temperatures; trait differences are consistent with Spanish Pumpkinseed being better adapted to a warmer climate. Populations also had similar overwintering ecology, however some differences, such as higher survival under starvation conditions and greater energetic benefits associated with winter feeding, indicated that Canadian populations are better adapted to harsh winter conditions typical of the native range. Finally, I determined that the relatively fast life history expressed in wild European Pumpkinseed is largely driven by plastic responses to the local environment; however, the higher reproductive investment by European populations has a genetic basis. Most climate change research considers taxa that are expected to be negatively impacted by warming: my research demonstrates that even warm-tolerant taxa that are unlikely to experience strong climatic selective forces can respond to a warming environment through evolutionary changes. The potential for adaptive contemporary evolution in warm-tolerant taxa should be taken into account when predicting future ecosystem effects of climate change, and when planning management strategies for species introduced into novel climates.

TI  - Maternal Effects and the Evolution of Chinook Salmon
SP  - 209
AB  - Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations are under increasing threat due to habitat degradation, over fishing, invasive pathogens, and climate change. The early life history stage (fertilization – free feeding) is one of the most vulnerable developmental phases and performance at this stage may be a critical factor affecting population persistence. Offspring traits and performance are often greatly influenced by maternal effects, which have the potential to alter patterns of inheritance and selection, and environmental factors such as temperature. However, the contribution of maternal effects to the evolution of offspring traits under varying environmental conditions is still poorly understood in salmon. To address this research gap, I assessed the contribution of egg size, a primary maternal effect trait, to the within and among population variation in offspring traits in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) under different rearing temperatures. I found that egg size explained most of the within and among population variation in offspring traits, which suggests that egg size has the capacity to significantly influence the adaptive response of early life phenotypes. I also assessed the effect of egg nutrient composition, which is a transgenerational maternal effect, on the expression of offspring phenotypes and determined that both the fatty acid and proximate composition of eggs influenced offspring phenotypes above and beyond the effect of egg size. Importantly, the effects of both egg size and nutrient composition were temperature dependent. A primary concern for many studies of maternal effects is the lack of in-situ studies. Therefore, I reared Chinook salmon embryos in-situ and found that egg size had a linear, non-linear, or no effect on early life survival depending on the habitat characteristics of the nest. Based on the in-situ egg size - survival relationships, I showed how variation in egg size could increase or decrease offspring production in a population depending on the match between the population egg size distribution and the egg size selection regime using a simulation model. Overall, this work demonstrates the significant contribution maternal effects make to the expression and evolution of offspring phenotypes in salmon.

TI  - The Detection of Cervical Cancer Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) Biomarkers Using Metal Oxide-Polymer Nanocomposite Sensors
SP  - 166
AB  - Three film sensors prepared with Tin (iv) oxide (SnO2), carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and cellulose acetate (CA) composite and each containing different amounts of SnO2 powder were prepared for the detection of n-dodecane, 2-hexanone and 3- methylcyclopentanone biomarkers for cervical cancer at room temperature. Another four sensors made with, CNPs/CA, SnO2/CA, SnO2/CNPs and SnO2 composite was used as control and compared their performance with sensor based on SnO2/CNPs/CA towards wide range of 2-hexanone and 3-methylcyclopentanone vapour concentrations. Sensors based on CNPs/CA and SnO2/CNPs/CA selectively responded very well towards 3-methylcyclopentanone and 2-hexanone, respectively. The sensing mechanism, the in situ FTIR study revealed that both sensors undergo deep oxidation process during sensing. The effect of SnO2 concentration in the composites indicated that Sensor A highly selective towards 3-methylcyclopentanone and low selective towards to the two analytes. Sensor B and C, were selective towards 2-hexanone and n-dodecane, respectively and very low selectivity towards other two analytes. All the fabricated sensors were found to have their sensing ability regenerated after the analytes were removed from the system without losing the sensing and recovery abilities. The synthesised materials were characterised by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm.

TI  - Epigenetic Basis of Long-Term Responses to Environmental Stress
SP  - 91
AB  - Responses to environmental stimuli can persist over a wide range of timescales within the lifetime of the organisms and, in some cases, even across multiple generations. Since these responses can extend beyond the duration of the stimuli, but they are not as stable as genetic adaptation, they are likely mediated by various layers of epigenetic regulation. How epigene-environment interactions mediate lifelong and transgenerational persistence of induced responses has thus far been underexplored. Here we investigate it using complementary model systems of responses to novel stress in flies. In each of these models, the response is linked to a major epigenetic memory system, regulated, respectively, by the Polycomb (pc) and trithorax (trx) genes. The transgenerational model is based on larval exposure to artificial patterns of toxicity which has been shown to induce a Polycomb-mediated response. The life-long perturbation model, on the other hand, is based on environmental induction of haltere-to-wing homeotic transformation (the ‘Bithorax phenocopy’) that is triggered by brief exposure to ether vapor and persists throughout the life of the fly. Our work on the transgenerational model identified a new mechanism of epigenetic inheritance, which depends on polycomb genes. We found that exposure to G418 in the parental generation reduces the maternal deposition of pc transcripts in the oocyte and that this reduction contributes to transgenerational inheritance of ectopic expression (Stern and Snir et al., 2014). Analysis of the Bithorax phenocopy uncovered a mechanistic chain of events linking the stress of exposure to ether to a Trithorax-dependent reduction in tri-methylation of histone H3K4 shortly after the exposure. The resulting interference with the onset of the epigenetic memory, predisposes wing development genes for much later up-regulation in the haltere disc of the larvae. The emerging picture suggests an intriguing axis of influence: Environment → Stress/chaperone function → Epigenetic memory → Morphogenetic transformation. These findings implicate the major epigenetic memory systems of the fly, Polycomb and Trithorax in mediating environmental-induced changes, which persist over a range of timescales that can bridge part of the gap between physiology and evolution.

TI  - A Genomic Appraisal of the Stock Structure of South African Sardines, Sardinops sagax
SP  - 176
AB  - The southern hemisphere sardine Sardinops sagax is common in two of South Africa’s temperature-defined marine provinces (cool-temperate West Coast and warm-temperate South Coast), and during the KwaZulu-Natal sardine run, it is also represented on the subtropical East Coast. Non-genetic data suggest that the species may comprise at least two regional stocks that need to be managed separately, and it is possible that different environmental conditions among the provinces may have influenced population structure and driven adaptive divergence. However, genetic evidence for such spatial heterogeneity is lacking, and results from previous studies using traditional molecular methods remain inconclusive. As a result, a single-stock management strategy is presently being applied, which can potentially result in stock collapses as regional stocks become overexploited. To address this question, genome-wide DNA data were generated to determine whether there is evidence for genetic differentiation between sardines from the different bioregions. As a means of assessing the role of active adult dispersal in the sardines in reducing genetic differentiation between regions, genomic data were also generated from an endemic goby whose range is almost identical, but whose adults are sedentary. The majority of genomic markers were selectively neutral, and a pattern of isolation by geographic distance was found in both species. However, genetic clusters did not clearly match pre-defined marine bioregions. In contrast, outlier loci under thermal selection identified regional genetic clusters that could be linked to bioregions in both species, with stronger evidence for admixture in the high-dispersal sardines. These results reject the idea that the South African sardine stock is genetically homogeneous, and challenge present management practices.

TI  - Direct Selection on Lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster to Elucidate the Mechanisms of Longevity
SP  - 698
AB  - Artificial selection can be used to create model organisms tailored for a specific research question. Selection experiments using Drosophila have been a prominent aspect of ageing research over the last 40 years, being used to elucidate the evolutionary roots of ageing, as well as the mechanisms and corollaries by which lifespan extension is achieved in semi-natural populations. With the advent of modern sequencing, and other -omics, technologies, selection experiments offer an exciting opportunity to investigate the molecular and genetic mechanisms of longevity. We selected directly on lifespan in a recently wild-caught population of Drosophila melanogaster, achieving a median lifespan extension effect of 30% and a delay in the onset of ageing of 68% after 5 generations of selection. Various life-history traits and stress responses were measured and one line from each the selected and control regimes were analysed using RNA-Seq. Changes in stress resistances were observed in the selected flies, with the long-lived lines showing an increase in starvation resistance and a decrease in heat stress resistance, both responses being consistent with previous selection experiments. Desiccation resistance was initially increased by selection, but this declined after 5 generations of selection, suggesting that it was not necessary for the long-lived phenotype. Likewise, and somewhat unexpectedly, oxidative stress resistance was not altered in the selected lines, and neither did levels of protein carbonylation change, suggesting that early life prevention of oxidative damage is not an indicator of lifespan. Differential expression analysis of the long-lived flies revealed enrichment of developmental and metabolic biological processes amongst the genes with the highest fold-change. These categories are commonly altered in long-lived expression profiles and suggest the longevity of the selected lines may be due to alterations in developmental pathways in accordance with the hyperfunction theory of ageing.

TI  - Innovation in Solar Thermal Chimney Power Plants
AB  - This thesis analyses novel technology for renewable electricity generation: the solar thermal chimney (STC) power plant and the suspended chimney (SC) as a plant component. The STC consists of a solar collector, a tall chimney located at the centre of the collector, and turbines and generators at the base of the chimney. Air heated in the collector rises up the chimney under buoyancy and generates power in the turbines. STCs have the potential to generate large amounts of power, but research is required to improve their economic viability. A state-of-the-art STC model was developed, focussing on accurate simulation of collector thermodynamics, and providing data on flow characteristics and plant performance. It was used to explore power generation for matched component dimensions, where for given chimney heights, a range of chimney and collector radii were investigated. Matched dimensions are driven by the collector thermal components approaching thermal equilibrium. This analysis was complemented with a simple cost model to identify the most cost-effective STC configurations. The collector canopy is an exceptionally large structure. Many of the designs proposed in the literature are either complex to manufacture or limit performance. This thesis presents and analyses a series of novel canopy profiles which are easier to manufacture and can be incorporated with little loss in performance. STC chimneys are exceptionally tall slender structures and supporting their self-weight is difficult. This thesis proposes to re-design the chimney as a fabric structure, held aloft with lighter-than-air gas. The performance of initial, small scale suspended chimney prototypes under lateral loading was investigated experimentally to assess the response to wind loads. A novel method of stiffening is proposed and design of larger prototypes developed. The economic viability of a commercial-scale suspended chimney was investigated, yielding cost reductions compared to conventional chimney designs.

TI  - The Potential for Biological Control of the Invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle with Native North American Parasitoids
SP  - 182
AB  - The invasive Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), is a destructive xylophagous forest pest species originating from Asia. First discovered in New York in 1996, breeding populations have since spread to several U.S. states, and are also found in Canada and Europe. Currently, control of ALB is focused on its eradication; however, the rapid detection and removal of infested host trees is complicated by the cryptic nature of the wood boring larvae. Moreover, the removal and treatment of both infested and at-risk trees has led to tremendous ecological and economic impacts in infested regions. More sustainable options for the management of invasive ALB populations are greatly needed; therefore, my dissertation research focused on exploration for mortality factors of ALB in its endemic China as well as the potential for a new-association biological control approach using native North American parasitoids. Mortality factors affecting ALB eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults infesting Populus and Salix were investigated in several Chinese provinces. Results revealed that ALB density and mortality caused by various abiotic and biotic factors varied between host tree species as well as among different years and regions in China. Overall ALB density was the highest in Jilin province, and in Gansu province nearly four times the density of live larvae and pupae were found infesting Populus compared to Salix. In a survey across all provinces, ALB eggs were the life stage that was most susceptible to mortality factors, with the majority of eggs dying from undetermined factors, followed by parasitoids, and lastly from being removed by woodpeckers or other unknown predators. Larval and pupal stages were least susceptible to mortality factors throughout China, and the majority of those that died were either removed by woodpeckers or taken by unknown predators. We recovered the parasitoids Dastarcus helophoroides (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) and Scleroderma guani Xiao et Wu (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) from a small number of larvae and pupae in Gansu province and Beijing City. While foreign exploration has not resulted in the discovery of any host-specific co-evolved biocontrol agents, exploration for native North American natural enemies has revealed several native parasitoid taxa that can form new associations with ALB under laboratory conditions. One of the native parasitoid species, Ontsira mellipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has been continually reared on ALB larvae at the United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Beneficial Insects Introduction Research Unit (USDA-ARS BIIRU) since 2010, and may be useful as a new-association biocontrol agent against ALB. Currently, little is known about this North American parasitoid species; therefore, several laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate its life history, thermal tolerances, host preference, and potential to adapt to ALB through continuous laboratory rearing.Life history studies indicated that adult O. mellipes parasitized approximately 21% of beetle larvae presented to them throughout their life, and that host paralysis occurred 1 – 2 d after oviposition. Adult female parasitoids produced around 26 offspring throughout their lifetime. Females that were provided access to a host, honey, and water survived 9 d longer, on average, then females denied access to these resources. Egg to adult development was completed in around 3 wk, during which larvae developed through five instars before pupating and emerging as adults. Thermal studies were carried out to determine the effect of temperature on immature development, phenology, and adult reproduction and survival. Development time from egg to pupa significantly decreased from 26.7 to 6.1 d as temperature increased from 10 to 30°C, and no pupae eclosed as adults at 10°C. Furthermore, increasing temperature from 15 to 30°C significantly decreased pupa to adult emergence from 39.7 to 12.2 d. Based on the linear regression equations obtained from immature development stages, we estimate a single generation of O. mellipes requires 342.9 degree days accumulated above a lower development threshold temperature of 11.1°C. Results of the lower developmental threshold and degree-day requirements for O. mellipes obtained from linear regression models were then combined with temperature data from ALB infested areas in the U.S. to estimate the phenology of this parasitoid. This reveled that nearly 1.2 to 3.7 generations per year may occur in ALB infested areas. Adults parasitoids attacked (parasitized) host larvae across all the tested temperatures; however, parasitism reached a maximum at 25°C. Additionally, increasing temperatures significantly reduced the pre-oviposition period and longevity of female O. mellipes. Host preference studies using ALB-reared parasitoids revealed that the most abundantly and frequently collected native cerambycid naturally infesting red maple trees, Neoclytus acuminatus ssp. acuminatus, is most likely not a host of O. mellipes as no larvae were parasitized during no-choice testing, while 70.4% of ALB larvae were parasitized. Laboratory adaptation experiments revealed that host attack rates (% parasitism) increased from 46.9% to 65.7% between the F1-2 to F68-71 generations of parasitoids reared on ALB, indicating a marginally significant increase in host attack rates by later generation parasitoids (F41-43, F68-71). Additionally, later generation parasitoids produced significantly more progeny, on average, than did early generation females (F1-2).The overall results of the laboratory studies indicate that the artificial selection process acting through current laboratory rearing conditions has enhanced this candidate biocontrol agent’s ability to attack and reproduce on ALB, and further demonstrates the potential of using O. mellipes as a new-association agent of the invasive ALB. While investigations in China did not reveal any co-evolved and host specific naturally enemies, we suggest that future investigation should examine the causal agents of mortality in the field that is currently categorized as undetermined.

It describes the current situation of the organization, product planning, process planning, work planning, as well as operational management and improvement proposals. The first chapters describe the organizational and operational characteristics, and describe the structural and location characteristics of the plant, as well as its distribution at the infrastructure level. Based on this information, an exhaustive analysis was developed and with technical support, it proposes proposals for improvement in performance, cost reduction and efficiency, aimed at generating additional profits that satisfy the expectations of shareholders and the regional market, which would provide a profit of 30 to 50% of the final investment. All this focuses on the proposal of a new distribution of plant, new organization chart that raises the area of investment and project, flow of processes of activities that optimize the processes and increase the productivity of the same. Likewise, planning is proposed with assertive strategies that improve the productivity of human capital, which is transmitted in efficiency and effectiveness of results. On the other hand, it is proposed to improve preventive maintenance policies to reduce corrective costs, which would generate a reduction of 40 to 50%, with an increase in assets of 3 million 360 thousand. Finally, it is proposed to explore and exploit new, renewable energy alternatives. The implementation of new policies with assertive strategies using specialized and motivated human resources in an efficient manner can generate greater profits for the company, job satisfaction and quality of service to customers, which allows the development of new energy projects as the demand for energy increases electricity in conjunction with the urban development that has been increasing in recent years, it is worth mentioning that the effects of global warming are altering the water flow of the main sources of water in the Peruvian Andes, which motivates to think about exploring new Projects. To conclude, the generation of clean energies reduces the risks of environmental impacts that must go hand in hand with a culture of environmental responsibility, the improvement of rules and rules of the game regarding the use, generation and distribution of electrical energy and in this way guarantee the availability of the service for future generations at affordable costs.

TI  - Heat recovery and conversion technologies with organic fluid cycles : optimal working fluid and system design
AB  - Heat recovery and conversion technologies have become increasingly important for a variety of reasons relating to growing global concerns on energy security, rising electricity costs, CO2 emissions and global warming. Although many energy intensive industries could benefit significantly from the integration of these technologies, the current adoption rate is limited due to the high investment costs involved and the difficulty of prospective investors and end-users to recognise and, ultimately, realise the potential energy savings from such deployment. Thus, the wider adoption of these technologies can be facilitated by improved performance and reduced investment costs. In this context, integrated thermoeconomic optimisation of such power systems through the optimal design of working fluids and operating parameters is invaluable in improving economic viability. The performance of single-component working fluids is limited by the large exergy destruction associated with evaporation and condensation. Thus, working-fluid mixtures promise reduced exergy losses due to their non-isothermal phase-change behaviour, and improved cycle efficiencies and power outputs over their constituent pure fluids. The optimisation of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems revealed that mixtures do indeed show a thermodynamic improvement (in terms of the system power output and efficiency) over the pure-fluids. Although systems with fluid mixtures could see up to a 30% increase in power output over those with pure ones, they require larger expansion devices and heat exchangers (evaporators and condensers) due to their deterioration in heat transfer during the phase-change processes; thus, the resulting ORC systems are also associated with higher costs. Hence, ORC systems with pure working fluids have lower plant costs per unit power output, up to 14% lower than those with mixtures, highlighting the importance of considering system cost minimisation in designing ORC plants. The Up-THERM heat converter is a two-phase unsteady heat engine; it contains fewer moving parts than conventional ones and represents an attractive alternative for remote or off-grid power generation. With the aid of a validated first-order lumped dynamic model, its performance with respect to working-fluid selection for its prospective applications is investigated. With the engine's power output and efficiency being conflicting objectives, fluids with low critical temperatures (and high critical pressures, reduced pressures and temperatures) resulted in designs with high power outputs and correspondingly low efficiencies. For a nominal Up-THERM design corresponding to a target application with a heat-source temperature of 360 °C, R113 was identified as the optimal fluid, followed by i-hexane in maximising the power output. The Up-THERM heat converter was also seen to be effective over a range of heat-source temperatures delivering in excess of 10 kW (about four times higher than with water as working fluid in the nominal design) when utilising thermal energy at temperatures above 200 °C. Of all the working fluids considered, ammonia, R245ca, R32, propene and butane feature prominently as optimal and versatile fluids on the developed optimal working-fluid selection maps, delivering high power over a wide range of heat-source temperatures. To facilitate simultaneous optimal working fluid and process design of waste-heat recovery systems, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) optimisation framework for the computer aided molecular and process design of heat engines was developed. The components of the framework, consisting of thermodynamic process models, heat-exchanger sizing models, component cost correlations, economic evaluation models, transport property group-contribution correlations and the SAFT-γ Mie group-contribution equation of state are individually and collectively validated to acceptable degrees of accuracy against experimental and available commercial data. Following validation, the framework is used to identify optimal working-fluids for ORC systems with three different industrial waste-heat sources (150, 250 and 350 °C), with different objective functions. Although slightly related, maximising the power output and minimising the specific investment costs (SIC) are not equivalent objectives. From NLP optimisations, n-propane, 2-pentene and 2-hexene were the optimal working fluids when maximising power output, while n-propane, 2-butane and 2-heptene were optimal when SIC is minimised. With MINLP optimisations minimising the SIC, 1,3-butadiene and 4-methyl-2-pentene were the best performing working fluids for the 150 °C and 250 °C heat sources respectively; these novel working fluids do not belong to the common hydrocarbon families assessed in the NLP optimisations. Similarly, with multi-objective cost-power optimisation, the same molecules are identified, striking a delicate balance between investment costs and system performance. Ultimately, the results demonstrate the potential of this framework to drive the search for the next generation of organic Rankine cycle and waste-heat recovery systems, and to provide meaningful insights into identifying the working fluids that represent the optimal choices for targeted applications.

TI  - A GIS based approach to investigating the potential of herbaceous bioenergy feedstocks for cellulosic bioethanol production in Nigeria
AB  - Cellulosic ethanol provides a global alternative transport fuel to substitute conventional fossil fuels. The Nigerian Biofuel Policy in 2005 mandated the production and blending of gasoline with 10% bioethanol. Although, there have been indications that Nigeria has sufficient land available for 1st generation biofuel production, there is an urgent need to achieve food security for an increasing population. To these effects, this study aimed to investigate the land requirement and production potential of purposely grown herbaceous energy crops for 2nd generation cellulosic ethanol production in the six geo-political zones and states of Nigeria to meet the government Biofuel Policy. In this study, ArcGIS software was first used to identify two target land use classes (grassland and shrubland) with the potential for cellulosic ethanol production. The two land use classes were evaluated both on a regional and state basis. The study further employed a GIS-based multi-criteria decision method to determine land suitability for four herbaceous bioenergy crop species (Alfalfa, Elephant grass, Miscanthus x giganteus and Switchgrass). Suitability analysis was conducted using literature-based criteria weights for temperature, rainfall, soil organic matter, soil pH, slope and elevation by zone and state. The study further integrated Python software with ArcGIS to evaluate biomass productivity of the 4 species, where the NE zone was found to record the overall highest potential across the country, the SW was the highest in the South while SE zone generally possessed the least potential for all species. Estimates of productivity by state showed that Borno is the most potential productive state in the North and Oyo in the South. Lagos, which is largely comprised of built up areas, is the state with the least potential. In terms of crop productivity, elephant grass showed highest production potential followed by Miscanthus x giganteus and switchgrass while the C3 species (Alfalfa) has the least potential. The theoretical ethanol yield based on cellulose content of each bioenergy crop showed that at a national level, elephant grass has the greatest potential of the four species at 338 billion litres production per annum, which can power 735 large-scale cellulosic ethanol processing facilities. Generally, the study demonstrated that Nigeria will require the construction of multiple process facilities in order to be able to sustainably use the potential feedstocks available. Furthermore, the study showed that Nigeria has the potential to produce about 66 billion litres of cellulosic bioethanol per annum from the range of feedstocks evaluated. It is to this effect that the study indicated that Nigeria could potentially exceed the proposed 10% biofuel target of about 2 billion litres per annum using purposely grown herbaceous energy crops for cellulosic ethanol production.

TI  - Acclimatisation and adaptive capacity of echinoderms in response to ocean acidification and warming
SP  - 284
AB  - Based on literature indicating that echinoderms are tolerant to moderate increases in temperature and seawater pCO2, this study hypothesises three outcomes of long-term exposure to combined ocean acidification and warming: 1. Echinoderms possess the genetic capacity to adapt over long time-scales to predicted levels of combined ocean acidification and warming. 2. Echinoderms possess the physiological capability to acclimatize to ocean acidification and warming over long time-scales without a significant cost to metabolic energy budget. 3. After long-term exposure to ocean acidification and warming, echinoderm parents would alter the phenotype (Anticipatory Parental Effect) of their offspring to increase fitness in the F1 generation in response to the environment to which the parents were exposed. Broadcast-spawning echinoderms from the phylum Echinodermata (Fellaster zelandiae; Arachnoides placenta; Acanthaster spp.; Patiriella regularis; Odontaster validus) are used to investigate these hypotheses. Adaptive capacity was investigated using a quantitative genetic approach to examine the response in gastrula-stage offspring of multiple half-sib families raised in fully crossed treatment combinations of temperature (ambient, +2.0, +4.0 C) and pCO2 (ambient; 2x; 3x ambient ppm). Contributions of both genetic and environmental factors to the trait normal development at gastrulation were examined for wild populations of all five echinoderm species. Complex interactions between sire (father) and dam (mother) identity and environmental factors were detected for most species, and the individual response to warming of between +2.5 - +3.0 C and concurrent acidification equivalent to -0.4 pH units depended on phylogeny, genetic identity and environmental exposure history. For all species except O. validus, significant [sire x environment] interactions were found. The response of Acanthaster spp. as well as that of both clypeasteroids (A. placenta and F. zelandiae) to ocean acidification depends on both maternal and paternal lineage, and differences in resilience among genotypes will affect future population response. Maternal lineage (dam identity) was an important factor in every species. For O. validus, the only genetic sources of variation among genotypes came from dam identity and [dam x environment] interactions. The hypothesis that marine populations possess the capacity to adapt to future ocean warming and acidification is therefore supported. Physiological acclimation was investigated in two sea star species: P. regularis and O. validus. Adults were acclimated to combinations of elevated temperature and low pH for 12 months, during which time physiological indices of gonad and pyloric cecum growth rate, righting time and tissue inorganic content were measured every three months. At the same time respiration, energy absorption efficiency, and nitrogenous excretion rates were measured to estimate Scope for Growth (SfG) in all treatments. The hypothesis that adult echinoderms exposed to near-future climate-change conditions will be able to acclimate was supported for both species, however P. regularis may still be at risk of physiological distress over multiple generations as it maintains SfG by taking energetic investment away from gametes. Odontaster validus may be one of the most thermally-tolerant polar species and therefore may be one of the winners of future climate change. Trans-generational plasticity was investigated in F1 offspring of the P. regularis and O. validus parents used in the long-term acclimation study. The hypothesis that echinoderm parents can alter the fitness of their offspring in response to their own thermal or CO2 environment is supported for O. validus but not P. regularis. This is the first study to combine long-term parent acclimatization to ocean acidification and warming with estimates of broad-sense heritability and trans-generational plasticity in the next generation, and can go some way towards answering questions about the effect of parent environment on non-genetic inheritance and evolutionary fitness. The result of this study have wider implications for predictive models of how Southern Ocean echinoderm species adapt to ocean acidification and warming, and supports the need to exercise caution when using models which predict the responses of temperate marine species from examining their related polar counterparts, or models which use parent environmental stability as a predictor of trans-generational responses to climate change.

TI  - Low temperature selective oxidation of methane using hydrogen peroxide and oxygen
AB  - The selective oxidation of methane, which is the primary component of natural gas, isone of the most important challenges in catalysis. While the search for catalysts capable of converting methane to higher value commodity chemicals and liquid fuels such as methanol has been ongoing for over a century, an industrially viable process has not yet been developed. Currently, large scale upgradation of natural gas proceeds indirectly employing high temperature conversion to syngas which is then processed to synthesise fuels and chemicals. Different catalysts are currently being studied for direct low temperature selective oxidation of methane to liquid oxygenates primarily methanol. One of the systems studied is based on gold-palladium supported nanoparticles using hydrogen peroxide. Though the catalyst was shown to be active, high wastage of hydrogen peroxide was observed along with low productivities. The work in this thesis shows the removal of support can be used to increase the activity and efficiency of the reaction. By tuning the amount of hydrogen peroxide, high productivities and selectivities were observed. Further optimisation of catalyst preparation and methane oxidation were also performed. A theoretical study based on density functional theory into interactions between metal particles, such as gold and palladium and substrates such as oxygen, hydrogen and water was also carried out to identify the active sites and reaction mechanism underway with hydrogen peroxide and these metal particles.

TI  - The Adaptive Evolution of Herbivory in Freshwater Systems
SP  - 296
AB  - Herbivory is thought to be nutritionally inefficient relative to carnivory and omnivory. But, herbivory evolved from carnivory in many lineages, suggesting that there are advantages to eating plants. To understand the adaptive significance of the transition from carnivory to herbivory, I proposed five hypotheses for the adaptive evolution of herbivory and reviewed the current freshwater literature to identify conditions where eating plants might be adaptive over eating animals. I tested three of these ideas (Suboptimal Habitat, Heterotroph Facilitation, and Lipid Allocation) using the herbivorous Sailfin Molly (Poecilia latipinna)and identified each as a potential mechanism for the evolution of herbivory. To understand the origins of herbivory in Sailfin Mollies, I reconstructed ancestral habitats and dietsacross a phylogeny of the genus Poeciliaand then used phylogenetically independent contrasts to identify patterns of diet evolution. I found that the degree of herbivory increases with increasing salinity affiliation, suggesting that in this genus, herbivory evolved as an adaptation for invading less productive saline habitats from freshwaters. This result is consistent with the Suboptimal Habitat hypothesis, which states that herbivory allows organisms to invade and persist in ‘suboptimal’ habitats. To understand how herbivory is maintained in extant populations, I raised juvenile Sailfin Mollies in mesocosms and enclosure cages placed in the Everglades to document that dietary autotrophic lipids play a role in early life history by supporting rapid growth (Lipid Allocation). However, dietary bacterial fatty acids promoted fish survival, consistent with the Heterotroph Facilitation hypothesis, which states that indirect detritivory supplements the herbivorous diet. Finally, I quantified periphyton quality/availability and consumer density across the Everglades landscape to examine the correlates of trophic dynamics in nature. Results revealed that herbivores can persist in diverse habitats and survive on varying resources when habitats are unfavorable, supporting the Suboptimal Habitat hypothesis.

TI  - Advances in Air Pollution Simulations for the United States: Ozone and Ultrafine Airborne Particulate Matter
SP  - 328
AB  - Air pollution throughout the United States has changed dramatically over the past 50 years in response to numerous initiatives to protect public health. The improved efficiency of motor vehicles and adoption of stricter emission policies on coal-fired power plants are two of the reasons concentrations of criteria air pollutants have decreased. Despite nationwide reductions in most pollutant emissions, many urban regions throughout the United States still exceed unhealthy levels of criteria air pollutants. The underlying causes of these exceedances are difficult to determine as they may be the result of unidentified sources, certain meteorological conditions or changes to ambient pollutant concentrations that may alter the formation of secondary pollutants. In order to develop plans that manage these air pollution episodes, accurate tools that are used to resolve the underlying sources and chemical pathways are required. This dissertation describes three studies that improve our understanding of the causes of modern air pollution problems and provide insights that are useful for the development of the next generation air pollution abatement strategies. The first study explores the effectiveness of historical ozone control strategies by updating the calculation of the Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) scale that predicts ozone production from volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Inputs to the MIR calculations were modernized from 1988 atmospheric conditions to 2010 conditions by accounting for changes in meteorology, emission rates, and background concentrations. The calculations show that the median MIR values across thirty nine cities in the United States decreased by approximately 20% due to the impact of emissions control programs on the atmospheric composition and updates in meteorological variables including temperature, humidity, and boundary layer height. Although the absolute MIR values decreased, the sorted MIR rank of each specific VOC did not change strongly compared to the original rankings calculated using 1988 conditions. These findings indicate that past decisions about ozone control strategies remain valid today and the MIR scale continues to provide relevant guidance for policy makers. The second study evaluates an updated version of the SAPRC chemical mechanism for the prediction of ambient ozone and peroxy-radical concentrations. The SAPRC16 mechanism represents more compounds explicitly and includes a new lumping scheme to improve toxics and SOA precursors compared to the previous SAPRC07 and SAPRC11 mechanisms. SAPRC16 was applied under ambient conditions in cities spanning the United States in order to determine if the improved performance observed during the simulation of smog chamber experiments translated to the real atmosphere. Concentrations of ozone, hydroxyl radical (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical were predicted with SAPRC16 and SAPRC11, and compared to measured values. It was generally observed that SAPRC16 predicts slightly lower ozone concentrations than SAPRC11 in NOx rich urban centers. Predictions from SAPRC11 are in better agreement with the measurements in the western United States; however, SAPRC16 outperforms SAPRC11 in some eastern and southern U.S. cities. Ozone concentrations predicted by SAPRC16 and SAPRC11 diverged more as emissions decreased suggesting that the two mechanisms will predict different outcomes from increasingly stringent future emissions control programs. A box model analysis showed that the SAPRC16 mechanism quenches ozone production earlier than SAPRC11 as NOx concentrations increase (yielding decreased VOC/NOx ratios). This could be caused by more detailed HO2+RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions in SAPRC16 that compete with the HO2+NO reaction. The predictions of OH and HO2 were also evaluated for the two mechanisms using measurements from the CalNex field study in Pasadena. SARPC11 and SAPRC 16 prediction of OH are similar and within EPA criteria for mean fractional error (<0.75). However, SAPRC16 largely under predicts HO2 leading to the conclusion that further analysis of the HO2+RO2 reactions and RO2 isomerization reactions is needed before the SAPRC16 chemical mechanism is widely adopted. The final study described in this dissertation investigates the predicted concentration of PM0.1 in thirty-nine urban regions throughout the U.S. during summer pollution events in 2010. PM0.1 is a subset of PM2.5 that has been measured to have high toxicity and has been found to be associated with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) mortality in recent epidemiological studies. Artificial source tags were used to track contributions to primary PM0.1 and PM2.5 from fifteen source categories. On-road gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, and food cooking significantly contributed to regional PM0.1 in all 39 cities. In addition, natural gas combustion made large contributions to PM0.1 concentrations due to the widespread use of this fuel for electricity generation, industrial applications, residential, and commercial use. However, the source composition of primary PM0.1 across many cities was notably different. Future epidemiological studies may be able to differentiate PM0.1 and PM2.5 health effects by contrasting cities with different ratios of PM0.1 / PM2.5.

TI  - Fish Growth, Temperature, and Life History: Applying Theory to Improve Fisheries Research and Management
SP  - 267
AB  - Ectotherm growth is inextricably linked to both temperature and other aspects of life history. In this dissertation, I leverage life history and bioenergetics theory to (1) justify and standardize the use of metrics that adequately describe the effect of temperature on ectotherm growth, and (2) develop and apply methods that leverage the links between ectotherm growth and life history to extract life history information from growth data. I focus on fishes as example ectotherms. Fish growth is driven by the amount of thermal energy accrued over time (i.e., the thermal integral). Accordingly, numerous studies have found strong linear relationships between fish growth and degree-days (DD), a thermal integral metric. Despite these findings, fish science lags behind other fields in the widespread adoption of DD, likely due to (1) a lack of theoretically-sound support for the observed linear relationships between fish growth and DD, and (2) insufficient justification for using DD derived from air temperatures in place of DD derived from water temperatures in fish science. Moreover, there is limited guidance for selecting the base temperature for growth (T0), an important parameter for calculating DD, among fishes and scenarios. In Chapter 2, I combine empirical data and simulation modeling to provide bioenergetic and limnological foundations for the linear relationship between fish growth and DD, and I show that air-based DD can serve as an accurate proxy for water-based DD for describing fish growth. In Chapter 3, I provide estimates of T0 for 82 fish species using approaches that are rooted in fish biology. Together, these analyses will help to justify and standardize the use of DD in fish science. Fish growth is also strongly correlated with other aspects of life history (e.g., maturity, mortality). Recent advances in life history theory have led to the development of biphasic growth models that allow for the estimation of age-at-maturity, reproductive investment, and other life history traits from growth data. However, these models can be difficult to fit in the absence of maturity data. In Chapter 4, I develop a statistical framework for fitting biphasic growth models using only length-at-age data. I show that this approach can provide accurate estimates of age-at-maturity and other life history traits, and I evaluate the performance of the method across various species and data quality scenarios. In Chapter 5, I use a similar approach to investigate shifts in life history traits in an ecologically and economically important fish stock (Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus) from 1941-2005. This growth-based approach allows for the estimation of life history traits deeper into the past than would have been possible using traditional approaches and provides a more holistic understanding of how red snapper life histories have shifted in the face of fishing pressure and other stressors. Taken together, this work has the potential to improve fisheries research, promote sustainable fisheries management, increase global food security, and encourage similar advances in other fields.

TI  - The Evolution of Termite Immunity
SP  - 118
AB  - Alongside sexual reproduction and multicellularity, eusociality is considered one of the major transitions in evolution (Szathmary and Smith 1995). Eusociality has evolved most often among the insects, particularly the Hymenoptera (the ants, bees and wasps) and termites. The hallmark of social evolution in insects is the appearance of permanently sterile castes, which is reflected by reproductive division of labour. A notable feature of insect societies is the emergence of sophisticated immune adaptations at the individual and group level to control the spread of disease. However, the evolution of termite immunity remains poorly understood. In particular, information regarding molecular evolution of the canonical immune pathways, and how innate and induced immunity were shaped by the evolution of a sterile caste system, remain major gaps in knowledge. A comparative approach in the study of the evolution of termite immunity requires robust knowledge of the immune system of the nearest non-social insect lineages: the cockroaches. To this end, the immunity of a cockroach, Blatta orientalis, was explored in Chapter I. Using de novo transcriptomes, a full repertoire of immune gene members was identified. Interestingly, expansions of immune gene families of receptors, including GNBP, PGRP and hemolymph LPS-binding protein (LPSBP) were identified. After immune challenging cockroaches with a mixture of heat-killed microbes (Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas entomophila, Saccharomyces cerevisiae), I was able to record a broad induced response in canonical immune pathways, pointing to the presence of effective and potentially long-lasting protection against infection, which is a key trait for organisms that thrive in a rich antigenic environment. In the first part of Chapter II, I examined the evolution of immunity in termites by first reconstructing a termite phylogeny with 19 newly sequenced transcriptomes and 16 available genomic datasets. As a result, we confirmed termites as the sister group to the Cryptocercus, a subsocial cockroach genus, and located their most recent common ancestor (MRCA) to the lower Jurassic. An evolutionary analysis of immune related gene families was then performed based on 18 of the newly sequenced transcriptomes. A family of antimicrobial peptide, Drosomycin, was found to be lost in the ancestor to the subsocial wood roaches and all termites. A further analysis of two other classic effectors, catalase and thioredoxin peroxidase, revealed a rapid contraction of related genes in the ancestor to all eusocial termite species. In addition, a family of receptors, C-type lectins (CTLs), showed contraction in the MRCA of Cryptocercus and termites as well as in the root of the Termitidae. In addition, these contracted gene families underwent a subsequent re-expansion in some individual higher termite lineages. These results suggest a substantial re-modelling of the termite immune system during the evolution of eusociality. This qualitative analysis focusing on major shifts in termite immunity was followed in the second part of Chapter II by a quantitative analysis of individual immunity across different castes of a representative lower termite, Neotermes castaneus. Gene expression changes were then compared with a subsocial wood roach, Cryptocercus meridianus, and the solitary cockroach, B. orientalis. Interestingly, I found evidence for higher investment into innate immunity in the reproductive termite caste as compared to sterile soldier caste members or false-workers. Furthermore, the induced immune response elicited in soldiers, but particularly in the reproductive caste mimicked the induced immune responses of C. meridianus and B. orientalis more closely than the response of false-workers. Additionally, the induced response to the same experimental immune challenge was remarkably similar between the subsocial C. meridianus and the solitary B. orientalis. From these results, I argue that the evolution of division of labor in termites was linked to the evolution of a fundamental change in individual immune defence between the sterile and non-sterile castes. In Chapter III, I expand on the role of the sterile caste in eusociality and immunity by examining the function of soldiers in social immunity in the Darwin termite, Mastotermes darwiniensis. In this chapter, M. darwiniensis soldiers are shown to contribute significantly to the social immunity of the colony by increasing the survival of groups of workers, probably via the secretion of potent orally-derived antimicrobial substances. In a comprehensive proteomic analysis, I demonstrate that M. darwiniensis soldier oral secretions possess a rich array of immune related proteins and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of cytotoxins such as benzoquinone. These findings shed new light on termite societies, indicating that termites are likely to have evolved a sterile soldier caste with important functions not only in colony defence but also in social immunity. In this thesis I reveal how the termite immune system evolved during the transition to eusociality. I have established a robust foundation for the study of molecular immunity in termites and contributed new insights into the evolution of immunity in social animals in general. As the contraction and re-expansion of receptors and effectors in termites indicates, the function of a number of immune gene families should be examined in much greater detail. Furthermore, it will be particularly interesting to explore the individual immune (as well as general) responses of termite in a wider social context, particularly given the observed immune differences that were detected between the termite castes. Comparisons with immune adaptations in the Hymenoptera and other social animals would also be highly beneficial to understand commonalities and differences during this key evolutionary transition.

TI  - Phenotypic, Genetic, and Transcriptomic Decoupling of Thermal Hardiness across Metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster
SP  - 258
AB  - Complex life cycles (CLCs), developmental programs in which life-history stages are distinct in morphology, behavior, and physiology, are common throughout the biosphere. However, it is still unclear why and how CLCs evolve. The adaptive decoupling hypothesis (ADH) postulates that CLCs evolve to decouple the developmental processes that underlie traits across ontogeny to allow for independent, stage-specific responses to selection. This ultimately could lead to alternate life-history stages adapting to unique environments, thus optimizing fitness across development. However, few empirical tests of the ADH are available. Detecting genetic and transcriptomic decoupling of thermal hardiness using robust techniques in a model system, D. melanogaster, was the goal of this dissertation. Furthermore, this work illustrates that different life-history stages have the potential to become adapted to unique ecological niches. I performed three primary studies to test the ADH: 1.) estimation of the genetic correlation for cold hardiness between larvae and adults using isogenic lines of D. melanogaster to determine if unique genetic architectures underlie variation in cold stress response using standard quantitative genetic and Genome-Wide Association (GWA) methods, 2.) testing whether developmental acclimation is genetically correlated across stages, and whether acclimation alters cross-stage correlations in cold hardiness, and 3.) analysis of the transcriptional responses of both larvae and adults to extreme cold to determine if stage-specific stress response mechanisms exist across development.

TI  - Heat Stress Response and Evolution of Thermal Tolerance in the Copepod Tigriopus californicus
SP  - 129
AB  - With the warming trend due to climate change, conservation of species requires knowledge in ecological and evolutionary aspects of thermal tolerance and adaptation. In this dissertation, I use tidepool copepod, Tigriopus californicus, as a model for studying both aspects of thermal tolerance. For ecological aspect, identifying the most sensitive life stage can help us predict future responses especially in marine organisms with complex life history. I examined different survivorship to acute heat stress among life stages and across populations of T. californicus. Results revealed early life stages of T. californicus survived acute heat stress at higher temperatures than adults in contrast to popular belief. However, heat stress during larval stage of T. californicus resulted in developmental delay. Survivorship in larval and juvenile stages across populations also conform with a pattern previously observed in adults with more heat tolerant populations toward southern range of the species. In order to uncover the evolutionary basis underlying thermal tolerant in T. californicus, I examined allele specific expression in F1 hybrid between populations from San Diego (SD) and Santa Cruz (SC). RNA sequencing revealed regulatory divergence in several gene ontology categories that potentially contribute to thermal tolerance including, electron carrier genes, genes involved in muscle and cuticle assembly, genes involved in proteolysis and Heat Shock Protein (HSP) genes. Heat Shock Protein Beta 1 (HSPB1) is one of the highest expressed HSPs in response to heat stress. HSPB1 Allelic imbalance suggested divergence in cis regulatory element underlying heat stress induced expression. HSPB1 promotor sequencing revealed polymorphisms in the Heat Shock Elements (HSEs), a binding site for Heat Shock Transcription Factor (HSF), where heat tolerant southern populations contain 2 canonical HSEs while northern populations have substitutions in the conserved motif of HSEs. Allele specific expression in more F1 crosses confirmed biased expression favoring alleles from populations with 2 canonical HSEs. Functional assays comparing recombinant SD and SC HSPB1 demonstrated that SD HSPB1 has a better capacity for preventing protein aggregation and preserving enzymatic function under high temperature. Overall, results from this dissertation provide insights on both ecological and evolutionary perspectives of thermal tolerance.

TI  - Evaluation of Effects Due to Land Restoration on Northern Bobwhite Demographics and Movements in North-Central Texas
SP  - 77
AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation leave ecosystems deficient of natural ecological functions thus reducing availability of food and cover for important socio-economic species life northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus ). Recovery plans for degraded grassland ecosystems recognize land restoration as an important strategy to combat habitat destruction and mitigate population declines in northern bobwhite. However, studies monitoring effects due to land restoration on demographics and movements of northern bobwhites are especially lacking. My objectives were to (1) examine the effects due to land restoration on northern bobwhite nest microhabitat, reproductive success and nest predation, (2) compare northern bobwhite movements and land use between treated and non-restored sites, (3) determine how breeding season survival differs between site types in the Rolling Plains of Texas. To understand the influences of land restoration, I radio-marked northern bobwhites, measured and compared ground composition at nests and diurnal locations, and compared weekly survival of individuals between treated and non-restored site types. In the 2 years, I radio-marked 182 northern bobwhites across treated and non-restored site types and located initiated 38 nests; 7 nests (n = 18) in treated, and 6 nests (n = 20) in non-restored were successful. Nests in treated sites had higher rates of reproductive parameters (clutch size, hatchability). Only 1 confirmed nest depredation event, captured by infrared game cameras, committed by coyotes occurred on a non-restored site. I failed to detect differences in nest vegetation between sites. Based on AICc candidate model selection, I identified temperature as the best predictor of daily nest survival across both site types. However, I found confidence intervals of estimates describing temperature to overlap zero indicating no reliable direction of effect on daily nest survival. I compared breeding season home ranges, determined by minimum convex polygons, but failed to detect differences between site types. Northern bobwhites in treated sites were in areas containing less vertical and horizontal vegetation structure but greater bear ground compared to northern bobwhites in non-restored sites. To examine the effects on breeding season survival, I used the Cormack-Jolly-Seber approach to compare weekly apparent survival rates. I used AICc and found the most parsimonious model influencing survival was [&phis;(t), p(t)]. Estimated seasonal survival in 2016 was 0.79 ± 0.04 for treated landscapes and 0.83 ± 0.06 for non-restored. Estimated seasonal survival in 2017 was for 0.86 ± 0.02 treated landscapes and 0.88 ± 0.02 for non-restored. Alternate abstract:La pérdida y la fragmentación del hábitat dejan a los ecosistemas deficientes en funciones ecológicas naturales, reduciendo así la disponibilidad de alimentos y la cobertura de importantes especies socioeconómicas, bovinos del norte (Colinus virginianus). Los planes de recuperación para los ecosistemas de pastizales degradados reconocen la restauración de la tierra como una estrategia importante para combatir la destrucción del hábitat y mitigar la disminución de la población en el norteño bobwhite. Sin embargo, los estudios que monitorean los efectos debidos a la restauración de la tierra sobre la demografía y los movimientos de las bobwhites del norte son especialmente deficientes. Mis objetivos eran (1) examinar los efectos de la restauración de la tierra en el microhábitat del nido bobwhite norte, éxito reproductivo y depredación de nidos, (2) comparar los movimientos de bobwhite norteños y el uso de la tierra entre sitios tratados y no restaurados, (3) determinar cómo la cría la supervivencia de la temporada difiere entre los tipos de sitios en los Rolling Plains de Texas. Para comprender las influencias de la restauración de la tierra, radiobordé bobwhites norteños, medí y comparé la composición del suelo en nidos y lugares diurnos, y comparé la supervivencia semanal de individuos entre tipos de sitios tratados y no restaurados. En los 2 años, marqué radioeléctricamente 182 bobwhites norteños a través de tipos de sitios tratados y no restaurados y localicé 38 nidos iniciados; 7 nidos (n = 18) en tratados, y 6 nidos (n = 20) en no restaurados fueron exitosos. Los nidos en los sitios tratados tuvieron mayores tasas de parámetros reproductivos (tamaño de nidada, incubabilidad). Solo 1 evento de depredación del nido confirmado, capturado por cámaras infrarrojas del juego, cometidas por coyotes ocurrió en un sitio no restaurado. No pude detectar diferencias en la vegetación de nidos entre los sitios. Con base en la selección del modelo candidato AICc, identifiqué la temperatura como el mejor predictor de la supervivencia diaria del nido en ambos tipos de sitios. Sin embargo, encontré que los intervalos de confianza de las estimaciones que describen la temperatura se superponen a cero indicando que no hay una dirección de efecto confiable en la supervivencia diaria del nido. Comparé los rangos de inicio de la temporada de cría, determinados por polígonos convexos mínimos, pero no detecté las diferencias entre los tipos de sitios. Las bobwhites norteñas en los sitios tratados estaban en áreas que contienen menos estructura de vegetación vertical y horizontal pero mayor terreno de oso en comparación con las bobwhites norteñas en sitios no restaurados. Para examinar los efectos en la supervivencia de la temporada de cría, utilicé el enfoque de Cormack-Jolly-Seber para comparar las tasas de supervivencia aparente semanales. Usé AICc y encontré que el modelo más parsimonioso que influía en la supervivencia era [φ (t), p (t)]. La supervivencia estacional estimada en 2016 fue de 0.79 ± 0.04 para los paisajes tratados y de 0.83 ± 0.06 para los no restaurados. La supervivencia estacional estimada en 2017 fue de 0.86 ± 0.02 paisajes tratados y 0.88 ± 0.02 para los no restaurados.

TI  - The impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect, tribolium castaneum
AB  - Climate change will increase the frequency, intensity and duration of weather extremes including heat-waves, which could have important consequences for biodiversity. This thesis examines the direct influences of thermal stress associated with heat-wave conditions on reproduction in a model insect in order to understand how animal populations might be affected by climate change. Fertility reductions in homeotherms due to thermal stress are well documented, but effects on ectotherms have received little attention. In the first half of this thesis, the flour beetle model Tribolium castaneum is used to measure the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproductive fitness in males and females, and the proximate mechanisms behind any impacts. I find that the reproductive fitness of males, but not females, is impacted by heat-wave conditions. Female fecundity is not affected when mating with heat stressed males, but egg hatch and pupal eclosion rates are reduced. Transgenerational effects were not found beyond the pupal stage. In experimental examinations of mating behaviour, males exposed to heat-wave conditions were slower to initiate mating and mated less frequently, but still achieving sufficient matings that would normally allow full female fertility. However, ejaculate sperm numbers were reduced more than five-fold following a simulated heat-wave, partly explaining how male reproductive fitness is halved following exposure to a heat-wave. In addition to an impact on male fertility and sperm production, I also found clear evidence that sperm in female storage were also sensitive to heat-wave conditions, with significant declines in female reproductive fitness if they had already mated and contained sperm, but no effects if the heat-wave was experienced before mating and sperm storage. This sensitivity of male fertility to heat-wave conditions could generate selection on both males and females to respond. In the second half of the project, the male and female responses to thermal stress and their impacts across generations were investigated. Females were found to be able to rescue their fertility when facing matings with heat stressed males by mating polyandrously, restoring their reproductive output to normal levels. However, I found no evidence that females strategically or facultatively adjusted their remating behaviour to compensate for reductions in fertility condition after thermal stress, and multi-generational male responses to elevated ambient temperature regimes showed no evidence for an ability to acclimate or adapt to heat-wave conditions. This thesis advances our knowledge of how one important trait for population viability and biodiversity can be impacted by climate change and increases in extreme weather conditions. It offers directions for future research to investigate the drivers of temperature-induced male fertility loss, and suggestions for how management efforts might be focused to mitigate the impacts of heat-wave conditions on reproduction in ectotherms.

TI  - Vulnérabilité des tanières du renard arctique aux aléas géologiques reliés aux changements climatiques
SP  - 83
AB  - Les changements climatiques augmentent les risques d’altérations sévères des habitats essentiels de nombreuses espèces animales, surtout dans l’Arctique. Le renard arctique (Vulpes lagopus) utilise des tanières comme refuges contre les grands froids et les prédateurs. Ces tanières, creusées dans la couche supérieure du pergélisol (couche active), sont essentielles pour l’élevage des jeunes et sont réutilisées d’une génération à l’autre. Nous avons testé l’hypothèse selon laquelle, en raison du réchauffement climatique, l’augmentation de la fréquence des aléas géologiques comme le tassement au dégel, les mouvements de masse et l’érosion thermique est une menace sérieuse à la stabilité de ces tanières. Sur l’Île Bylot (Nunavut, Canada), nous avons développé un indice de vulnérabilité qualitatif des tanières à ces aléas. Cet indice a été calculé à partir d’observations de terrain et de photos aériennes obliques. Parmi les 106 tanières étudiées, 14% ont été classées comme très vulnérables alors que 17% et 69% ont été classées comme modérément ou faiblement vulnérables, respectivement. La vulnérabilité n’était pas significativement reliée à la probabilité d’utilisation pour la reproduction. Les changements climatiques affectent donc les tanières de renards arctiques, mais sans qu’ils soient un risque majeur pour l’espèce à notre site d’étude. Notre recherche est la première à donner un aperçu de l’impact des aléas géologiques reliés aux changements climatiques sur l’écologie du renard arctique. La méthode proposée est flexible et pourrait être appliquée, dans un cadre de conservation ou de recherche fondamentale, à d’autres sites ou d’autres espèces qui dépendent directement du pergélisol durant leur cycle vital. Alternate abstract:Climate change increases the risk of severe alterations to essential habitats for wildlife species, especially in the Arctic. The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) uses dens as shelters against cold temperatures and predators. These dens, which are needed for successful reproduction, are dug in the top layer of permafrost (active layer) and reused across multiple generations. We tested the hypothesis that due to climate change, the increasing frequency of geohazards like thaw settlement, mass movements, and thermal erosion is a serious threat for the long-term stability of Arctic fox dens. On Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), we developed a qualitative vulnerability index to geohazards for Arctic fox dens. The index was calculated from field observations and oblique aerial photographs. Of the 106 dens studied, 14% were classified as highly vulnerable while 17% and 69% had a moderate and low vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability was not significantly related to the probability of use for reproduction. While climate change will impact Arctic fox reproductive structures, we conclude that this is not a major threat to the species in our study area. Our research is the first to provide insights into the climate-related geohazards potentially affecting Arctic fox ecology. The developed method is flexible and could be applied, for conservation or basic research, to other study sites or other species depending directly on permafrost for part of their life cycle.

TI  - Coronavirus Evolution and Immune Evasion
SP  - 86
AB  - Coronaviruses are emerging pathogens that threaten human health and prosperity. Each year, hundreds of millions of people are infected with continually circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold in healthy individuals and kill the most vulnerable of us. Coronaviruses adapt to environmental change at a remarkable rate. The HCoV-229E coronavirus has adapted and evolved over the last 50 years by mutating residues in the receptor-binding loops of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike (S) protein. These sequences phylogenetically segregate into Classes whose viruses have successively replaced one another in the human population. These Classes possess different receptor (hAPN) and antibody binding characteristics and the crystal structures of RBD-hAPN complexes have been solved. Structural insights into the ever-changing RBD and its interaction with hAPN show the use of secondary structure-less loops facilitate tremendous structural variability, a trait that likely enables changes in viral fitness and immune evasion.

TI  - Nitrogen Loading, Climate Change, Pathogens: Impacts of Multiple Stressors on Rhode Island Shellfish
SP  - 186
AB  - Filter feeding bivalves, such as the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis are valued for their role in the marine nitrogen cycle; specifically, their ability to facilitate the process of denitrification (reduction of nitrate to an inert N2 gas), and thereby the removal of reactive nitrogen from the system. Historically, these organisms have been victim of overharvesting along much of the east coast, however Rhode Island has undergone a vast expansion of oyster production through the development of a prosperous aquaculture industry within the state, potentially contributing to the restoration of this valuable ecosystem service. However, the success of all of Rhode Island oyster populations are threatened by anthropogenic stressors, such as warming waters and increased nitrogen loads into coastal habitats, which many interrupt and/or alter the rates at which C. virginica and M. edulis are able to perform the process of nitrogen removal. Of particular concern is incomplete processes of denitrification that may lead to an accumulation of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas with global warming potential nearly 300 times more powerful than that of carbon dioxide. Warming waters are also known to favor common oyster pathogens such as Haplosporidium nelsoni, H. costale and Perkinsus marinus . The combination of high temperature and nitrogen loads is likely to cause physiological stress to these organisms, leading to increased susceptibility of the organisms to pathogens and, therefore, further impacting the environmental benefits provided by bivalves. The goal of this study was to investigate how the combination of current and projected temperatures and nitrogen loads may impact the health status, rates of nitrogen removal, and rates of N2O production of C. virginica and M. edulis. This was accomplished through separate studies conducted on C. virginica and M. edulis. Two types of experiments were performed with C. virginica: Experiment 1, which was a controlled, laboratory-based study, in which organisms were maintained in a gradient of ammonium nitrate levels, crossed by contrasting temperatures Upon completion, prevalence of three common oyster pathogens listed above was determined in a subsample of oysters from each treatment. A similar mesocosms experiment was performed with blue mussels with slightly different experimental conditions, selected based on biological and ecological differences between oysters and mussels. With the realization that C. virginica tolerates much more variation in environmental conditions within their habitat than just temperature and nitrogen, Experiment 2 was performed, and consisted of two, 3-month field manipulations in which oysters where maintained in contrasting ends of the estuarine gradient of Point Judith Pond, in Narragansett, RI were performed. At each location, organisms were deployed in experimental setups and left at either ambient or enriched conditions. Oyster growth and mortality and water quality measurements were made at selected time points over the 3 month period and, upon completion, experimental organisms were brought back to the laboratory for a single incubation at ambient conditions in Year 1, and at contrasting temperatures and high nutrient levels in Year 2. The goal was to reveal how previous exposure of oysters in the field to different environmental factors may have impacted the rates of gas production under high temperature and nitrogen loading. In 2017, a random subset of experimental organisms were sacrificed and analyzed for the prevalence of common oyster pathogens. The major hypotheses for this study included: (1) Temperature will initially increase rates of denitrification of both C. virginica and M. edulis. (2) Increased nitrogen loads will increase rates of denitrification and nitrous oxide production of both C. virginica and M. edulis; (3) The combination of warming and high nitrogen levels over long terms will compromise the health of the organism, causing physiological stress for both C. virginica and M. edulis, and higher nitrous oxide accumulation (possibly via incomplete denitrification). Several major conclusions emerged from this study. Based on both mesocosms and field experiments, temperature appeared to be an initial driver of denitrification for C. virginica, however long-term exposure may act as a stressor, possibly inhibiting the process, indicated by the greater level of mortality within warmer laboratory treatments, over time, and general lack of enhanced rates in association with temperature for both experiments. Additionally, increased temperature may lead to increased N2O production, indicated by the field study. The combination of nitrogen loading and warming appears to promote N2 consumption, as opposed to denitrification, as well as increased N2O production of C. virginica over time.

TI  - Transport and Tunneling Investigation of Strongly Correlated Superconducting and Magnetic Thin Films
SP  - 142
AB  - Complex physical phenomena, such as superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) effect, multi-ferroics, metal-insulator transition, quantum phase transition, etc. in strongly correlated materials have been enduring topics in condensed matter physics. The overarching theme of this dissertation is the study of transport and electronic states in emergent phases with distinct magnetic and electronic properties in strongly correlated materials in thin film forms. At first, we have investigated anisotropic electronic phase separation (EPS) of optimally doped La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films under various degrees of anisotropic strain by static magnetotransport and dynamic relaxation measurements. Distinct from the prototype perovskite manganite LPCMO with well-known micrometer scale EPS, the bulk optimally doped LCMO does not exhibit the large-scale EPS near a transition from paramagnetic insulating phase (PMI) to ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) phase at a high temperature. Through epitaxial growth of LCMO thin films on NGO (001) substrates and post-growth annealing, an antiferromagnetic insulating phase is induced in the FMM ground state and results in a large-scale EPS of coexisting AFI and FMM phases below the bulk metal insulator transition (MIT). Substantial resistivity anisotropies along the two orthogonal in-plane directions in the EPS region were experimentally probed by static temperature and magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. More strikingly, with increasing annealing time, resistivity along the tensile-strained [010] direction becomes progressively larger than that along the compressive-strained [100] direction in the EPS region. The enhanced resistivity anisotropy suggests that the EPS is characterized by phase-separated FMM entities with a preferred orientation along [100] direction, possibly due to the deformation and rotation of the MnO6 octahedra under the enhanced anisotropic strain via the post-growth annealing. Furthermore, the EPS was found to exhibit glass-like behavior. The resistivity measured at fixed temperatures relaxes logarithmically over a long period of time. The relaxation behavior also shows a coherent enhancement with increasing annealing time. By fitting the relaxation data to a phenomenological model, the fitted parameters, resistive viscosity and characteristic relaxation time were found to evolve with temperature, showing a close correlation with the static measurements in the EPS states. In another project, we have investigated the superconductor-insulator quantum phase transitions tuned by disorder (d), magnetic impurity (MI) and magnetic field (B) in ultrathin Pb films by electrical transport measurement and single electron tunneling spectroscopy. In the past decade, the investigation of SITs in homogeneous thin films by transport measurement from our group has provided valuable insights to the mechanisms of SITs. There are two main theoretical models to explain SITs. The first one emphasizes that a transition from a superconducting state to a fermionic insulator without the existence of the superconducting order parameter, the formation of Cooper pairs is completely suppressed at the transition. The other one calls for a bosonic insulator with localized Cooper pairs. d-tuned and MI-tuned SITs well fit the fermionic framework, and both share common transport features, such as a sharp resistive transition to the superconducting state, a well-defined phase boundary, and a weakly insulating state near the phase boundary. While B-tuned SITs are a canonical example of the bosonic model. The resistive transition to the superconducting state is broadened by an application of magnetic field. Rather than a clear phase boundary near the transition, emerged resistive reentrance and double reentrance indicate phase fluctuation of the superconducting parameter is the main driving force for the transition, suggesting the survival of Cooper pairs in the insulating phase. Electron tunneling spectroscopy has been proposed to directly probe the existence and evolution of the superconductivity in these SITs. For B-tuned SITs, the existence of Cooper pairs is supposed to be detected even in the global insulating phase of thin films. More importantly, the approach also allows us to compare the evolutions of the normal state density of state among these SITs, particularly for d-tuned and MI -tuned SITs. Transport results show that MI has little influence on the normal state sheet resistance near the transition, while increasing disorder gradually raises the normal state sheet resistance. These observations suggest that the normal state density of states behaves differently in the two transitions. The experimental setup is a dilution refrigerator incorporated with in situ quench condensation, electrical measurement, and sample rotation, enabling us to achieve and tune SITs in the same sample by different parameters, and systematically check and compare the evolution of the density of states in the SITs. Up to now, we have performed transport and tunneling measurements for d-tuned SITs in homogeneous Pb films in a 4He quench probe and the modified dilution refrigerator. The transport results are consistent with previous experiments from our group.
